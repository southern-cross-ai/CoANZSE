    "text": "I 'd like the consultation document for the LTP we have to put out a consultation document to get feedback from people so all that stuff that happens before that is recorded and people have views about what should be in the financial strategy or whatever but we still have to put out a document as a statutory process for people to be able to give feedback so I just really want to make aware of that because if we don 't do that you know it will put us in a very difficult situation in terms of time frames and and actually what could possibly call into question you know the the council in terms of its governance so think very carefully about how we vote today because it is actually very important that we have to do this by the one we have to get something out cool yeah it 's a very answering interesting concept yeah and you 're quite right we do have an obligation but I slightly a long term plan that we put out and it didn 't stop some cancers putting out an we vote the way we feel and if we don 't like something we should have the right to issue voting incident regardless yeah look look I actually don 't think that was incredibly helpful I think that what would be helpful for people to understand that there is a legal process happening here that is not of our making the legal requirement is for us to do this there is no provision and the and the there is no provision that would enable us to continue with our existing arrangements largely because of the size of the bank 's financial award compared to the other wards and that cannot be allowed to continue so I do regret if Jamie hadn 't interject it and we 've just taken this as a single resolution then this wouldn 't have happened but I 'm going to put the motion and as a whole and those that are unable to support their colleagues and putting out an initial proposal with an open mind to hear submissions from everyone on these matters well then that 's fine but met Amir I 'm sorry there are better patient isn 't unfair I virile items of I 've already ruled aureus matter the ruling by those it gives me reason we actually had this debate we completely had this debate and we made it crystal clear to everyone last time that that was the debate that all we would be doing would be voting for this or opposing this resolution and I meant just inviting people that oppose the the resolution initially to actually think about this as an initial proposal and to consider supporting it because you 've had all the arguments about why you don 't agree with it all of those will be put up by people if they agree with the position that you 've adopted and there is always room to change this when it comes to the final decision this is not the final decision that 's just adopt doing an initial proposal so i will put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no right so we 'll have a vote that 's carried thank you very much and so now thank you 've gone to I know that this is a challenging process the next item is the housing management board chair persons report as this does this have to be dealt with today okay good it 's an information only would someone like to move it Jamie Paul any discussion yep page 253 financial success of the chippers reliant on the middle of the IRS etc etc originally what was that amount and now what is it estimated to be originally if it was estimated to be on all in a tenant 's but that was changed in December last year so from December last year it hasn 't really changed except I think it was some well it was somewhere over north of 10 and but obviously as soon as existing tenants which nobody else has access to IRS on either came out of that when Paula Bennett wrote that letter then it dropped their the predictions from Deloitte 's are now incredibly conservative in the first year I don 't have them in front of me about that there they only start no they they 're about half a six months because obviously the longer we take to get there and then they and then they only have them increasing and their financials by I think five percent per annum which is incredibly conservative yeah but nonetheless it makes the chip financially sustainable very even wasn 't over to be exhibiting and Jim if I can on page 254 2.6 g the financials provided by Deloitte is potentially financially viable potentially what 's that based on well because their financials are incredibly funny are incredibly conservative so they 've got something like our own staff estimate is that we have we turn over the entire tendencies and about every 10 to 12 years they 've worked it on about 20 year time frame so all of their can all of their numbers are incredibly conservative all right thank you but it does actually wash its face no problem so all right so i 'll put that the two pointers three Napoleon point in a meter in a police ability for partner to a CD from the the community housing provider whether this community housing provide a new one is do the view of the housing management board was that it was best to look at all the risks while there weren 't any so it 's looked at what happens if the chip doesn 't need to be there if the IRS is no longer there there 's a change of government all sorts of things could happen and those are real things and politics and a number of things at partner make such what would happen to the council 's resource resources to resources one their housing that we lease clearly that it stays in the council 's ownership the second is any land or other assets that we put in there and that 's why the suggestion is by that the vast majority of that is by way of loan rather than direct a gift so that if the chip winds up and it 's important to take all these things into account if the chip winds up then the council gets first call on those assets so that the council 's assets are protected or a lot of the way okay thank you all right i those opposed we know that 's carry the bents vests of all _"

    "text": "very good okay I 'm just to note that the development contributions rebate policy pay paper number duty as being deferred until the next meeting the attachments for the report went circulated in time so that will be held over until until the next meeting regulations and consensus are going to take very long can you move your amendment quickly have you given up to staff okay it 's the my own Committee 's recommendation this basically stemmed from an objection to elected members being excluded from the decision-making process we 've got section 95 decisions we 've got section 104 following our meeting stuff to go away and do some further thinking on on how those concerns could be addressed and they 've come up with a an amendment which I have before you today which basically allows hearings panels to continue to be used on section 104 decisions that 's the substantive decision making process if it 's required there 's not many hearings that are used these days but substantive Lee I suppose I 'm conceding in point one that stuff will make the decision on notification that a list of applications that are being considered will be sent to the relevant community board and also the entire list of the of applications be available to the regulations and consents committee so it 's a concession on part of stuff I 'm comfortable with it and I would move that that Rick resolution be accepted do I have a second of that Thomas Kendra is there any discussion yani I just wanted to check because we 've had a lot of concerns about notification practices as well and on what I kind of understand how this will improve our notification practice to communities who you feel figured by the decisions they feel excluded from participating I think I could say that section 95 decisions they have to be made according to the RMA and the planning rules and regulations to have a community board member or City Council are actually making an objection to a section 95 clarification or notification on the basis of anything other than the facts before them is not not acceptable so I 'm quite comfortable that we have a process in place subcommittee they are required to make that recommendation on the basis of the information put before them as robust as this decision has to be made today or could it be deferred till next meet I think it can be made no no it 's going to take time so if it doesn 't have to be make today if the decision doesn 't have to be made today I 'd like to leave this report on the table until the next meeting as well because it is now 25 25 and we we are running out of time well I 'm comfortable with the recommendation but it 's going to it 's going to spark off a discussion and it might be a good idea if Vicki and yanni could take it offline with you to talk through concerns but and by the time we get to the next meeting we will either have an agreed position or and I mean position what yep or a contested position all right thank you consider your whole day and that 's right sorry about that that 's okay because my understand to improve notification not reduce it so could we have an offline discussion about it thank you ribbit representation review I have to say I was extremely attracted to a letter to the editor in this morning 's paper which said leave well alone for the next three years if to say I thought this is not turned out the way I would have liked to affect it turned out no no it can just lie on the table till the next hey no cuz i 'll do that next time the report will just get referred to the next meeting thanks i got all excited when i read the letter to the editor this morning that said for goodness sake just leave the boundaries as they are get the city back on its feet and then do it again i have to say after all the trouble you 've gone to that 's exactly how i felt this morning but the note no no reflection at all on the amount of work and effort that 's gone on to it but it does highlight that we are a city of all of the you know transitional stuff that 's going on at the moment with their you know very difficult long-term plan with the district plan review you know with all of these challenging issues that we 're dealing with you know my great hope for us was to be a much more engaged and really open process and people have just got thoroughly confused they think that we 're trying to increase the number of councillors when in fact we 're responding to our legal obligation to look to our representation arrangements and to review them and light of a very embracing and inclusive set of criteria about how people feel in relation to how they elect their representatives and and how they contribute to decision making and their own in their own cities and districts so you know what should have been an incredibly positive and I would have thought to be very empowering and almost self defining moment for the city has ended up being quite confused with respect to what we 're trying to achieve but we made a decision at the last meeting to person who wrote the letter to the editor decides that it would be a good idea to object on the basis that this be put on hold for another three years I 'm sure that there would be a degree of support within the city for their whereas there of be others he 'll say no let 's use the advantage of all the change that 's going on in our city at the moment to actually truly reflect the nature of our city as it is today and and reshape at over time which is why these things are required to be done every six years but they can be done every three years so I guess all of those options are on the table I know a number of people contributed to the debate last time talking about workloads and talking about you know where people stand and you know and all these different things and of course the media want to ask questions about where people going to send this has got nothing to do with us as individual counselors it 's to do with the people say about the boundaries for which different representatives will emerge and and and run the only person that 's elected at-large under all of the proposals that we 've considered as the mayor and I guess that 's why I 'm sort of starting up our off our contribution and the way that I hope others take it up this is not about us it is about the people that we represent and it is about the mechanism for a lick ting a council and establishing community boards to to represent the different wards I think we are all agreed that there should be Ward 's we 're all agreed that there should be ongoing reviews of our of our ward boundaries in the same way as required by our electoral legislation in fact it 's something that we we think as a positive and again an engaging process so I 'm simply going to move for the purposes of having this underway and Andrew i think is putting up his hand so he can sickened he okay well does someone want to second the motion Phil and sorry you for staff the hearings dates includes some dates when councillors are known not to be available now we 've already received advice that all councillors need to be present for all hearings so I 'm requesting that the hearings dates are set out here be revisited to find dates when everybody is available or other things may need to be moved around to take account of that but scheduling the hearings for dates when we know that people are not available doesn 't allow for all members to be present and we know that that 's a requirement so when wins this no you don 't hit ya you 've but a person who isn 't there isn 't able to take a person who misses even as much as half a day isn 't he able to take part in the decision are they well I think and Ian given you some advice on this before recently I think they had been probably a stricter approach adopted to their participating and hearing all the submissions and then and the decision-making so as you know you 're allowed to pop up or whatever whatever person I must all the hearings you couldn 't test the pace and the decision making it sorry what we remember dates are from 27th of October to the 31st of October which includes a Saturday yeah and includes so in my own case I 've had the friday the 30th noted that I 'm not available and I 'm not available on that Saturday and that 's been in my diary for a long time as not available I know there 's at least one other council it was not available on that friday as well so if we agree this with those dates in it that immediately from the advice that Ian gave us last time excludes people who are not going to be available on those dates when there may be other dates we can find when everybody would be available fine and of course we will try to find dates when everybody 's available in fact I don 't think we need to have these dates actually stated in this table so we can delete those two lines and we 'll try when people can attend but I 've just been up and had another look at the schedule and whichever days and that period of time when we have to do it there 's only a six weeks to and round there after we get the hear that the submissions back is only a six weeks period before you have to make the final decision so it 's very very tight and so whichever days we have it on we 're going to have to move some meetings we 're going to have to do every day that we 're going to have you have the dates George pretty soon because I mean I don 't know what you 've gotten your diary but you know I 'm free those days and I 've set aside for that purpose so yeah but if we could approve this today without those days yes ribbit without a direction yeah but I mean we 'll do the best that we can but that not everyone will be able to just because of people 's you know sort of personal circumstances but will do the then I had a second question my understanding is the two reports have been commissioned one from Bob shearing and one from Martin ward where are they to be included in the process terms I don 't see any mention of them here and I would assume that they would need to be tabled prior to the hearings commencing took years that 's correct two independent reports have been commissioned working with the working party and they will be available at the beginning of this towards the start of the submissions period so that they are available they 're going to be comments on the decision coming out of today great thank you um le Jan related to page 2 46 the epidural wiry word littleton Sumner areas with regards the community board members so we 've got the low population numbers there which clearly were aware of and yet with littleton Sumner which has got a combined population of 16 or just over we 've got five there there are nine and total for around 4,000 i 'll talk about community board I mean this why is that so them well it could be English it could be but we 're trying to replicate the situation with two community boards on the peninsula there 's no way to get around that with our carrel why we 're if you 're going to have a board over there you going to have lee 's population evil why do we have three it 's summer well you can change that in the review of you if you to not only I a look that 's great but I 'm asking the question why too because it just seems illogical when you 've got subdivision populations above way in excessive 11 which you 've got four Sumner and yet for some reason we have one additional community board member and similar why would that be well as I thought you want two different Ward 's you 've got sprayed most and Kashmir you 've got three wards together that 's six and you 've only got five four little to the summer some of us more than summer I mean it 's right across through to death cut isn 't it by the reasoning want so it was a geographical a thing because you 're combining Littleton with with Sumner and you 're representing a wider community so little terns always going to be you know like you wouldn 't just have one person from little fun I mean you know I 'm also good I 'm one of them seem that some learn for from know I was thoughtfully some dinner and two from the sort of it turns yeah it is I couldn 't understand though it was the logic that was missing in ER that 's all I 'm just asking double the population let 's double the population little tennis 5271 summoners 11,600 yeah singletons 19,000 and they have to community board members here would is 21,000 they have to community board members I 'm looking at the numbers of bar none but but it was always going to be like there when you 've got occur or wiry were and one community board little chance getting tap done with Sumner a minute I mean it 's that and it 's not just it 's not just little I know you are but it 's because it 's with little time here can I answer that just from my observation about that in fact the term some also goes right round to Mount Pleasant it 's I baked a geographical area it 's that whole piece yeah question popular follow the artist equation because I review this one 's particular a paragraph three pointer stay with some of the area you need whether we can take a time to define clearly for instance like monowheel Brickton have monowheel Pendleton hebbal Munna we 'll probably cross the boundary you know different as three AC to suck but home we have sucked penticton hyper sock bun Ireland Pendleton have iron and also the victims of the island we still need to define clear otherwise race then they are not aware where belong to yes well gee they are the reason for that is that we tried these are than the names of communities from the statistics mesh blocks that are used so we 're we 've put the ward boundaries we 're trying to make it clear that we have one ward and half is in the other one so it 's very difficult to get around that counselor team I 'm yani then Jamie I personally do you think it 's a bit of an anomaly for summer day of three and I can 't yeah I I wish I 'd picked it up last month when we 're discussing it because it does it does seem a bit odd that urban would have more representation I 'll so yeah I just wanted to raise that you want debate now our users more questions now I 'm just doing questions quickly and then more okay so I mean I just all the question is can we change it now or what are we tied by that earlier decision time I think you could change it now I can 't see why this is the fight this is formalizing the decision in do you want it registered to I would prefer not to reduce it to two and of course I would say that I think there 's a concept with community boards that I mean I know this is has a wider geographical area as this little tin saamne community board will often the issues the community board to deal with and not just people driven but are also physical things driven so you know the amount of roadway in a community board area or the number of parking spaces or the number of trees or the number of you know things that create issues for cubans you boards to deal with and it worries me that if we reduce some to then you could easily take the argument we should reduce Littleton 21 and I think to have one member for little son which is actually the very diverse communities of Littleton governor 's Bay all of the southern Bay 's including diamondharbour per hour and across the port leaving would then call into question the arrangements we 've already made with the a corollary were bored and the whole thing starts to unravel so whilst I understand from a purely representing people viewpoint it wouldn 't make logical sense to look at reducing those numbers I think the whole thinking behind what we did with a corollary an extent that thinking needs to extend to lyttelton harbour and also needs to extend some balance within that new community board for Littleton sumner of realistic balanced and fair representation on that board so you look at the fact that the sumner population is twice that of the Littleton population that would lead to we should reduce Littleton down to warm but then in terms of fair representation for all those different and diverse communities around the harbor and wrapping around into port leaving that argument doesn 't hold so I would far prefer to leave it the way that it is so that the whole thing doesn 't start to unravel then hornby you had 12 11,000 and in record and you have 12 wrote a roughly 12 11,000 and in sumner all three to 11 personnel anyone suggesting produced a little from one but certainly that the similar one does seem over-represented what they 'd introduce I presumed that the Summoner one was put on because the little town mum was to represent 25 5200 so would it make any difference if we reduced it to two only thing that I think kind of potentially misses out as does that Mount Herbert representative represent as much as the other side of the harbour which is quite a significant looking at current representation on Littleton mount herbert board there has historically and even on this board there is a reasonably equal weighting between both sides of the harbor so it would be I mean we can 't predict whom I stand and who might get elected but looking historically there has been good representation on that board between the Littleton side and the diamond harbour side and in fact with the by-election we 've got a good representative now for the head of the harbor governors bait headington as well so I don 't think there 's an assumption that all of the representation with those two members would come from little term and I guess if we were going to reduce the numbers in sumner it would be based on an argument of some as a urban population so to bring sumner into line with other urban populations then we should reduce it from three to two board for lyttelton harbour once the board has been elected that 's right you 're listening in to the arguments yeah I thought it was mainly about continuing the spirit of their arrangements we had with the two boards on the peninsula given the given the extent of the geographical area more than anything else in bringing that littleton and there 's some area in there with three was going to counter that in some way but I guess it 's diamond it go then the reason for it isn 't around the percent it 's not the numbers population it yeah I know but it is the merging the seat doesn 't work but then nor does the yay you don 't have once out and one counselor for 3,000 people which is metric here this is basic communities and community pool it 's one counselor for a corona wire real were slapping those little to the summer it 's all for they 've got it that 's good no this nexus one sees me it 's the same counselor that 's not what I suppose the one doesn same what you see is it 's one counselor to 19,000 869 population and that 's consistent within plus 10 minus across the other Wars so the council ratios have to be within plus minus ten percent but that 's a human rights don 't the only discussion about the community borders are they representing you know fairly communities of interest in their subdivisions and I just can 't argue that Sumner and their small geographical area even though it 's got more population their little turn should have an extra member well it has double the population of little turn yeah you knock it down to two you give it equal weight as little turn yeah so it 's we 're not bound by the percentage rules yeah when we get to the community board so I think you can validly argue for three or two the question is do we leave it at three or do we knock it down to two I think both are valid arguments and I think you have to compare it to the other urban forwards and the existing boards as do fairness would be to keep it at two which is consistent with all the other community board wards and would be the most logical but I 'm you know people over to aren 't we approval something to go out of consultations yes we are question is do we put it out at two or put it out of 23 yeah that 's true how many people think it should be reduced to to reduce it to too quickly just a quick show of hands one two three four five six seven looks excuse me aight no eight that 's right so reduce it to to reduce it to talk okay I was just going to suggest that we could note that in these proceedings that you 've taken you 'd want to reduce it to two but we we probably don 't technically need to do that because you could do that during your I don 't know reduce it reduces it to all right and and you could you could you know i mean yeah i listen to toe yeah bruh jackson 80 cuz yeah yeah because somebody may any other questions you it is it a quick question yeah it 's actually a question for you than if you don 't mind but it was um given what is to house it nothing given there 's only five minutes left I 'm there 's no point we litigating too much of the stuff and it 's not too different to really receiving a report really so would you mind there are some things that I agree with the recommendations some things that I done could would you be happy to put them separately yeah which one it 's complicated I agree with 3.1 I don 't agree with 3.2 i agree with 3.3 I don 't know 3.4 times you know you want me to put them through wait individually okay all right right right right yeah there 's some that I agree with some of my diet it 's just convoluted well given given that this is going out for this is this is the whole process to get it out the public consultation I would suggest that we limit the debate and in and we 'll so so so debate do you want to speak to it the some speakers for in some against a limited number you want to know what I was gonna invite yani is the spirit that we can grope to stir to Britt I I don 't know that people need to have a debate about it it 's merely to relitigate fauna here but yani is the chair of the working group and I wanted to invite him to speak very quick I 'll just invite you to watch the video from last month 's council meeting where we debated this all the comments I made then I think still true today this is just that procedural thing to have had the proposal developed into a form that we can put out it 's not really a debate about the merits of the proposal we 've done that and we 've got an agreement I just want to stress that councillors we 're in a consultation face so please think about what you say publicly and the point the mermaid was absolutely true the start of this this is not circumstances it 's not about where we love it 's actually about how do we get a fair system of representative democracy through communities of interest in our setting so we 've got pretty clear guidelines from the local government Commission it 's not about the quality of councillors it is about how we actually get the best system of democracy representing those communities of interest and I just want to convince staff for the huge amount of work that they 've done through the mapping and the numbers it may look fairly simple on the surface is a huge amount of effort it goes on behind the scenes to get the numbers to work in a way that we need to do because of what 's happened on the pendants of us so I won 't say any more than that you know please don 't debate the merits of this today this is a procedural motion just to get to proposal out for consultation yeah and although I started by saying that we you know that the letter to the editor this morning said leave things the way are because of the banks peninsula Ward the Beast would we were told by the local government Commission cannot remain as it is because it is outside the percentage tolerance for the difference between the different council representatives and and so once we have to make that change all of a sudden we 're having the debates around the scale of a small community board with a larger community board inside a large Ward that has one councillor all of the wards under this proposal have one counselor and and that is what we will be discussing and the public arena will be inviting the public to have a say but at the end of the day this is not the day for making a decision other then for what we go and consult on so I 'll put item are 3.1 all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried item not 3.2 all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that 's 00 what let 's have a vote sorry I can 't can 't called it we already voted on time that that was the volume so we know what do this I don 't know I 've got asked to split up the boat yeah um no I can 't I can 't do this I 'm sorry but then why can 't I vote yes to saying that I don 't support no no no I 'm sorry we voted last time on the substance yeah so we 're either voting to put this out in the public arena or when not know so it 's not true I 'm sorry I 'm sorry that was the ruling that we made last time was that we made the we made the decision at last at the last meeting and so we can 't go through and have people voting up and down before the Indians in my ass if you to do there because it 's the case then I will vote against the whole that 's right that 's right well and that 's what you have to do which is misleading because I agree with some aspects of it the purpose the reports his formal adoption a bit they 're not hard lemak one can I say and legally under the local literally it you 've got to have something the way the resolutions are weirded a matched up with the local literally which is what you have to pass today so thats because the losses you know you 've got to resolve these things XYZ it so we do have to go through them one by one yeah okay so we 'll have to have a vote on each separate one of them yeah that 's true yes true or if they don 't just on the same but no that 's just the same it 's in the same meeting I think it 's in the same meeting sorry it so it 's not so if our vote is equal so if it 's seven all then it doesn 't carry so that 's my problem excuse me Mia I think we 've got a slight problem here I think this is more of a procedural vote today because we have acted on the instructions that we 're going out with this and if don 't make a decision today so I don 't do that thank you I understand they 're absolutely which is why I 'm a little frustrated that we couldn 't have passed a resolution last time that locked us down I understood that that 's exactly what we 're done last time I don 't understand when we talk about this just being procedural the factors that we approve this or as elected members approve this to go out for consultation we are clearly showing a support or support for this not yeah I think you are how can you not I 'm sorry this we already decided as a council it doesn 't matter whether you voted for or against that the council resolution was to adopt this option this is the option we technically have to go out on consult on that was the decision we made at the last meeting and we made there absolutely nobody know that it is not because we have to have an open mind when we go out for consultation it was the same with the long term plan we had submissions and then make our decision could be hip Dara wait a minute can I have Daryl could I ask daryl ok can I explain it this way in my view you have already resolved all of those individual components you did then your last meeting yep and it to change that you would need to revoke that resolution it 's not what you 're doing today is formally adopt in the initial proposal to go out for consultation and in my view that 's all of the components of the issues that you raised last time yeah and and you simply need to have that single resolution to put this out for public consultation at this time that 's right and I 'm not going to go through an item-by-item if you lift up the staff recommendation that says that the council resolves under sections 19 hnj of the local electorate to adopt the following initial proposal the Christchurch City Council for the elections be held in 2016 elections thereafter until altered by subsequent decision and that as what the proposal is we have made an amendment and turn the community board member numbers and and the Summoner component of littleton Sumner and we have also removed the dates for the starting and ending of oral submissions so I just need to change three point 12 as well because it refers to a number of community boredom as reach three points well we 've saying littleton so yeah number three ago sumner will go to two as well alright so that 's the that 's the whole thing and if people don 't want to if they want if you want to vote against the initial proposal going out for public consultation then you can vote against that but voting for it to go out for initial consultation or initial proposal for the election for the for the elections the initial proposal that is not endorsing the initial proposal or supporting the initial proposal it is simply adopting the initial proposal for for public consultation so that is not you if you voted against the particular resolution there is nothing to stop you from endorsing this going out for for consultation because we must announce this proposal or a you have a question I understand what you 're saying but we 're actually sending out a recommendation for public consultation and we 've only we 're only sending out 11 of the three options and because it 's going out under our umbrella or whatever there is going to be the perception that that is the third option and I would much prefer i was asked to make a comment on us and i said this is an initial proposal we are still gonna be pissed we are quite i look i see that right from the start the public perception is guided by the way that this has been it has been commented on and that has been very and would rather than outward and that is that is just the nature of the political environment that we find ourselves in as I have tried to say to anyone who will listen this is a legal process we made all the decisions at the last meeting it was not unanimous people expressed strong views and the alternative approach to this and it was close this is the proposal would take comfort from the fact that there are mixed views around the table because they know that there will be an open mind a series of open mind sitting around the table and when we come to make a final decision as a council we will take into account the feedback that we receive from across the city and when we do so we will do so as counselors for the city not as representatives of ourselves or the positions that we currently hold that was the point that I was making right at the very outset because this is about the people we represent it is not about us _"

they and are they old are they I know there 's an average and reportedly that was quite doesn 't look provide through and identify the geographical location of the trees they 're talking about so tell me that state like I can summarize again we made a great effort that he made a great effort to include as much information as possible on the impact and mitigation within the the consultation document and tree loss and the forms of the trees were summarized sir for option C for instance 112 sorry no suddenly tree so I looked down the wrong card we were able to split those between native exotics or 28 native trees 42 exotic and then they looked at the life remaining of those trees so if we don 't do anything how long might they live so it 's a measure of the the quality so 28 of those than 10 years 20 between 10 and 20 and then further 22 greater than 20 years and one of the considerations that the team of given has been to target the the improvements the widening of the tree loss largely to areas where as fewer trees affected and also where there 's alder or lower quality trees impacted so whilst we wouldn 't be widening the impacting on the trees along the entire length the sections we wouldn 't be touching largely because they have good quality you know high number of trees right and I didn 't see any thing in the consultation feedback from Stapleton 's road about the trees particularly wasn 't good huge uproar as he was an option a no and we picked up a reasonable amount of support where residents on Stapleton 's Road felt that they like to see a tidy up yes that section which which we can 't provide I would concur with it and just from the deputation this morning the was Clare appears he was concerned he he gave us the impression that there was very little enhanced not area and it would just be pockets can you tell us how how much enhancement you 'd physician yes yes so the the effective section is something round about 400 metres long of which about 250 meters so just a little over half of that would actually be directly affected with with works and enhancement and as I was saying the hundred and fifty meters that we are so that we wouldn 't be touching is largely being left untouched because it has mature high quality tree stock and we 've been trying to work around them so you know if you 've got a good quality area you don 't need to enhance that further and so we 've tried to design around them and he was also from the consultations people were concerned about the avon river being able to cope with the extra water going into it dealer response to their so we have done some more detail on long around aven river and the impacts of the scheme and it 's felt that those impacts are very small very modest we 've considered a very yeah the avon river and in dudley creek in conjunction with the twenty percent tied that in fact as higher sort of liberal of service and you 're normally designed for and the impacts were minor downstream and about the outlet of the bypass and mostly due to the different responses and in the catchments of the evans very large catchment of the Dudley 's just a small component of it so they respond in different ways to different rainfall events and also the avin flood levels are impacted by the tide so I 'm thinking the tide with their proposal so the works from our analysis today don 't have significant impact downstream and so when you 've got let 's say option C was was supported today the Dudley will still continue around our normal route as well and as option C just kickin in an event that would be the idea because you could maintain environmental flows and the deadly and so he wound up compromising the and it was just one other one of fun days that was concerns about moving the flooding no it 's not the modeling being referred to as a dark art now I 'd like to sort of clarify that modeling is quite mature in fact I would say it 's quite a mature science and in fact hydraulic modeling today has has particularly in this situation where we have the ability not only to drive computer models to simulate rain events but we also use real-world data so we got there and actually monitor and then compare the real world results with what the model produced when we see good correlation we could we can then start to rely on that science so you know it 's far from being a dark art thank you yani thank you so just the sectional step one 's right it 's not going to be a big bit with trees coming down is it the city next to p2 park or is it through the down further so there 's pockets these pockets of trees and there 's a pocket of trees near warden Street which were supposed to be retained there 's another pocket probably midway down Mayor Brown guild street and that detailed plans in the consultation document that people were avail we 're available to residents and along with we did the drop-in sessions we bought quite large plans so people would see quite clearly which trees we 're and what trees are going to be retained send about the idea that that the rest of Dudley Creek is just lift as so crystal straight north grade what are the plans that you 've got a lot just normal maintenance ongoing maintenance that that from from the from the the modeling that we have done that would be sufficient so in fact the flows will decrease and that fridge as a result of putting in the bypass in order to get that water level objective warden street so the amount of water that we need to go along that stretches reduced with option C still a considerable flow but certainly less than what would expect to see today well you 've done saying all this Dudley in Chile on the left hand side and what you don 't think you need to do yeah so that sinal winds surely work was not gone back out to consultation on there those there 's still work in those areas significant work proposed on surely stream and Albans creek so we 've had that communication and consultation with the community late last year but we didn 't seek to rican sult on that as part of the downstream options can I just check that Dudley Street and not provide the deadly trigger and look great and process it it won 't be returned to cope preview well there will be reduced flows along there but the water levels have to double check out the water legal but I am persuaded dropping significant amount the flood risk through those areas wasn 't identified as significant risk to houses the other question I have is around that impact on on the avon river so that you really cuts quite a lot further on a long as you go through that local into the next loop so how is this going to impact I mean if you take a van park for example those roads are constantly closed due to flooding so all this water going in to be any change or impact if you want to address the other plans for the downstream mitigation weeks or so as I alluded to earlier we 've done some work looking at the impacts on the average river itself and we believe those to be very small downstream flood protection works which would fall some protection to their areas like even park and through the residential red zone subject to ongoing investigations right so here I 'm just trying to understand from a sequencing point of view if we don 't know what we 're doing in that residential red zone how do we know what the best model is to divert water and we were the best location asst well certainly in the lower lost reaches their flood levels of the avin are driven and ty lee by the tide so any work that we do and the upstream riches will have no effect on those people at levels so we know for much of the lower avin indicated roughly by the extent of the total stock banks you see today those temporary stop beings as heavily influenced that comes up and you 've got this division coming in and they made what happens in terms of the hydrology well as I said we 've done some hydraulic model runs looking at the avin how the Evan responds with this scheme and we believe impacts are very small the other thing is they 're having a well we do allow for what 's a five year or twenty percent event and that scenario if we add up very large tied with very large rainfall event you get very very improbable occurrence and well beyond what we 're normally designed for but we look at we we are looking to understand those risks we have done some work in that space and we believe that those risks we did traduce prior to even having option C on the table I 'm Tim glean David thank you i 'm looking at a B and C that he 'll try and follow roads with possible or go through parks or follow streams river route store obviously mitigate or reduce the risk for property owners objecting and I 'm just wonderin be the red zone effort had followed the east side would Chester Avenue and piped through to Midway street you 're from your scale on the top right hand corner you 'll be saving the costs of over 200 meters of underground piping plus if you 're on the east side would Chester if it would reduce the risk from complaints or issues with property owners I 'm just wondering why that why go through richmond park right through to residential rather than follow the east side of wood chester street which is on the rim you wouldn 't be in the red zone but it would be the least intrusion on probably owners and so kind of my god my my understanding was that the project team did look at that bad option there 's been a lot of work done down woodchester that would be have to be ripped up and pulled up and that obviously has an impact on costs so yes for a number of reasons that was looked at by the project team and they felt that the root down through the park more direct route the two but if the face side of them would choose that as redesigned and although there 's been work done on there we don 't know what 's going to happen in the future so I mean what does it per meter or ten meters to pipe underground am in us because on your matrix that won 't the two risks would cost or one of the number that would cost and also possible trip from probably us objecting which I thought this would have probably mitigated a couple of hours near for hips would have changed its standing because any of these streets that in things happening here to be dug out and when we talking about impact when we 're talking 140 odd trees it seems to me that doing a perot that 's hit some work and its face it through the city roads being dug up twice three times anyway so I 've just you know it 's just an interesting space inside so you suggesting that this wouldn 't be underground no no would be but yes it 's a lot shorter so if say with inaccessible isn 't it it 's it well yeah it 's not well that 's not a start it 's not a straight line and it boots well it 's a straight line there others say no but it keeps continuing in the same direction where it devotes back the other way quite some studio but you can 't tell from a map i 'm not gonna redesign of me sitting I think it 's the cost of going through open field or pine green space area as less than going down the road corridor that may offset in some part the reduction and length of the pot I suspect that that solution is bounded by those costs b1 and b2 so we know that will be in that same sort of San to the ballpark there and still be was significantly more expensive than a and C so it 's unlikely to overcome that difference at all yeah Oakland think you just you sit before I can see the most disruptive but that 's not saying the same by any means as saying the most invasive is invasive in your view or is it one of the other by invasive jus mean or you can sit on genesee is the most construction in construction gig but not it 's not the same as saying the most invasive it 's the option says certainly there impex the largest number of people that goes across the most number of parcels and for a front of the most number of properties so that 's the basis by which we always going to be the greatest impact say for example banks air would impact fewer number of residents we might more than pack them in a different way because we 'd be looking to replace their private bridges for example and that would I would obviously look to offset those excess issues and during construction and but soonly option c is the greatest number of people who might be impacted by those short-term construction impacts in just in terms of the tidal influence i mean that far up the river it 's not that strong is it well even Dudley Creek up to north parade along banks have still influenced by that 's for you but with what you 're saying over that whist case scenario a high tide and great out for that probability is very low really yep okay dad thank you yep just a technical question on at the petrie street or the start of option C are you proposing to maintain the same the normal flow of water down Dudley creep through was near option a or are we diverting a bulk of the flow at all times through our option see through the I 'm just concerned they 're here that we we may disrupt the ecology downstream if we divert a significant amount of water down option C at all time so I suppose my question is really is option C being used as a primarily as a an extreme event exit of water and we are maintaining the flow downstream as paradas now or are we actually splitting the flow yes the the pipe option C dan Petry street through Randall Street Midwest street would would be dry the vast majority of the time it 's not diverting any floor under normal conditions under of times a year during a big storm event so it is literally an overflow it 's not seeking type diver so it in terms of the impact on the ecology it would be really be not affecting that thank you alright so now do we have a mover and a seconder so Pauline alley is there any discussion well well I think perhaps from a question that 's really clear that well certainly I strongly support option C the staff recommendation I think clearly a huge amount of science and work and engineering work has gone into this and it 's really impressive because I think we 're making a decision now to actually fix the issues that really I guess struck us that much of last year and we know that there 's a long history for this area tub in it where it 's been flooded too so all to altogether too i 'm really impressed that in fact the multi criteria analysis that that the start of used really ties in and I think Keith said it really correlates with the public feedback it 's really leads us to to make it to option C and supporting there too and I think the way things have been really sensible the basically giving that flood reduction that was as a number one and the hydraulic sustainability and resilience for the whole system in the future and making sure that the environment is cared for so all together to you know I 'm saying the the whole thing really reduces the flood risk for that for this area which is low lying open basin and i think that the feedback from the people to indicates that they want the long-term outcomes they wanted want it fixed as well as possible and in between from the very good consultation that the residents will cope with the disruption factor caused by the works so I 'm going to strongly support staff recommendation you should feel asleep there for a minute because just around the estimated cost there is there is a side of me that just wants to have a little bit more comfort around it and I know that I raised a couple of issues during the course of test these costs and I wonder if we could just put after the estimated cost of 48 million which I know includes the upstream work so that 's another amount of money for the works that we would be approving today but I just I just kind of want to have a subject to sign off between myself and maybe the chair of the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee so that we 've just got the opportunity to have you know maybe an independent group just look at the overall cost Ang 's because I mean what we want to do is save some money down the track if we possibly can as well so it would that be okay if we just have subject to the sign-off from the mirror and the cheapest and the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee we went with unreasonably withhold our consent obviously but I just want to have that degree of comfort that we 've given up that degree of oversight mending recommendation to yeah 3 point a is very similar to the arrangement we had during the days of the task force thanks for that and YouTube quite happy with that yeah so Pauline ali jaan e you think you inducible I 'd really like to also communal staff an incredible job particularly not just in all the technical reporting in your brains and bringing in all the right people here but the engagement with the community was outstanding and I don 't know how many meetings that you had including one on ones we nice the syrian so that was amazing and i noticed too that and one of them eating 's I mean to it was even Smith who stood up and said to the group and it was a really large group and he said please everyone try not to think of just your own personal circumstances here think of the greater benefit to the to the whole greater population the residence in the environmental outcomes and I think people really took that on board now I noticed in the consultation these people in stapleton Road who 've actually supported this as well and I think that gives testimony to thinking of the greater picture even though they will a huge amount of work gone into this and it 's very well presented report and it 's taken a long time and I think too that we listened to the banksy of people when they came in and I I was very reluctant to lose trees there because of the established ecosystem they talked about the birds the bell Birds the kingfishers the wood pigeons now you can take the trees out you can replace them but how long would it take to replace that whole ecosystem a long time I think with the option C going into me I support that because I like the idea that we 're following the natural water way for a lot further and in fact we 're not disrupting the stream really because it will continue on its own course most of the time and we only use the option C when we the division when we have an event and we all know from the reports that de Lucas gives us regular leave it it 's very difficult to actually dive the waterways anyway they find their own course again and so by the time and as we know that staff have been continuing on the upstream improvements including widening some culverts and pecks removing some bridges and most of all improving the maintenance program which is I think some considerable improvement and also on our area the resonance of being really you know participating they are needing a slow in the odd shopping trolley into the waterways and things like there and plus the tay street pump which is going to take the water out the other way so i think this is going to give a great deal of comfort to people who are vulnerable in who they are not sleeping at night when it starts to rain now we haven 't slowed down the date because of all this because we 've been doing the upstream work so we 're still learning for 2017 which is getting closer and closer so for me the fact that the Stapleton 's road built away will be the enhanced at the end of this and it as pretty scrubby looking as is a couple of people of noted today and that excited about this today it 's going to enable a lot of residents to to move on to think that this is going to actually achieve something for them it 's going to enable this to get started after all this time in all this hard work building up to it and I just want to thank you all very much for the week so far I 'll be supporting Operation Sea okay Ellie I just want to start off buying not only commanding staff but also my colleague pulling quater who 's worked incredibly hard on this both as a ward councillor but also as the land drainage recovery program working party chair so good on you pulling that I 'll be supporting option C today it aligns with what most what most people want which is importantly returning the flop tan area to pre youthquake risk and and I just like to repeat what Pauline said you know you imagine going to sleep or not being able to sleep as soon as it starts raining and that 's not an exaggeration that is what is happening in this today is with option C um yani yeah I 'm kind of struggling with this because it just seems to me that we 're spending a huge amount of money for something that happens every two might have been to two or three times a year and the rest it 's just redundant and it kind of the cost just seemed massive for Annalise 585 properties but I do kind of wonder whether this is the right kind of approach this is very much an engineering approach as opposed to working with the natural environment in a different way recognizing that actually maybe some of those land isn 't suitable for residential so I don 't know when we start to have those serious conversations like we 're having with the coastal hazards around you know huge expenditure on an engineering solution versus other other zoning or planning mechanisms um I just wanted to raise raise the issue that you know we 've been to a consultation process and I understand the inks that people people have I am really concerned about not knowing what 's happening in the red _''_1581.24 good decision-making to rush into decisions when we have no idea what 's happening in the red zone I do know the ad in rubber in fact when it flooded it came all the way up to Barbados stroke in the avin loop so we 're going to put all this water into the into the river and then it 's going to still be flooding all the way further up in Barbados straight so I 'm just trying to kind of understand how that 's going to work whether that phone is going to get exacerbated because it would seem kind of sensible if you 're putting a lot of water going this way and the water is going this way what happens so I have some real concerns about this I do want to see solutions but it does yeah it does seem odd i think that we are just building hugely expensive engineering thing that what we used a few times a year if at all and we 've got some other major decisions that we still need to make that could could be impacted by this I 'm really not happy about 3.2 I think it should actually come back to the full council a 50 million dollar contract not coming back to the full council for sign off and you know I put my hand up i got i think i got the city care one wrong I wish I hadn 't delegated dead away I wish I hadn 't don 't get it away things like a Kashia but this is a lot of money and I 'd like to have confidence when the tenders come back for the work that we actually sign off as a full council so everyone 's aware of who 's doing it what the costs are and what the budget expectations up so I don 't know if 3.2 can be amended but i would say like to move an amendment that does come back to the full council so that 's an amendment moved that we replace the subject to approval well I mean we 're not delegating the authority of we 're giving it to the council so so we 'll deal I 'll deal with so we don 't need an amendment will deal with 3.2 separately because you can 't grant delegated authority if that 's coming back to council so you 'd have to your vote against it that 's the easiest way to deal with that I mean it was to be a delegated authority to staff we 've added on myself and the chair of the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee which I think there 's a better then then the full delegation to stuff but if you think actually come back to council then you 're not approving a delegation so that 's a complete contradiction to the motion already spoken but I think the point about the impact on the Avon is absolutely no no no no well I 'm not inviting through the conversation I 'm just so so it will put that 3.2 separately term I think you would we 're next David thank you I 'll be I 'll be brief this whole project started off with a proposal to put a bypass across warden street and and realign sections of Dudley creek down banks air occasions and I really want a compliment stuff for taking the initiative following those sort of meetings to look at other options and I think this whole process has been thoroughly work through and I 'm totally supportive of ops and see and I would urge other counselors to vote likewise thank you very good all right well I 'll put now what is it easiest that I put 3.2 on its own first or or are you just not supporting the whole thing 3.2 ok just take yannis vote recorded against 3.2 and so I shall put them two separately i 'll put 3.2 first all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried yani opposed and then i 'll put the balance of the recommendation all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you and thank you too to also the stuff you 've done an amazing job think the whole team up there _"

    "text": "thank you for all finishing your conversations now and returning to your cell I have decided apropos of nothing in particular to move to Clause 31 Dudley Creek options for downstream long-term flood remediation I think I think we have a team of people available ready willing and available cast of thousands and John I think you 're coming up to the table as well honey would you like to make a suggestion read the future we do the important things first off in the morning yes I great late in the office yet the travel time is supper is I know that but we just suggest we have the community boards in the morning and that 's always the case and we do try not to have major papers if the community board meeting but you know and I had to I had to organize a sick time excuse me I didn 't organize a set time i 'm not i 'm not taking umbrage at your implied criticism of my chairmanship of you um anyway but no it is you 're absolutely right and we will attempt to boards in the morning for severe purposes so Dudley Creek options for downstream long-term flood remediation so since this was last in front of our committee there 's been a substantial amount of community engagement undertaken and if I 'd like to hand over to hand over to that one do you want to introduce the paper or okay well who would like to introduce a page on would you yeah okay i will i will just kick it off and and thank you you worship for up bringing the sport and until the team who can actually present this large piece of work that mean me going for sometimes are really pleased to be at this point with with a comprehensive set of options and we think with it with a way forward or suggested way forward and that will we are ready to take any of the questions that might come of this but rather than doing page term of voluminous appendices that support the report and prepared a presentation that the team that walk so if you 'd like to see that Merrilees they just give you and these and these are Penn disease that has been an awful lot of work on into this and I think we can give a precise summary and by way of PowerPoint yeah I think that would be good don 't ask Keith and Tom to leave that just as freestone could we get some commentary around the deputation this morning because it would be quite interesting in conky let 's hit the presentation and then we 'll have we 're having then we 'll have questions I think we 'll deal with her questions because I mean he 's obviously raised issues that will be shared by some are not others so yep yeah okay thank you you all set to go yeah we can have the lobby overhead we go ah here we go right thank you very much um so the question is which which Ruta Lee recommending and as it says there option C so as you 'll recall option a is the warden street banks Avenue route so it 's a piped in open channel route the alternative route that was proposed when we met piped route warden street down through marine college and through the red zone and options see that that came up there it was a route that previously had been discounted but for reasons around related to the red zone and to cost came back in option C this involves route channel widening on Stapleton 's road and a piped bypass down Peter E Street Randall street and medway so we 'll refer to those those three options a B and C as we go through so what I wanted to do is just take you quickly through comparing and contrasting those options so that we can understand how we 've done the analysis to come to this recommendation of option C so the first thing is in terms of flood relief now in comparing these options all of them give equal benefits to the flockton area which of course is what these downstream options are all about the upstream you 've already agreed now it 's about the downstream and put together all of them give equal benefits to flop tan area so there 's not really anything between them in that there 's some secondary benefits that 's worth noting in that Stapleton 's Road do receive some additional flood relief of their own by pursuing that option in preference to the other to the cost estimates are all quite comparable for what are quite different different options option C is the cheapest not by far but still substantial amounts in in those absolute terms the most expensive is option B and the alternative route for option B where we found a route around the red zone because as we got to it as perhaps no Sarah 's have difficulty giving consent in a timely fashion for a new infrastructure through the red zone so we came up with this alternative route but of course that adds to the cost so twenty six point two million against 32.1 these are the construction costs but just for the downstream option parts that were considering today deliverability as we 've indicated previously we 're targeting a completion of works on site by winter 2017 we believe this to be the earliest date that we could construct a scheme of this magnitude to them option B has the highest risk risk because of the red zone consent and because of that we 're not recommending that option in the direct option option B route option a the bank 's Avenue route has a moderate risk that also requires a red zone consent although a lesser threshold to gain that so that 's possibly more consent about but there 's also risk of third party challenge more so than perhaps option C which we considered assessed as a lower risk possibly the least risky option would be option be the alternative route there 's far fewer landowners and it always avoids red zone however there is a risk that a single line owner could block that by not giving a negotiate consent and that could delay the route that option quite considerably resilience and sustainability here a lot of work has been done to come compare options around this and we 've compared gravity solutions with pumped solutions and in looking at whole of life the team have come up with the assessment that a gravity system is quite adequate and has a recommended and proposed as part of that assessment similar to the skirt models they 've worked on assumption for costing purposes of two earthquakes over they what would be a century or more of us at life of two earthquakes that would cause cause damage in order to give some based assessment what it 's felt is that any repairs that would be necessary in terms of whole life costs is still to buy the house of gravity system in terms of future sustainability all the options are comparable all of them can be upgraded to different degrees in different ways to allow for future climate change or sea level rise so that again there 's there 's nothing really between them environmental impact this was obviously a big consideration when we 've considered this previously and been through consultation option a as the most significant impact tree loss is greatest 112 trees would be lost with this option but our landscape architects also see that this option has the greatest opportunity for environmental enhancement so there 's conflicting drivers in that one option be in contrast has the least 's not without impact those trees would be replaced on a like-for-like basis so this little opportunity for for enhancement it would just be replacement option C sits somewhere in the middle with a moderate impact of 70 trees and shrubs lost but again there 's opportunity for enhancement from that construction impact another consideration that we consulted on and again this is mentioned this morning option C would be most disruptive to residents during construction it 's a very significant scheme it 's a very large pipe culvert to to put in and we can 't get away from the fact that residents would be disrupted option option a ceramic and Ron option a is moderately disruptive there will be less impact it 's a shorter pipe length affecting fewer people option be mostly piped mostly through recreation areas and through marin college and so assessment would be that that 's the least impact public feedback we went to a very extensive consultation exercise it 's not the first one so we 've been able to combine the results of those to some degree in terms of our understanding public vote of the options we did ask the public to express their preferences and to give us their views now option a banks avenue not surprisingly with least favorite and had the most negative responses option B was most favored by residents and a lot of the reasons given for that was that that would actually have the least impact on other residents or on the environment so it was favored on that basis option C the recommended route actually had quite a reasonable response wasn 't too far behind option B and again as was mentioned this morning depending how you it 's not a straight thought but there was a significant number of residents both through their representations and through the one-to-one and drop in sessions indicated support or a neutral response to option C somewhat may it 's a number of rape Aldens Road residence favored this this this option because they felt that they would benefit personally in terms of flood with risk reduction and from enhancements that could be made to landscaping and as we say there 's twenty percent responded with comments but 's the that 's the summary of the the analysis at the general level the multi criteria analysis that we 've referenced previously is about trying to balance all those things I 've just gone through and for that we 've we 've given some waiting considerations the project team decided that more weight should be given to the functionality aspects the third reduction the hydraulic sustainability the performance and the environmental impact with less less weight given to cost and construction impact now when we actually then wear this up with what the residents had responded to in terms of their questionnaires you can see here there 's actually really good correlation so the residents slightly different but again flood reduction community health and well-being an environment so the long-term benefits were seen to have a higher weight than the the short-term costs construction impacts and the time to complete the work the feeling that get get the right scheme get the best scheme and so that that 's pops a view that 's been shared by the project team and by residents who 've responded again just making to help with the recommendation so with the team have given weight to each of those storage of those considerations and that 's been weighted and that is given as a recommendation on which is which are the best route options when comparing them option C scored top but we should not hear that option a Dudley Dudley Creek widening at down banks Avenue actually was a very close second option B the piped option through marine college was was drilled quite a way behind now this is this is not considering risk this is not considering deliverability this is just about what we believe to be the best scheme when we added in risks at delivery risks the scoring changed a little bit we found that option B because the risk of deliverability dropped to the bottom option a actually scored a little bit less because there 's some risks on durability because of breads on consent and the option B the alternative route because it avoids the red zone came up in the second place but still somewhat behind option C so option C was felt to be assessment of deliverability it 's held its place as being the recommended route so that is our recommended proposal to you today good questions so got though Paul did you have a question or you want a general response to that yeah I just like a general response to 2001 berries commentary on option B being the better of the yeah yeah no no it can do but I just didn 't want to ignore him because he did have his hand up after felt so I 'll go fill Paul David alley Pauline so well what am I are on the same owner at this will thank you very much for such a full report and so heavily indexed it 's excellent what I want to ask you to us about like it just seemed to me from from the submission here this morning that there was a it was claimed that the sea would have an impact particularly on step and so residents and yet in fact in the report as I pulled it out it really sees the opposite so I 'm just wondering if you could is asking just into it is that were there any ways there in fact the submission this morning could have kind of been aired up to make any possible further option if you get my drift um well pops if own comment it this pops a couple of parts to that I think what what came out from the representation this morning and from a number of those residents who did respond is that they 're concerned about impact to residents into the environment and it 's their their risk assessment around the scheme now they 're quite valid questions and the project team have been spent a lot of time developing responses to that and through their design the risks around Stapleton 's road are such that we believe that the the modeling work that has been done that design proposals are solid are robust they 've been validated by the flood events that happened yesterday last year so we can we can say that the the modeling work that underpins a lot of the design is is solid and as good as you 're going to get anyway clearly we 've still got a bit of work to do to convince the community that and you know I think that in terms of our communication and consultation that the team here have done an absolutely fantastic job and I 'd really commend them on that but clearly there 's still some some parts of the community who have still yet to be convinced and so I think we do need to do more work on that but the project is a project team we feel very strongly that this is this is a robust scheme it 's a robust proposal and will give benefits to those that live on option C on Stapleton 's road and that those risks that have been raised will will not eventuate yeah and i think i could add to that is that the reserve there was a short term risk identified that in doing the shirley road cold at first and by putting in the larger calvert taking out the constraint there would would permit greater flows before the works downstream were completed now that can be managed and that will be culvert so that when we do get events we don 't have consequences downstream in an ideal world would work from the downstream end and work our way up but because this work was in the script program it was it was critical that we get this thing off off the constructed while skirt was still in play and so that work is actually in progress at the moment due to be finished in February march next year but those risks can be managed so the kind of like ideas that work just to clarify for me the ideas also put to us this morning by the submitter in effect you 're not so far even said no to but it is there anyway that effect they could be joined up and what wats bassoons in terms of being been workable that they were better they were bit unclear but I 'm just in terms of what was presented is there any way that that concept might be able to be were achieved certainly in the future it 's recognized that duplicating the options could be one way forward to sometime in the future date you may come and construct an alternative bypass route along the lines that was discussed this morning but to advance that in parallel would considerably provide additional capacity in the scheme but they would go beyond what that pre quote flood risk reduction with noting that forced open road all options will provide a reduction and fighting along steps enjoyed and in fact for option C because the bypass starts downstream and we have to achieve a certain benefit at warden street there is there 's a further flood risk reduction along step 10 so we 're looking for about half of me to drop and water level around warden Street F option C progresses there when additional say 300 mils or so down the petrie street in now that benefit produces the closer you get to ordinary because you 're getting closer to that point it what 's your target is but there are certainly additional benefits and flood for ask reduction for stepping through with option C so I think that answers your question too doesn 't it yeah okay so David alley in the same context good option be one of the greater impediments were the greatest impediment to pursuing option B was the section of that would traverse the red zone man do we have any any issues with it going on a road through the red zone lead we 're still going through the red zone land but a portion of the road we have total control of that or does sierra have something to say about half now so they so they are alternative route for be the one that was shown in the I 'm sorry section so option C going through our thriller research red zone omelette on road through a red zone portion so Sarah Sarah have not submitted a response on that so being as where the red zone is obviously under the land parcels it doesn 't include the road carriageway so we are able to pipe through the road corridor through the middle of the red zone without requiring red zone consent and unser I 've been accepting of that and have not submitted in any opposition to that can you picture back front of us yep thank you it 's just a small section of eroding that goes through ops through the red zone so guys we don 't have any idea the roads aren 't technically we 'd zone yes thank you my second question sort of centers around the multi criteria assessment it 's no secret that I 'm a week that skeptical about computer modeling and and a few things like that so what assurances Emma I 'll back up Weaver you are able to give different loadings to various criteria in your multicolored motive criteria analysis how do we know that the waiting 's that you are given giving a appropriate I mean some people will suggest that this is a suggestion that you run the multi criteria analysis until you get the result you are can I answer that that was the the allegation that was made this morning and we have to defend that the process that was followed it is an object of human analysis the criteria are ranked based on a comprehensive collaborative team from different disciplines who sit down and look at the saw the slide there that said what are the one of the priorities of the community and there was a good alignment between what the community felt was the most important and the team so it was good alignment there and then you give it some object of waiting it and there is a humanistic element to that so it 's based on a judgment and experience as well as the feedback from the community no way do we run that analysis by changing the waiting 's together any any publishers you decide at all but but if we looked at and I take the the point that the public feedback and the the multi criteria analysis were closed so they were closed for options a and see how how close were they and would would minor tweaking of that actually made option a more yeah when what were you do is run sensitivity around that and we are more than happy to share the actual scores if that was felt useful and I 've not i think i think in response to your point the the scoring is done you know any changes to the scoring could have an influence on the outcome of the results now it 's just a tool and so you know presented that that really given the we 're not basing the recommendation just on the multi criteria assessment because it is a tool and it with the sensitivities that could change it I accept that point NC did come out quite close in terms of what is the best scheme and I think what we 're saying is that a and C are better than B but in terms of the deliverability one consider the risks and we don 't need a tool to to give a scores for that C is potentially has a lower risk of non delivering that time frame than a and I think that that 's when we start to see the separation so we don 't need a tool to tell us that the tool supports an outcome that we you know we 've reformed by working this to ourselves thanks and just lastly then did you actually do some modeling of the potential effect around the hydraulic model forth whole system which we 've been used to sighs the scheme and come up with the material the the scale and magnitude of works required to achieve the benefits we 're looking for so we do rely on hydraulic model and but we also need careful design to support them so we need to as the designs progressively very carefully assess a whole range of risks and do our best to mitigate those risks through the design process look I 'm rip I 'm res are you familiar with that stretch of stable ones road and one side of the road substantially higher than the other or one side of the rubber of the creek how many properties you know if they talked about and we had that submission this morning that was asserting a possibility of increased risk for some properties how many properties would actually be at risk if each rot well there are a number of low-lying properties along Stepan 's road there are a couple of local houses particularly on the true right bank the right side away from their opposite the road drive down there you can see the houses relative to the group can relative to the road two in particular or lower than the rest some of those houses are have been rebuilt built into the earthquakes and have been rebuilt to the new floor level full management areas are much higher than what they used to be so that risk is reduced for floors the problems properties themselves are still at risk and as part of the consultation we went and tried to speak with every resident along opposite the road there amongst Elkins road to get their view on the works and understand their acceptability or otherwise of the proposal and generally those people reported that use that Creek does flood it does flood on their properties up to certain level some close to their houses some not close to their houses depending on the particular property but they are all tended to be very sympathetic and did it to the people of flockton and we 're generally favorable for the scheme to progress so yes there is flood risk the scheme will reduce flood risk with those just like a compliment you guys for a very comprehensive report I think we 've covered all the bases very well and Ally Pauline thank you option a 118 trees last option p be sorry 42 trees lost an option c 70 but there 's a mention of enhancement there so option c which has preferred 28 trees are additional to the B option as far as being lost what is the enhancement so the the enhancement is a landscape architect designed proposals for those sections we gave reference to them in the consultation document so residents had the opportunity to see some of the proposals what it would look like forth in terms of this its visual like I 'm aware they built visual at symantec purchase and these logics yes and we made clear through the drop in sessions where they got more detailed as well so they had the opportunity to understand just what we were proposing I 'll sir _"

    "text": "and the next one is the proposed freedom camping by Lord 2015 do I have a mover of the resolution Andrew Turner seconded Glenn lovingston is there any discussion Andrew I had a question if I may please who are not here for bylaws and it okay really just relates to wear from here clearly we 're going out for a period of public consultation are there any public meetings proposed as a part of that public consultation and if so as a timetable being worked out or how is it expected they would run yes cancel tuna they are two meetings organized I understand one in the new brighton area in one over in a corolla and we do have a timeline for those i don 't have them with me right now but i could get there to you by email for a meeting yeah no that 's fine i was just concerned that there wasn 't any mention of that but yet no pleased to hear that there are public meetings and exactly as i was gonna suggest in the areas which are most likely to be you alright i 'll put the motion oh oh sorry no no it 's fine i just i moved an amendment at the committee it wasn 't supported but just to be consistent I 'd want to move it again here and if that fails so be it but um it 's just about putting something that I think there 's a better suggestion now what would what was your one the amendment was if you recall to this man back to this meeting that under the the statement of proposal I believed that the baile what didn 't go far enough around restricting freedom camping and consulting on it so I moved an amendment that under the statement of proposal that the areas that contained a five-day maximum stay became a some of three days and the areas that are allowed for a maximum of three days stay or three nights day became a maximum one night State it wasn 't supported there I 'd move it again here beside me that 's the better way to go is account so that 's kind of your job okay well I have a seconder for that David East right so um let 's speak to it quickly yeah if you could speak to it yeah I 'm kind of I have to go from memory here look the gist of it is just from the maps you 'll see that the statement proposed has areas that what is effectively four areas on the maps one is where the freedom camping is allowed one is where freedom camping camping strictly isn 't allowed and there 's two variations of restricted freedom camping of which there are proposes a five-day maximum stay and a three-day maximum stay and that can also be determined around whether or not the units are self-contained and so forth I won 't get bogged down on that so much but the rationale around that was that if you look at the areas which allowed for stays a good chunk of that probably eighteen ninety percent of it was actually suburban streets around around the city so probably every councilman sits around this table would have under what we 're consulting on would allow freedom camping outside their I was proposing that this simply changed the maximum number of days from everything that says a five-day maximum become then becomes a three-day maximum and that a three-day maximum then becomes a one-night maximum the reason being quite simply I do not believe what we 're going out and consulting on goes far enough and the intent of this is to find appropriate places for people to camp and I 'll tell you where I think an appropriate place for people to campus and that 's camping grounds not suburban streets and I don 't think that goes far enough and I think it 's very relaxed around allowing freedom camping outside your house which I don 't believe really nice interests of the city so that 's why I 'm moving this it still has a period of grace but it doesn 't go as it 's not as relaxed as what I believe that we are going out and consulting on it 's slightly tighter that 's really oh I don 't_''_270.21 I don 't like to do this but but that 's incorrect because we can and in fact cover by the bylaw which our reserves so I 'm and council property so please you council-owned amends property years yeah so what 's our council owned and managed property is the only areas in which we can at this bylaw replies yeah so we can 't do it for we can 't_''_295.26 say that these are the Bible won 't if you where are we if we look at the maps but of course in my robes that we oh yeah yeah our roads exactly which is council-owned there 's a sec good i 'm talking about so roads and every thats why all the maps that are attached with this no wrote roads are owned by council so you 've got an a maximum of I don 't have the maps aren 't on this one but can you just help me out here for the wider sitting I ever feel it might have been three nights maximum and a lot of the areas around the suburban areas even so it 's different for whether it 's self-contained or non self contained oh yeah self-contained makes me free doesn 't it kingsborough does beans okay it 's a mixture it is a mixture so simplicity 's sake all I 'm just proposing is that everything that the Red maximum of five nights stay it comes a maximum three nights and everything that 's is an exome of three night stay becomes a maximum of one night stay so it strengthens it tightens it because i don 't believe that is tight enough and as i see it i believe the appropriate place for camping really is camping grounds so my desire for this by law is to be actually far more tight around freedom camping and to not really promote it as as freely as what it has been in the past I thought we had advice on this but anyway yeah well obviously we 're going to have to have some questions now because is there more of an opportunity or chance for it to be challenged legally as being too restrictive of illegal activity Judith illegal yeah the Act requires us to take a proportionate approach to deciding on the freedom camping areas and five days probably 10 and clearly took that a little bit more in terms of the rationale but part of it was to do with providing people those who do choose to freedom Kim because you 're not going to get everyone into freedom camping ground or enter camping grounds provide them with a proportionate approach in relation to what the problems and that we can address the question is what counselor costs proposing considered too restrictive on the basis that freedom camping is in fact illegal it could be our the one I think the three days are is only or does relate to where people are camping him self contained vehicles but it 's because the self-contained vehicles have got the three days the three days came because they 're the capacity just always for three days and the five days came up to some extent in association with beings potential of being very much a holiday direct traditional camping area perhaps a little bit more so that was we the five days sort of became becomes relevant because people are often a net basis of the coming and staying outside your house in there Kempin um Andrew so just to follow on from Ali 's question which is very similar to the question I 'm about to ask but I 'll just be a little bit more specific about it in terms of section 11 of the act and in terms in particular of the Thames coromandel case if this amendment were to be caring would that exposes to a greater level of legal risk in terms of people saying that we were been too restrictive than if the amendment wasn 't passed does the amendment this is what the act is also going to tow your legal risk um not necessarily because I think you so the consultation Pierce 's you do have to wear you know to go out with us for consultation as I guess saying that 's your position and if we didn 't get any submissions in debts what would be passed is the bile or there is a risk that someone 's might say that and it 's you 're taken too restrictive approach but given that we are we there are controls in terms of self-contained vehicles only and some areas where it 's the sea where you can camp in a non self contained vehicle but there 's still also areas of our district where there isn 't any controls proposed at all in the more rural areas then I think the difference between how many nights restriction you put is probably not going to put a circus but I think you but it 's about is that a proportionate response to the nuisance that we 've heard about an evidence of complaints and have you had many complaints from residential streets around christchurch i I don 't say this mini but there are the occasional complaint that makes it a Christian that Craig might be better to answer from compliance but we do know I mean when we were doing the research for the for the Bible I mean it 's fairly obvious there every now and again people will complain about people for example camping perhaps associated with the library you know quite often I 'm which free Wi-Fi yeah I 'm associated with a residential dancin it a couple can fully come forward topology areas where we have it numerous complaints and that 's around like you swear people of freedom campus of congregated in large groups close to residential areas Beresford Street 10 surf club being with the main examples of that you but their main domain these sort of kind of associated with a beach environment yeah yeah so what happened that yeah yeah in intermittent complaints and largely realizing from a freedom camper parking at the outside somebody 's house yeah libraries pendleton library an example of that where this you 're making use of the Wi-Fi I wouldn 't say there 's a passion north complaints that they pop up from time to time when we have have people that okay so it 's a whip that we 're being very mindful that our response has to be proportionate yeah yeah okay I 'm clean thank you just looking at the attachment there under just looking in the attachment under 1.3 duration doesn 't seem to be a theme that leaps out from me and reading that it does come up five nights can ask it was that proposed or I kind of an example of duration something that came from respondents themselves or is that a weather for circular we ended up the balance of those nights after consultation so in within the project 10 yrs quite discussion around one day two days three days five days in the feedback we head and was around enabling people to be able to go away for a four-day weekend on the plunger or wherever and being able to stay there so that 's where we came back with the balance of those days fully aware that will go up the consultation and can come back or will be increased all right so Paul yeah we have actually history with actually freedom camping in the central city around premise queer where you do get accumulation of people parking up outside residential properties near a park and it does cause a lot of problems i 'll be very very concerned that if we allowed you know the central city streets to be a place where they can park up for three or four days i 'll mention it strongly supporting young homie I Jamie 's amendment cuz I think we really know that this is a note none allowed on the CBD the CBD is completely Randolph talking central seattle City none that 's city street its father says so in the central city but is the city streets saving we 've had the problem in Central City where they Park in inside of Park little happen a residential areas with there 's a nice park they 'll park up out there and it 'll have the same ok problems as long as you understand at two separate things yep all right we 'll we 'll put the amendment thin so it looks as if there 's a bit of a balance here so let 's vote on it electronically oh that 's equal so it doesn 't move forward stays the same so i 'll put the motion no yes i know it 's a democracy but Yanni I called for I put the motion and I I called for people to speak nobody spoke no okay you you speak to make the consultation so there 's a number of concerns that have been raised but they should be addressed be able to be addressed through that public consultation in terms of addressing those individual concerns and I do think it is really important to recognize that it 's not just about clamping down on freedom camping but is about managing it in a more appropriate way and the fact is that we need tourism in our city and this is actually a very important part of tourism coming into whether it 's a city seem to all the suburbs so I think the Bible is trying to get a balance and I encourage people to make submissions our face still concerned well seed Andrew um yeah I certainly welcome this going out for a run public consultation I 've kept a very keen eye on on this work because it 's gone through we obviously have particular interests on the peninsula around problems that we 've had with freedom camping but clearly there have been problems elsewhere in the city as well I think this is a very pragmatic approach but certainly is a proposal going at the public consultation I 'm very aware that there will be some aspects of this that will be contentious and will provoke submissions and we we certainly look forward to hearing people 's views expressed through those submissions so that what we end up with is the best by law we possibly can that gives us the best way of dealing with this both from a restricting and then abling point of view so certainly very supportive of this going out to public consultation and look forward to hearing the views of the people that I 've got views on it exam i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much the next item on the agenda is the residential land availability and Christchurch City we didn 't give you an opportunity to deal with us that strategy and finance due to time constraints so I 've and i 'm not sure if you want to kind of take us through toward well the key point is that councillors is that the a sufficient supply residential land at door 2028 and this report shows that the council is almost certain no should meet those obligations and meet that target probably a couple of key points to emerge from this report firstly that it is they benefit really of the work that the council did prior to the earthquakes in the areas of southwest and Belfast and doing the area planning work because the money that was put into the infrastructure and the pendant was put under the the provision of land use for housing industry at that time has paid dividends because they 're all that area is now largely unconstrained and similarly for belfast so i think that 's that 's one key message most of the growth will occur in the southwest in the foreseeable future with with others occurring around belt and obviously preston 's but there will be a gradual movement of growth from the southwest to the north over the plan period so most of the growth will occur in those planned areas around pools will Wigram and west halls will over the next five to ten be a bit later on so just a couple of interesting things to come out of out of these figures there is no I mean these figures don 't include the port hills vacant land so that an extra 500 hectares of land on the port hills and some of its subject to headed constraint but not a lot so all in all the council there 's in a very good position as far as land supply goes to meet the current the future housing needs questions Yanni thank you for including the section 224 so that that basically 2633 is the number that have setauket us of Titus inclusive so basically out of the 20,000 sections available I need 2600 I 've got stupid subtitle 2600 but when say only council it that 's quite a number at the the rate of which land has been taken up so and that is likely to be quite constant as subdivisions come through so and I 'm pretty confident that that number of you know titled sections provides a good choice and availability so just in terms of the current sections 22 Falls if it Riggins done so we would have basically about 6,000 so you 've got the 10,500 that 's been resigned there 's 10th out this correct and of that you 've got 5,000 that 's been consent of subject application for subdivision yes so those ones are the ones that could get there is two to four years the knee that 's the next stage so just really trying to understand in terms of people 's choice we don 't know whether that on the market or not but basically they were there 's about five five five thousand that people possibly could be looking at right now absolutely yes they 'd they wouldn 't necessarily want to purchase them of that title but they would be that they 're in the process of being being developed and as a then on what 's called shovel rib really but the well on the way okay so do we know how many a shovel ready well that 's the ones i 'd say that the title did whence they titled you could actually start putting a house on is do we are we looking at what 's happening and so on and why my consumes of land availability and what 's their kind of how many sections are available beer and is that something we could get I think are really interesting I certainly could get those figures I haven 't got them with me but I know anecdotally that Rolleston is in Lincoln have a lot of sections available I look up but I can 't put figures on that but more than happy to provide those things that 'll be quite you thought I 'd see what 's having a mind we can sell on Ivan it 's pretty fair to say that actually yeah often the developer will develop a subdivision and often will sell the land subject to title and that 's they could be my understanding that happens and do we know how many of being sold subject to title no I came and got those figures I 'm sorry no any others clean some point I 'd like to make a couple of comments if I may not not questions to Ivan and a secondary sorry Paul and Jamie so yes i 'll call further speakers to the resolution thank you thank you very much thank you look just just a couple of comments I I feel that we 've answered the land supply question as a council working with what we 're required to do under the loop there 's been an inquiry from the Productivity Commission overland supply I think it 's followed that here in Cantabria hasn 't necessarily follow that in meeting supply that affordability has been addressed so the Productivity Commission undertake squared from time to time over various subjects that has over lens of high what I would like at some point addressed is construction costs that part as it relates to housing is I really think that needs looking into they have increased due to building requirements after the Canterbury experience but still there are some big questions I think we need to look at over supply chains and getting those costs down councils are often challenged over land supply and regulation and we 've seen media conferences to to that effect but you know of this just wanted to make that point today that I hope that will be a piece of work that 's addressed at some point we 're good anyone else I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Perry next item is the will Graham Rohde land options they can 't really focus on pasture Association supplementary report who 's here for that yeah okay Tim and David do we have it we must have a staff member here we 've had oh sorry afternoon I guess we 've had a deputation so I certainly would appreciate the response we 've also just dealt with an item which meant which was a lease upon a lease upon a right of renewal which is lift us several million dollars to shy of where we want to be so do you want to talk about the suggestion that we have a right of renewal on top of the 35-year really so this is really the issue is whether we go a 35-year lace I mean we think it 's in the council 's for a hundred years to develop the land get some tenure repay their funding and from 35 years pair commercial rent rent reviews going forward so it is in our interest i believe to support them I don 't know Andrews got any more comments about the long-term use of the land but essentially this is the last piece of land in the area yeah no I understand that but I mean the question is to put on the right of renewal that 's the question our keys yes well we are limited by leasing practices 35 years is the norm government by the reserve Resource Management Act so does highly irregular so if you have a right of renewal way you caught by out what we 're proposing is they do have an existing license 400 years on the park so we will sync it up with that and make it co-terminus so they 're both exist at the same time we keep their in yours consistent so what does that look like well six years would be the initial Tim and then it would go through to probably yep Tim I thought we had earlier with a cat club i 'm in the am p shower hit over handed his history with this city there are major player with the city they are the RP show as a major giver back to this city and as the marriage between country or rural and City so I mean it 's so important for us eventually right that we as in our best interests to it with them have you talked with with being at sutra about the the 16-19 because I support the 35 Plus that are with it right arm right of renewal yeah because of the history of the Association and that what it gives to our rural and City communities yep now I absolutely agree we haven 't got down to the details yet but there are looming subdivision issues subdivision issues on the main pack which are coming up in six years time so they need to be dealt with I believe at the same time as well and the existing lease have you talked to the association with regards to debt yes okay yep is their feedback with class today they basically just going to have to start working through it so essentially the lease on the existing park around their sales yards needs to be subdivided away from the main title so the less can continue their licenses around the outside us for 100 years so we want to make this new lease coterminous with the existing lease so that it 's or Nothing situation could you do it the other way around I think we do the 35 + 35 year lease with right of renewal and the land that we 're discussing now and when it comes you can sink the new leases into that 35 year agreement yes absolutely meant that would be a positive way for through pain either way it can be coordinated simply the matter of it it 's the outcome you want not you don 't how we get the earth yeah that 's right okay yeah le and the 16 plus 10 that would you say that that doesn 't provide a hell of a lot of confidence i guess or ability for the A&P hint from the other reason all the 35 absolutely yeah i mean the only reason i say we 're limited to 35 years recommendation is present currently some practices we have no issue with a hundred years that I senior foreseeable issues with 100 years it 's just how we break up that turtle tomb so that 's just an idea of this thing alright i 'm paul and then yani we 're not clear when some of obviously seen that with the calf calf issue you know fly watering numbers to move them yeah s0 mechanism where we can do the thief by the lease in this point the first questions is a 35 year lease enough time to give them the confidence to issue develop the land well i would personally think so but they 're looking long-term to you know cement the fillet or give you that would get there whatever they put in back out to get enough of you two yeah and not being a clear but we in turn actually not seeing the future and how you know this land or whatever reason may could put them there still give them confidence to develop the land for the 35 + 35 but there may be some exit polls we may need to have in the for whatever reason health leaders look we haven 't_''_1779.85 discussed it at this stage I think it would be like to include that if they 're going to be building a sort of development here talking about being a conference facility we haven 't reached an agreement on that you know but probably figure something that actually does able to do that obviously 55 years they will probably money back out yeah it would need to be a substantial reason for us to reclaim the land I mention we have an included that you know it sort of down there as you know should they cease to maintain their not-for-profit charitable operating status in a market rent will be payable commencing immediately for the balance of the least tomb so I suppose that 's the council 's protection being the character costing a 70 million dollars to move it so we don 't be caught in that position again it isn 't causing a seaman half-million-dollar we 've locked in the figure at the lower right I understand but it didn 't we didn 't accept that advice yeah um breath yeah just a question on the change from the 5.8 hectares to the 5.1 is that what can we do with that other piece of land well in all honesty it is a long thin piece of land I 'm not sure of their well I guess from a parks or open space perspective it 's only potential use isn 't in open space natural environment revegetation just to buffer the impact of the of the moto and the surrounding environment there 's no active use that I 'm aware of that it could be useful potential linkages and that you know depending on what else develops but yes I 'm sorry yonni I 'll skipped over you is not I 'll just just trying to understand the 35-year place without subdivision so if we went into the subdivision we could do a longer lease than 35 years for any at least longer than 35 years you need is still part of the main title which includes Canterbury cultural park as part of the solution then when you 've got the other subdivisions to do is to just do all that subdivision at the same time absolutely and work out a longer list too yes that 's definitely an option so what 's the timing around doing that I 'll come by sure it could take quite a while it wouldn 't be for the scenes show potentially next year six months maybe but it but it would seem to me that the requirement of the association is to get a longer term security than 35 years to enable I guess the funding of the development day with propose we started to go through a public consultation process for us as well for Elise about six months so that 's the first step after this from providing the gradual ace and if one hundred years is given then they will be on the association to go through the subdivision process um do you think it would be easier if we just sold off the land and section a discussions I don 't believe they 're currently in a position to do that the preference is to lease the land for 35 years develop it and then commercial ring going forward right okay and just in terms of the other use I mean obviously we 've got enough pain or wire which is kind of separate but related yep have we looked at issues like car parking on the other outside of irrya a like area be as being something that may be absolutely yeah like I mean area B could be used to license to the Association for car parking perhaps that comes directly off we 're green road I 'm not sure how many could get in there but that would certainly appease an issue you know in five to ten years time okay so just so I 'm clear though we still don 't have agreement with the Association about preferred option that you 'll recommend it they still are concerned about it they would like a hundred years option B we are limited to recommending option a 35 years but i 'm sure you can a process to try and just collect a result and we sort of kind of indicate an ability to work towards this i mean because it clearly it relates to the subdivision from tims of the timing but whose idea was it to switch the that round the other way so that the two became you know that the two lease arrangements became you know one yeah co 2 minutes as you say is agreement at the end well it 's just about syncing up to date its existing come you know yeah a varying existing lease Jimmy as always yep yes around 26 or the suggestion was a six year lease and in 10 he 's turning at the other around if we give it 35 + right of renewal for those blocks yep and then when you come in six years to look at those others then sync it into the 35 barata renewal for 35 and 30 so the homepage show have certainty of the hundred years but it 's done in a 35 35 dirty yeah for both blocks of land because I mean they 've not going anyway that 's right oh yeah their existing lease on around the saleyards is actually in perpetuity so that his continual rights of renewal for ten years but they are subject to the subdivision process they have to do in six years time that 's sort of confusing but they they have an ongoing least they 're so there 's no issue in that regard I guess what I was trying to find was just a process in the next sort of 12 months year to kind of get everything aligned so that so we 're giving a 35-year least now but what 's the point in doing that if we 're going to go to our subdivision thing and have to come up with a new lease why wait for six years why not try and get it all tidied up in the next 12 months so that 's this certainty footfall that I mean that 's my view if there 's a way of doing that may be it a resolution to give effect to weaken those issues forward if we can we 're kind of I think that we I mean what I think what you 're hearing is that we kind of want to get to a resolution that yep works for everyone yeah Jamie did you have a question or a comment no it 's kind of along those same lines I think we are all saying the same things both the city councillors around the table but also we have a lion goals of City Council a name PS a MP Association we all want the same thing we all recognize the contribution the A&P Show and Association makes staff saying that they would because because I actually you know I actually prefer option to you know I 'm looking at this and I want to give the amt Association Susan they need so have some sympathy around it start saying that it 's effectively policy which is prohibiting them from supporting option two now we have to do a subdivision I 'm just saying it 's a highly irregular however it 's not impossible impossible no you know and that 's probably the best course of action if i can say of becks tops i suppose in there anyway which i can do though gonna try as a safe as they arose does they create a tie my shoe because then don 't you have to do the hundred years I 'm sorry the subdivision first before you would enter into agreement but let 's but that 's your view anyway we would do an agreement subject to public consultation subdivision resource consents for the pros buildings all kinds of things off to the side they still have the subdivision issue with their existing lease which is they know well about so it 's all about package really it 's an all-or-nothing situation for them and I think they 're ready to take it on yeah well that 's that if there is the general feeling of the meeting then can I change it then claim claim move up oh no no you don 't need to move anything of council skander and east agree that it concluded lease negotiations up to a maximum term of a hundred years well it 's effectively option two we just say adopt option two _"

which was adopted fiber the committee azhar a call and would someone like to move that he seconded by jamie is there any discussion are there any question evictions i had a lot of questions that i put through i 'm still waiting to get the answers babe I 'm just wondering if someone can give me the answers to his questions who 's doing the cat club receive is it you Jane oh right sorry we 're up to the we 're absolutely cuz reserved relocation of crash each cat clubbin crashes greyhounds yeah he has a couple questions rock have you seen these questions no haven 't seen the question okay um well these were submitted yeah a few days ago so um right okay go through though excuse me can I just interrupt for one second because I 'm just a little bit concerned about the item on the agenda I was searching for the key to kind of put this on the record keep museum beautiful is funded yes by coca-cola and by a couple of other organizations but the reason that they have accepted money for British american tobacco is to assist with the cigarette butt campaign funding only they say they 're reliant obviously on any funding we can get to deal with serious environmental problems like cigarette butt disposal for that reason we 've made a considered decision to accept funding from British American Tobacco New Zealand to assist our anti-litter education programs we recognize british american tobacco awareness of the environment vera mental impact of its products alone everything else and its contribution to mitigating net impact keep newzealand Beautiful 's acceptance of this funding and no way endorses all supports smoking or the tobacco industry the British American Tobacco receives no public endorsement recognition or promotion from Keith New Zealand beautiful as a result of funding this program so it 's specifically targeted only to the cigarette butt campaign so I just wanted to kind of put that on the record it doesn 't change anything but I just wouldn 't were saying that they were funding keep New Zealand beautiful for its campaign it 's not it 's dealing with the problem that it its own industry creates one of the very small parts of the problems that they create obviously they create a far bigger amount of problems to human health but anyway so cigarette butts are the worst thing to pick up on a on a on a beach cleaning campaign especially if they 've been made which by the environment that they 're only anyway so questions for the survey i thing out so i wasn 't aware that no that 's like I race them with the with Colleen and Michael so the first return to the haircut club in greyhound check remain approximately how many houses can be built and the proposed residential development the if it was to remain in the area around the about the 400 meter radius there probably wouldn 't be any certainly worth that going through a very steep resource consent Adnan complain resource consent so what could be they could it would be non noise sensitive in activities like allowed to go there the second one was it is it possible to go map of the current zoning in the prophet proposed zoning with the car club relocated so I didn 't possibly get and met with the current zoning and what the proposed zoning wants to cut clubs relocated so you can understand the difference in Simon I 'm sorry that just sits here you see trying to get and I just try to understand it once the car clubs are relocated yeah obviously some zoning that 's right Eileen that happen yes so I 'm just trying understand if we don 't agree to relocate the car club what the zoning will be well that would remain to be seen there is the option there is an option here in the report that says that it could go to a business zone if the go can 't club remain but i think that would if the club remained it would require a another think set of investigators as to what those options were it now the report says that a business zoning or industrial zoning is one one that would make the most economic use of the site of that particular piece of land so I think realistically that would be the choice in an urban environment that if the go kart club remained it 'd be more than likely that the council or they 're here independent hearings panel where if it went through that direction would consider at some sort of industrial zoning but there are planning issues around that there are issues with the regional policy statement and the loop because that identifies the areas of Greenfield residential priority area so there there 's a that would be one impediment the other is some quite careful planning to ensure that such a zone would be integrated into what is essentially a surrounding residential area and it 's a different traffic environment that would be created different no it would need to be carefully planned thought throw but it 's certainly conceivable and that 's what would imagine that type of zone of young place every go kart club we made kristin three was I 'd like to propose an amendment that the cost of as a large pros and movement at the cost of relocating and making good the reserve is fully funded by a development agreement with the property owners her bid it fitting from the increased value of their land can you please advise the appropriate resolutions to give a fig to this no Brooke and Yanni that is not an appropriate question to ask it a meeting well I erased it no no no I told you how to raise questions and if you 've got an amendment that you want to move then read the amendment out and we 'll take it as an amendment well um so when Jamie did has development contributions phone he had advice from staff as to the wedding he was the Chiricahua t technical you you you were the strategy and finance committee meeting yani appropriate to us star for advices to the wording to give a thick to a suggested amendment okay phase 1 i 'm just off the caf if that 's what you 'd like well you know you do some work on it and and then we 'll come back an approximate estimation of the change in the value of the land of the car club is relocated that enables the rural land to be developed as residential so what 's the uplift and property value if the car comes relocated well you 're talking about the land surrounding the cat club yeah that 's not rural that 's exact it 's actually residential at the moment and the city plan okay so if it 's developed as as has been proposed what so you 're saying there 's no change in the value of the land of the cut cops--they or not well that 's a question I think for the real estate industry the pending I mean it really depends on a density of residential development as to what the block value might be and also it depends on the type of industry that would go there industrial land teens may have a high value the residence when as a matters a general observation that we haven 't asked anyone to look at those respective values and what what the deli what the change in land daddy maybe a city would really depend on the type of an industrial zone that went there and to make a comparison I really can 't comment in terms of the value up life for the if we make the decision to relocate the car club that enables a huge amount of I think it 's up to 670 houses to be developed on land it currently can 't develop anyhow yes is so but they 're not all owned by one person and it 's not a single developer there that 's what makes this a very complex decision so you know I appreciate the point that you 're trying to make but you 've made your point and I think we 'll move on so who would there was somebody over here Phil and Pauline and Paul Ivan I just want to ask you about the impact of relocating the cat club to another area quite as option to it doesn 't that sort of lead to the potential for just transferring the issues like a noise problem and how in fact can we mitigate that yes there have been 't think it 's a secret or the food side is really but it 's a hole on the ground out of the at maclean 's island and the the noise assessments and the other impact assessments have suggested that it 's worth pursuing now clearly has to go through a resource consent process so inappropriately to preempt any decisions made by Commissioner on that but yeah we don 't believe it 's transferring like-for-like intuitively fix i think the environment which is going into would be somewhat more receptive than the current one you know assuming the current one as a residential environment get my drift on there but yeah we quite a long time back the council undertook an assessment of a number of options and there were one at probably two or three which emerged as being more environment or less environmentally sensitive to hosting this particular facility there in the current location at the current location is surrounded by housing um Pauline and then Paul if it was going to be my question to that there there is no definite relocation place yet you 've answered a it 's not I 'm consent is that subject to a continuous right yep um the lead the reserve learn that it 's located on now is it contaminated yes it 's an old landfill so if so that to be turned back into a reserve or for any other use how much do you think that would cost what would it involve and who would be paying for that we 've had a look at possible uses for it it would be developed the best way for us to develop it will be along the similar lines to bexley Park which is an old landfill as well so not not not intensive sports field development or anything like that thinking along the lines of bike tracks and walking and that sort of thing it would it would depend on the availability of capping material and things like that but but it 's likely to be be in excess of a million dollars but it 's not a priority for us it would come from it would have to be budgeted for in the long-term plan and being a PSA there would be an additional cost over above that amount here to cancel yes and that 's what I think we indicated that it was it 's not funded at all and the ten year and would be put up as a proposal in future LTPS and to pick up yannis point can a development contribution be required for for thus relocation yes it can it 's we had legal opinion a number of years back in development contributions can be used for for this purpose is because it frees up the reserve for a further use said that the entire cost could be met both for the remediation and for the mood removal correct that 's that 's the advice that we don 't use thank you well just under three point one the planning context and a particular three point one point one the land between a would tear a road and holds a junction road has been identified as a growth as a potential urban growth area since 1995 as part of the balls were grim expansion area so if that was known as a growth years I think the lease was before well before this and in a had an automatic right of renewal through it was it was a came originally from a borough county and it had a term plus and automatic renewal calls in it so we had no choice and on top of it we did explore this at the strategy and Finance similar question but on top of that I 'm innocent I watering some to move that up and the greyhound Club half a million dollars could be saved by this legally greyhound club where it is and removing the cap is that being considered it has in that is always an option however the land that the greyhounds are sitting on is as they described at the Rick and work on board is quite unusable as large sink holes that started to appear in there as well so it comes a health and safety issue for them but for that term it further lessee of a responsible fixing icing hawks I think we 'd have to check with what our obligations were as the landowner the in the responsibilities indeed i 'm not sure if it covers landfills would be good to you right are there any other questions okay well we 'll just put up yannis amendment so that 's just an additional resolution and I just ask that it gets voted on first as its to how this is funded which would obviously impact on my vote for the 10.1 if it 's possible didn 't but you 've already said that this can be funded through development levy so a development contribution so what 's the difference with a development agreement that the development libby 's will be spread across that whole catchment in terms of the reserve contribution so it won 't just be the surrounding land owners all right whereas a private developer agreement would be tied to those particular wouldn 't this require a whole change in our whole DC policy which we just adopted in terms of how those DC 's are spread we still worth worth Greenfield subdivisions we still from time to time do private developer agreements in terms of the stretch of the de putting in with all no it would make it complex so and so if 10.2 were not carried then you would do it as a development levy at development contribution without each each each property would be as per normal but use these you don 't need a resolution to do that no is the is the subdivisions comment yeah the development contributions collected as the subdivisions come in right so so this should really read a private developer agreement shutter or is that what you would understand to be different from a development contribution that 's my own ears they 're two totally different things so can we change that to private developer agreement yes because then then you understand this domain a PDA sure it does everyone here understand what the difference is you like to know how many property owners there are because unless you impact on a decision because if there 's like 20 property owners it 's going to be really don 't go to get a good the interesting thing is is that when you touch it to the uplift and value that actually applies to the rest not easy but anyway are you seeking going out okay so around the difficulty of enforcing what 's proposed in the amendment in 10.2 given the number of property owners just how that would work and then my second question is the the number of properties or the area which would be subject to the development contributions under 10.1 versus the area or number of properties that would be contributing in 10.2 just to kind of get a picture of what the difference between the two would be in terms of how it would work and secondly who would be expected to contribute or how wide an area that contribution would go that the respective the first question one of the challenges when we got fragmented land is for a single developer to get contracts with all the land owners now a developer may choose to do a PDA on money speculating here but on the on the basis that such agreements could be reached but there will be a huge risk for that developer it 's it is an issue we 've got in Greenfield areas around you know you need to be bought into such an agreement I mean the developers that do a PDA with us first of all there 's going to be ones that we found secondly they need to be able to be sure they 're going to secure all the land so that creates quite a bit of uncertainty and and that 's probably the thing we 're trying to avoid here is to try and create a certain environment for everybody all right so um well hang on do we need a seconder for the amendment I 'm sorry the secretary question was around the the area that would be covered I mean obviously if it was the developer agreement that would just relate to this particular these particular parcels of land yes the development contributions as in 10.1 what area would they be over like how wide would they spread the catchment it 's a sigmoid quite enough it could be a citywide catchment for that particular DC I 'd have to check there yeah so so there would be anything happening some of some of the infrastructure is based on the reserve ones yeah no secret city or city wide and I think that could be a citywide catchment area so it could in fact then be spread wider than the area where they would be excessively been updated in value yeah currently there 's probably only about six or so landowners around it 's not sure there 's none that the trouble is that that the landowners concerned antal operating as a single block but the development is a single development you know so that our individual owners within it and some of them can 't proceed unless the rest of the developments going to proceed because the money doesn 't stack up you know if you 're going to put on roads if you 're going to put on the infrastructure then you actually need to know that these X number of houses going on so you might actually want to apply the cost to a small group but they won 't be able to build unless the rest is able to build so it 's not an uplifting value it 's actually an uplift and capacity to the amendment on your own amendment alright it just so just declare doing here I got a second before of relocation there isn 't a sequined us so it fails for want of a second oh okay alright so so we 'll move to the resolution I 'll put the resolution it 's not about yeah I 'd like to think and debate it I just want to say that this has gone through a process whereby all of the groups came into the wreckage Macomb Community Board SAT around and talked through the issues a very good process and then the wrecker Macomb Community Board had time to reflect and admit the next day or so and actually worked with the staff to find a means to get to these resolutions so we have a staff recommendation we have a board consideration and we have a committee recommendation all basically saying the same thing and they are based on achieving certainty you 'll recall when this report came to us first of all and was withdrawn and for much more community input the suggestion was that the cost of million which was pretty scary and so the concept that is before us aims to lock in numbers and lock in a timeframe this has been going on for a really long period of time and why anybody would ever sign a 66 year lease hmm defies logic but this is obviously one of the problems when you do sign a 66 year lease and so we are left with a problem where we have a very rapidly developing area that wants to be able to develop and residential as supposed to be developing and residential we either have to make the call that it can and hence the timeline on the car club or we have to look at rezoning so the aim of this is to achieve financial certainty and timing certainty and achieve an outcome that everybody can live with in this area of town where there are a lot of competing interests and very interested parties and the development of this hence they 're only giving the a short window to say yes we want to relocate or no we don 't and then working with possible and if they do not agree by that period of time obviously we look to rezoning we have to look to rezone in that area so this gives us a amount of money that is already in the long-term plan and is funded by development contributions and it gets us certainty about the way forward and it was basically well it was agreed by its most of what the staff said amended slightly by the rec sir and welcome community board and then adopted by the strategy and Finance Committee so it 's had quite a thorough process and over a period of time very good yanny it just wouldn 't want to be clear on on this that certainly I think the entire cost of the three locations going to be made through development contributions and it 's certainly not going to be met through the local area the people that are gaining the biggest benefit won 't actually be funding the cost of the relocation that will be sitting wide it won 't include the central city because there 's a central city rebate so basically developers the north will be paying for the cost of relocating this but i also think they will be there is a rights impact of point one percent which is ancient and here and also an impact on our net debt ratio um I originally supported the idea that we would relocate the car club but not the Greyhounds unfortunately in the time that spruce proceeded to pass the attempts to relocate have not been fruitful or successful and the costs have increased dramatically and so I 'm very skeptical that they will find an alternative site for the car club and the short to medium term but if it could be found then I think it 's entirely appropriate that the people who are going to benefit from the relocation of it fund that costs directly I can 't see why we 're charging developers and other parts of the city that want to intensify existing brownfield sites with existing infrastructure the cost of relocating these activities so I 'm disappointed that the amendment wasn 't seconded and it wasn 't pot I can 't support us spending more money a direct value and benefit to property owners that falls on the rest of the city to get more residential housing in this area I just don 't think it 's realistic I think we need to start having a really good thing about how we 're funding the infrastructure associated with the rezoning of land and why it 's fair to charge people across the entire city to benefit a few so i won 't support this i cannot justify the cost either associated with relocating the car club and also that i can 't see the need for even relocating the greyhounds which actually don 't need to be relocated in terms of their enabling the residential activity to occur so i don 't know why we would be paying for that ab fill and also includes a question just of clarification well we 're debating that I know what we are just clarification realm agreeing to the following and we haven 't got anything after that fits all but yes we hear that 's the balance of the recommendation that 's and the so if you want the balance that is not following okay yep but that 's fine i 'm i 'm actually going to support the recommendation i think what 's important is in fact we we have a clear clear and fear process around their development contributions policy and we stick with us as Vicki indicator this is dragged on for years and in what it does need a resolution and I think staff I 'm sure staff will look carefully at you know the future relocation position and consider that very carefully so I 'm sitting under to support the recommendation clean PQ although I have some sympathy for yannis position there my information latent I 've just received it from one of the members of the hood is that because I asked this question long-term the rates take from development near will overtake any price to pay now so I 'm heavy electric guide provides more housing the income for the city will actually overtaking any costs if there is a burden that does that that will transpire on to other parts of the city that 's short term and the long of the city I 'm Jimmy as a local councillor I fully support at least the recommendation because I pass through all the process especially this issue my understanding has been exists for popular 20 years and also the last monster I remember the economy to request a local community board to review this issue and try to recommend to the council in any net hangers who all the passes the chemical member cami poorly organized the kind of meeting to integrate all the different the parties different good I have a further info oh the discussions on this kind of knowledge as one group to goods is 0 the group gathers resolution because why the one key issue is a council already you know signed at least kind of the lease agreement with the purchase car club as well as the gray home then also expiry date one is aware be in 2050 for the other will be 2047 but this is the council responsibility also if we choose some other option rather nice one like the vehicle he mentioned earlier this kind of play with certainty no certainty for all other people and also based on the staff that reply the earlier age race or a new subdivision council get lost the vitamin contribution you can compensate you know to meet all those relocation as well as the new infrastructure facilities needs but we got your minimal win still need be consider this uncertainty the situation may be in McAlester issue more getting worse in they don 't public place at this view there will be the paper again so that 's why i support the committee recommendation thank you very good all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no record jana johansson opposed thank you very much now we move on to the lighting exemplar project lindenwood village street environment but someone like to move this recommendation cool lonsdale seconded yani there any discussion or put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed i know there 's carried the long walk _"

    "text": "Oh Oh why me why don 't we quickly took the attitude reports and everything so this Peter so some rooms joseon 's and now Josh races and those two reports anyway so the issue then they report on the pops of dividing page 63 yeah Melanie hooker or notice emotion three paths for some of the way that it would expose all in the world and particularly lot of highlights 9k rose the old homemade apology library which there is considerable demand for which has been there 's been some preliminary talked with community groups and by Melanie and we are still waiting to hear back from staff and we we really came to make sure that isn 't lost for community use and you know various things of rumors floating around about what might be the intention for that land but we don 't have anything concrete and it has been some time since we 've heard and we know that there is can that it will be used and in that same report and the at the Board and requested that staff provides us on page 64 regarding funding organizations that except tobacco industry sponsorship and this is because we have learned Helene mountain has learned for us that keep New Zealand beautiful which is the parent organization for Pete Christchurch beautiful receives ninety-seven percent of its funding from a combination of coca-cola and British American Tobacco half of that funding 160 thousand dollars last year came from British American Tobacco and this concerns the board greatly and so we would like to know if there is a council policy regarding funding organizations that except tobacco industry sponsorship and on the final report and just wanted to highlight ongoing concerns around the rally resin term which is a key local project and their new building which has been funded by council and community board and needing that needing assistance through the resource consent process and finally another appearance of on page 66 of the cass street waist-deep oh i hope that the whole council shares our concerns about the jeopardize ation of the Signet master plan and understands that the whole cinema business community is very mentally opposed to the disposal facility to be run by enviro and traffic and noise and consent from the council on signage concealed sorry and I don 't think there 's anything else that needs raising okay so i 'll put that motion so I 'm just googling on liners they talk about corporate social responsibility goals and resources and their sponsorship so i 'll have to look it up I 'm just gonna put the motion on there all right I I know we 've talked about difficult and this one previously the council but you 've just highlighted tobacco but was it any other concern about other sorts of sponsorship or just coca-cola which is the other forty seven percent of vehicle pretending ok so I just wonder whether in terms you notice the motion you actually ask you spoke a bit wider than just tobacco which is kind of like an no no we are specifically about tobacco the council wants to inquire further than that it 's up to the council but it was the board to maintenance right but the reason for the tobacco as well well well pretty obvious tobacco companies around the world fund social responsibility for cleaning up the litter but we know that that I mean my viewers that 's just PR we I don 't think I need to convince the council about the appeals to no no it 's the harm caused by the by the substance this was the policy we 've had smoke-free environments legislation since 1989 I don 't think we need to pursue that further I just don 't want to go back to the first one the ask Carol really to around the accessible parking just no no no no well we 're not which one are you doing we 're doing that we 're doing the other two reports just clearing them away and then we 'll go right to the welcome back to the partay ya know if you want comments or debate on this whether we just requesting council policy there 's only a question is by believing on the community board raised in a shoe they 're getting feedback from status I can and I 'm personally very interested and whether keep New Zealand beautiful does it 's sponsored by really we can we can pursue that separately because I presume that we have a bit to do with it so hmm alright so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried and now we 'll move back to the 19th of june report and the the minister notice motion which addresses the idea of that we nor development proposals put forward that just like legal considerations is a box that has to be checked and commented on that we should include in those considerations cultural and other issues and disability access and other issues whenever we consider a developmental proposal the reason for that is is that i have twice moved a two resolutions on to to this council 12 years ago two and a half years ago one a year ago that was endorsed by the council here and unanimously both of them and they have been lost in the system and that was that the council doesn 't partner promote or invest in organizations that are housed in buildings that are not accessible for disability people with disability by the previous council once and is just completely gone in the system but as well as that when we were considering the buck and park issue and we considered it seriously and all the board members went to meetings at the park when we considered that issue and it was before our board the fact that the Signum school the historic signal school had donated add effects to signal to back in park was not a report and we were not aware of it when we discussed the future of back and park the staff had that knowledge and it was going to be presented at a later report but when we were to decide on the future of back in park we didn 't know about the artifacts fool would have done the rest of us didn 't and that 's a very serious thing that we 're considering development issues without talking about disability access and cultural history and artifacts and I think they should be boxers when we considered development issues for the staff to comment on the second thing is is that Helene and I ward which would have been humorous if it wasn 't so serious because there was hardly a park in our ward which complied with anything it 's the only plaques that complied and we 're a very good parks were the ones accessible car parks outside new world innocent Matins the risk of the accessible k-pax almost to the last one we 're not accessible or were in the wrong place or were badly marked or one car park that was accessible was outside was in front of a curb and the next door marked car park an ordinary car plaque was in front of a slope with someone could have had access and we 've now asking for a database of accessible car parking spaces and the sprayed and here kat ward that is available to the public so we 'd like to know about that what their issue as well but either also just like to say that those two resolutions that were endorsed by this council that were very serious resolutions about disability access and the ability for people to be employed who are disabled and was never to be seen again I would like this council to revisit that issue because we would not allow ourselves to partner in beeston or donate to organizations that discriminated against women or discriminated against people who were not parking at we would not allow it but we do allow ourselves the council to invest in organizations that cannot employ disabled people and cannot provide services to disabled people because they do not comply with for 121 thank you all right Caroline peps if you could respond to the initial thank you and I appreciate the mission and concerns that you raised I 'm not sure when you say it 's got lost in the system what that means but certainly with and we just focus on development proposals what we can do with info council which means transition and as we can add these as aspects that need to be completed in our reports so I 'm happy to look at all of those and see how we can leave we have no idea where it is and rain it 's just it you know like week and we and the resolutions tracker we don 't know where they 've gone so we really if we had ongoing communication about where things were at that would help just go on I thought I don 't know it solution tracker yeah what I 'm suggesting is that info Council is a better way of managing that so that you will be able to make sure that we include that in our reports so i won 't just be reflected and just development proposals but more broadly pixel Tim and one of the things with regards to the car parking and Carolyn you highlighted that and brought it to our attention was at the eddington when they redid the car park there they didn 't make it a priority he will repaint the disabled car parks that they had they had to lay deleted one yep so I mean I think thought a council in some way shape or form rather than had businesses usual to make it a priority to trust chase up those resource consents where those organizations in those areas are required to supply an amount of disabled numbers are correct and they are up to standard up Carolyn would you ever comment on that we understand that the star under a great deal of pressure the initial idea was that we could have an order to the disabled car parks citywide we do understand that staff are under serious pressure when we did our own order to the disabled car parks that was about nine months ago is still waiting for the report but we understand why the reporters delayed but we would like enforcement to be checking on car parks in areas where their concrete 's gone down again and their car packs are all marked out and ones deleted deleted just gone and we would like eventually when the city 's back on its feet and has a little bit of spare money for disabled car packs to be a priority and for access to disabled car packs to be listed somewhere so that people could find them yep um just thinking with regards to that one of the teams it goes out throughout our city as the the parking enforcement team and if we all those parts etc that are required to have disabled car parks that I mean if we 're going to travel the city net team does and they do a fantastic job I 'm they were able to follow those up and just check on and if there wasn 't a show then they could relay the very resource consents because you are absolutely right our staff work incredibly hard but if we 've got team out there I know it 's adding to a job but hips just thinking outside the box you 're the ward boundaries may change too so I think an area you know citywide description with you know sort of areas you know identified but by but would be would be extremely helpful but I think it would be helpful generally to have that information available i think a lot more of what we 're going to be doing is going to be online and people will have apps on their phones and they 'll be able to identify and the future not only will there be able to identify where the different parks are are actually free at the time I mean the technology is moving very very quickly and snaps in solve has been one of our most successful sort of online releases to date so yeah yani thank you for the word you doing in this space so I 'm just not sure if you 're talking about public disability car park private s ability car parks oh it 's probably a combination it 's combination because he 's requirement to have a disabled car pack for up to 50 and then 50 plus 12 car packs disabled car packs is that that 's just a requirement so it 's a city count it 's the oats local government at the City Council it 's private we we did an audit of all the disabled compacts now board that we could find ok so just I guess the question for the chief executive as a um have we talked to skirt about the work that they are doing I know an hour board with head skip put in new parking restrictions and so obviously just having some sensitivity around disability car parks in terms of the monitoring and enforcement of resource consents because there can be captured in the M vote council work or is that a separate works during that we need to look at so so anti councils really just about our reporting the information we provide to you so what you 're asking for such as I think there 's a piece of work that 's separate to them is there any work program looking at because this is something comes up around breezes consent condition is not currently program specifically around it okay I just wonder if that 's useful when it if we can get some information back if that 's kind of the gist of the consumer happens and in relation to existing scared we 're well no I 'm is to worship the skirt one is around public road space so we 've got new parking restrictions or going in it just to make sure there 's no loss of disability car parks or there 's a system of replacing them but that the other issue is the resource consent conditions that require that disability gap that there 's no monitoring of that so having a system and this is song has been raised around our resource conceding we 've got a lot of conditions a lot of requirements but who is actually monitoring them and how does the community know that those conditions are being met without doing the client I salutes detective work himself so it would be good to have a better system where we could actually be proactive in that space so I guess that we need to prioritize that against all the other things that we need to measure as well but we can look at how that puts anything at all I just wanted to note in the staff note which wasn 't and wasn 't information that was provided to the board at the time it would cost about five thousand five hundred dollars for a citywide database of accessible parks and you know Alex would no idea what I which is frayed in here to get it don 't wave it and I 'm sorry it was for the spread and here 's get bored sorry um would be great if the council would support the development of their I don 't support a city aboard varsity white only needs to be it needs to be ward wide and it needs to it needs to be captured and it may not be something that can be captured instantly but we should be able to capture all of ours to start with and and then I would imagine it would be relatively simple to literally count them and the supermarkets which would be the next obvious one and then the third group would be the that the developments that so see ated with shops that have parking spaces where they don 't actually have a you know more or a supermarket so I don 't think it would be very difficult but could be just done over time I mean we 're generally monitoring in those areas yeah um it just seems to me that there 's an opportunity for one more board what area to pioneer this this whole whole accessible parking database and the like I don 't agree with the staff comment that in fact know the standards aren 't being met and in the cost is for the ward is five and a half thousand dollars so I 'm just really checking with the chief executive all pretzel the board surely can we find that money so in fact this databases done well let 's see if we can get the public information first you know the information that we hold if we could if we could identify that I mean I I find it hard to believe that five and a half thousand dollars would be an impossible burden it will hurdle to cross in terms of farm you getting the information by either I had another question relation to the who no library to and its to the chief executive around given that in fact the board members had to seek that out would it be possible for a list of facilities and council land which was no longer needed by counsel in this example the hoone a library to be made available to the community boards when it that when those facilities or pieces of land pertain to the area so I 'm sure it 's fine on what usually happens is that it is the information is circulated with a question around the other things within the council that could be useful before we go out and consultant eyes and that 's good and I 'm just wanting to ensure that list goes to the ward managers and the board advisors and the boards too well the boards should be included as with many things where you know we said we say there 's a lot at early in the process so we know that there is an intention to go through that disposal process that one of the issues around the disability access I remember when I was a member of parliament I had a staff member who had a particular disability and the number of organizations including organizations that represented people with disabilities who were on second floors and accessible by loves so you think the council should just stop funding them because they can 't get I think we can achieve accommodation I think we should treat it as any other discrimination if it was women if wouldn 't even have to know but they did make meeting rooms available don 't like they moved out you know that I mean the fact that their offices aren 't disabled accessible you know ah Leanne my idea was that the cat that my understanding of this process would have been that policy would have come back to me with a proposal or come back to their counsel with a proposal of implementation and it would have been five years notice you know that if you want to be in receipt of donations or partnership with the council you will be in an extensible building and five years notice I didn 't imagine it was going to be tomorrow I just thought we should be going along the track that disabled people have the same rights as everyone else yeah no I agree I agree and disabled people don 't_''_1335.25 all fit into one category that they don 't not all buildings have hearing loops and them not all of them have you know different things so but you 're saying that the criteria against which we should measure and that big yeah all right I think a yeah I think it does need it but but of work in terms of just getting it absolutely right I 'm quite shocked that you weren 't given information about the history of the park before you made a decision I think that 's these things fall through the loop what we 'd like is to fix it so there was a box you know we 're not critical of staff with their pushed no no I had what were you like as a box i doing I understand that they were in an effort to make report shorter some information has been dropped out there was assumption that providing the information slowed it down but what we 've learned since I here is that that 's actually not what slowed it down at all providing the information to members isn 't isn 't the thing that makes reports take six weeks nine all right so I 'm mover in the Second Earth or anthem I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that can we change that to accessible car parking data set 444 crush each city can we yeah Sleiman beyond the bomb beyond the board because I mean the ward boundaries may change so I think so Tim Phil want to ensure that in fact we are able to do that and just seemed to me that there was potential for this database to be started in the Spuyten Heathcott were building on the interest of people like Carolyn and Helene and that we shouldn 't lose that as a way press include that concept and the recommendation and yeah I think that I mean I 'd rather start from the information that we have which is all the publicly available disabled pack so I 'd rather I rather than start with a ward and have to build up all of the additional information before you start on the rest yeah I thought because we 're in an organization of records and whenever you go for a resource consent anyone that has required a disabled car park we cut through the resource consent process so we shouldn 't only just have actually pretty well have it right across the board so that 's what the entities that they would build it up yeah but concrete yeah I 'm yawning teleporting separate out the tutors texturing publicly pop disability parks and public spaces in and then in private off-road spaces and I think you know obviously the cells like something would be great to get the students from the University of do or something I am worried that I mean the cost will be massive to go through every resource consent and find out where the disability carfax are and then upload their information to some sort of database so it is quite a big project but I think there are community mapping exercises that could actually make it more affordable and actually get progress with them certain certain areas but I mean yeah I guess we 'll get a report that this is asking for investigation about how we can best achieve it yep and I 'm pulling and then who was your just Andrew we talked about compliance as well as I didn 't way so this is only using two different issue here compliance there 's another one I wouldn 't I said a separate activity or a secret recommendation or did you want to build it in what in one respect we 're saying that this is just the variable power packs in our ward and non-compliant and we would like that addressed and we 've asked the parking people to address that six months ago eight months ago 990 that this one is saying just like the universe information here we should put this on the net so that people in the city knowing where they can pass oh yeah Andrew then Paul thank you and yea I support this and I 'm particularly happy with the change to make this cover the whole of the City Council territorial area it might seem pedantic but just for the sake of certainty in the resolution can we drop the word city so that it just says accessible car parking spaces in Christchurch yeah so that it 's clear that it 's the whole territory Alerian not just the city area yeah that 's true right Paul just follow countable car parks in central city and my previous role they did it in a day we break it in grids and you give a maps and it is actually considerably cheaper them and tying up ourselves time to do it java p students would do it yeah yep all right so um alright i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now it 's still clear water on Thomas kindred moving and second being that the report be received I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye in case they know that 's carriage that 's all good thank you and dusted thank you very much and now we move on to _"

what fun is we get from it the strips in terms of ease in traffic Gyptian a nap after it sports while I 'm is not right hand reasons as I different agencies actually look at a really good solution to

thinking along the lines of every say diluting the trend compact or grinded street by looking at cheering the light between hills road and also coming off booth street term addressing that made us so what Bill Murray 's we do have condition any sort of issue sooner rather than later in a small cone from my library eat us no wrinkle because I think a lot of assumptions made you know actually a few copies of the VSA of what I very District Council when I say thank you very much of offering to pay for here but but they 'll pass is affected by the incoming tracker as well as flvs Belfast gets hooked up up up negro if we 're going to give if we 're gonna hear bus services that actually work as efficiently and effectively then for our main pass rates and to see in this boyfriend in college I would if we look at the northern arterial the Nashville the majority has ever used in all the materials will be from the way not from crushes itself as a each says carbon 18 will not become a more Pro XML free of those right but we still have a problem where it has I go again when we look at the Motley and we 're looking at around 47 thousand cars heading in the drug on daily basis and currently we 're sitting around 20,000 a huge huge jump so you something this be done by this shoe concerns about what happens at the hanford rodents Brian section hey this is why the border saying we can 't look it right over these little bit either option that actually gets the castle wheeler need to go so I understand is something find out what came into the city deeper us agreement in the office to see the very building has guarded s the reason why the couch metro and not due to the recent about we need right in coaching business going to imagine actually thin these people through the city actually is it can 't fly through an RPG sit around at cranford industry area we have shown in what is that suggests that what happened to me is still the same pair faith and that my better just doesn 't center and ring true and so we need to look at options to make sure that it has do not be interested so it 's so moving to continue my point there 's where it 's coming from so that at the moment the engineers plan is to bring all of the credit that comes from the northern arterial impossibly Martians right the cross and down cranford so if we can use that 's one route that leads me to other choices available as well to reduce the amount on cranford and it also gives choice on where you into the city so you don 't have to all go down through transit and on to durham you could take friend Fernando tooth barbados or you could take Russians and in down hills wouldn 't reduce said oh my heck Donnelly cranford would you want what have you were do do pulling did you want to specify those or you hear me to leave this time heavily laughing like this a lot for granted downstream effects and litigation that 's the one of those concerns as well somehow fancier and I had just seen what happens at craps readers pins wrote theorists options they need to be looking at seriously the nation doesn 't put 40 sitting person has a day on to the decision if needs be coming soon at some summer you know we 're not ready engineer so we don 't have all the answers we 've got ideas doesn 't mean otherwise but something needs to be done because we are looking for figures look at the track condition today it just doesn 't stick up my fingers on Porter 's bigger problems for the horrible cars moving up north karachi asian and we 've only have the development going out of egis us as well Fire Nation and you 'll see okay so we 're gonna move in just want to see look at the amount again come on intimate with people Marcus Dupree the previous rule we dispense with the hot office and where and what can I just ask you to just following the types of motion that you feel towards wheeler consideration to it if every that you would see potential for Cutie board members to work work the instructor transfer environment committee to actually examine the very downstream effects the grass before which exactly a way forward to solve the issues that you 've understand without a special in terms of the traffic impacting on the city it 's a little more about when we did a bit it 's going to be because we never see that how many of us from here your experience um the other thing two of the mic that I thought you might want to talk about this much spoken about the improving the bus routes and traffic as well but you know you 're still putting vehicles onto a road road that you can 't widen especially with paranoia road you 've got cyclists as well I freight needs to be looked at lines so that we can actually use our roads were safely with the cycles on there as well it 's only universe it 's not just about improving public transport in the form of buses which is why rail was put up and putting wigs number i agree i guess the five companies look at certain perishing more more chasm ways of writing dinnerwire contrary sources which is obviously having one person such as a private passing years another vehicle ama on road which will begin our league has a bigger office and are you talking about existing lines existing rail lines trajan you 're either just missing some we were we like I run through the happy new year Ian yeah yeah so they just invited 10 Toledo me together Brazil come to the board that we didn 't wanna lock the other except of course and resume their forbidden on a lot of down and resilient cases option to yourself or some type of session push this back onto the Unisa Gina and strategy last month and obviously what the railcar program back in your dinner and it 's never been taken off the agenda rail was looked at as part of the temporary solution to the pressure points and from a cost-effective basis that just didn 't stack up but whether whether it makes the critical step up on a long-term basis you know rolling stock on a trampoline it 's useful phrase meant an Auckland they 've got the population to sustain a double mine which is what I 've done which means that the friend doesn 't get held up by peasant a-train 's getting to transcend to be frequently well news I 'm afraid despite the growth over the wire brush it hasn 't been the extent of of you know increase that that it might sustain they exceed the use that you won 't see and until being moved into the CBD to work we 've still got people who actually traveling up the divinity or going up John 's right those who at the moment won 't be coming anywhere near to study and where at least two three four five years yeah options that got laurels really important part of the district plan review for its same reason oh yeah II think I try to question whether the page report we would have met Jack Kirby release that nice another saying is this another base amount of the BS report because produce and you just that the sins of unquestioning it seems very fine it 's not a problem so we worry about this statement that explains what the resolution was information so distinct nothing less healthy Ashley I was concerned notice that we 've got this is a new consider a French plated other the projects it doesn 't make a clear with it 'll begin consultations however ink that changes to more agree but yesterday because what we 've all received as if the council will also refer to the big confusion to ensure that downstream check and clean surge of that P surgeries and the council is proposing to be the long-term thing to a conic in ZTS offer variable funding assistance it 's part of the annual plan process 3 16 to 17 we came to consult so it 's an I guess it 's really that there is an area that around consultation of councils ladies decisions and other charts international heavens all that consultation second I think it just a change of the recommendation here on the serum will be before we care about the castle is that we want to you know sort of falling engage the community board in this process as well and you know I know we 're setting a saw I see that NZTA think they 've spoken very favorably about the other direction of the people of the community board and felt that there is a good basis for the relationship going forward so important today very much so the only question I had was um you 've talked about a project for the reason when I 02 the same day but there 's huge impression baby very if they have you eaten as many great things in cash around us so you know it kind of understand understable what you try to check with everything right it is it what we try to chase and simple so you just stopped out from 's that especially one like an 80 per cust comes in secrecy which things is it would be passing you from if I go again sure what this is not the first option I think should be okay but we need is a magician and we need it have made a difference isn 't anything but we have in get into like being here and you just stop it here we need actually follow a certain sense of what we want has so after day this possibly is going to be indexed on the wound or you already if we don 't do anything well was always a look at this tiny closets moving moon yeah I guess I hope everybody tears what 's wrong with just doing the northern bacteria extension of that with other works waiting for their work to be completed waiting for the central city looks to me I 'm sorry she can be kinky as it should have no community forward passes resolution before we pass the resolution to read much too with no means ETA to deliver projects with absolutely who bought the neighborhood they want us to be poking my buses it 's you know don 't just come as easily isn 't upset people are going to hear often and it will be major clear here and we won 't get a bottom in appearing as we keep our staff and our throw the shots that you would like to improve the entrance way through the road that you 're going to make other changes and you will see but eventually don 't take that browser system that and right at the achievement of course actually with we were able to utilize our existing lines and put some rather suck on Ashley people in an out on a convenient and in some way in and it would be the best of all possible what I 'm here in this era me want to be involved in an RV why have you filled this is heading to bring them into the conversation I don 't be the problem in this maybe would appear sadistic in cinemas wrote about the trip more than fittings and it was really tired issue is because if you a shoot have no community was resolution that was passed of we passed a resolution and saying we would continue to work with New Zealand Transport Agency a lot of cases of modeling the first themselves don 't know what the effect is going to me which is awake in frozen sometimes that 's why we are discussing the shooting category community boards resolution which day good race prior to or past prior to us making Lee may be making a decision so and I think we need to be fully engaged and thus and thus prices and I think the expressionist is that Kieran able to play more engaged roll with cheering cut my on on the I guess that point it was kind of person with us the funny person so six months so the only version of us a lotta Graham we 've officially done that should be material reason why are we done after the northern RT request yeah it is that easy ta will put out a might do that rollin artery which I know there 's some people but actually is many more anyone re so but there is not efficient for this year of a shipping company board so i got the resolution and I 'll for that resolution all those in favor say it 's cari thank you so then this is that the reported for fall and I am i doing bacteria charge burglars everything sigalert of motion say aye scary and what exactly my apologies who dispensed on page 45 of there for a couple of things consuming 19 the fire station takes 16 months to process that was also been seen there I just like to start with that one up can I discreto makes it different from a deputation it was unfounded they don 't even see our just merely saying they hoped it wouldn 't take that long and actually even watch that year so i 'm sure that wont idea and we 've got a commitment from staff to be actually given behind and help the skit this suit club you know nadel be happening all but not to put roadblocks up forward is to have a new community board have funded this to the general a couple years ago it 's very worthy cause so it was just some dedicated days I got appreciate that and the other one was a phone so it 's just a technical glitch the through the school was not much content this is great and from Auschwitz right fresh ash and we

    "text": "to what do you want is you want to say a few wheels I 'll say a few words first of all I Drive you know I 'll setting this is an excellent submission it covers a lot of the important points in essentially I was reviewing some of my notes while I was away the last couple weeks and I came across this meeting on the fourteenth of february2014 nearly 18 months ago this is where I kind of go I told you that and it was a short presentation I did to the board of the Treasury that were down here meeting for the day and I had said to them it was a good opportunity for counsel to talk directly with the Treasury Board and I said we have a plan of action it was a five-point plan and i 'll go through it one was a transparent finances which I think we 've delivered on in terms of explaining a financial position and understanding what it is the second was an upgraded insurance process and risk management plan which is something that we 're working on 've done the fourth was a new investment and delivery agency which we now have in place and the fifth was a transitional plan to take full responsibility by 2016 and I think that is where we are at and I think we pretty much delivered on those five points and I think the important thing is in terms of the formality of a submission on on you know the government transition plan is about taking responsibility now that doesn 't mean that we 're not going to work with the crown on an ongoing basis we will and I also put down here you know we want to operate with the three C 's a certainty communication and collaboration and we want to be working with the crown but I think what this is about for the city is about self-determination and agency and allowing the people to now as we go through as we 've been through the response and the recovery process that regeneration is very much a locally driven process which is people led community-led and I think the submission it is is excellent in the explains regeneration is something more than just physical aspects that it is about social the cultural the creative capital that we try to create for the city for the future and that as long as we 're leading it on behalf of the people that I think it 's the right way to go we 're good Queen thank you and just pick up on what ref sit there on behalf of the people I view on this is that not only is the council ready the people are ready and we are the people we come from them and I note on page 13 and says recovery needs to be owned and led by local communities and institutions and I think that this is where the heart of this slice for some time we 've been living in the tension between a power that is top-down and a power that is springing from the ground up and out of that tension that rub has come a lot that is creative which we 've seen in the long-term plan and I think of many of the proposals around the Athanor for one of our daughters at home it 's a surprise and the bulbs are starting what we now know the bulbs are starting to shoot through and like the coming spring the bulbs of new growth I think in our city are unrelated and have been actually for some time pushing their way up from the ground and it 's time to let those bulbs spring up to let them grow and not be overshadowed to let them flourish one understanding which I am drawn to over vision is of vision meaning a preferred future and in my mind this is one where the city prefers as the people to run their city and to do this by holding us their elected representatives accountable at all times and as electives holding us accountable every three years we heard about the paradigm shifts in our society I think from Kevin Roberts at the elgin 04 he talked about moving from a tension to participation information to inspiration interruption to interaction and return on investment to return on involvement he also said it 's difficult to get ideas past the abominable a can-do counsel from the word go so let 's support the submission and I think foster a city with a council says yes and in turn enables the people to have their ideas and come through and do things as well so I 'm right behind this picking up Rep talked about sovereignty 1000 meter tunga and to me that that 's the sovereignty and it 's the partnership so it 's the partnership with it round bound up in that sovereignty is gone ok yani thank you I welcome the opportunity make some comments on the submission I think the general thrust of the submission is excellent it is talking about transitioning back to our local democracy and I also think it is really looking at some of the more fundamental issues and really that 's a transition from an exclusive city to an inclusive City a transition that addresses that we 're actually in a dynamic process not a fixed process and that there is a need for a new vision and platform grown from the grass roots of our communities and other citizens not not from round and so I think there are some challenges that this submission recognizes and I do commend the submission for making reference to the idea of krupal bottom line reporting you know it 's really interesting to look back at some of the comments that were made in 2013 where people talked about this economic modelling and how it 's quite risky relying on some of the economic assumptions that underpinned the recovery and that we did need to look at new ways of doing things so I see this is a real opportunity to start having those conversations with the crown and with our community how we can actually start to put in place some video frameworks around measuring what 's happening in our city it was interesting to note that were there was comment at the time that are from from some other distinguished people who did talk about the possibility of Sarah and this was messy university professor bruce gleb ovitch the country 's top recovery expert as the earthquake commission chair and natural hazards so in one of the challenges is how sarah is going to going to mobilize local capacity to rebuild and how is it going to enable local communities to make choices that were built safer and more sustainable communities so you know when you reflect on what people have said previously you now welcome the opportunity finally I think to start to have those conversations and actually start thinking about how we do it I think that the other big question that 's raised through the submission is how do we turn a blueprint that can to share an idea how do we capture the the blueprint into a way that 's meaningful for the citizens again of the city so they feel connected to the outcomes and the vision and the common objectives that we share with them and with the crown and you know it 's I think it 's important to note that we shouldn 't look past the fact that you know we have one in four children living below the poverty line we have a huge impact on on ring to people that read in our city a third of our city pays rent yet has been those social inequalities and those environmental inequalities that are being exacerbated by the earthquake as we know from post-disaster literature that natural disasters have an ability to do how do we address those and there is reference in here to the fact that any sort of commercial regeneration agency or development agency does need to think about those things it needs to be seen as being as I said an inclusive opportunity rather than just another set of exclusive decision-making I also think one of the really interesting comments that was made previously was that you know in terms of democracy in our city it was seen as seen as a kind of we 're existing in this framework of a stakeholder democracy and I think the opportunity through this process is that we start to transition back to service and democracy so you know the idea that people are asked that people are meaningfully engaged in given information is all essential to the role of a local council but also a partnership a meaningful genuine partnership with central government and I do endorse them as comments that you know huge and it isn 't just about what Christchurch can do it is about how we work constructively with government acknowledging that we do need their support and their help and actually this is New Zealand 's problem not just Christchurch 's problems so we do need to I think be mindful of how we work collaboratively together but that shouldn 't be at the expense of our sovereignty and I think that 's one of the key points at the submission document makes says that you can retain your sovereignty and you can have constructive relationships with the crowd and with the various partners in the recovery so thank you for the work that you 've put into the submission I look forward to us having the opportunity as this process progresses to address some of those things that we know that are having a huge impact on our local communities and giving them an opportunity to actually share our vision for the future and Bill feel part of it rather than excluded from it up for themself I first wanted just to thoroughly endorse and the comments made really express exactly how we feel was a council and how we want to take this fall but at brasserie specific Christchurch become rock stars and the transitional since we did and we the people which he created and adopted the new tomb the new normal and we now challenge other cities that are facing challenges to find their new normal and I think it 's part of actually who we are with from the from the grassroots we came out through all this disaster and and suffering and it was citizen lead and as the mayor quite rightly point out they didn 't ask permission they just got up and did it and I think that actually highlights what we have to do as a council and it 's almost like organic management allowing out people to do things for themselves giving them the framework and the help to actually achieve it I think it 's really important I 'm up for the challenge and I know this council is up for the challenge taken back the control of its city and its future we were pretty hard over a five-point plan having achieved those quite significant milestones as and I think it 's now for us to become rock stars and the regeneration of sins and to do that we will need to actually raise the bar and I know my fellow councillor Livingston here works to raise the bar for that you know that the least fortunate and interesting enough I was out last night and having a chat to a chippy and he was talking about raising the bar at the less fortunate which actually raises the bar for everyone and I think that 's as a city where we should have hid ourselves be a rock star and raising a bar and regeneration and helping out people find a better future thank you FL I 've certainly been very happy to it thickened this whole submission and I think it 's an excellent submission to and I feel quite proud of it actually feel proud of the fact that we as a council and now it is positioned today because like I think LeAnn referred to some markers in terms of a recovery and city clear marker and what I 'd like to see two is that we ensure that we invite other leaders in their communities to also comment on this this legislation I think the key is around involving people in the ongoing recovery and it is there 's a reference that phrases a Herculean task and at times it has seemed ginormous but i think it is broken down now as in ref recreated some steps going back 18 months and it 's clear that now we can make it I 'm very pleased to see aspects and the submission around reducing future exposure to hazards and risks clearly that is important for future recovery and any future event risk events so clear you know in many ways Wallace isn 't a vision statement in itself it sets the scene for Christchurch having a future vision statement and I 'm quite pleased in fact that it 's not a vision statement PSA because that can kind of mean anything but there 's a lot of very specific in very specific aspects of air recovery that we need to do referred to an a council we are is Leanne see the beginning of her introduction are we ready to step up the challenge I 'm sure there 's a council we are so thank you and Jimmy thank you yeah I remember the meal would like to quote the Confucius saying you know if your plan is one year and plant advise your plans for ten years and the trees your plane is for a hundred years kind of educated people today we review all those the earthquake recovery we found a pass through the stage of the earthquake emergency response then we enter into the recovery by this how is here if we subdivide the public from the repair and the reconstruction but right now we are aware we enter into the final stage there 's a regeneration I based on this document particular mention these the regeneration is candidly image you know in our future but an accretion I also like to you know by this kind of regeneration is a jeweled Easter the rivers and also transformation it means is a totally different fonda before the earthquake total the change well I went to the channel with the mail in our dedication we admire the channel is quite recovered we all miser they are so quickly no superbly so we 're know especially we have a site visitor to the winter and chana the autumn everything but at least I 'm the winner our Kwon dongha on the urban design innovation team they whisked us the opportunity to cherish name a total name of all the passes have kinda have used yo yo yo say no create idea we create a hundred and a thousand or 600 idea they also admire us because our the plano is for the future public hundred years because last we established planning is the city 's pay 260 years ago but right now we prepare for the Kimura for the next generation extra Centennial the kind of lapel so there 's a kind of long long way to talk but we still need to take time to review nur but as the our vision what is alcohol it 's actually this division is not the individual vision this call is not out individual save are aware of agree you know we will lie to know to reboot regenerate this city is the safe is a queen needs a wife rent is attracted city to make the people who like to stay in here to wither here both working here run either visiting here even die in here you know this out the kind of the same way she also this common core because we are in a simple no mater central government local come we are in the same boat so we have this common goal but in here I because I review the on page 27 yes because I agree this recommendation because why in the early stage especially in the Earthquaker you know the recovery response in this stage we have to you know central gamma have a spatial directory no 22 times you quickly but according to the Tiffin estate a popular item thing so Karmin drawer still you know kind of the needle so tall veneto gradually based on these the stage gradually the release this power to peg to the local government pay to the local democracy so that the kind of specialist ended at meijer so made a people everywhere contributor create ideal tool is the city because this out the kind of city is other kind of master disease I think this the way we push an important first issued because council couple weeks ago we established the kind of develop cultures limiting would lie to the repair the Beulah CBD as whereas the suburban a center in suburban area but but central government also the establish does regenerate the quiet responsible for the ocp dealer in compartir osito how to integrate these two kind of the break all you know entity together otherwise fabulous if the waster these kind of resources so i thinka days how to the mitigated eases my mind my concern generally speaking i support at least the samee she thank you thank you very much le thank you i think what 's key and our submission is the commitment to taking the full reigns up again return in christchurch to being a fully self-governed city so governed by the elected members I think it 's also significant that the city is one central city and the surrounding suburbs need to be both strong and a strong and stable city is as strong as its communities and its suburbs and I think our submission clearly acknowledges and promotes their speed with me while I find where i wrote my other nights here we go there are still people died think it 's really important that we acknowledge that there are still people though who won 't be able to understand the idea of transition that they won 't be able to look too far ahead we 're excited by that and a lot of people are but there are people still trying to sort out their insurance issues still trying to sort out EQC and find out with their homes and rebuilds or not trying to sort out their lives and we have to continue to help them and remember that not everyone is in the same place I 'd also like to encourage people to put in their own submissions this is a really important document this is your city our city and it 's important that you have your say i so that 's a great start so 30 years of gin up july as the deadline it 's just a quick add so there 's some still much work to do and i look forward to doing that book was my colleagues around the table and our strategic partners Pauline great thanks Ellie your spaces and places citizenship participation empowerment they all equal regenerate and this is exciting but Sara needs to hear from the people of Christchurch the people who live here those who will be affected by the future decisions and those who will be but from them whilst reached residence really need to convey their confidence in their council we heard so many people through a LTP submissions process calling for priotiy it should be restored to local leadership we heard this loud and clear so I encourage those people to step up now go to the syrah website and make these submission to pass this message on I plead with them to do that to transition from central government leadership and power if you like to local government will be in the words of the mirror feel empowered we need balance out the central city and the suburban needs to enliven Christchurch we heard that from our LTP as well this council feels ready I know we 're ready and i think the christchurch people are confident that we will create a positive working true partnership model to achieve the representation of christ church this council regeneration of christchurch and this council has shown we recognize and value the skills and talent and creativity and leadership that we have in the people who live here we are able and willing to engage with them to empower and thus create resilience and our LTP submissions also prove that not only did we have thousands of Russian ones that we had hundreds of people who came and SAT here and spoke to us and they did that because they could and because they felt they could and this is a really important part of engagement and recovery so as I said earlier the step change will innovate in enrich our people and our city hugely and it 's just what we all need with submission thank you good other people to make submissions I think that 's really really important and good I think in the event of a major disaster like this the government has to come in and it 's got a huge I totally get that and then I think it has to fulfill its obligations and and to exit gracefully and I think what we are trying to make easy for the government in this submission is that to say thank you very much and to help them to exit gracefully from the city so if we 've had the grexit then this is the Crick 's at the crowne exit and from christchurch so and greeks it was the greek exit which didn 't happen but but as we know cities are well I think anyway cities are the drivers of the future that 's where we will see their really major change and the step changes in terms of social justice and climate change and the issues that will really matter and the reason that they will lead on those issues is that governments are in the differ in the really difficult and two small student to do the things and they and they simply can 't twist themselves to the differing needs of each region answer so their levers that they have a uniform they can only pull the same levers for every part of their country it makes it really really difficult so I think that they have some work that still needs to be done we 've outlined the common objectives obviously there are still some anchor projects such as the convention center in the Metro sports and also issues such as the residential red zone were which need a great deal of attention and need to be finished and and it 's important that government exercises its role there and Christchurch people are taxpayers and that was clearly outlined as a taxpayer or some of those were clearly outlined this taxpayer responsibility so it 's but it is important i think that they do those things in a way that joins up with the council well but returns the city to the feeling that is so so important in a city and that is that anything is possible every time the council or others go to stand up you get the feeling that you 're going to bump your head on here 's another rule or another three letter acronym that 's been imposed in the city and I think we 're probably at the point we 're well past the point where we actually want to stand up properly and not bump our head on any new government imposed three-letter rule or three letter acronym or the T that or a new thing that limits the power of the people in the city and I think the best hit that this city has always had and will always have is the people who live here and that 's why it 's really important that people make submissions on this that not only does the city get control back 30 but the way in which we learn from this disaster is about much more as the mayor said much more sharing of power and much more helping people to do the things that they want to do rather than centralization of power because I think some really good change the nature of governance and doing in Christchurch for years to come and this submission is great stuff anyone else I 've just conclude then i just thought i 'd remind people that the government 's transition rakaat recovery plan was informed from the work of the advisory board on transition and that they made a couple of statements that I just think are worth while remembering as we move towards the regeneration renewed development of the city the next five years are very important in five years time we hope that people of Christchurch City and greater Christchurch have a strong sense of ownership and pride and the regeneration of their city and region so ownership and pride we want people to feel optimistic about the future we want them to be surprised and delighted by the progress they will see and experience we want the people of Greater Christchurch to be living the lives they want to be living and you know and some respects that language speaks to everyone because living the life you want to be living speaks as much to somebody who 's 85 you know so it just really does pick up the the spectrum I was looking online for some a frame of reference which I have been talking to a number of groups about for quite some time ever since I found it and it was really picking up on what Vicki said this could be a moment in time that marks a complete transition for us as a city in terms of how we do governance about how we actually connect with local people for local decision-making and it 's not just a reference to community boards that 's how community boards relate directly to those communities without breaking the direct link to the council itself and I think that 's an incredible sense of opportunity and a lot of works then go on unto thinking about what it 's like as what what the future is going to be like when you don 't know as a government and whether that central or local government when you don 't know what 's going to happen win or you can expect as the unexpected and that is incredibly hard and for the unexpected is to prepare your community to be really that 's all that you can do and that changes the entire nature of the relationship between a council and its communities and I mention this because there 's been a lot of writing done on the subject of how citizenships have citizens have lost their status as citizens that ratepayers their taxpayers there are consumers their purchases you know and it 's all very on the receiving end as a citizen you have a status and that is what we need to reclaim and the role of government changes when you think about people not as ratepayers but as citizens and what that does is that governments become these and i love these phrases enablers within a framework of collective responsibility so enablers partners who use their power and that of the state to support the contributions of others partnership depending as it does on trust goodwill and mutual respect facilitators who convened citizens and organizations to build communities of purpose purpose collaborative actors who work with others to coordinate decisions and to achieve concerted actions stewards of course-correct when the Public Interest demands it with a stewards of the collective interest you know that it 's a difference between under vidual interests and collective interests with the stewards of the collective interest and we do need to steppin when the collective interests can 't_''_1901.98 be protected when the Public Interest demands it and then leaders to achieve convergence and that common sense of purpose it 's probably a bit risky to end with a to confirming councillor Livingston 's comments about Kevin Roberts speaking about such Cuban Robert speaking at the local government New Zealand conference but I had another quote from her but it 's a high-risk one because I haven 't gotten into it he also said that Martin Luther King did not begin that great address with the words I had a vision statement he had a dream and I 'm not going to tell you what my dream is because it is the collective dream that we represent around this table and something that we are about well I believe on the verge of being able to to really engage with our communities and i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried unanimously thank you and on that note I 'll declare the meeting closed _"

    "text": "I 'm back to the meeting that was a June from yesterday and we 're meeting today to discuss the submission on the draft transition recovery plan greater Christchurch earthquake recovery transition to regeneration July 2015 and I 'm going to just perhaps present the submission and then we 'll open it up for debate we the amendment sorry the resolution that we hope to adopters to adopt the draft submission with final sign-off being delegated to the transitional working group so that enables any changes that we want to make to it and particular emphasis that we might want to highlight to be addressed in the forward I 've actually quoted Rebecca Solnit who is a very well-known author and she said this and great cities spaces as well as places are designed and built walking witnessing being in public are as much part of the design and purpose as is being inside to eat sleep make shoes or love or music the word citizen has to do with cities and the ideal city is organized around citizenship around participation and public life participation and public life is exactly weird regeneration has actually excited quite a lot of interest in the transition recovery plan itself because shifting from recovery to regeneration means something it means something quite different and when we look at the draft transition recovery plan and when we look at the advisory boards report to the minister then we can see that it means a stick change something positive something different something new and an increased level of opportunity that we have before us and interestingly for me was that when we were coming up with a title for our long-term plan we called it christchurch 2015 to 2025 building resilience from recovery to regeneration and i remember the discussions that we had about whether regeneration was the right word and the reason that we came to agree amongst ourselves that regeneration would be the right word was that it managed to capture both the combination of restoration on the one hand a new growth on the other and we are experiencing restoration and new growth in our city at the moment so the idea that we 've shifted from response to recovery to regeneration it a city regeneration does represent a stick change that means a significant change it means a positive change and in the context of regeneration is a tomb that actually embraces that world of opportunity that can be captured by reimagining our future and reimagining our future not just from the perspective of putting back what was there before but reimagining our future is one through as one seen through the lens of sustainability and if you think about what the rest of the world is grappling with at the moment some of the issues that we can find answers to today our answers to questions that the rest of the world will be seeking tomorrow there is a lot about what we have experienced and what we are experiencing that we can contribute not only to our city but to our country and indeed to the to the world regeneration is also reflected in that sense of energy creativity and flair of the transitional movement that has emerged and the post-disaster environment if anyone thinks this is unusual it isn 't this is what opens the sense of possibility that the expression it 's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission and working for a council now you certainly know that a lot of people would prefer to us for forgiveness in permission given how long the permission might take to do it to arrive enter depending on the circumstances that might be less of a mess of a trial and may cost this in the long run but that whole sense of possibility that 's emerged from the transitional movement let 's put Christ Church on the world stage it actually was nothing about the disaster that put Christchurch as one of the must-see places in the lonely planet or in the New York Times it wasn 't because of anything that we would think about in terms of Christ church 's history it was about the transition they were looking at the restart more they 're looking at get fellow they 're looking at life and vacant spaces they 're looking at all of these things emerging from the rubble as it were of the disaster that has affected our city at the same time regeneration allows us anchor projects and I know that there are discussions that we have from time to time about anchor projects and they will excite a lot of attention as they did during the consideration of our long-term plan the number of people who set at the end of the table and raise this anchor project and that anchor project the purpose of the anchor projects is not the anchor projects it 's the enlivening of the spaces in between it 's actually to catalyze development around them that 's what they 're for that 's what they were always designed for and that 's what this focus on regeneration enables us as a city to actually finally bring to fruition as a city we all have an absolute direct and trust and what 's called the commons the public realm the places where people participate in public life as Rebecca Solnit describes it we also have a very indirect interest but very explicit but undirected interest and the private developments that will use the anchor projects as the springboard for development and that 's what the anchor projects were always designed more than developing a vibrant central city it 's a given we need a vibrant central city to make it make things happen but for us as a city council it is about regenerating the range of suburban centers that support the neighborhoods that have been so badly hurt by the earthquakes we don 't divide our city east and west and we don 't divide our city center in the rest we actually make sure that we are holistic and the view of the city as a whole and what is it that we can bring to that city as sonic says the ideal city is organized around citizenship and that 's what we 've been talking about all through the long term plan people came over and over and over again and they didn 't come to ask for us to do things for them they came and asked us to partner with them and do things together they actually asked if they could have permission to do things for themselves with our support financial legislative regulatory whatever support it was they weren 't asking for us to regeneration enables us to give people a reason to engage with their city in a positive and meaningful way and of course the other driver for stick changes building momentum you know and it is important you know I 've worked in this area for quite a long time there is a view that you 've got to do things very very quickly and there is there is a need momentum but there also is a need for deliberation the balance between speed and deliberation is very very important in fact it 's so important that i created my own expression to describe it and that is take your time as quickly as you can and the truth is is that people need to see that things are happening they need to see the milestones along the way they need to know when things are going to be happening they need a timeline it doesn 't matter if there 's the odd falter it always happens in a disaster environment there 's always going to be things that take time or things that don 't quite go to to plan committed to you actually give it a sense of momentum in itself and it 's much more likely to occur then not to have that sense of momentum built there so I think to get that balance right as something that we can do setting up development Christchurch as a signal to our strategic partners that we are ready to do things differently not just be a you but actually a new way of partnering with the government with our communities and with the private sector in a way that business as usual models just simply cannot and I think the other point that I 'm making this forward is that we don 't have the capacity as a city to do everything at once and we don 't have the capacity to do it alone and that 's why the concept of collaboration and partnership and co governance that emerges from the transition discussion there 's something that is really really powerful and I guess that what the government 's looking for as a council that 's ready to step up and play its role and I say that what we are debating today is not just a submission and many respects it 's a statement of intent when i was elected mere i said the city was really and willing but not yet able today I can say we are not only ready willing and able but we are actually quite excited about the opportunity that this presents the government 's commitment to shifting from centralized leadership to local leadership is something we welcome we absolutely welcome it and we give confidence and reassurance to the government of New Zealand that we as a city are prepared to take up the challenge that they have thrown down the proposed submission we 're debating today deals with principles and values against which we would measure decision-making approaches rather than the specifics of things like a future regenerate Christchurch the minister has been invited by cabinet to work with me and my capacity as mayor of the city to investigate establishing such an entity recognizing that we 've set up development Christchurch to deliver and develop our objectives the single decision signals the government 's willingness to collaborate with the of Christchurch on the next stage of the recovery I kind of wanted to put something on record and I know that people you know sort of you know sort of get out of bed in the morning and think I just love their urban development strategy but here is the the vision statement there was written back in 2007 by the year twenty forty one greater Christchurch has a vibrant inner city and suburban centres surrounded by thriving rural communities and towns connected by efficient and sustainable infrastructure there are a wealth of public spaces ranging from bustling inner city streets to expense of open spaces and parks which embrace natural systems landscapes and heritage innovative businesses are welcomed and contrived supported by a wide range of attractive facilities and opportunities prosperous communities can enjoy a variety of lifestyles and good health and safety enriched by the diversity of cultures in the beautiful environment of Greater Christchurch this was written three years before our earthquake and use it still has meaning today but what I found interesting about the strategy and it isn 't just a strategy on paper development strategy enable it to be given effect two and in fact if anyone wants to say was the city better prepared for the disaster that was to befall us and the need for rapid assessments to be made of land-use changes and things like there we were already there but the guiding principles really do stand for me instead as a kind of a beacon of the sorts of things that we should be thinking about sustainable prosperity as the overarching principle chief through strategy partners committing to providing leadership and to work in partnership with each other and the community and taking responsibility for decisions decision making will be based upon the need for resilience adaptability to change the need for innovation to find creative approaches and through integration between partners plans and processes and so doing we must value and look to the restoration of our natural systems this is 2007 the strategic directions outline the strategy outcomes and provide the basis for the specific actions listed in the action plan and this is really the nub of it they focus on enriching lifestyles enhancing environments encouraging integrating implementation well it sounds like a recovery strategy to me and if you actually think about where we got to after this even the September earthquake and then the five earthquakes the recovery strategy was really in place in 2012 and yet all of the words all of the objectives they were there right from the start so are we ready in Christchurch are we ready and greater Christchurch to take up the challenge that the government has govern us of local leadership yes we are since the earthquakes life has changed every one of the reports that have fit into the draft recovery plan highlight the tale of two cities unresolved EQC claims unresolved insurance claims becomes the determinants of well-being and all of the evidence backs that up my memory of that time will actually go back to the opening lines of the tale of two cities it was the best of times it was the worst of times the beast was the way that our communities came together incredibly powerful that knowledge and communities that we were competent to do things for ourselves an incredible sense and that 's why we refer to Sir Peter Glickman 's report in this in this recommended submission a feeling of self-efficacy and community efficacy assists the population and reactivating their coping mechanisms local governance empowerment and ownership had been shown to facilitate recovery when did he write this may 2011 just months after the februari earthquake based on all of the available evidence this is what makes the difference the inevitable tensions and conflicts in achieving this are obvious long-term verse a short term public versus private local versus national interests and cannot be avoided rather they have to be openly handled with sensitivity and that 's what the council does the way it makes its decisions we debate these issues and the public arena and that is good for the city but they have to be handled with sensitivity as we know with issues like the challenges we face in terms of the close coastal environment the sea level rise those issues need to be handled with sensitivity it follows that from the psychosocial perspective those involved in directing the recovery should create governance structures that understand and such approaches will be most likely to be effective and re-establishing coping and functioning communities may 2011 we 're ready we 're ready to take up that role and ensure that our communities are fully engaged in the process of recovery restoration and now regeneration no body should ever underestimate the knowledge that has embedded in our communities nobody should underestimate it it offers value to planning it offers value to budgeting it offers value to decision making and the more that we engage with our local communities the better it is and I when I say communities I mean communities of place I mean communities of identity and I mean communities of interest as well the the the next that I guess that what is critical to the point that we 're and at the moment is to have a number of approaches that enable things to be resolved so we 've set out on page 14 of our submission a number of themes really they enable us to move forward developing a common and shared view of the remaining problems at the stage in the recovery through information decided emits the various existing program level governance structures but on a no surprises basis and in many respects this was designed through the cost sharing agreement and requires to be refreshed in this context considering collectively the effectiveness of interventions put in place and programs of work underway being clear about the role of Governors the crown and the council and agreeing on a process for resolution with assumptions and or programs that we cannot align to affect but the best outcomes for all and I kind of want to conclude on that the best outcomes for all because we could sit here and have a conversation about what 's best for Sarah what 's best for government what 's best for council what 's best for the ministry of business innovation and employment but that 's not the test not from here on on the test for what comes now is what 's best for Christchurch what 's best for Christchurch will be what defines the regeneration of our city and look there are so many different ways that you could find to define regeneration and so I thought captured why the word regeneration excites me and this is the co-developer of East London 's silvertown keys who said there is no template over two decades every project has been different to Givens first regeneration as a long term process patience as needed a problem given short term property perspective second investing and social capital is as oughtn 't as the physical side but as often not understood regeneration is now where the action is and that 's what we need to do we need to get that balance right it isn 't just about regenerating the physical of the city it is about regenerating the spirit of christ church and i believe that we now have the opportunity to do that so I 'd like to open it up for all I 'd like to move the motion and would someone like to second it in though and ref would you like to

    "text": "I time to deal with them the occasion I just acknowledge I 'm Jason and Amy who have spent six months of making boundaries in scenarios for you thank you very much okay just one other item to deal with in the public session which is the Memorandum of Understanding sister city partnership and if George would like to come forward we have a memorandum from the circle international relations team and an amendment to the MOU which picks up the point that yarny made that we we haven 't formalized the relationship as a sister city partnership but this is intended to do so so and I have to say that I referred to Wuhan as a sister city I referred to yell at well I did and and it 's kind of being treated that way on our website and it 's kind of like everyone calls it a sister city so it my fault that there is a real desire and Wuhan for this to be reaffirmed and well we sit shouldn 't say reaffirming now should it so it should say that council receives an approved the establishment of a sister city relationship would you like to talk to that George is um unfortunately at the time when the initial Memorandum of Understanding was placed before the key committee there was an assumption that the relationship that we had with Luhan due to the fact that the dialogue that had been ongoing between three different consecutive years it always made reference to the fact that we had a sister city relationship with wuhan however as councillor your hands and has pointed out there actually hasn 't been a resolution or formal recognition of the relationship as a sister city we have progressively increased our interactions ruhan to the point we 're actually engaging with them on the same level that we do with other sister cities such as crush gear and some power however insane once again it comes back to the fact that the memorandum of understanding is about the sister city relationship which has not had a resolution and passed to actually formalize that own relationship with Luhan and in saying that wuhan have formalized the end of the bargain by stating in all city is an official sister sister city relationship so from wuhan Z and it most definitely is a high level relationship that they do have in honor however from our perspective as a council inner city we do not have some formal process recognizing that relationship with one hence the reason why I 've made the memorandum outlining the fact that the memorandum itself is actually requesting in the same breath recognition of the fact that we do have a sister city relationship yeah the memorandum that you provided also highlights the fact that this can 't wait until the next meeting because it is at the next meeting that we will sign the memorandum so as part of the hoob a visit to to christ church which was delayed so the who may visit was due to be held next week which was wireless needed to be on the agenda by today but that 's been postponed until to every single august and it 's my suggestion that we adjourn the meeting at the appropriate time and actually sign the agreement here live streamed of course and as part amazing because all of the counselors be able to observe and and they 've got a significant delegation coming from who bae as well yep yani thanks come it 's fine let me know but just I guess is a little bit of frustration that we had a whole process last team of council that looked at sister cities and relationships and it was supposed to be some work epping that this kind of thing done in isolation off let 's find out knowledge that we got people coming in in it we 've got a Chinese Christchurch sister city committee so yeah that 's you know they 're my view but but it does raise an interesting question for me which is is other cities around the world that we might look to think of as possibly wanting to connect with and I take India for example it seems really weird to me that we haven 't had any thought about a strategic sister city relationship or whatever relationship worth in a developing country with a growing economy and with a huge cultural social connection to Christchurch so I any other work happening around looking at our sister city relationships and where we might have gaps and looking at what the opportunities are it 's our point of water memory is this the place where we all know I proved the new model yeah I like I think these writers but yani can we leave that I mean seriously I just want to conclude the public part of the meeting as quickly as possible I 'm really happy I 'm sure George to come and have a chat with us on an informal basis that doesn 't matter for the resolution of this one and but but it won 't be lost but you know quite frankly servicing our existing relationships as a as a as a priority for me right now rather than looking for others there 's plenty of work and servicing our current ones it 's quickly I 'm going to totally support this but but I sort of acknowledge George 's work is charging juggling two balls at the moment he 's doing outstanding work so I just wanted to acknowledge the work that you of things hit me in the market circuit thank you so on that basis I will move and Jimmy will second the report the Memorandum of Understanding resolution and I 'll put that all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and thank you for going to order that trouble so quickly _"

    "text": "now I 'm thank you look I think if we look back over the last council has said to take on more than probably any other cast in the history of Christchurch and we 've done it with 13 elected members plus Sameer I think it 's fair to say the back of a lot of the work post-earthquake and i do question whether number of councillors is actually going to make us work there is a fear I think expressed around the table that this amendment may allow election of counselors from one specific socio-economic group or or bicular sub-divisional I do believe in the best person for the job and in fact if you look at the bill would Pegasus would you talk about that in the last couple of elections two out of the two of the elected members their side of the board Pegasus Ward anyway and I we have in history seen people of high profile stand for council high-profile sportsmen etc and have got elected and uncertain electorates and I have no doubt that if Richard stood for a right Mia for mere he for the woolston ward he would probably get elected so can express that you know as elected members we have a citywide vision however i do also support this notion that we 've had it for a long time now that we 've had peered wards we 've had we 'd shared the responsibility area and I think it 's work very well and I 'm more than happy to support this amendment I fell well I i support the combination of the 16-member awards but i cannot support this amendment I just see this amendment that we 're discussing today and it 's the first I saw today it 's really like making a major decision while we 're running in on the hop and I just don 't think that 's a good way to make decisions at all but it 's a sorry that 's all right and it is that there 's more than a few few problems and defining it today and I 've got no doubt there 'll be a lot of problems with with potential voters to clarifying it too and that the sense that the different groupings for example and although councillor golfers said that in his own phenyl t 'en fais moi ma reward has been great support for Bishop Dale when I look at the future the future areas huge areas like here would have McLain 's you really have to wonder how in fact I would wonder how in fact areas for example with lower socioeconomic areas over here what how in fact they are going to get close representation what from their councils and that is what the there 's what the resonance when they were engaged with us for they wanted to have closer contact with their local councillor and this is just a dist to me clustering the wards this way does just simply the opposite I also just want to comment on how on the comment from councillor Jones that in fact combining the wards actually means that you can share the workload I 'm sorry but this this representation review is not about how we share the workload I would expect we don 't do in a matter what arranged our little arrangement we the most effective and fairway I certainly interested to hear the comments about what gene drage had had made and in relation to fairness and I went back to my notes last night and basically what she also said she I made this note that as soon as wards are combined you get poorer representation and gene gage was the expert she came from University she did contribute a lot to the background of this paper and I think it 's really important as counselors that we take note of that i 'm also really concerned that in fact if we have these big Ward 's in fact that makes a lot more difficult for ordinary people like us to actually or most of us to make to actually stand and get elected there 's the awards would be huge the way of running a campaign in such big boards would be enormous on ordinary little people and I urge counselors to bear that in mind I think I think in terms of that of the fairness of a toe and I will go back to my own case and isn 't in my self interest at all to what it would be to keep to go for a wide award and it 's not in my self interest because i live and kashmir like tim does and end but it 's not about my my interest it 's actually about making a decision which is right for it for the people who we represent so in the other point too is that there 's no question in my mind that when i see the wards combined this way that and it 's been referred to actually that in fact this is that not just a tip of the iceberg but it 's very clearly heading towards having voting at large now we do that for the mirror and that works but there 's as history indicates when this council when the city had voting at large people were poorly represented so i think that the amendment is the opposite of best representation it 's the opposite of being fear and will be the opposite of being effective but i think having 16 councillors should work very well so I um thank you I will address the amendment first and then I wanted to make some comments around the subdivisions and then I 'll talk about the 14 16 and there are a number of points I want to make dark keep it as brief as I can there 's one thing about the amendment that I like and there 's only one thing about the amendment that I like and that 's the single member for banks peninsula but the things about the amendment that I don 't like a less accountability less representation less democracy less power to the people less room for grassroots involvement potentially lower turnout at elections which in turn means a lower level of engagement with the democratic process and with council in general they 're all things that I really do not want to say this further removes counseling so the amendment proposed amendment further removes the counselors for pollute from the people it doesn 't respond to the feedback that we 've heard from the public and there are two other things it does as well it increases the cost of a about here is Ward 's big enough to have three councillors representing them the bigger the ward the more the cost of running an effective campaign that immediately rules some people out who might not have twenty or twenty-five thousand dollars just sitting in their back pocket it also decreed it decreases the chance that a person who 's been involved for that reason you know you know a grassroots person who 's been involved in a community group or maybe even as a community board member they may not be able to afford to run that kind of a campaign they also may not have the visibility across award which is big enough to have three councillors to be able to be recognized as a person who might make a good counselor and you know that leads to an outcome that again I 'm not comfortable with because of that bigger cost because a person needs to have the flexibility in their life to run that kind of a campaign and the sort of profile to run that kind of a campaign that leads to people that are either I don 't want to sit around a council that 's full of rich and famous people there 's been some of that already and there are humans as to how well it work and how well it didn 't but I would rather sit around a table here which is made up of real people from real communities who have had that grassroots experience and this amendment in my view at least to an extent precludes those people from running on the subdivisions we talked a little bit about the sub divisions between the a corollary were part of the banks peninsula ward and the Acora sorry the the why ray were part of the banks peninsula ward near Cairo a part of the banks peninsula ward and that works well we 've got diverse communities communities communities with different interests different needs we 've got good local representatives from each of those communities who represent their particular needs well so I certainly welcome across all of the proposals and I take the the hills and little too not the Sumner little some community board depending which way we that lyttelton harbour continues to be well represented at that community board table regardless of the fact that we lose the Littleton matoba community board proper it means that we can be confident that at the community board level we still got good representation at the counselor level we also need to have good representation and that 's why a single member for banks peninsula in my view is the only way forward I 'm the only person sitting around this table at the moment who is a single counselor representing award and I 've got to say it works well and I have good relationships with the two community board chairs and I have good relationships with the community board members and those people tell me what I need to know to represent them well at the counsel table so another point I 'll make around that and I hope it wasn 't just because I was in the room at most of those meetings but the people of the peninsula actually made similar comments when we went to them for feedback and I imagine given the opportunity to would be saying that to all of the things I 've talked about this afternoon and not in any way unique to the peninsula the peninsula is a community just every other community in setting so my view is that single-member wards and the 16-member model is the way to go the reason for the 16-member model and again I speak from the peninsular viewpoint is because it gives the greatest level of representation around the council table for each community from the peninsula I would far have preferred the 19 model but I know there 's not support around the table for that so I haven 't_''_663.13 pushed that particular envelope but if the peninsula has got to expand into the city if there 's a danger that the rural peninsula is going to be diluted or absorbed into a larger urban community with urban interests then I want to make sure that that dilution is as little as it can be that there isn 't the possibility that the banks peninsula communities can be lost or hidden in those wider urban issues so in my view for the of people per ward the better the relationship can people can have with their counselor the better the representation of those people at this table and again that 's not unique to the peninsula I could say that for every community across the city so that 's the reason I 'm going to vote against the amendment and I 'm going to vote in favor of the the 16 councillors Paul I 'm going to fully support the amendment and I 'm going to fully support 14 councillors and I just want to touch on a couple of points I remember what councillor Jones is here because I actually fully endorse at first of all I think cam this council and the incumbent me have done a great job so far and so i really take a bit of effect when people start talking some things i 've talked about here i think the me would give ferrets in the Quran for his money because of the job you 've been doing so far and I think that actually highlights what this council is actually doing right at the moment broken the back of many of the issues we we 're with you know we 've actually taken on a huge amount of work but we actually stood up for this job knowing that so it 's not that much of an issue because we knew that 's what we were going to face I also think the the dual council Awards is really really important and i and i 'm going to point to this current council table in particular because we got the chance of mix and balance within each of those wards yah ni we want the same thing for out for our constituents but we are different people and I think you can look at round in each yeah kill Jim we are and we 're different we women are looking very hard that 's about it about that balance around the community board table as well and I think that 's really really important and we talked about effective representation and I and I do talk about the workload yes we we have a big workload on our hands as counselors but effective representations means we can 't we have a ward buddy that it can actually go out there and do the job as well and I think that 's really important as well I don 't expect with more counselors my workload will drop one single bit because I want to be at every single briefing I want to be at every single council meeting that goes on and I want to try and get to every single award meeting or discussion or event to help I my constituents so I don 't think it 's going to change and we talked about the diminishing voice and we have a community board and I think our community boards doing great job they get out there that are really effective the visible and I think you know we we have to remember there are other members out there aside from ourselves that actually are doing some work load and we 're going to take that into account my biggest concern and I think it was brought up by both council of clear water and Livingston around you know people who perhaps don 't get 's a really good point who don 't we hear from it 's not just the you know the disadvantaged we don 't hear from there are a large group of people we don 't hear from and I think they would have a different view to what we 've actually heard even through the review even though the staff have done an absolutely outstanding job noting how many people have actually engaged but they are also a chunk of people out there that do not step up and say anything and we know through the voting records forty-two percent of the last election so there is forty-eight percent I 'm sorry fifty-eight percent we don 't actually hear from my own brother I asked him dis recently who are your ward councillors oh he didn 't make it because he doesn 't live an ugly very mate see ya here but I 'm so before word because he doesn 't feel as though what he 's gonna say is going to have much of a change and it 's our job to get out there and make sure that the size of those Wars I was going to change it and and I you talk about some people are understand someone being rich and famous I don 't know who we 're talking about here I am an ordinary person I think you buddy around here is an ordinary person and they have ordinary views and a live ordinary lives and I think we actually represent our people really really well I think you know that to talk about campaign costs you know as part of this process is really what I 'd call a point of order is not about us in our campaign cost you know we stand up because you know we want to go and make a difference and I think anybody who actually wants to step up and make a difference will have a voice because they will be in the community and they 'll make sure their voices who regardless of how much they spend that I campaign so again I urge you to support the sir recommendation I believe that the 14 ward councillor is the right one I think that we I do believe that our large amount of people don 't the scene huge amount of extra cost burden of them through this process yep right here interesting debate some people are obviously more ordinary than others around this table which I find quite an interesting prejudice I think there 's a confusion here between the role of the community board member councillor and I think that 's the point jamie is pride to make the city councillor has the role of representing the whole city not just their community board I think what 's been come through clearly in this process is that the community board level people want that effective local representation and you know I mean I know person I 've been talking about that for ages that local decisions need to be made by local people but he has a different perspective and I can give you an example myself having got involved in new brighton recently it 's not my ward don 't have a lot to do with it and i was called by people over there we 're not happy with some of and get stuff going and that 's what i did and that 's what 's happened so as a city cows that we have a very very wide view not just of our local communities and I think the effective representation for the city is very different to the effective representation for communities and I think also because this as Glenn was saying this talk about all you know certain streets or people not being represented you know grabbing yup worked there for years know the area are very well work with refugee communities in that areas well I kind of resent that implication so I think we 've got to be careful here to not worry too much about where people are living when they 're represent yes far as the community boards go we want people from those specific areas and we want more powers and responsibilities given to those people so I think we 're making a little bit of a meal if this is actually pretty much the situation that we have well and I don 't see that it 's actually a big deal and wrong I support the amendment I support very strong representation at the local level and I 'm very supportive of more focused Community Board elected its and I think hopefully over time we can develop that so that they 're actually taking on lot more power and responsibility and City Council 's are really just dealing with the big issues which we shouldn 't matter where you live but I think as long as there is good representation from around the city in general this isn 't a big city I know my ward very well from top to bottom I can drive through it and 15 minutes and I think the idea that we have to have city councillors elected from specific wards it 's not as important as having thing because that 's why I 'm supporting us okay done thank you i 'm going to speak first to that the 16 and the 14 i seek into this the scene option to choose to 16 so i absolutely believe that it 's now more important than ever in the history of the city that we get good some really good work done by our staff and yanni um I do community for the work that was done and there 's no question that this work was outstanding and the information that was gained from it is very accurate because that people want to add more connection is upsetting to members you I mean I get a lot of calls from local businesses because I am their local councillor as I 'm sure Phil does too literal with regards to the people around this table we all have different qualities and proficient as if you like and that can really help when you 're in your wards so if one 's got a more specific knowledge and something you can rely on each other to sort out those issues for your constituents and that 's the bottom line it 's not about the cost of running an election it 's actually about representation I the comment with regards to you people think of it you know me pretty well broken its back I think we 've achieved a lot but I think we 've got actually a hell more important than ever that those items that need to be dealt with those issues that need to be dealt with as we focusing on our suburban communities such as an hour wards Sid nums spreading shops etc that we have more support for those groups and our staff working on those with their communities so I 'm definitely supporting option two as for the amendment hmm I 'm not sure I have to think about that a wee bit more and listen to some debate yeah Vicky do I haven 't yet made up my mind on the amendment either and I remember actually when I was at high school I got to count the votes in the city council election as a whole lot of people did and it was pre wards and everybody who got elected basically had a name that started with a B or C from from a large list of names that clearly did not necessarily evoke special reactions amongst people and it was interesting to look at a council that was basically from one part of town fairly homogenous and yeah interesting and 's on it so later when i got more involved in more interested in local government end involved i decided i would do my thesis on local government and christchurch on who pays who governs and who benefits started on the work on who pays in terms of local government finance and then decided that i should ask the professor if i can do such a thesis for political science and he told me no it 's clearly not political sciences sociology so my thesis did became only about local government finance and so I 've never quite found out who governs and who benefits from local government and gradually change my job yes but I had to say as I watched in the local government commission which was involved in and that changes in nineteen before 1989 and earth the South Island I watched as counties were try we try to drag them out from almost times we 're basically grandfather 's passed on the ax seat on the council to their grandchildren sons grandsons actually and and complained because commissioners turned up wearing trousers if they were female if you don 't structure local government in such a way that people feel that they are hugely involved in this via town or their district and so I 've always favored wards I think they have transformed the nature of representation in Christchurch and I totally totally favor them but they need to represent some sort of logical community particularly if involved also a community board and I have no problems with community boards having as much power as we can possibly give to them I prefer it and for myself I don 't like single-member Ward 's because I think there is always a risk that some areas miss out from good representation just by accident actually so I actually prefer double member wards so that the risk of that is minimized but the difficulty I have and the amendment so I don 't like the motion and don 't like the amendment precisely like two members Ward and the difficulty I have with this amendment is that it combines areas that I doubt would have combined themselves logically and so the concerns I have particularly are around these combinations have come from those own natural community creation statistics it 's how they would feel themselves how they would naturally align themselves I may be wrong on that and I appreciate that this at least it 's to go out for consultation but I 'm stuck between the one member wards which I don 't like and the three-member ones which don 't make sense here so I 'm not sure her and voting on that in terms of the 1614 entirely pragmatic one costs four hundred and fourteen thousand more and one costs slightly less than now so I 'll go for the one that cost slightly less than now which is the 16-member option so I 'm left sort of betwixt in between on the amendment because the communities that are expressed here and not what I think their community itself would see as logical communities but I don 't like the single member one either because I don 't like to Singa rewards so I might just have to vote with Tim on this one session that can alter slightly all that we can eat we 've got to it we 've got to release and I understand a proposal but what you 're saying but he is that made but we 're putting up a proposal now and I understand it okay I mean I suppose a and I 'm sort of I know I 'm interrupting the debate which I shouldn 't do but and to ask a question but is it possible in the context of between now and the end the actual resolution coming back and what two weeks time is it possible to look at whether some of the mix of the wards could change or is that not not possible consultations they are too but are there not not the boundaries but actually the mix the mix yeah that 's possible sorry ok but if but it would be very difficult if you didn 't make a decision no no I know I know you so we would need to be able to make a decision so so anyway I 'm Pauline you were next thank you will I think it 's a pretty much all bean seed and to just to remind you and we are just putting out a proposal at the moment end and i congratulate the stuff on the pre engagement that 's very proactive and we 've had a bit of a steer from people on that so we knew that people are you more representation which is why ice 16 counselors that will end that will give us a better representation at around what you know closer to the national average which is 16 and a half thousand it will take us to one to nine and twenty thousand and thing is that it will residents perspective as well not just from a counselor perspective have more counselors are standing in a single Ward 's actually makes it easier for people to get to know us and when they want to know us as when something goes wrong and that makes it much easier for them to reach us to connect with us and to communicate with us as counselors and I think that 's really important we had a comment about of it ain 't broke but we 're obliged to do and because of the earthquake population shifts and we have to make sure the wards of them plus and minus ten percent of each other we 've heard of there 's a confusion I think to about the role of a city councilor when we talk about strengthening community boards but we 're not handing everything over to community boards need to be representing how well it says counselors I don 't know if people have a picture of us as counsel is going to be sitting up here just tweaking numbers no we must stay connected to our wards and our people we come to this council table what 's funny Vicki and we also go into bed for our woods now look at this morning was the the hornby traffic issue when I came in here I was actually wanting to support the staff recommendation at listening to the local councillors and putting their views in their community board its views I went into bet for their community and that 's what you do so we all put our you know leans on the city as well that it 's really important that we retain their link with our communities and we don 't just become city councillors sitting around this table in this room and that 's why I will support I 'm not meant and I support 16 counts and 16 boards individual counselors in each world Thank You Jimmy is very difficult you know to make decision but in perceptual I prefer you know this kinda Amendment value invasion of economic support because a moment our situation is still differ from the liger Auckland Council all calendar we are all aware you know cdy all cancer just make decisions regarding to the city wider issue or concern sh 0 regarding local issue all the rely on the local port and also local bhowmik decision and the whole council cannot overwrite in there is kind of but if we review the central government the member parliament election they have focus on each electorate is also the one-hander member member parliament MP is rather than two or three a sage of why because they to make the concept tuner fully aware who is the other no color election they have advantage they ask is because they have a hunter of the party list if you are in the publish that you are eligible you know highly possibility to beginner yield you can contributor to yourself for order a moment structure our palace in moment still a show for this for situation so let 's wider the council one console on behalf you 're kind of your arianus most important whether you 're the candidate of the local other people realize you are the other local issue for however in the last under second term counselor had a few issue issued is not in relation to any local issue that 's the kind of city why issue so absolutely we make the decision is focus on this city why however some of the issue is local if a local one if you are not a counselor now you are fully aware the locals to Asia even because while every did you listen from your the local people local eventuated a sitter so to me I still alight to another repeater in perception maybe this one why because it a number one but if I 'm number two or number three well I still have a possibility but I canalla just consider my personal interest because we are aware not because in ennis the whole city we still have more or less thermal area is high economic social area summer area is a meeting or no social economic area so each area to be have their the kind of local elected member the local councillor on their behalf to bring to the council table so next the way we were crucial and important but we got into the 14 and 16 because I appreciate the staff you know give us a comprehensive that we poor because I only consider one issues because a moment we should all follow funding but we reviewed a 16 single console in the 14 1 it looks like 16 is more cost effective because we can save you know the almost 900 k 900,000 and money and also can play that the this kind of job can fulfill our responsibilities solar I would like to support a 16 council and today it 's difficult I call yani to close the debate I just want to remind members and i thought i 'd just use the local government New Zealand you know how to stand as a candidate or standing as the candidate just to remind people of just just how councils are intended to operate in terms of council decision making generally elected members hold particular views on certain issues and often campaign on them it is these views that are endorsed by the community at election time however after the election elected members are required to recognize and consider the views of all residents and ratepayers and their council local board or community board area when they make decisions and making decisions they must have an open mind with no bias successful elected members balance the mandate provided by their electors with the need to make decisions on behalf of the whole community and future generations and so the argument that is put to us as that when we sit around this council table we do take an overview of the city of course we 're influenced by our experience of our areas them but I don 't have to be elected by the board Pegasus ward to know that to know what the issues are there I live there I 've represented that area and a different capacity for a very long time so it 's not it is it is an ability to separate the two now that doesn 't mean that people don 't sit around this table as representatives we do it 's a representative democracy so I don 't think anyone should think that this is like a board of directors where people just make decisions that are in the best interests and uninfluenced in any way but you are not representing the individual ward interests when you sit here you 're representing the interests of the city as a whole even though you are influenced by your experience my issue around the woods and this is why I 've struggled with this issue for so long I look around this table and I don 't actually see a very diverse group of people and it is diversity and decision making that enables us as humans to deal 've broken the back of anything we have a long way to go as a city and actually the people of Christchurch you 're asking us as a council to step up and be ready to take back the leadership that they 've been looking for from us for a very very long time a long time before any one of us was elected so the point that I 'm making is is that we need to think about this as a strategic decision that will be influenced ultimately by the submissions that we here we absolutely have to get a proposal out in the public arena once we 've made the decision here today we don 't have to feel compelled to vote that way when we after we hear from people but we need to be able to get those views on board and and this is the way to do it I think that it 's a shame and again it 's what we 've been heritage but it 's an inheritance that dates back to a very difficult decision that was made by the local government to merge two wards together and it made the decision that was not a grassroots movement to do that and it was simply to reduce the number from 24 to 12 my view at the time was was that yeast 24 was too many to be an effective governance body for the city but 12 was too few to come to provide for the diversity that you actually do need to have around the table and it isn 't just a gender diversity it is every element of diversity and actually Reverend Jimmy bring to this table a diversity that you don 't see in other parts of the South Island of New Zealand and we have not won Marty member elected to this council not one Pacifica member in fact I think in our history I think there 's been one Pacifica member Lloyd Lewis a Crawley who was elected as a counselor so you know I mean I just think that we need to think more about the need for diversity and decision making tackling the the wicked problems and so I keep getting back to the question decision-making how do we ensure that different parts of our city feel like that they have a voice at this table even though the representative elements are far more you know obvious at the community board level I also worry about the point that Jonnie made and deep down that 's what bothers me and that is that we could put into place and we will put in place the very best delegations that will enable local communities to be in charge of their own decision making but the truth is is that the next council could completely over to knit and that is the one thing that bothers me and I would much rather get to a situation where the government would allow a council like ours to develop community to develop local boards and the way that all contests with their own budgets with their own responsibilities and not accountable to the council per se but accountable to their communities for the decisions they made and the only way that we can access the local board structure as if we amalgamate well I 'm not going to force now they 're very busy with their own recovery components and I 'm sure so one would feel exactly the same way I think that we should continue to work collaboratively with Selwyn and waimakariri as we are doing through the Utes but I think that we need to be talking to central government about the need to trust the city to develop a local board model that would work for Christchurch and that i think would resolve the problem for me so my issue is around diversity supporting decision-making I really look forward to hearing what the people of Christchurch have to say whatever option we put out for consideration and that we all approach that with an open mind _"

    "text": "yani off because we 've got a number of cancers say it 's their personal view that this is the best way I just I just want to bring you back to the purpose of what we 're actually doing and that is that we are looking at the election of counters that will provide effective representation of communities of interest within the city and we 're also looking at the guidelines which highlight what is effective representation of communities of interest as factors and I want to go through what those elements are one avoiding arrangements that may create barriers to participation for example not recognizing residents familiarity and identity with an area during elections to not splitting recognized communities of interest between electoral subdivisions three not grouping together two or more communities of interest that share few commonalities of interest for accessibility size and configuration of an area including the populations reasonable access to its elected members and vice versa and then and the final one which i think is really important to understand what we 're doing which is identifying communities of interest for effective representation the electoral area we 've hit a lot of things about the fact that counters are there to represent the entire city xray that is not what would be tasked to do what we think task to do is not go and talk about how we get the best possible governance for the setting which of course is an important aspect of what we want to achieve as councillors around this table that is to actually look at how do we get elected members ability to effectively represent the views of their electoral area so unfortunately some of the debate that 's been seed is totally wrong in terms of what the job we 're doing today in terms of coming up with the electoral system because it 's based on communities of interest and in fact it 's how we get effective representation that is the key driver behind us it 's called a representation review so when hear things like it 's you know it 's quality not quantity it totally misses the point I do take exception to the issue that all of an all-black stood they would to say I know it was me when I my hand out I 'd really great sit Fillion although when I do this to me when I first stood for counsel I did have to go up against grams thorne hey and I did beat up so there is hope for anyone out there to get elected even if you 're not an all black and you know I just think it 's really important that we do and some people have talked about the diversity reflect on what just happened in Auckland the hero Bren a really interesting story around the complete lack of diversity around the decision in the corporate structures of the new Auckland super-city Council and it was a fascinating article looking at the diversity of the population compared to the lack of diversity around the super city in terms of people that were making decisions and had huge rolls of influence so I actually think it is healthy to have a diversity around this council table and I think that the way in which we get effective representation of our communities is to look at we 've had we can talk about all the government 's issues later but that 's not of what we 're doing today so I urge you to keep it in the back of your mind when you vote the other thing is that if we pass the five Ward option I think we 're at huge judicial risk because actually you can 't go through an option of wards without looking at what those factors are and I can 't see how any of those wards in terms of the five wards proposed it had the opportunity has taken to account those factors and we can 't we don 't have any written evidential basis for making that decision compared to the huge work that 's gone on from the working party over the options that have been put forward today so I you know just caution you on that um I totally dismiss the the view that if you 're if you 've got a big Ward and you 've got three counters in that ward that they can all work together and and and but if you community board that somehow those counters shouldn 't be making decisions on things that went in the award it 's like asking the Environment Committee not to make decisions on the Hagley pharame board because there 's no higley fair amid committees counselors on it or saying that the counselors that our honor unelected from that ward and therefore they shouldn 't be able to make decisions and in fact in the debate we heard that insects some counselors have been going out and helping other Ward 's around the city and I respect that because when we get around this council table we do have the ability to go depending on our interest depending on our roles and portfolios or spokesperson ships or whatever committee we 're cheering or working party were involved both it 's absolutely appropriate that we go and help those areas and any way that we see first so I just I just really can include by saying think about the purpose of what today is about it is not about working out how we can best possible governance for the city that is about of interest and i leave you with the thought that you know some people have made reference to the costs and i ask you what is the cost of democracy and what is the cost of not having democracy aust comparison in contrast to things like appointments of crown managers of unelected commissioners and expensive consultants there is a cost of not having democracy in our city which we in this region unfortunately only know too well so think about that when we think about the small costs associated with a change to our electoral system the fact that we 've had the status quo for our little system for quite a few years and of course there will be a cost associated with change they 're always says there is a small cost to pay for having a democratic system in our city and in our region and I urge you not to be taken them by there is an argument for the decision you make today around the communities of interest thank you thank you alright so we 'll start with the amendment I think it might be favor press yes and those opposed press know that is lost so the next motion is the _"

you attended jamie what did the community say about no that 's not an order sorry no no that 's not that 's not an order where he 's entitled to move an amendment he doesn 't have to answer that other than a debate so no no it 's not a question to ask him he wasn 't part of the working group no but we all had community meetings to attend uh over this representation review we all attended well i 'm sorry i didn 't attend anything i 'm happy to answer but in saying that it would just be anecdotal and to be honest it 's kind of dropping the level of debate yeah no no he doesn 't have to answer that question you got another question no um david um just a question of process with community subdivision and three from the other or were they just elected amendment or in the actual proposal i 'm just asking a question i 'm trying to find it i can 't see it in the paper so in in the paper that was put forward that was proposed that the community board areas would elect uh people they were the community boarders would be subdivided and elect people from their subdivisions and i think that whole i think that holds for councillor goff 's amendment as well which which is interesting is that you 'd end up with two different models of voting in the um yeah you 'd end up with two different models of voting that 's right that 's right so that so you 'd be voting for the ward at large in some respects it would actually be from an administrative point of view better that it was one or the other but um more confusing for the voters but it 's pretty i mean that 's kind of more decisive for me the current position in relation to the banks yeah so three for the members bought from the ecoroa subdivision two members are evicted the amendment would we be proposing that the community board members be elected oh no no it makes no difference because you 'd you 'd have the you 'd have all of the candidates across the ward just printed on both papers like you do with the i mean you 'd have to have you 'd have to have a subdivision one for you do you have a separate paper for community boards and councillors what you do yeah yeah okay well then it wouldn 't matter because electing at large genuinely at large all right okay so um right well we have an amendment on the table i propose that we basically um uh debate uh the the the um the the issue um uh uh with the other the wider issue so i 'll put the amendment um at the end of the debate and i 'm still not quite sure oh it 's been moved as an amendment so i 'll put it first um at the end of the debate but we 'll debate the whole lot together all right so um so it doesn 't i just want to talk first to the to the amendment and what 's interesting and those of us on the working party and those of us who have read the information and read the information from staff particularly will see the repetition of the phrase effect of representation now effective representation um i believe is better served by the amendment because of the pairing up or the joining up of councillors in an area for the reasons i think that councillor lonsdale raised whether it 's sickness whether it 's holiday whether it 's issues for example in our ward when you 're looking at flooding there is quite often a lot of stuff going on at one time so effective representation i believe and would argue is better served by the amendment that councillor golf has has raised i 'm also hearing a lot about the consultation with the public and what the feedback from the public was and consultation with the public as i 've said before this chamber is important it is key to our process and it is key to our democracy however consultation is and we as elected members are in receipt of i would suggest in a lot of cases more information than some of the public and our staff are in receipt of more information and we certainly have got more practical experience as counsellors working with other counsellors at the moment as the system currently stands the shared workload the shared responsibility and the shared skills to be frank you know we all have different areas different areas of knowledge and experience that is really important when you 're working in a ward i actually think the status quo works really well i understand the requirement for revisiting this how we the city is still in flux and with people still under a lot of stress and changes in the city even the change of ward names is something that concerns me because i quite like the stability of papanui in the ward names that we know um i believe that what we have would work better with stronger community board support and stronger ward hq support as well again i do appreciate we have to address what 's happening because the um population um so i actually probably i 'm unsure what i 'm going to do as far as the 1416 goes but i 'm definitely supporter of the amendment because i believe it shows a much greater effect of representation for the city um jamie thanks um i 'll speak to the amendment because i obviously moved that and then i wasn 't expecting to but i 'll try and tag on the end then where i 'm at with the 14 or 16 or the numbers because that that is a separate issue but um i i think you have an understanding of and if you can give me a wee bit of grace because it 's combining i 'll give you some advice um the wording 's been worked through with staff and it results really in just proposing that instead of being elected for each subdivision with an award and later joined up with the other one subdivision councillor in the white award that the total number of councillors the ward has would simply be elected by that ward as a whole so that it and it doesn 't touch the community boards and the subdivisions there they would still exist it just simply says that instead of councillors being i 'm just repeating exclaims looking at confused there it 's just that instead of so in your ward then for instance instead of one being from burwood and one being from coastal there would be two councillors elected for that burwood coastal area under the foot so um and the only other point i 'd make too just on what yani said originally uh might not have been yani sorry if not but around you know a burwood city council the whole point of me promoting this is so we don 't have people saying they 're the burwood city councillor or the strong city council or the coastal city council you 're a christian city councillor at community board cool get really parochial that 's great grassroots stuff tackle those things but the whole point of a counselor is to have that higher overarching view and that is the intent around this and again i 'm keeping this very separate from the from first the amendment is about quality first and foremost good and effective representation relies on good and representatives in the final waimaari ward over the past few years no area or suburb in our water has had more attention more resource more love given to it than bishop dale that 's an absolute fact and no one could dispute that you know we 've um we 've assisted to have a men 's shed community developed a new new initiative which celebrates in a yearly event celebrating everything that the bishop day award is about it 's fantastic in fact we um we actually fought for and secured funding against all the staff recommendations for a purpose-built and brand new bishopdale library and community centre so neither the two councillors nor any community board actually lives in bishop dale but it 's incredibly well represented and i would say that it 's better represented than actually any other subdivision for lack of a better word in in in this proposed area um i guess if you i want to give you a real life example if you were going to 14 ward model for example in the spreydon beckon award as opposed and you had two outstanding councillors running in beckenham but no one particularly effective in spreydon why would you choose to have one of those outstanding ones miss out in favor of a dud that 's the essence of it and from from a resident 's perspective they will want to contact a councillor for councillor related issues that was on their ballot paper electing one councillor per subdivision means that if they are a dud or even if they 're great but if they 're away or they happen to be on holiday or they 're bogged down with another significant issue then that subdivision is going to get absolutely left out in the cold there 's no one to share the load with or to tackle an issue with together and it 's all well and good to say that after the election all the subdivisions within that ward are joined up so there 's more than one council to go to but it just isn 't going to happen those other councillors will have their on going to them you 're going to create an inherent reluctance rightly or wrongly for a councillor to be expected to freely take on council-related work for people that don 't won 't and can 't even it 's not going to be particularly fair on the representatives and it 's certainly not fair on the community secondly for this and my final point and more important and my driver around the amendment the most important aspect that i see is that it 's a safeguard against falling into neighborhood battles and silo mentality not just at the council table but perhaps even more damaging would be to have councillors put into the silos even within at the community boards if the community board members are elected by a subdivision within the ward that 's where the grassroots parochialism can come from but you 're going to be wanting the councillors the councillors that are there to bring that overarching big picture view which electing them by a subdivision as well as the board members just does not bring now there 's not much more detrimental to a city i digress look the point is having one sole counsellor elected to their smallest subdivision within award only encourages each to joust for patch superiority and ultimately miss the bigger picture you know by all means be parochial as a community board member for that subdivision the oath that you swear is to be looking at but not as a counsellor as a counselor your oath is a different one and that 's to be making decisions outside of that and in the best interest of the entire city i can see it now you know as the strong councillor or as the wolston councillor it 's not what we want we need to be doing all we can to ensure that the councillors take a holistic view and have a wider decision-making hat on whenever possible and it 's fine for the community boards or subdivisions to be getting amongst those local issues at a neighbourhood level irrespective of why the city matters but that 's not your oath you take as a councillor electing councils at large across the city would be one way to stop that but that perspective at community board level because then you wouldn 't have a counselor on a community board i think that it 's important for them to be there electing the councillors for the wide award and not by a subdivision within them does however allow for that important distinction to be made and for councillors to bring that bigger picture city-centric perspective it captures the important distinction between those two different roles fix the actual oath you take that is the basis for the amendment there um overall look i 'll listen to the debate um around the 14 or the 16 or the 19 or um as that was put in there later um i have an open mind to this we 're obviously going to be asking feedback from the community and i look forward to seeing what that is but at this point what we need to do and what my job is to do like all of you is to put what we believe to be our best foot forward and to say here 's what we think makes sense from my perspective right now what we should be striving for all the time and uh personally where i 'm at and i look i look forward to being convinced but i can 't see that adding counsellors or community board members makes a jot of difference in quality that 's my perspective and i stand to be convinced later but you look at the likes of the 14 ward model on page 237 you 've got cost of 414 thousand dollars to achieve that and i don 't believe that you 're going to get close to half a million dollars benefited and if you look at the other option which is the 16 ward model on page 242 don 't be fooled by this either it says negative twenty four thousand dollars that 's doesn 't mean that it 's negative twenty four thousand dollars cheaper to what we currently have status quo it 's twenty four thousand dollars cheaper than in my view absurdly it spends a four hundred and fourteen thousand dollar model i added up the numbers and um the current cost for our council outside of the deputy mayor change at all under the current rates for all councils and community board members currently it 's 2.091 million dollars under the 16 model it 's two points so that that 's the difference so it 's um you 're looking at about three hundred thousand dollars more so it 's it 's not it 's still a more expensive model than the status quo and i really struggle with that i think most important thing is you say what was broken the reality is we 're being asked to relook and review this because the law requires it okay that 's fine so what 's changed the boundaries have changed or should perhaps change because population shift from perhaps the east to the west so i would look at addressing that but i truly do not believe that adding more people makes anything more effective and efficient that 's what worries me about it but i look forward to seeing what the consultation uncovers um so for me and i could still change my mind before the vote on the 14 or the 16 but i actually can 't i don 't believe that you get a tangible benefit as a result of it so for me it 's like asking which what type of fish would you like in your seafood milkshake they don 't sound very appealing whatever way you go to me and that 's just where i 'm at but look it 's a it 's a transparent process and we 're asked in the community they may share my views they may not but i just don 't believe that the quantity that 's what we should be striving for yeah i i don 't normally do this but what you stated wasn 't accurate so the um the reason for the increase in the cost actually is about the um increased remuneration that has been passed by the remuneration authority as well i was using the latest numbers i actually talked about that so what we 've set out in that table is that the 16 board model is actually less than the status quo yeah the status quo isn 't today than today but that 's interesting though because today that all members salaries equals two point zero nine one thousand dollars what was that one yeah and i added it up forty community board members sixteen councillors no no there was one point of order that 's obviously yeah incorrect so it is incorrect and so but but the thing is is that that that i wanted to kind of right this one and i don 't really do that because it normally you know if it were a parliamentary debate it would be a debating debatable matter but the trouble was is that the way that this would be reflected is that yeah so so that isn 't accurate the figures that we have uh so um glenn and then david uh phil andrew thank you marin apologies for making councillor golf and yourself wriggled with uh before i didn 't mean to you know rock the boat over that question i thought anyway that 's fine it was out of bounds but correct yes thank you my perspective uh many of us here have a social constituency apart from a geographic one so my view on this is that city we need to ensure that we the voices of those in woolston aranui linwood eddington casebrook jelly park are represented going forward the proposed amendment means these communities and the chance for these communities to have their voices heard would arguably and strongly so be diminished in a large award in this city 's history is it any surprise that the in the know hub is actually located at eastgate it 's a place where those who may not have the skills to articulate their insurance please heard a natural or rather is a natural disaster amplifies in my view existing social conditions and it seems to be well known that disasters worldwide disproportionately affect lower society so socioeconomic communities the amendment in my view would not provide an equitable platform for our lower socio-economic communities in this city to have a voice and in this regard i i think yes bishop dale very good we 've heard a lot about the library there i 'm aware of the surrounding social housing members of the community i lived in that ward for seven or eight years but i do housing residents in brinwa who will represent the multicultural community in arangi the children of that former school who will knock on the doors on the northern side of clyde road build community in tough places like hooker avenue and articulate the anxiety over housing new zealand intensification in jelly park the last council got itself into trouble uh and this is my view my take on it because it stuck to bau after a natural disaster this status quo as councillor goff has actually said uh proposal uh keeps us to a business as usual model we 've had a huge uh natural disaster uh there 's been quite significant socio-geo political change in the city and we need to respond we can 't stick to what we have now we need to ensure that the voices of those in our community are heard and that 's why you heard such a big pushback from those in the new brighton community i know some may have found at times difficult to hear that but actually at times you do have to move with some primitive actions in some places and that those communities are resourced i my viewers that the original recommendation meets the local government commission guidelines in respect and communities of interest in terms uh effective representation of those communities and the fairness of the representation of the electors and that third aspect of this and so i urge you please to support what is a fair approach kiwis have in their psyche this fair go for all and i feel that the original recommendation actually responds to that uh through what we are being asked to do here i truly feel that if we go down the path of the amendment that a lot of communities whose voices do need to be heard will actually be subsumed in those please urge you to support the original recommendation dave _"

    "text": "public your sleigh hey but it certainly correct that okay final decision right I haven 't had a chance to look at this thoroughly it 's been raised with me and understand that at an earlier review the advice given to counsel as the N why 's that everybody had to be at the hearings every minute they would I haven 't been able to find you anywhere based on statute for that I 've said to Mary and Jenny I feeling us that it 's the same as what we the situation we have with long-term plans where if someone has to be away from the hearing for an hour or two that 's fine they can come back as provided they 've brought up to date with what 's been said and their absence and be given any written material there 's been provided well this is the joy of live streaming we can actually catch up with things you exactly yes but but I think we 'll take proper advice on that so I will take your considered advice on up it was certainly what we would law and the other thing is that once once we then publish the final as it were it isn 't the final people have a not an opportunity to objections are heard by the local government Commission and they would travel here for those objections to be heard right good our pool it 's like after I was like it 's to test a theory till on the amendment and here in the commentary around that 's not really what you read through the consultation I can 't actually see any label and lie to me how it was any different the fact is you 're still going to have a single counselor world that when it comes to the community boards that those multi awards come together as one 10 you still have a fifth of representation from a single count actually come together as a single community board with two or three councillors which also begs the question of let 's say one councillors away or sick and the obviously important stuff Adam that you need to be handled by a counselor that other counselor the other counselors so that is not what 's in the amendment so the amendment is clearly saying one can 't slope reward it 's not saying no it 's just one counts when I linked to counselor pro ward but you 've got a multi-award being outside that science it 's it once a multi that the the amendment saying multi counselors peer award that 's not them coming together I think you described it is still one counselor award in the ilume coming together for community boards no will this one saying that a number of councillors are elected for the ward yeah so instead of one counselor for coastal one counselor for because we 're going to combine it with hauled in there aren 't we at one counselor for sprayed on you would have three councillors for sprayed and halls will and coastal so is that I mean I 'm only joking about the combinations but yeah to it but the point the point the point is is that is that that 's the comparison so what Jamie 's proposing as an amendment so instead of having one pure combination that 's actually really so if you win sprayed and will stone in Kashmir and had three counts as elected for their yeah okay of all councillors coming from Kashmir yeah so riccarton hornby halls wall so it under the proposal that we have there would be one counselor for riccarton you don 't have to be loving and the board that you stand and you just have to notify that and your disclosure so riccarton one horn beeped one and halls for one compared to three to represent riccarton hornby horse well yeah that 's the difference questions yep Yanni oh sorry felt look I did acknowledge fell and then I ignored them that can do okay and again thank you so much for a huge amount of group I enter to ask the question before about in relation to how the amendment perhaps doesn 't hasn 't fit it fitted the previous report but I want to ask something quite specifically around there too it 's really in terms of its relationship with the local will it correct so it 's really in what and I probably justify but it really what way does this amendment here in what way is it aligned with the local electro act I guess I 'm thinking and what you made some reference already 22 like community interests and commonalities but it was wondering if you could clarify that so the local elite relented and you would have seen in the report on the 14th that came the 14th of May the local electorate requires that council consider effective representation for communities of interest the guidelines put out by the Commission said that the first step is to identify your communities of interest and then to identify how you effectively represent them so that free consultation identified communities of interest and then identified from the feedback the most effective way of representing them was the proposal that was put up one counselor the community of interest but presumably all plan meets that test yeah so ya know it 's different legislation but one can assume that well is it different legislation when it comes to the local electro eight they bought your boards are now they 've got boards but this meet the requirement of effective community it 's right even for the counselors and that boiling my second question are but two other presumably my answer Phil 's Christian were you as well only if you want me to you just you mention me what 's that when it 's appropriately if that 's why don 't go eat I 'm it aligns in the same way as it does now you have two counselors for spray tan Heath get and have done since two thousand of which obviously you and Tim other counselors and I 'm proposing a feat to these days so really my next question is in relation to that sort of thing and like I think mirror you might have referred to and to de like socioeconomic factors number in fact how they can be influenced influence of ocean and like for example and you refer to that the wards the board 's baton combined more the term scanner and myself represent and tell you there 's an example where in fact spate inhibit wise the two counselors live in the one ward and I accept know in terms of that occurring if we if in fact we surf this amendment is supported you 've got a table on page 214 with the combinations of community of the peculiar boards and wards and how they would be I guess I just wonder if you could aside for Kashmir one we 're in fact when we look at that I would have thought potentially besides woolston missing out in terms of voter turnout and lower socio economics different so status that possibly speedin would too but I just wonder if you might comment on the other combined Ward 's in any areas that in fact potentially because of those voting voter issues may actually miss out on having a counselor being elected from the beauty of interest for their small award it 's difficult to hypothesize about so all I can or we can relate because what some community boards or some community meetings suggested to us so so and that was concerns around federal my Marty area or that fiddle tune here would Maclean 's potential area as if you combine that you may get dominated areas that came up at one meeting dirt was amazed that it was soon he raised and spending his area their concern about sprayed and not being she doesn 't have to be resolved by anecdote there is evidence that actually highlights thus which are called the electoral returns and if you look at the electoral returns then you will find that to stand and it 's the easy comparison is when there were twenty four wards and that they were unceremoniously jam together the wrong way because it did actually mean that you put on a high voter turnout ward with a low voter turnout ward and I 'll use beer would Pegasus because it 's the one that I knew very well beer would Pegasus was just two representatives from beer would you needed to have an equivalent turnout and Pegasus to even run the run the slight you know sort of possibility of winning one of those seats and it wasn 't until one of the incumbents actually retired that actually that change with an exceptional candidate as I recall at the time and in that certainly you didn 't won the support of booooored you didn 't win the seat that 's right and that was in some of the background information that was CD out about that history about and it was so heavily sprayed in heath could i believe and some other way so so the information of the data both nationally and internationally supports what counselor clearwater was saying is that you if you match PR people you get low voter turnout areas with no representation the in fact the interesting point and i think it is worth reflecting on is that the council at the time the recommendation that put to the to the out for you know public notification was actually a 16 ward model which is interesting that if we chose the 16 ward model today then that would actually reflect exactly the position that the Christchurch City Council got to and 2004 yeah yeah sorry yeah and I 've got one other question it 's really when I look at the map attachment to on the looking for Teen Vogue equally look at the map on it should be look at the proposed warrior there of kashmir and muslims praying for one seems to me that every this amendment is supported but in fact it 's almost like heading towards voting at large and would that have potential to actually lower the voting turnout as well based on the research of dr. June Drake 's has entered to you this could potentially low voter turnout no I might add that nearly all the workshops we had but particularly in the halls were born we and record in areas in and end in the lynnwood area the most citizens there talked about this and they talked about it in terms of wanting to know their counselor as well and so they wanted their counselor to possibly live as near as possible to them but they were also concerned that you would get a cluster like somebody said in horn Lee what does the person living in up erect record and know or care about hornby basic that we promote busy so said it 's certainly something that 's in the minds of people that came along to the discussions and about term from one suburb say about the next suburb you could actually apply that to anywhere and Christchurch what would people are Merivale know about what 's happening in phenyl turn so argument could be applied across right down to the small mesh box but he could not um term and then Jimmy um just I guess this will thank you to Yanni the staff the mints what you 've done on this and the phpbb it 's certainly very very good just consumed about some of the terminology with regards to you know things that some of the area 's won 't what I lack of representation for as a council I mean I know my ward extremely well I 've lived in every suburb that starts with ASUS including Eddington etc so although I love and Kashmir now I do know it extremely well so however you do all throat but I guess when we go through and we 're getting the feedback from the community through the hearings etc whether we go for 16 or 14 or whether we 're going for is on page 238 regards to each Ward itemize so you 've got 16 boards and 16 counselors or on them over to the page which young Phil pointed out for a two page 240 whether you 've got some of the three and one with one we 're going to get that feedback from the community which we represent and will so I mean although we will come up with something that we support here today we 're key is to get the feedback and as Jonnie it said that feedback was very strong and as yourself so said about the numbers that people want the most critical thing is that the council does read it reached a decision that you can go out consultation on that is our biggest risk is that if you don 't meet the statutory requirements you know it 's a serious breach so you do have to make a decision that can go to consultation you can at the end of consultation and the end and change all right question yani and then Jimmy sorry i did call Jimmy Foose but look Yanni you ask you a wanted to understand from the proposed amendment how it meets the guidelines from the local government commissioned the 2014 so the 2014 guidelines in terms of determining effective representation of communities interest and how about speakers actually would be applied across the five would I think what I mean I guess what I 'm trying to try to understand as we 've been through those tests with the the other three options that we haven 't_''_955.519 for the five reward so can we get with other business moving it or whether staff can provide advice as to how those factors have been considered and that and make the point for counselors that there are new guidelines so despite what 's happened previously the 2014 guidelines on you and do require a different kind of thinking of local wards compared to what possibly was done last one it is that right but are there new guidelines are there new guidelines you sir the Commission has issued new guidelines are they were the ones that were attached to the name yes how do they differ from the previous guidelines just just just really apart from I mean they do stick through the same three step process I did fake news event us yep I did fire effective representation can do just the only consider fair representation so it 's not notice and it was the way it was when these Ward 's that we currently have we 're approved there is some love yep and very quickly just just to their that the subdivisions have meet the guidelines of the grassroots representation for the communities of interest that 's not being proposed to to be abolished the community bought be elected by the subdivisions so on the fourteenth we actually will object use the 16 Ward models example because you moved it so for instance frame Austin Kashmir to community board let 's propose with something says instead of one it would be three councillors for their wide award because the earth you take is a counselor is different than the earth but I 'm trying to understand I understand it the community boards yeah but the test the guidelines that we take into account when we factor through North awards should wards and for the council rewards here 's some quite clear guidelines as to the consideration and I 'm really struggling to understand how five actually meets those when you when you look at brookhaven you know brookhaven going all the way out to brooklyn 's for example in the war though they would have they represent representation through the subdivisions so your attic Councilman Jim community board one at marras oh I 've answer the questions may go in circles oh yeah anyway them in bits I guess a debating matter so um Jimmy and then there 's all these questions right okay Ellie and then clean it quick quickly okay three questions the first one regard into lumber of cameo for the relevant associate three options the single or council would a concentration air if we review this information if the 14 a single council would have eight communipaw 49 comical members but if increase to the 16th single council water Council reduced to saving kamila 442 nipple members but absence Reaper absolutely Napoli here you know it 's a supplementary if a 19 the coming aboard then 46 the amiable members I don 't know how to reach in there my question is like that is the if you have eight coming Paul 14 the single council then you increase us to the 16th council but reduce one company police recent reasonable but regarding 19 the counselor but you still increase the one come nipple so they I went to aid I don 't know Lisa logic that they should nail so that was all around trying to configure made sense Oh at the under-14 model that was pulling those wards and to what was a configuration that appeared to be an effective arrangement for those awards and that 's that 's another committee board set turned out with 16 was more appropriate and more effective to cluster them and to seven wards and for the 19 model it was clustering them and so it was actually about trying to pull the wards together into water community a better community of artists for community board so that 's how the different configurations of numbers of community board and worked out okay thank you second question is regarding each you need a cost thirty four thousand dollars for 14 or members the these thirty four thousand dollars is for the operation cost for each war for each day poor members so the three four thousand dollars is waters the new roofs in air renew action authorities allow allowance or salary freaking new board member plus their direct their direct costs the 348 is for the running of the whole community board okay so there is so that 's all the secretariat the you know facilities secretariat advertising support staff etc so 34,000 as the cost per community board member 348 is for to run a whole community board okay thank you last equation and we got into this amendment I 'm not sure we did it Jamie can answer my question not unless you based on this amendment my question is that how to you know to fit in those in other than numbers because wider if 14 are single cancelled the war we have eight community poll if this one I 'm not not sure how to fit in or either 16 we have seven come near each voices 3 councillor plus only one single console how to fill in right I will try disregard the numbers Jimmy for the council 's because it 's irrelevant and the simplest way to side is that there is no change to the numbers at all it 's simply how the councillors are elected in their ward so under the 14 would model for example in record on whom be as well as they call it which is your wood under the 14 ward model that 's the same story to both of them but it reca means that you have one councillor for record on they 144 look for the community boards there were three community board members curriculum three community board members for home beat reportable it 's a counselor what if it subdivisions then join out for the wider world at the end of it to make three in total what this proposed under their model is to simply say that well the community board members will still subdivisions you know record on whom be that the counselors running three would be elected within the whole community the laker are 14 you know single hung counts of water because you calculator he said five would each one is for the the three counselor am i right history as one single was 13 but in here how to calculate they go to 36 Shimon they won 't see this here but a central woolston they look into that too so these are these are only a whack I 'm fine thanks monster is just one way of the way you slice it all of us is just saying as the subdivisions are irrelevant for counselors because they would have an overarching Ward role whereby proposed be it I 'm to or for whatever modern mothers that they 's not the subdivision father community boarding same price no difference to me it doesn 't over anything it 's just how it 's made up thank you thank you _"

    "text": "yes will recommence the meeting and perhaps staff assisting us on the representation review could come to the table I 'm not going to deal with the sister said he wasn 't until after this right so I just kind of wanted to make a couple of comments first one of us that there 's been obviously considerable public interest in the subject since the measure was first put on on the agenda and of course you know items do go on the agenda before the council has an opportunity to debate them so there 's obviously a lot of commentary that precedes a discussion such as the one that we 're going to have today something that seems to be absent from the discussion so far as an understanding that this is a legal process that we 're required to go through under the local government aid and I would perhaps draw people 's attention to Clause nineteen eight of the local electro act 2001 which which says that a territorial authority must determine by resolution and in accordance with this part whether the members of the territorial Authority district as a whole so that 's your at large election by the electors of two or more awards or in some cases by the electors of the district as a whole in other cases by the electors of each ward of the district and then it talks about where you 've determined to have sorry when you 're determined to have Ward 's the proposed name and proposed boundaries of each Ward and the number of members proposed to be elected by the electors of each Ward the proposed number of elected members of any we 're not covered by the local board section whether the elected members of any local border proposed to be elected by the electors of the local board area as a whole no I don 't even need to go through there the most important one is this the determination required as required by law by subsection 1 must be made by territorial authority at least once an every period of six years after the year in which the first determination was made so you can do it every three years but you must more than six years without doing a representation review we decided to do as it will undertake a slightly different approach with this representation review and that was to go out and engage with communities in quite a different way so rather than start from the top down we started from the bottom up and n boys I don 't like the word bottom grassroots we started from the grassroots up and we engaged with a number of people that really hadn 't engaged with the council before and in a way we 're quite deliberate and the way that we were able to engage people when a conversation about this I have to say that one of the issues that is challenging for us as a city is that when the banks peninsula when banks peninsula and christchurch city i believe were technically dissolved and then re-emerged as a single council it created an issue for us with a corolla why we were and the last time we were in front of the local government commission they were pretty clear that we can 't continue to have separate community way that we have done that but they certainly accepted that there was an usher around acha robbery were from a community board perspective but they said no more can you have this huge disparity and the numbers of population and this is an issue for any part of New Zealand that has large tracts of land but very few people populating those large streets of men so we have to bring thus entire sweeping war done to our city we leave the community board and all of the proposals that we 're going to be discussing today we leave the community board there in a corollary were but it does create an issue and in fact many of the discussions that we 're having around the type of wards that will be discussing inside the city boundary are all predicated on this huge decision about having to bring this large Ward geographically but population-wise a very small Ward and to the rest of the city arrangements and a lot of the juggling has actually occurred around that one single decision and the irony of it all is that if boundary as a city and we decide to go through holes wall we literally have to enter Selwyn District Council in order to get there the only way that we can get to to occur or if we want to stay within our own boundaries and not use any of someone 's roads we would have to go through the littleton tunnel or over the Gibby 's past so so so that creates a number of issues but it does mean that we as a as a city council dealing with district council issues on a day-by-day basis so but in it it does impact on the discussion that we 're having here so I think that there was a view that certainly I 'd seen expressed in some quarters that we were doing this because we just wanted to we 're doing this because we have to end and actually what I always wanted was that this would be a mechanism for engaging communities and a serious conversation about how do you formulate boundaries that then become decision-making frameworks because the more decision-making that we can delegate to those so relevant and so important to the discussion so I wanted to just put that on the record a legal requirement to review its called a representation review it 's reviewing our representation arrangements we are legally it would be unlawful for us not to do it and this tomb so I 'd like to hand over to Yanni who cheered the the working group that brought together a range of elected members both from the council and from community board in order to bring forward these options for our consideration today thank you jaani think you just really want to start off by acknowledging the huge amount of work that staff have done in this regard at the start you talked about taking a grassroots up approach to this engagement and that 's exactly what 's happened this has been a huge process when councillors women thought of its long-term plan and it 's just a plain review to go out and connect with local people in local communities to understand how they feel about their representation representation requirements and I think it 's really important to note that counselors this is about what our community is telling us in terms of how they wish to be represented that to me is actually the test of this process and the test of the resolutions that we pass not what we individually philosophically ideologically think not what we think will benefit us individually the most at a personal level but AG how do we get a system of local democracy in our city that is fair and effective and that recognizes distinct communities of interest so it was overwhelming in my view the feedback from p bol was that they wanted relatively small geographical areas in significantly smaller broad areas than the current that we then week that we then what we currently have there were there was feedback that talked about people being more likely to vote when they knew who their candidates work they were standing in their wards having a lower ratio of population to councillors and really also the fact that small awards enabled closer connection between councillors and communities thus enabling better representation at this point I think it 's interesting to note that the is 1 to 16 and a half thousand and when you look at the options that we 've brought forward it 's interesting to go through the 14 the 16 in the nineteen because as we went through our engagement what we heard from our community again the majority of participants was that they would like to have a ratio somewhere from between 12 15 thousand to one to twenty thousand and so when you look at the options that we 've actually developed you start at the 14 which is one to twenty one thousand to one to twenty six thousand so there 's a range between a plus minus ten percent each Ward has its own unique situation but that is effectively what the 14 does so that doesn 't really make the feedback that we 've had the 16 it has a kind of more firmer imprint and terms of what people ask for one to 19,000 21 to 20,000 so it 's got it 's probably got again a good reflection of what people have said as does the 19 option which is one to 16,000 sexting and the 19 options are really the ones that reflect what the community has see the the thing that the other points that people made was that their lives have contracted into their local areas plus it is quite there 's been a resurgence and call activities local things happening as a result of the impacts of the earthquake now we know that those won 't last forever but certainly over the next six years as this representation roof formulates of rewards those I think are critical considerations that we should take into account so there 's been a huge amount of work gone into this process this is as the mayor said this is the initial proposal and this is the chance for people to have their say so we 're not making a firm decision today we 're trying to go out with a Rapoza lat balances what we 've heard from local communities and I think you know option to the 16 would model with single-member Ward 's does that I think you get wards that due balance the need for local representation and keep community that 's a good it 's a good starting position and if we 've got it wrong we 'll hear from people will hear from the public and communities if they want if they want more counselors or less counselors but that is actually a good middle middle ground approach I think to recognizing what people have seen the thing is is that I just want to emphasize because I know that there 's an amendment going to be cut up shortly and in some ways it 's disappointing because it 's I respect the right for Kansas to make a mean that I just want you to understand that we have gone through a huge amount of work to understand the different aspects of what makes up local wards and there 's a number of things in here that are set up in terms of the local electoral act in terms of consideration and guidelines and that is looking at things like voter turnout it is looking at things like socio-economic areas it is looking at where geographical boundaries go around communities so these things cannot easily just be a lot of time to understand and try and calculate and that has been a huge focus of the staff as they 've gone through and met the different ward options that we 've had to 14 the 16 and the 19 and and you know I just really want to place it on record that there 's been a huge amount of work going into working out those wards so getting away from the three ward options that have been developed as you know is at this late stage in this process without their full consideration i think as there 's a little bit concerning that was as it was to happen so um you know fine i just i just want to make the point that in christchurch in particular that actually we 've seen a huge loss of local democracy and i think this has been reflected in some of the sentiment that people have put through we no longer have an elected a ken and we won 't have one for a few years yet to 2019 we 've had an appointed Health Board which is lot of functions that we would normally do as a city taken away from us that are looking sick hopefully through the transition to come back so I think that 's really important that we are the face of our local community for many decisions and things happening in our city that aren 't necessarily things to do with council but people want someone to talk to understand and help them explain what 's going on and so yesterday I was at meetings and bromley dealing with a Ken issues as much as it was council issues or I was in beachfl road and ricklefs last night as well as iska and these are you know all communities that councillors represent that are accountable by going and attending meetings and there was one of the things that came through that people like to see local Catholic local elected representatives at these places and so finally I 'll just make the point the idea of community boards is really important in our city and we do have a very proud tradition of supporting delegations to our community but history has shown we saw when we went from 24 to 12 was if you cut the number of cancers and expect community boards to GUP the work that necessarily isn 't guaranteed and legislation and effectively what can happen is the boards get starved of resources get they have cuts to the capacity of being able to be proactive in their local communities and even us as a counselor who have said we wish to give more to community boards and some of the community board agendas that we have have got virtually nothing on them so it doesn 't it 's not always as easy as simply saying we just want the community boards to pick up the slack as the role of council it 's very much the elected council that determines how strong how weak a community board can be and that you know as something until legislation has changed we certainly cannot cannot I don 't believe taken to account although we have endorsed the idea of having community boards in our city through this process and we welcome to get further feedback from them on that so you to the staff again for the huge work that 's going on with her University students from Canterbury and I mean so shame in some ways stuff can 't really talk through that a little bit more but I know you 've heard that presentation previously so but there have been external people that have come and young students for example that would rather interviewed communities and you know we really think those people for the work that they 've done thank you very much um would you like me to move the option to I 'd like to move the option to ya 16 wood model yeah and just conclude by saying thank you for allowing 19 to be added as a supplementary I just thought it was part of the consideration that the public could see in terms of their early engagement so I think it 's good to have it formally recognized yep thank you so you 've moved option 2 and seconded by terms Kendra Jamie would you like to put your amendment on the table I proposed to deal with the overall debate but the amendment so so I 'd like to invite you to move the amendment it has a seconder night has a second are already and then and then I might just pause the air and allow for questions to be asked to staff on their men okay that 's fine um so this amendment is obviously an overarching one which irrespective of what number of wards being proposed it 's the same principle do you want its debts up there do would you prefer that star fans in Equus speak to at once there was any yeah i think that would solve our and you get a penny on it 's on the table so Andrew thank you very much now um the amendment clearly as Jonnie already alluded changes the the parameters of what this looks like from the models that have been put out and what I wanted to do was to to test the amendment against if we look at page 237 to test the amendment against 6.10 the options summary I mean given that this changes some of the fundamentals in terms of what put forward of us for a number of days as well I was keen to see what affects the amendment if indeed it 's carried would have on the advice that you 've given on each option so you know we 've got these bullet points I don 't know whether you 're able to go through those one at a time and let us know what effect the amendment would have on the advice that we 've been given around the 14 and 16 model so that we can see you know whether it actually does meet the requirements whether it addresses the public feedback and whether it aligns with the working part of you and the other consideration got in that paragraph 6.10 on page 237 so that 's the first of two questions and then I 've got one question about 14 and 16 as well it 's difficult off the top of my head to say this but I 'll walk I walk to this as ed and i think it was covered by Councillor you 're handsome and the combining and to double or triple member wards in the pre consultation and isn 't consistent with the workshop of councilors where we 're at that point the majority of you went for single-member wards which is why we developed the model so you will see from the summary of the advantages and disadvantages the majority of the feedback supported a lower population ratio and also I wanted effect and wanted effective leaders into representation of communities of interest and one of the aspects that came up in the consultation and was also reflected in the work that was done by dr. Jean drage was actually you are better to have representation closer to communities because otherwise when you start pulling communities together some communities massoud and that tends to be low socio-economic communities don 't get representation that people are areas that have more resources to campaign tentacle and altered members are standing those areas and so you you would see in areas such as Pendleton by Marty which I think the board raised there all discuss they 're both counselors coming from fiend Alton and sprayed and heathkit both counselors coming from Kashmir so this was so in terms of the end being consistent with the feedback that 's probably not as consistent with the feedback as a single-member ward so it 's purely based on feedback we thank you and then just one further question relating to the comparison between 14 and 16 model and I put this question in the context of banks peninsula and as the mayor noted in her opening comments a lot of the issues that we 're dealing with our as a result of this extension of the banks peninsula ward further into the urban areas so just thinking of effective representation and in particular communities of interest in the 16 model I can see how you know we can say that there is a community of interest possibly around landform and coastal interface coming through Sumner and far around the end of the natural land form of the peninsula but the 14 model of course comes right the way across the top of the port hills into Kennedy 's bush in Westmoreland and those areas and I was just interested in the comments any comments that you might be Kennedy 's bush Westmoreland how the upper part of Kashmir could possibly be seen to have a stronger community of interest with a Corolla or with some neurol with little term than it does with lower Kashmir just the boundaries and how we deal with those in the 14 model and communities of interest question well from the consultation with the public the only thing I can really think of that could identify a common community of interest between those areas that we see the holes in banks peninsula is a very very valuable environmental special area of our city and secondly a special recreation area for our whole city now that 's not really taking into consideration the residential parts of that area but certainly the environment and the RIC recreation aspects could pull all those together and certainly there has been some talk about creating a one sort of Park approach to the hills and maybe that could happen around like a national park approach around the whole of being spinnin surrender all aspects of our city so that 's the only discussion I thought there was but what residents said on the 14 model for that ward than there is on the 16 model we did have the residences opens from the summit area saying they felt they did have a community of interest with with the harbor areas and with littleton but we didn 't have we didn 't have that with our people and we small the community of interest was in to the city in that way so it would be fair to say that on the 14 model the boundaries are more arbitrary rather than driven by what we heard in the community engagement the boundaries are more driven by us being restricted by the mesh blocks in the numbers that 's correct maybe Mary Scott 's actually can you just into lot no put on there the mysteries of mish blocks because people don 't know that and this is a really good because it 's live streamed and we 'll be able to do a link to it I really want people to understand that isn 't like looking at maps and saying well there 's an obvious line so welcome on the fourteenth of may and the report on the 42 may had a long appendix which described what the legislation required of us so the legislation requires that boundaries must follow mishe blocks and so we can 't it 's very difficult if we want to make a boundary outside of each block but what are they and what are they designed for so they are sensitive like there 's mishe blocks that build up into cincy air units and so they 're really for the census so they 're about numbers of people and mish blocks and any area so I they are not where you would put a natural boundary and a representation review often so that 's why we have these strange squiggly lines on some of those boundaries because we have to follow the mesh block boundary so it 's for the purpose of collating statistics which have been used for a variety of purposes so Misch boxer use for disel ratings and circles and they just happened to be used as a requirement for boundaries that 's a much better description than I gave is that the plus or minus ten percent as well I think yeah could you talk about that so that 's another legislative requirement around fair representation the definition of fair representation in the actors that are Ward 's must be within plus or minus the effort Ward number of of what was it so apart from an exception and you have to make for special exception for an isolated community and we did that for banks peninsular last time and the representation review said no more I mean not the representation review that the result of the representation review was the local government Commission said not not anymore banks bachelor has to come under the study so when you combine those two things of having to follow mish blocks in heaven to have every ward within the plus or minus of the average it is a very difficult exercise to make these wards and any change you small change you make somewhere has implications on every other founder in Ward you 're making is you have to get the numbers right and balance them across everything so that 's consider a model that then goes out for it will come back to us and a form which we are then able to vote on and put out for public consultation and at that point we we then set ourselves up as a as a hearings panel and we hear submissions and weigh up all of these things but it 's like the local long-term plan once that goes out for public consultation we we must have an open mind we must be able to hear people 's submissions in a very open way and an element of predetermination would be a problem for us and as I understand it every single council member that wants to be part of the decision has to be part of all of the hearings so it 's not something that you can dip in and out of that 's something that you 're either here for the lot of or you 're not able to contribute to the decision and that 's tragically true even if you get sick on the last day of hearings yeah yeah are you able to give legal the entire hearings because I think that you had some additional views to you but I think we 're following it up _"

    "text": "yep oh come come forward and you can can you start without her yeah cool but the pool we haven 't actually accepted the cheat committee report here Oh was it was it my mistake I 'm gonna be college eyes so let 's zip back and Paul would like to move I know it 's not just gonna make it 1-1 I mean that the leads we put up to them and to the minutes from it because they 're le lift also a meeting early an astonishing the most ellipse yeah my own oh hey sorry so can we go back to the I know we 've still got an outstanding item that 's why and the reason that we 're not dealing with that until after lunch is because the reporters being amended to pick up yannis point so wasn 't the memorandum is being a mendham to pick up that point to make it explicit about what the intention is right so if Chrissy if I could invite you to presume so this is Clive in the meantime yeah Thank You Metta mere though this is for the next room environment recovery program the report used to go to the recovery strategy Advisory Committee which is it 's no longer um goes to the urban development strategy implementation committee the UDS IC and that 's in the open part of the meeting just a bit clarify your agenda I think Clive and the preparation of this as attached the full UDS IC agenda to the loop rapport rather than just the the report that went to UT as I see so you do have the UDS I agenda agenda and your papers and the memorandum of agreement secluded and that but it shouldn 't be attached to the new and if you need to ask questions on what 's and the UDS IC agenda I refute for you to keep Tallentire who 's at the bed so just and lower until Clive get see the as part of the report that he 's written as the comment and paragraph section before so i won 't go into detail and there i think that 's PETA that perhaps I talk to the colored aspect the that the be programmed the loop technical advisory group meets now meets every two months and Helen or Clive attend that from the crow suits of accounts along with the other strategic partners and they they guide the work of the neck the loop and also provide input into this progress progress report and it seems to come around awfully quickly for them I know that what I thought I 'd do is just highlight two or three s bits and then the progress report and I 'm sure you 're raised some questions about others most of us around the community involvement and and your I think be aware that through the spray tan Heathcott community board especially with Helen Helen mautner and Melanie Coco they 've been working with a number of the groups working along the heath cat reveille and have now reached a point without they 're going to have an overarching group around the heath good and I think that it was an earthquake it has come out of the earthquakes where people who 've got a strong interest in the heath get have seen the attention they think they are aware that the heath get is as important to the city as the Avon so yeah I think that 's a positive aspect of one of the paws of ESPYs that 's come out of out of the earthquake effects on that river end and there is increased sediment and that revolt and that 's always been the significant contaminant there but I think you 're very aware of this the stormwater work that 's going on it and that that rather than the nitpicking their tap themselves those people you two 'd from this morning the christchurch we smelt and zone comitia and providing a strong community voice on that and you 're aware of their concerns issues an approach that they 're taking and the under the project teen around the controlling the weeds and peace early on and the development of the nerp we initiated meetings between the agencies who are involved in controlling weeds and pests and the residential red zone especially around the on the flatlands so that was sarah and Department of Conservation Environment Canterbury and council and those groups of their needed to and and have been working really effectively on that Sarah have now picked it up that up and of I mentioned a work interagency Rusk workshop under the Sierra heading where Sarah do an analysis of the concerns around with ann pearson that might be round biodiversity human health or safety specially around fire rust and looked at various strategies for approaching that and they did that collaboratively so i think again an outcome of the new process of having those groups working together has has gone on to a more formalized approach that Sierra 's taking and managing that residential reads own land and the interim until future uses decided so again a positive outcome and then the meringue acai project 17 although there 's an exemplar project on council land with a long ends at drive between Trevor 's road and New Brighton Road that 's driven by a partnership and it 's called an exemplar because the intention is that that make principles of mahak I going to be put right along the river so I always see this protein is quite an healthy healthy rubber healthy habitats that and the very long term you might be able to eat and have us but it 's not just about food it 's about much more and I 'm sure many of you have heard a dupatta end tomorrow no explaining the the deeper meaning of my anger its importance under the treaty settlement so so I just I think there 's a project where there is strong partnership it has council landed as at acen to the red zone so it 's got quite a lot of issues around it but there 's been two or three community plantings and I think men and me you were involved with the one on Anzac weekend where the poppies were reinstated with the community board it was their project initially and then there was a planting that followed and in the Turkish ambassador was there so again it 's just reminding you about the partnership approach it 's being been taken through here and to finish my own prodigious but what happens to the nib as we go towards transition that that our suggestion is at the UDS and the UDS actions from 2010 there 's a number of environmental actions and there so it 's not just about land use planning and transport the UDS is much much bigger than that and so that the Newark goes beckon under their end and when the UDS is refreshed that the considerations of Watson that the the new are take taken through into the into the UDS and an intention that there 's a partner group that sits under the UV is thinking about the natural environment and possibly natural hazards that may be a totally different aspect but so that the natural environment group is advising appt right up through to the UDS eventually so that 's kind of that the approach we 're taking around transition so it does stop and April 2016 and you 're probably aware from other updates that a number of recovery programs sara has stopped reporting on them from the end of two thousand and financial year 2014-15 so in the end of June so the sport and Rec ones back with the Sports Leaders the art and cultural so the news continuing and one of the reasons for that as is our involvement in the discussions around future use of red zone it 's important that all these aspects of the new thought about and that process so i don 't know Helen if you want to add anything Plus not be a five star portal well in terms of the City Council contribution to the natural environment recovery program most of it has been around our natural hazards work through the district plan and you 'll be aware that the latest is the coastal hazards which will be notified this weekend and then the lodging of the comprehensive storm water discharge consent so that was lodged at the end of June of Environment Canterbury and that covers all of our stormwater networks across our city catchments and also the settlements on banks peninsula so those are the major streams of work that would be no just a comment from me is that I would really hate to see this level of sort of public reporting lost and our transition back to UTS so I think that might to you know that the framework for the transition so there you know a refreshed you dears actually has a requirement for this reporting back to each of the council 's because in a way it 's it 's almost like devolving it to another body to hear these issues and and I think it 's useful for the whole city especially since our meetings are live streamed and years and it does provide an opportunity for people to kind of to none and and check up where we 're up to in terms of a very important focus for our city one of the things that I was going to mention though because it came up during the long term plan process was the lack of synchronization with the natural environment recovery program in and naturally obviously he can and the council over the sara counsel project on the tidal barrage and he came quite rightly in my view it came to counsel and said you know if you 're going to look at things like that work with us in a collaborative way because we 've got you we 'd want to be taking that into account right throughout the discussion and it may have even influenced the level of input that was put under a pre a feasible pre-feasibility study we were quite surprised that he can hadn 't been engaged in that process but i think the nukes are natural kind of supervisor of the relationship across the two supervisor might be a bit strong beliefs and information Shearer and I think that 's non-statutory when you is more like an alert whenever and when you 're talking about possibly continuing reporting currently it 's every quarter what frequency would six-monthly be adequate do you think you know me well I mean we quite like this so it might not be me but the year anyway but it but I 've you know a reasonably frequent report because it is something that the city 's interested in as a whole it 's you know it 's not just council laws that have an interest the city has an interest in and cleaning up the rubbers and you know we see this is very much a focus anyway Phil Andruw and glean exactly just nothing just to comment about the title barrier at the will be a pre-feasibility study report coming to the ite committee at free next meeting thank you for the report Chrissy what I what I want to ask you about was that at the partnership you mentioned with Sarah around managing weeds in the red and the red zone is that being extended to empty section say on the portals where houses commitment at Sydney the discussion student include both the peat that Sarah people who are managing or and the other agencies who manage weeds on the port hills but it certainly involved at both Sierra groups those different groups that manage the land on the flat the end the portholes and they were both involved in that discussion so different approaches will be needed I mean access on the port hills because of risk as as one of the barriers for good weed control and and it has been here for the last five years so so that the there 's different reasons why the weeds are perhaps with on the and the defect we 'd say yep my other question is possibly more for Helen but it relates to your the report on biodiversity and the right species of the his get but I just wondered if you could tell me Helen whether our trees policy fits our biodiversity policy like can we be can be assured that when trees are planted by councillors part of obvious quake recovery or whether it 's business as usual in fact that the tree planting will fit the biodiversity policy does so our policies for tree planting do do include using native species and particularly where that is important to use them so we 're it 's a long riparian strips and in areas of ecological significance so yes that it is greatly influenced by the biodiversity strategy just wonder if there might be away in the future that community board just like you immediately excellence ample of the spray tan he 's get board members if that might also be an area that they could potentially be involved in it is Utley replanting thank you Andrew with it thank you very much I 've got two questions the first of which relates to number six in the table manage sediment from liquefaction yes this piece of work limited specifically to sediment from liquefaction if I look at what 's happening in lyttelton harbour as a result of changes to where the land behaves as a result of the earthquake and in particular changes to drainage and as a result of demolitions which have left bare land and as a result of retaining wall damage will be another example the amount of sedimentation going into the harbor would have increased is that within scope of this piece of work or is it just limited to liquefaction as it stays here I 'm sure Helen can enter most of the work that 's been done around sediment has been and the tributaries of the Aven and the heathkit and the area 's above weather 's tidal influence so we 've got tidal influences that sediments are almost part of the environments we previously had gravel beads and with which are with invertebrates love as we 're that work has started in obviously starting and main steam I 'm not aware of where that 's happened and the in Littleton or other helps have suburbs around sediment and I 'm not sure I don 't know if you can help the hello so I mean the short answer is no it doesn 't extend to lyttelton harbour and the sedimentation issues there but they are more likely to be addressed through the lyttelton harbour management plans whatever form they take yeah no that 's great as I 've always said it 's good to see bits of work been joined up so in as much as this piece of work doesn 't have that in its scope that catchment management plan certainly will be able to address this my second question relates to item 11 emissions and air quality and their issues around household heating and burning wood in particular clearly within scope and dust as well one of the areas that 's not covered by this or does it seem to be covered by this would be an increase in pollution from vehicle emissions as a result of different transport patterns of network delays of an example of this be increased traffic on Norwich key in littleton as a result of rubble coming into the reclamation at lyttelton harbour and of course depending on the outcome of the final version of a little important i cover e plan we may well have an increased amount of material coming to Middleton harbors a direct result of that recovery plan for the recovery of the port so that would obviously have an effect on vehicle emissions quite possibly coming towards a little turn along Broad Street in the motorway for example and certainly on Norwich key is that within scope on how else could it be I think you talking about item 16 up at 11am which is the Equality one and equality is reported the work that standards done by the the team that are working on the airplane and all the subsidiary where that 's going around that with the winter program I you recall the commissioner David Bedford reporting to you yesterday about the proposal to do some specific sampling and littleton and i think that that 's the first step is to sure whether there 's any baseline data because you 're talking about change change in emissions because of increased traffic so but at least if we can get current state so and then can think about response that 's based on based on that when this was first raised by the community board they were they made contact with myself and I passed it through to other people with an Environment Canterbury and one of the Comets was is that emissions for VIP from vehicles per se and managed by the transport authorities rather than by the people who are monitoring year but then we need your say we need to think about our response because of the Equality so i think we probably need to wait for that that that have come through that I understood from what I heard yesterday that the time frames are reasonably soon for giving that data I don 't know whether those don 't need to be some winter in summer something because while the emissions might be similar the effects might be different depending on that and the environmental conditions so that that 's probably do need some evidence to respond so clean think you think you could see anything if these updates are really appreciate all the details such as project five good to see some improvement in me we 'll talk or there but my questions about the net ezard 's as you know they 've been to places by way of meeting until Pegasus boarded the date prior to the notification and if we anticipated they haven 't been necessarily easy meetings what I 'm hearing is that people have want information that 's good that they 're all in there wanting solutions and so when we talk about solutions in terms of the strip plan provisions yes they can event some of those are a bit tough to but kind of looking for solutions by way of built from and on particularly referring to stop banks this has been a common denominator in both meetings if you 've got any comments on other Helen Helen comment on that what again remember I when I 'm reporting on the nuke this is a partnership position but i will report coastal erosion has a list of both under the regional coastal environment plan and under the district plan and you 'll be aware through the loop that there 's been an action that transfers that solely to the district council and that 's what your chapter is going to address under the regional coastal environment clean it was only the open sea hazard that was a Rochin hazard that was assessed so it was quite a small area along the coastal area what has changed is that the analysis that you 've done has included the effect of coastal erosion on the inland waters so that I think that 's I think that 's probably what the community is strongly reacting to is that the previous plans were based on a different assessment from the current assessment so that 's kind of part of a story and and Helen can report on the rest and that 's a very big question in the context of of this report but if I if I just give a brief sort of overview answer the the the intent of coastal hazards wit is council itself in terms of its infrastructure program over the next 10 20 30 years so from that perspective the information what what it 's designed to do is help those communities become more resilient through where we build and how we build in the future now in terms of the district plan rules in the proposed framework that 's notified this weekend those rules are looking to restrict new development in the high-risk areas so that is not allow intensification in those high-risk areas what you 're asking in terms of solutions and gulped solutions in terms of either stop things or hard coastal protection structures is is quite a different pistol so the district plan provision so far are about adaptation and preventing intensification and high-risk areas so reducing our community risk that way one possible option is indeed to defend and protect and what the council needs to do in a citywide context is look at where that is feasible and where that is cost effective and affordable and we 're that will take us in the long term so at the coastal erosion and coastal hazard 100 years but of course climate change and sea level rise may not stop there you know the predictions are that they will continue so what we do today to protect existing communities needs to be consistent with and take us on the pathway to more resilient communities in the future and that 's a that 's a difficult path way to met today but but this information is the beginning of metal net pathway and just to add to what i said previously at this I think ism and I say a misapprehension for some people in the community that we 're in a vacuum at the moment because of that transition from the regional coastal environment plan to the district the replacement district plan the RCEP rules and requirements as still and play until the what you 're putting into the replacement plan becomes operative so that shouldn 't be a vacuum yani thank you two questions I just wanted to understand around the earthquake effects of emissions and air quality whether any work happening in the central city in regarding to dust monitoring and contaminants and in waste dumping syndrome for example where is a lot from the trucks that are going in and out and was just wondering whether there 's been any project to try and understand what the possible environmental effects are of the construction and the demolition happening in this interest early so you want me dancing there before you go into the second question ok um again not not a area of my expertise my understanding is that work that 's happening in the central city and any facilities managing waste are all governed by resource consents and conditions on those resource consents so it 's I don 't see that is a role of the natural environment every program because it 's been managed through an RMA process so i just stopped the other thing really good to hear about the work being done around the steam Wolf 's stream and the teeth or not the chest the kind of collaborative project I was just wondering if the local community would could get a presentation and also how that 's fitting in with our land drainage here WIC program is just light blue I 'm not so it 's number five eka number five just above University very 17 and our agenda um just try oh it 's coming from the immediate steps oh this can 't that 'll be coming through from the zone committee so um yeah I 'll follow that up with that it 'll be the crisis alert insane committee is anyone from the award no having to DSA so and we 'll get that from the zone committee and we can send it through an email response or at the Community Board wats presentation I 'm sure we can arrange it just in terms of the land drainage program because we need to do some work there as well is that that 's all going to be quantified through that process I 'm not sure if there 's a land range recovery program project active in that area at the moment but I can cheat on it maybe the design committee can discuss it tonight I think the local community and members at the board but we 're probably welcome doing it 's just something that and given Hamlet how much of our missions are in the transport repeat it 's the only work being done on electrification of vehicles any um the CEO became last night at least an afternoon I think before you got there counselor was talking about that we do measure p PM 2.5 which is probably more as a another measure that can be used to try and identify sources but no not not through this and the other thing that 's not involved with the natural environment recovery program as the improvement of sustainability I end things like insulation and houses that 's done through the Canterbury sustainable homes working party and thus of the affection that that involves them and they 're so this I know it 's segregating things but it fits under the built environment but there are electric cars are not on can I just this Leah then just terms of the government 's target for a little scent drop and emissions regionally on how we would actually meet that than that it 's unlikely to come from action or other easy ones and that it isn 't looking at co2 emissions it 's looking at particle emissions that have helped health effects and and course mark so that I don 't_''_1751.26 so there 's no link between the government 's voluntary commitment that it 's making any of our natural air quality standards not within the loop then maybe another aspects of work and I could follow that up and be interesting to know what the council 's also doing through their climate smart strategy as well because Pauline need to spawn quick question and you 're looking at reduction of sediment Chad I just from both you mix from developments and the team environment temporary that looks at sediment controls and as incredibly active they 've got a pocket guide book that I 'm sure is available to you and I think it was at that it was presented to the zone committee at its last meeting I think I remember so really strong focus through literature workshops and videos at the the builders both small and large who have have to control the serum and it 's leaving leaving their properties and I that are going to and from those and you 're dropping dust and those kinds of things so that 's that 's not perfect but suddenly that the team that 's doing that in a very incredibly proactive and and I mean you 've had that presentation others around this table may not have had their presentation is what I 've noticed is that what do they call those big sausage things I put a name I know what you mean you haven 't got good making them there do they work Lee whose responsibility is that to remove them from the site after they 've finished because you see a lot of them around the streets lying down and getting broken down and I would suggest they 've filtered is actually going to end up and it 's no it 's a really difficult area it 's around education nobody can be watching over people 's shoulder the whole time so it 's up to vote it 's up to those contractors to have the controls in place n to maintain them which means removing those sausages and washing 't re into the gutters or the streams it 's the same with the covers that go on and some of the big holes that great they 're great and so you know they have socks and those but it 's really important that they are taken out and cleaned remotely not cleaned on site because otherwise they lose their feet so it 's around constant constant reinforcement through through education and through conditions on consents but like I say your staff and Environment Canterbury staff can 't_''_1907.89 be on every single building side every minute of the data to monitor what 's happening so by building if people see these things lying around their street for a long period of time when they know the construction is finished to crepes use the pollution hotline would they could try I don 't know whether they may respond it 's okay i can bring that up with that team and and if you feel it 's valuable maybe at the ER t committee could have a presentation from those that team that they 're incredibly you know passionate about what they people also let Counsell know through snaps in Seoul and particularly if filtration cloths and materials have been left on our stormwater greats so people can use that as well next in solve walk the pollution hotline thank you we good all right would someone like to move that the report be received Pauline seconded sold I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's Carrie I 'll adjourn the meeting until 215 we have two items to deal with them public and the public session and they are the remaining component of the chi droop or tanned relation to the Wuhan Christchurch that our sister city issue and the second as the the representation review thank you _"

    "text": "so supplementary number two agenda page 563 would someone like to move and second this I 'm happy to move it and he 's second so do we have any questions about it Yanni and then Glenn have we got someone here to answer the questions ok tell him to run yeah yeah i mean not run no good tell him to walk quickly and carefully think also Caroline Ingalls I think Caroline Ingalls as well ok no I had a conversation with Carolyn Gallagher about it she said it was telling ingles but anyway ok I 'm Yanni and then glenn order these questions that have to wait until we 've got someone here terms of i don 't know maybe senior management can answer about 4.1 100 hours of time what what is that replacing on our existing work program so what works not going to happen because of that sorry but we 've got it we 're being asked to commit a hundred hours of stuff time so I 'm just interested in what the floor and effectors for what drops off no no else will have what was what was your question clean well we may be able to answer it ourselves it was a in relation to 2.7 in the bulb is where it says there 's no longer any intention to seek approval of this proposal as an exemplar so in that housing Accord crown converts to to accept our projects we commit to two these two in the private see because my questions where does this leave that commitment as X now is this a watered down version basically so it is a change version yes yeah if not me differently so we 'll wait tool ok yep someone 's here I just wander with a mighty supposed to be advising on there okay right okay Jimmy what 's your question assure you sir because these civilian are there we at acute in here style accommodation we promote and also supported eastview just want to know that about how do we know the for instant in the Sun surrounding a 30 area or maybe the communal Bowl know whether their point of view it will go out for public submission I mean it 'll go to a select committee Balki for submissions I imagine that we could get an undertaking that they would come down here to hear the submissions so there 'll be no nothing nothing had nothing you know I mean that 's why I kind of want to get on with us it 's a little disappointing around the around the exemplar but at the end of the day it just you know gets the gets the ball rolling to get the bill 12 Parliament there will be some adjustments to it this is a very recent bill and quite frankly if we don 't if we don 't get the ball rolling which is my point then we 're not going to be able to see it referred to a select magic introduced into parliament in referred to a select committee and we 'll be waiting till next bloody year oh sorry I didn 't mean to say that word but you know what my viewers is that we 've just got to you know get on with it but anyway and Paul what 's your question I saw actually in 4.2 the costs are promoting the draft will be accommodated at Anzhi within Lee 2015 2016 and strategy of planning work program we 've had this debate before and we 've been told that there 's no capacity so we 've got resolutions outstanding from a year ago that we 've got no financial I can 't resist my peps you could help us out so yeah nice question is that the hundred hours of staff time that will be devoted to this where is it coming from is what are we going to miss out on the strategy and planning program that won 't be able to be done because you 're tied up doing this well I have 65 particularly in respect of this bill actually most of the work from here on and would largely be done by Robert because we 're now moving and he said yeah so because in many respects in John John has done a lot of negotiation well if it 's a hundred hours it 's only a week 's work for Robert he can probably do it between here seriousness I mean we are moving we 've a lot of that work has been done and that were presumably from an urban design and planning point of view pick up again once the bills passed and development starts to flow but we really are now moving into the legal process so it is really now moving more and more into that process around preparing well notifying the dull appearance in Campinas all right so um so no he just said that Roberts gonna be doing Robert doesn 't work for strategy in finance he works in legal unless you 've moved we wouldn 't want them excuse me what have you got against lawyers oh where do I start I 'm on your side Carly neutral you want to be with planers or strategize yeah no we don 't we boys don 't like people that plan and Glen yeah thank you I do up cooking before didn 't get it quite right but it 's more about the bold part page 565 at the top over the exempt last project are referred to the accord that 's not about the lube where the Crown 's required to have two projects us to private sector to so this is saying that no longer any intention to seek approval of this as part of the loop so what will happen instead the crown is falling back from a commitment here they seek another project well that we 've hit honest I can 't speak for what the crown might do but I mean obviously we had this discussion I think probably around a symbol a she about what was technically meant by an exemplar I think council accepted at that stage that this was a process moving forward so I suppose we 're focusing on trying to make this one happen there are obviously the loop is up for review and the future of the loop is up for review how that might translate into future exemplars I from the government 's point of view I don 't know we 're continuing to talk with housing zealand around surely as a major opportunity so that 's where we 've got some current dialogue with them okay so that review if the accord though it talks about aspirational targets over affordability it talks about a ten percent reduction in the number of households that the 40th percentile household income pay more than thirty percent of household income on housing in the envy and increase in the proportion of new-build consents Eastern to 50,000 so the thirty percent proposed in this development at being 450,000 that 's defined here as bility so I includes the land yeah well that 's I mean is that affordable if you 're gonna was held it portable is being defined sorry that 's where the government subsidy kicks on doesn 't it I mean it wall ends yes it is the threshold above which you don 't go so the right yeah fun so did everyone else get their questions answered yep all right is there any discussion Yanni I won 't support this I think we 've heard that there 's been an oversupply of land now resigned for housing purposes and I think you know consistent with my previous inviting resolution on this I think that this land should remain as a reserve or I think it 's huge traffic affects end this is a very intensive development so I won 't be supporting this today and I think it 's really important we try and retain open green space in our city we 've got plenty of other land at suitable for development that 's been resigned that can cater for development and I think there will be some major infrastructure issues associated with us as well so from my point of view this isn 't a priority it 's no longer an exemplar project and I won 't support the bill go Becky and mingling justice I a well-supported I am was going to say us I was going to support it with gritted teeth but I feel happy with the answers provided so yep yep to support great Vicki I do support it and there is going to be good amenity value there is good thing there are good things nearby and it 's not out in a remote from any services and when when the racecourse was established it was fairly remote and obviously the city has come racing out think the important thing here is that that some of the local residents definitely want to be nude and I think that 's great they will get that opportunity to be hood they have issues about reserves being created within it and and that 's fine but to say that we have now an oversupply of housing and Christchurch at the Affordable level is just wrong we do well any we may well have some sufficient land zoned they 're really important thing is that there are houses on the land because it 's really hard to live on a be a secret and the key thing is the supply of housing and the thirty percent of these are going to be in the category that allowed people to cash up KiwiSaver adopter home state loan and the welcome home package fantastic so getting housing good housing that 's affordable that is near great amenity is really important and so we have actually supported this all along the way and this has been a candle a building has been supported by the council from the beginning and I 'm totally ahead and that we get on and do it very good Jimmy as a police one because I concern the two issues the first one a moment regarding the housing especially the affordable housing demand supply we still show for affordable housing so this can complain all the alchemist 80 seconds I 'm canceling is affecting the area that petite concern we have a new subdivision they might consider the traffic flow issue a petition calling issue but we have the channel you know because based on these the bill they are editable to make the summation a deputation during the process of the beer so I think there 's a popular channels oh I support I 'm just going to make the point that this is a this is a a proposal to have a bill introduced and the this will be referred to a select committee obviously the Select Committee will hear submissions and anyone who has impacted by that decision will be able to make submissions on it I agree entirely with with the deputy mayor we have to agree with cookie that I that is absolutely 't it so but the truth is is that we 've got we 've got to have more of these housing options that do allow people to access all of the range of supports that are available to get people into their first time and and thirty percent of these houses will be in that category and I think that is a good thing that is in a very good area it does it does mean that you get a very good connectivity in terms of public transport in terms of access to a hub you 've got all of the reasons why this is a good result and I think as Vicki said earlier on you know there was a long time ago well before I was born when Riccarton racecourse was a long way out of town you know and I think that we have reached out to the racecourse and it is very much a part of our city so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried record counselor you 're handsome opposed so yeah I what I might do because I 'm it seems clear to me that we 're getting close to lunchtime and so I think it 's best that we leave the representation review to after lunch but I 'm just wondering and I know that it 's sort of kind of against what we arranged but but if Chrissie Williams would you like to come and do the natural environment recovery program and we 'll deal with that then we 'll deal with the representation review after lunch and then we 'll come back to the depth in will go into our public excluded for the for the rest of the meeting well known well sorry page 2 315 and its claws 13 it 's all them in a min _"

    "text": "obviously we 've had a significant discussion in relation to the main south road central median changes between Carmen rodent and chippy place and some of well most of the proceedings are in relation to the legal advice that we 've received and obviously that 's protected by legal professional privilege but the other elements of the discussion we certainly can have in the public arena I 'm just to kick things off can we have a mover and a seconder for the resolution with the two council ward and okay Phil as it is and Jimmy as it is so we 'll come to the amendments after that but I just like staff to kind of perhaps update on some matters in relation to the information that we have before us in particular the financial implications of the of the proposal because I understand that there may be some change to the advice that we had previously received I think about it just by way of an update we have been so we received a variation require application the resource consent yesterday we clarified a point this morning which the variation do so the variation application is to remove the clauses that require the right term bait to be installed and approved by council prior to restaurant brands being able to open and replace them proposes that the site can be serviced from brindley Street which is the existing situation out there and as much as as of today you can turn right into brenly 's Street unable the proposal is that that provides sufficient here to service this site but the advice from this morning was that if we go out if council goes out to consultation on the full package of works as prepared as proposed in the attachment and the plan that you 've seen this morning for all the changes between common road and Kappa place that the original agreement in terms of the funding arrangement between counsel and restaurant bands to fund the right term Bay will not exist and that that basically that agreement is withdrawn because the the company will be able to service the site by access from Brittany street and and the but I mean obviously the resource consent has given yeah there 's no decision on that that variation is only an application that we received yesterday and so this would if if we were to prefer that as an outcome in terms of the cost sharing arrangement we would have to not consult with our community about a significant change to the arrangements on the main south road and the loss of trees that 's correct okay alright so now Vicki you had an amendment and i know david has an amendment as well i 'd like to move in relation i 'm happy with this but in relation to floors to which only talks about an option which removes the trees from the main south road which has been one of the major problems with this issue I 'd like to move an addition that says but that an to add to close to but that an option be included in the publicly consulted options which keeps the trees or at least most of the trees on the main south road so we just add an order to add additional option to what is publicly consulted oil and would be explicitly referred to the end with a preference for this one excuse me and there 's a the staff would obviously have to do some work on this option before including it because you couldn 't include an option that didn 't meet its our own standards in relation to transport safety exist I don 't know that their thing needs to include a preference does it we just put out the options don 't know what we 're seeing is stuff we need to investigate the option you are seduced no I told you where we go out to make sure I thinking that but in relation to leanne 's issue we don 't need to include a preference for one of the options is put the options at for public consultation well what we 're seeing is we 've got an option out there you 're suggesting you want another option with trees what the staff are advising is we 'd have to go and look I try to get that and it may not be an option that we should be putting out for 's what I 'm moving yeah well then I mean but and it may well be that if the staff come you know I mean the thing is is that this will this this this okay but that you can be included if possible and yeah it 's safe feasible it sees feasible would be beat yes benefit if it doesn 't meet the test that it won 't be included now but actually what we 're being asked to approve today is that we go out on consult on the two on the on these proposals the the other options are described as the other options that we looked at so we 're not going out to consult on them we 're going out to consult on this option and the other options that we looked at are described and the document documentation as the other options that we looked at that 's the process for consultation under the local government aid well it 's just like the long term plan but just in fruit for example ricca-san road we had two options we didn 't express a preference six options if you want to choose so they option so I 'm fine then FF feasible that this be included as one of the two options yes yep yeah we can do that David you want to move your amendment well no just like a point of clarification really with the proposal that it seems to me that where you 're at our odds with one and two where you 're asking to go out to consultation options but into your actually all right the approval was to go out the moment I got the impression that I 'm not going to have a discussion about an amendment now so do I have a seconder for Council of bucks amendment Yanni right now you can 't second an amendment to a motion that you 've moved right so David would you like to move your amendment which is that we so that we replace that well I mean the way that they 've done it has two is to literally remove the words after chappy place and then remove two and replace it with a new set of a have a seconder for that somebody nope that 's failed for want of a seconder so now we will come back to a a debate on the first on the amendment and but I mean give it given given where we 've got to have people quite happy we could we could debate the whole lot the amendment end their motion and and then we 'll vote on the amendment first and then we 'll vote on the motion all right so on the consent this is it likely to be notified all the must notify the variation it 's too early to say we 've only received the application yesterday and we haven 't really looked hit likely tomorrow and probably five to ten days time it just sits to me that if we 're gonna go for public consultation and we 've also got a resource consent that we still kind of wedding a variation you would kind of want to possibly have depending on the outcome of that an option that address there that we won 't know that is just a timing thing does it make variation to the consent they 'll obviously has implications for what the design might be that we would know it doesn 't because the as I understand it this is something that we would propose anyway yep so um so I 'll put the motion yes yes that 's fine but i 'm saying i 'll put the motion encouraging members to debate it so no Danny I mean I feel uncomfortable about us being you know doing this because of the consent but you know I can understand that there is existing traffic issues in this area I do wonder whether there 's also in need to do a more holistic traffic assessment and degraded traffic assessment of this wider area it does seem a little bit odd that people love that things like check your face get put in but then you don 't look at what happens on the other side the road so you 've got you know know it deal world it would have been great to have one traffic light servicing both sides of the road instead now we 've got this whole other local board to pick up but it does seem to me that if we are getting a lot of development in this area we do need to start thinking strategically about strategic land purchase to try and address some of these problems because we 're trying to fit feels very much like we trying to fit pigs and into or you know pigs and two boxes into a round hole so you know it does it just seems really like we 're trying to make the best of them bad situation that doesn 't actually connect and I support this going out for public consultation I 'm open-minded as to what the outcome of it is I do think we should be trying to retain immunity in this area it is pretty bleak as has been pointed out and absolutely retaining trees I think is important I think we also need to start thinking about our minor arterioles and major arterials and taking a consistent approach to across the network so that you know in some areas we 're actually shutting we are shutting roads and having impact on local just need to have some I think consistency across across those that network so that people understand the rationale behind these sorts of decisions so happy to support it going out for consultation open-minded as to whether we do this or not but I do think it should be driven by the safety and the traffic issues of anything but not the need for the regionals consumed I 'm filled David Jimmy I 'm also going to support the recommendation so I think the staff have done a huge amount of work on this and we just need to have it go out to consultation and I think it 's good having the second option which I believe the community board will also support and like it 's timely because it 's only recently as we know that in fact this major arterial road at she came under the jurisdiction of our Council and previously have been under NZTA s there are a large number of safety issues that in fact the the you turn will help address and so I think at some I think the recommendations are good come to this point there 's been a lot of hard work gone into it David then Jimmy I can 't support this motion environmentally I 'm against the removal of four trees the the area 's pretty bereft of vegetation for a starter and taking her out make a lot of sense to me I really can 't see the logic we 've been a major arterial forming a right turn and right and you tune within metres of a major intersection makes sense at all I 've did against it and I believe that the community board despite what we heard today on aren 't in favor of the majority of the community board aren 't in favor of this right turn and it was agreed to because stuff did stuff suggestion I would much prefer to see a controlled you to in a chappie place and review the Tao Street Burnley as appropriately with confidence I can 't support this motion and more and will vote against it Jimmy I suffer this one because it 's reasonable also support amendment as well as the poor country the the 50 meters but you can see my total in the area and also the countdown in the air Brendan del Sol that a figure for pity 's window closes where we were they visit the section so improve on the name work safety operation that 's absolutely imperative know so I do appreciate a staffer take a long time to have a disorder comprehensive the information and also if original based on staff the kind of information if we separate the 9.1 and 9.2 only nine point of one we go to the consultation rollin and I 'm for the two my concern is you know in depth and consensus if you shut down the premise tree and also the mains 'l slowly kind of the entries where the people to go but if we have established another you turn or write an elisa give the the drivers you know opportunity can write n to the power leg not even a letter to la pic of the tower power facility in which from sh 0 I think is the way we will add this number also combine 9.2 in significant otherwise you resolve a part of the technical Florida issue bother you ignored another part of the issue and also the this one popular consultation where we were with a series you know I so my personal view is not not only the staff getting involved we are not a local cancer or light of getting it all both in the public the job in the station also local popular calmly poke and get involved to make stir this issue you know we want together to solve so there 's a reasonable so I fully support this recommendation thank you very I like the fact that this takes the pressure off any speed of resolution of the issue and that it allows for real public consultation what we are bound to find is that there are a lot of issues to around both these areas around this combined area and that we will also find additional issues for example the lack of a footpath on the other side of the road and that will be brought to our attention and this public consultation I am like Dave not in south road when they are so few and far between and that 's why I want the amendment through so that we can look at a safe option that doesn 't do so I appreciate that and the restaurant brands development there are additional trees going in and I 'm pleased about that because there is there would be a big demand for more trees in the area as well I like the fact that public consultation will be real and that we can actually take our time and do this properly because it is a hugely significant chunk of traffic flow and also of people coming together and not always in a good and safe way at that intersection so I 'm hoping that by putting us up consultation we do a number of things one we get to actually appreciate that there are a lot of things lacking in this particular traffic area and some of those will include footpaths and that we actually improve this area and keep trees and Ed trees thank you i 'm just going to make a couple comments i am a little restaurant brands felt it necessary to withdraw the cost sharing agreement if we went out to public consultation so i think that 's that 's a shame i personally find it really helpful with the public are engaged in a conversation about why something is important i think that the proposal can be justified and the report itself highlights the fact that the council inherited the stretch of road from NZ daf that have been a council road right from the start it wouldn 't have had that type of tree planted there the issues that have been concerned about these particular trees is that they 've been poorly maintained they are not appropriate in an arterial road environment with wide tree form and shallow root structure so the potential for damage to the road surface is obviously something that is our particular concern so that the type of tree was hoping to be replaced and of course the landscaping that the deputy mayor has referred to in relation to the landscaping for the food outlet will include 12 oak trees along the road frontage that 's a significant improvement trees with more appropriate trees as was the plan begun you know over a year ago a lot of the work was done on trying to improve this this particular area and I think the pressure on this area to start to look like the rest of a garden city will increase as an end this council obviously is pretty focused on that the road the other point that I wanted to make was that public engagement will enable people to see what the real options are and I probably started my views on the subject at the end of the spectrum that David 's ended up on but now I 'm happy to support the motion and indeed the amendment to it so first of all I put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and could you record david east and i 'll put i 'll put the whole i 'll put the whole motion oh yes sorry i 'll put number two those in favor of paragraph to say I and those opposed say no that 's carried David 'll put the whole motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you now would someone like to move that the whole port report we received the key yeah and seconded by tongue I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much to the staff too much appreciated we 'll move on to item 9 which is the _"

christchurch west melton zone update and i have the chair of the christchurch we smelter zone committee here and i 'd like to invite out of think wants to sit at the table as well for the presentation thank you and can I acknowledge that Commissioner Rex Williams from ek nurse here as well if you want to come forward you 're most welcome but thank you gotta kum nahin keeta matter with a tiny 99 that meerkat all got me hit the pedigree to know you team up with committee nama tiki torch are oh boy you 're kooky car who did you do in water whoo-hoo-hoo my new tinoco total tool whatever Yatta Yatta cut up especially thank you very much for inviting the zone committee to your full council meeting today to support the ite committee 's recommendations on the storm woods and seen prices probably one of the key things that have come out of our zone committee meetings is that we feel this is too big a task for the council alone to handle and we see engagement with local community groups and individuals as a key player in helping us to reach those targets within the CWS a number of other zone committees have been doing collaborative consultation processes web key the key driver for that is to get community by and community actually helping to set those targets set those outcomes and the time frames and being associated with their spirit and water zone committee it 's a very strong dairy farming community down there and at first there 's always a lot of hesitation but over the time we come to realize that we all have the same common goals they need water they need good clean accessible water and quantity of water and a lot of the urban community and cultural communities are saying the same thing so over the last few years since some crushing swish Melton has been established we 've made some really strong connections with a lot of the community groups even or Target or for instance a hoot i trust haircut or par well as well as a lot of smaller community catchment groups and we sincerely believe that together we can get buy-in from those communities to help speed up reaching those targets that were mentioning the cwm is opening up difficult so we we applaud the tea committee 's recommendations that we we see the need to do more sooner if we leave at 14 15 years the cumulative effect i 'm not doing you thinking that time would make it more much more expensive much harder to remedy to reach those targets yeah could I just say no please the the skirt works of course are going to be the proof of the pudding and until that 's completed council isn 't able to assess the effectiveness of the storm water system as it will be at the end of the screw it works but it could be that the council is unable to achieve the targets and we have been advised by staff that if we can change people 's behavior it is possible to achieve a fifty percent improvement in the strong water quality and that 's what we 're talking about it 's one of those things that a bit like the old rather fit we haven 't_''_329.27 got much money to do this so we 're going to have to think and that 's what we would very much like to do is search with 's performance it 's a look thank you very much and this is the first time and my time as a mere that a joint committee has come to the council but it really does show to me the benefit of the approach of having what is established as a joint committee the zone committee model exemplified by your presentation so thank you very much for that I couldn 't agree more about engaging the community and the setting of targets but they have to as part of that process accept responsibility that they are part of the solution as well you know and I just I remember the you know the very powerful presentation which was just as such a simple thing about not washing your street on the car and having the runoff into the N to the N to the N to the drains and in I mean honestly when you wash your car you don 't think about it running into the river and and I don 't think it 's just the skirt works you know so so a little advertising here when we as put them on the boom or can you put them on grass somewhere on your property before you do the washing and if you can 't_''_421.61 do that take them to a place that actually properly disposes of the of the water and there 's a lot of kids that are doing it as fundraisers but doing it in an environmentally sensitive way so there you go a plug for the for the cleaning up the storm water but it 's more than that and one of the things that and it 's not just the skirt program just to alert you to the fact that we 're having conversations obviously with government about the future use the residential red zone and there is real potential for reestablishing wetlands and and assisting the quality of the storm water that enters out our rivers and back to me as an incredible opportunity there now lies with with so much land now available I think there 's a whole lot of factors when we pull them all together will help us to meet those targets yeah much sooner industry is another big number of focus groups on our industry that have been helping to lead change within their own business and encourage those around them as well so I think it 's the more we can capture at Point a source of discharge the list goes into the waterways and s that will need to go into that yeah the retention ponds attention pongee red zone land yeah yep it 's anyone got any questions of pouring beer to that I mean we 've got kiwirail Ravens down have been very cooperative we 've got developing rain gardens to absorb the runoff we 've also got solutions we we might be able to alter the exterior by coaching it to stop the zinc polluting and often the patience of the invisible ones like when we think of polluted water we often think of season not very nice e.coli and stuff but it 's actually chemical pollutants which were very very damaging they are the invisible ones so this is actually getting buy-in from a large number of the community today pretty much at the education program so it 's good work going move that and Pauline I guess you 'd like to see conduct is there any discussion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried thank you very much okay so how are we look it 's at about half past ten so I 'm thinking that the legal advice that we need to receive on the next item on the agenda shouldn 't take very long so so I 'm just going to know so what I need to do is is have someone move that we that we resolve to exclude the public to hear legal advice in relation to this item staff are always permitted to remain during a meeting of the hey oh okay the staff have always been permitted to remain but we 'll put that staff be permitted to remain and the the reason is to maintain legal professional privilege so we have a legal opinion to discuss in relation to partay item one of that report and we can expect to be we can expect to be able to let 's let 's be to reconvene the meeting yet so shall we say quarter past eleven and that will give us time for morning tea and then half an hour to discuss the that the legal opinion all right so i 'll put that I 'll move that motion and Bucky buckle second it and i 'll i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried and I will you know yes so I 've said that that we 're basically during the meeting for morning tea now but we 'll be back into a public excluded session probably until quarter past eleven but however long it takes all right so if councillors could be back here for the PX session at quarter to yep thank you _"

than picking out a particular age group I will fall through of actually create streets to be friendly for everyone now this way we want to get a bit of information that we are actually doing that as a matter of course say the around all those kind of issues are you know maybe specifics we could actually talk about that there are standards they actually make sure that if there 's shopping centres and there 's elderly people there 's blind is all those sorts of things and we do adopt those standards both in our when we redo up a street and also into our sub divisional standards the new subdivisions and developments which people have to comply with all right so i will put that i know that 's carried the report of the cheaper some of the housing task force is the other one so presume that Glen you 'd like to move their second up by andrew is there any discussion any questions sorry any questions any discussion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried Theodore item Memorandum of Understanding sister city agreement we 've had People 's Republic of Christchurch and crush City New Zealand the sorry I 'm just trying to find the recommendations this doesn 't seem to be in the right order what about done oh sorry it 's in a completely different place so that that we receive and approve the mou between wuhan and crushes City reaffirming the establishment of our sister city relationship of course we 've got a senior anniversary next year and we 've invited the mayor of we home to come to Christ Church to celebrate the occasion so so I 'd be happy to move there do I have a seconder for that Jimmy chin I 'll put that motion I understand that actually they 're not the sister city there are strategic friendship so we have sister cities with Ginsu promise but it 's neither thing we heart so I 'm just worried that the report is actually quite factually in careers I just want to have that has certainly been framed and our language as a sister city relationship but it 's it is it is it 's got a different relation I 'd shared the last International Working Party review when we looked at all these issues and one thing that was acknowledged was that this has a different relationship than a sister city relationship because it was more runs to take question we educate education these relationships and that work and recirculate it but I don 't think that there 's I think we can still go ahead with this as Jesus finishing a relationship will reassuming a relationship that doesn 't correct which could be equally embarrassing for both sides so it needs to be clarified because you know it sees an agreement on establishing strategic partnership that 's friendship city relationship so where 's the 't see them nice bedtime who 's doing there 37 okay so sees its the cream chips our sister cities following the establishment of a friendship city relationship in the agreement on establishing strategic partnership on the 18th of june two thousand and four so you 're saying that the proposals incorrect because because the original agreement established a strategic partnership you but they don 't call it a sister city relationship and China and gansu province is called friendship city as well friendship it 's a actually it 's all right I 'm just okay we 'll need to fear it we don 't we don 't need to do it today because we 're not signing up in the next month are we but I look so linear my I remember you know you way back to the two thousand in the fall signed on those agreement we still hot they substrate the the city but right now they already become the sacred of our church today the cisco silky were you know in China and also based on the new regulation is not one sin city only sister city hae in China we have 2 Sister City Times window this come from from the start but we need to the recap for people to Paris would appear to later an amazing I 'll get here because I specifically asked thus question at the committee level which year he was aired in and actually remember now because it was a while ago I were you not there okay well I asked this exact question yet at the meeting and we had staff there and they gave us an answer that yes get the answer so you know and although the read hearing I don 't care a counselor has asked a legitimate question and we will get an answer

that the so we have over 500 indicators that we report on so if we miss out on one of those it affects the total achievement across those and decay toes some are not all recorded so what it means is that in some of their targets we don 't have very practical ways of actually measuring the target that we 've got so we need to review those and make sure that we 've got a reasonable baseline in a way of recording Bennett most of the targets though I 've missed by a fairly narrow margin so again we missed the target even though they 're stretched targets and have us above the average around that is some of the timelines for instance the milestones around the long-term plan we had a number of timelines that with stretch targets but actually a mean we meet the most important timeline of getting the LTP completed and approved but also things such as our website targets where we had a target of 125,000 unique visitors and we had a year-end 120 3,500 unique visitors so it 's not far off our target but it does mean that we miss it totally given the way that we measure these things I think that one of the other issues is that because we have so many decatur 's they don 't necessarily tell us what 's really important and highlight those things that we 're striving for excellence and also things such as meeting statutory time frames and well I acknowledge their previous conversation and our consenting for instance has improved from 75% compliance in july of last year to 99 percent compliance of meeting those statutory time frames in june of this year so that 's a big improvement in both and in the face of bus increases requests that we have or applications things such as a resident satisfaction which is actually very important because that 's about what we do and how we deliver our services increase in areas that we 'd really focused on so increasing transparency in areas such as that council makes decisions and also increase in how residents feel that they can participate and influence council decision makings on an eleven percent increase in that we 've got a long way to go but those are the sort of things that actually are important in terms of how people access and use our services the other things around increase access and satisfaction with our community facilities we know that people really enjoy the use of our community facilities and libraries and so forth and as they reopen we 've left the targets as they were so we need to make sure that we can actually start to increase satisfaction and access to those if each of those reopen and our financials of course other areas that are really important there are others but I think that for the next year going forward level ones that indicate how those services are working overall so we 'll be doing some work on that and also confident that the changes that we 're putting in place are both structural and our management teams and accountability will also help us elastic performance as well I won 't talk specifically to the financials happy to respond Christians around that but I also just note some other areas so the progression around things such as great for Christchurch the work around the Sarah transition that you 'll talk about tomorrow and the work around becoming a digital council so things such as a simple early changes such as dog registration changes of address and the website upgrade that went live on first of July we 've had good feedback around those things but are examples of how again we can improve access and the experience of people using our services and to support that internally we 've got some development and training of staff available right across the organization particularly around change so we 've we 've been running workshops for the organization and using a little leaflet side talking about understanding change and where people are unchanged and and what you need to do and the other really tools that that sharp people can use either Rick knows that you can have as they 're working through what are silly difficult times in times when you 're busy but also major change underway we 've also got changed networks or key champions in the organization who are helping to drive some of us as well from across the organisation and again so this becomes part of everyday work and supports those other projects that are underway so I 'll leave it there that heavy should take any questions yeah Annie thank you I just wanted to understand if we are doing any local work around the consenting so I know we 're doing this whole partnerships approval and you 're looking at great for christchurch and customer services one of the suggestions that i 've put forward which i don 't quite know how to get examined as they actually put consenting back into local service centers so that when local people have issues i can actually to be centralizing all our services so is it any work going on to understand at a local level what sort of local schools delivery we can put back into service so you know we 've got our work on fit for future which is a look at how we structure our services and our staff across the organization so we 're looking at all of those options but there has also been quite a lot of discussion around how do you provide a number of services at the local level and thinking about how we deliver those and what staff community boards have talked about how useful it would be to have some of our staff more closely linked to service centers when are we going to start seeing I guess I 'm really asking is like when are we actually going to start seeing those results given we 're doing a whole bunch of stuff for that partnership approvals for the central city rebuild central but when are we going to start seeing the change at those local servers so that was my fault partnership approvals doesn 't some of the big projects are in the central city so when you look at the list of things that I 'm sure you 've read the pamphlet that 's been done where it sees that the projects that are likely to be approved central cities one of them but it 's only a component they 're actually helping you brighten so new brightens getting itself ready for quite a major you know sort of approach through development Christchurch the whole idea of wraparound support absolutely makes sense and a project like that you know so it 's just that we 're still centralizing services yeah so but Carly 's just told you that they 're working very hard Queensland start seeing we will yesterday that 's right and so so so we 're undertaking prices looking at all our options we may not end up doing that and terms of putting people out in service centers but that 's that 's the sum of the fee direct that we 've had is that community board service centers and local communities would like that so we will have to balance a change proposal around the major restructure towards mid to late august and then following that will be some discussion around so how do we actually deliver on the ground thank you I 'm just the sins snap-in solve we were expecting to get some information back um people are using the app but we don 't have is any any measure on how many of those that people have used it complaints have been sort of dealt with I 'm up for example of use certain still waiting it 's nearly two months so I mean there seems to be a gap and the feedback loop to tell people what 's happening that when can we do to get information so i apologize if it was asked for and we 'll do that if but that 's not a consistent problem that we 've got so some people were getting feedback straight away yeah well it 's just that but the information is not on the report will make sure that the informations on next month 's report well honey but I mean I 'd only just myself as we 're gonna do anecdotal then I 'll tell you the Facebook story which sees Center than the next day it was fixed you know yeah for this particular air there 's no mechanism what a minute idea is a mechanism that you hit must out and I don 't know why so maybe you could send your personal example through and we 'll follow it up so yummy so it 's it 's a final question for me just the thing we were still fighting for was the list of bridges and the repair program for our branches what 's going to be fixed what 's not going to be faced and what the time frame is um it 's our day adamson list of bridges what 's going to be same time Toby the bridges all the bridges this came out of Boston discussion so just trying to understand the strategic overview of how we 're prioritizing bridge repairs quantum of budgets this is ones that aren 't going to get here tae portrait criteria and so that 's why originally we were going to replace it now and have to go and have a look at the program of when it is on the program for its r appears to be to be finished the question was about the whole program for bridges a whole process the Environment Committee perhaps we could pick me up deal with it for the Environment Committee you don 't happen John has a detailed report in the city committee right okay so report back through there okay Jimmy went fishing on page three regarding to the greater for high chills this way we could appalled you know for the council to make a council more efficient effective and responsive conceived to our resistance adjust my questions whether accounts are considered to take to take a case the study especially for Los Turner handle requests for the service the items still pending in there for long time period for instant Aguilar tech example I chose whether our trip and the the law the kind of issues I remember the first of all other October of last year actually sender Tula are the council to posses but up to now still you know ascended to the you know the staff you know again try to follow up until one month just gather these response so my concerns whether we take this a case study you know that they we I know actually what the customer can sneak you there particular concern or they 're worried about it name we can if the substantially improve yes this is what we 've talked about previously I think isn 't it yes um case studies a really good way of actually following through a pro Cee 'd and understanding where the problems might lie of course each case might be different so it 's really what themes come out of it so since the executive a mystery Councillor John Henson has raised so they 're very useful as a way of improving our services I hope taken all those appending the issue it not take more seriously then we can have them Pullman yes thank you thank you fell thanks Kelly my question was really the website again and like it 's the dog registration you mention that that seems a pretty impressive with increase in job done stay on the straight forward way the it 's really and like clearly that the web 's the view of the website and how it looks is it 's improving I 'm just wanting that the work though in terms of actually having it more sort of easier to use how what we 're doing on there yes so so the team has done a stunning job in a very short time frame to get the new website up and running so it 's an ongoing process to continually improve it and as we get feedback that 's helpful as well there 's also quite a bit of work to do about the information on the website and actually one might get more accessible but two if you look at where its current and relevant story so it 's an ongoing piece of work but I think they did incredibly well to get where they did in a very short time any others alright David thank you just help safety thanks to the information in this report I do note that perhaps some of the inquiry stats are diligently these days would it be possible for me to to dig into this a little deeper undersea injuries I mean some of them the near misses 2 and medical injury was to sort of concerned me a little nun find out a little bit more of those as possible yep I 'm happy to do that so the executive leadership team C sighs and then that allows us to ask questions about you know this one office or something that we know we need to really focus on so we do get that information we could share that with the regulations I do note we are having a briefing at some stage on elected members responsibilities on health and safety will let be well before the implementation of the Act in 2016 or oh you 're so it 's likely to be mid to late august so it 's we were really waiting to any finalization of the issues around the egg but given that it 's been delayed well i will provide what we can around it and essentially one of the important things is that you make issues as well I 'm actually wondering whether the sum is not within the brief of the chief executive and employment subcommittee I don 't know whether someone can just double check the terms of reference of that because it may be that a regular report to the to the chief executive and employment subcommittee might actually be a way of generating ongoing review of health and safety matters which i think is the responsibility of the council but as you say a smaller subcommittee of the council might be better focused on on that issue maybe regulations since well except that that 's it 's really to do with the staff of the organization so employment measures I think might be a bit of focus but I 'm not saying that I 'm wanting to take on more work on a committee that I chair rather than one that you cheer so we 'll have a discussion about it but it seems to me that there 's a potential on both both both leagues of the double yep how the same as soon as a breath so therefore most it definitely goes through audit and Russell but I think that having a report generated for the for this committee might might actually be a better focus although rigs and consents meets more frequently so that might be a reason for choosing that one except they are all interested we are all interested but you know regardless of the law change I think we should be taking an active interest in health and safety so I 'm really pleased that Dave 's continue to to raise it thank you alright with someone like to move that the report of the chief executive be received Paul lonsdale seconder david east I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried a next item on the agenda _"

    "text": "yeah item 32 so yeah item 32 crown counsel transition work programs on page 235 which is on the supplementary agenda since which time we have made some significant amendments to the to the recommendation if you take out the words staff it 's it 's a recommendation that we 're putting to the council all right so the reason for the paper is really to acknowledge that there is an incredible amount of work to do in a relatively short space of time and I wonder if I could get you Brendan to perhaps just give a quick overview of the work program that needs to be undertaken and the next I think eight weeks probably and then and a further tranche of work once the government introduces legislation for the transition I sure so early July the government released and both a cabinet paper and also the draft transition recovery plain end and what the cabinet pay-per-minute referred to which is available on the syrah website was a commitment from the crown to work with the Christchurch City Council both for their respective chief executives in Nemea in function of the into the entities that will be leading the regeneration in recovery of crossstitch both central Christchurch and also the impact on development Christchurch limited and also the council 's working collaborating with counsel on the input into their proposed future statute that will replace their Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act which expires in april next year the time frames on their draft recovery plan and a submission by the end of july and there 's a number of report backs to cabinet some of the report back sir also at the end of july the report back that were explicitly referenced a working collaboratively together as a report back to cabinet at the end of august and so those time frames mean that over the next month six weeks and there 'll be a fairly intensive period of working and both worth officials it 's Syria but also more broadly Korean officials on both our submission on the draft transition recovery plane but also on the nature of the ministers vice bit to cabinet for cabinet decision making so the on the letter P so through stress that the council doesn 't have a direct line into cabinet but this is a great opportunity for us to positively together with the crayon and to arrive at the outcomes in a beautiful Christchurch and that is that the last opportunity and there 's a continuing series of technical topics including on future track sures of working at the detail a bit of the legislation in the current time frame you outlined in the cabinet minute we 'll see the legislation introduced and Rhian September and will being going through a select committee process so those again processes that we would have a keen interest in in may well and submit and further detail on those Meadows over the coming months that 's great is there any questions yanny thank you and thank you for the amendments you 've put forward um just in terms of what their outcomes that are best for Christ 's range I 'm just interested in how the community have input into what they are and whether there 's any process for us to discuss with our community what outcomes they think are best for a very public process happening right now which is killed the draft transition recovery plan and the draft transition recovery plan contains the proposal for an entity like regenerate christchurch and indicates a number of questions that the people of Christchurch and actually others that they are not limiting it to the people of Christchurch are asked to respond to and of course that is the greater Christchurch area that 's covered by it but even beyond that anyone in New Zealand can submit on it I in you know I 've been thinking exactly about your question yani because I think it is important for us to indicate to our own constituencies how important it is to make a submission and the reason why it 's important because the you know people need to know that our submission is going to make a difference because you know people are sick of making submissions that sick of well they 've lost energy you know and so they need to know that it 's going to make a difference I guess that the one thing that I would say is that that you want to be engaged in a process of you know being involved in the recovery of the city that you want to be involved in the decision-making we 've talked as a council about you know moving to a much more sort of collaborative and devolved decision-making framework as we decisions away from the council table and out into our community boards and more broadly into the community and you know I 've been reflecting over the last few days about the enormous number of submissions that came in on the LTP the where people didn 't come and ask the council to do anything for them they came and asked the council if we would work with them and let them do things for themselves with support from the council so that sort of engaged process I think you know the government needs to hear that directly as well and we 've heard that message and I think that allowing this process to hear that message as well but one word that I 'd just simply say and I 've watched the online commentary on this there crown does now should be handed over to the council lock stock and barrel that barrel that does not exist and and to be frank I don 't think that we 're ready for that either it is going to be an iterative process of as the crown gradually moves away from you know that the control of the CBD and and and potentially the residential red zone as the council is able to step up but not the council as an organization the council on behalf of the people of Christchurch who want to engage in that process so you know I think this is a wonderful opportunity the crown did not have to do a recovery program a recovery plan they didn 't have to do one they could have gone straight to statute and i think that the government by actually coming out and putting a recovery plan out for people to comment on has actually indicated that it wants to deal with the people of Christchurch in a completely different way and I think that 's good news for the city and and I think if government 's held out their hand and said look we don 't have to do a transition recovery plan we 're going to do one and we invite you to have a I think that 's tremendous so what we will do is we will sign off on a on a principles one because we have to do it the week before because our the last week of July unfortunately you know sort of bad coincidence there but at that 's a recess week for the council so we 're not here that following week to make decisions on the on the submission so make those on the 23rd or 24th depending how things pan out and but I think that after that we should definitely be engaging with our communities about all of the issues because there is another stage and that is as the legislation that will come on and I 'm sure there will be great interest and that Select Committee hearing and I 'm sure the select committee will come to Christ Church so engaging with our communities about what they want to achieve I think program what I was trying to understand this is really focused on the structures that that commit but there 's nothing that captures what the vision is for the city whether it 's the blueprint whether it 's Sharon here whether it 's the other kind of new thinking that 's emerged or evolved since time has passed so it 's not going to be decided between now and the end of July right so setting up a structure to deliver on outcomes that 's best for Christchurch without knowing what those outcomes are with look that as I just see this an assertion of process we 've got up to the end of july for the submitting on the plan the as brendan has said where we are able to work collaboratively with central government over what goes into the cabinet paper that signed off at the end of august legislation comes in and September we will obviously be making a submission to the Select Committee and we will want our communities to engage in that process as well I 'm sure that the vision for what the people fact that they want this engage not just as a CBD not just as a residential red zone but actually more broadly the whole of the city damage suburbs like Richmond like New Brighton Sumner little turn you know all of these communities need to be seen and that concept of in the regeneration that 's why I was really interested to understand because if you don 't know where you 're going how do you know what 's the best vehicle to get it if you 're going up to the mountains with snow you might take a four-wheel drive if you 're going down south ashburton you might take a sports car because you 're going on a long flat straight right so you wouldn 't speed you wouldn 't speed but you know it 's just I guess what I 'm hearing you 're saying is we should be encouraging people to make submissions to this process around what outcomes they want for the city even though this is mainly focused on the vehicle because that 's the first up we already know what our community wants about not even though it was focused on the CBD it really did speak to what people wanted for Christchurch and that still remains the most incredible outpouring of well contribution that has existed and the whole earthquake story and I think that we can easily formulate that vision for our submission on the plan we 're agreeing to today are flexible enough to be able to be changed amended yes sir in light of what do y 'all_''_771.42 can work gets done around what that final destination is that we agree with the crumb because I think we 're still a long way from we are going to sign off on it on really the high-level principles and yes I imagine that we will announce submission reflect what the people of Christchurch told the previous council and share an idea Paul I want a move will sick of it no and it 's in there talk to it well I 'll move it and you can see conduct and you can speak to it oh sorry so a geographic scope need to be determined he talked us through that maybe I can talk to this because I 've done it just before no good the thing was was that if you actually look at the recovery plan the draft and I haven 't got it in front of me but the headline on the relevant section that deals with regenerate christchurch talks about the central city so it is clear when the original cabinet paper was drafted that this regenerate christchurch was to focus at in the same area the same space as the ccd you so not Sarah but the ccd you after some discussions around why it might be a better idea to look more broadly than that and talking about those different communities that are so incredibly damaged out there and in how we might resolve that that lead to a discussion about whether we should be talking about what is the best geographic scope for regenerate christchurch so it 's been it 's been put in there as a matter to be discussed rather than something that 's predetermined any other questions and just said to you that and you raised the point early on part of the legislative review so that statute and select committee process that they would be reviewing the early sections of the recovery strategy in part of that work would include redeveloping the purpose statement from the recovery strategy which is there to continue the analogy there kind of vehicle and a sense for defining their the future destination so that 'll be a piece of work that and will will operate and parallel with the legislation progressing through the select committee process which of course will be at open public process through the parliamentary process it 's so they 'll what re that put out the recovery strategy for amendment and I think what the intention is is that there and recovery strategy as it 's currently now on will morph into my suspect something called a regeneration strategy to maintain their the synergies in the terminology but obviously there and purpose statement of the recovery strategy would need to be aligned with the purpose statement of the corresponding legislation so then their actions under the legislation need to be consistent with the purpose of the legislation in purpose I have a particular issue with the recovery strategy which is that the whole community engagement section of it sits outside the enforceable statutory framework so that could be something we could fix during that process Jimmy if they don 't wanna establish this generator pages and all who currently Council know has been established the development I chose limited these two is for all focus on the regeneration of the city osito I just want to know the what 's the relationship between these two candle company settle in case if they integrate together whether have more or less the overlap how to mitigate is the situation this my particular cancer yin and i do want to comment on celebrating I suppose I think we reduce the geographical location particularly of regenerate crushed church development Christchurch limited his a far broader geographical scope though than just the central city so that 's the meta one of the measures for consideration over the kind of coming period is how we marry up the entities in here we marry at the geographical focus of the entities and there will be a a position ideally a great position but and their crown will ultimately make a decision through cabinet of the focus for the particular entity the cabinet minute specifically asks for a consideration of the relationship works development Christchurch limited and and to talk about and it talks about possible integration with so so all of the options are on the table yep alright no more questions so i 'll put the motion Yanni yep okay um thank you um appreciate the amendments that have been made particularly for paragraph B where we 've now included the words environmental sustainability community health and well-being and a seamless transition back to local leadership and I hope within that broad context of leadership we also mean local decision-making in local governance because I think local leadership is quite broad though some some key elements in there that we should be encouraging back as we have with the request for an elected ich n so us from making those amendments um I just wanted to say that I think the really positive thing about this is the fact that this recognizes that the reports policy issues so unlike the binding cost share that council didn 't have come back in its final form it 's my expectation through this process we do actually get to see what the details are of whatever 's discussed and negotiated with the crowd for our formal approval so I think that 's really important point because we don 't we don 't want to end up on a kind of a great recipe for austerity that people don 't feel that they 've had involvement and I think this this transparency of us making a collective decision on the implications of it are really important I just also wanted to make the final point is that I do think I welcome the opportunity for us to discuss a new vision or new outcomes for the city what we know post-earthquake is that thing 's post disasters that things are dynamic things change so a blueprint that 's stuck in a certain period of time or a Sharon an idea that stuck in a certain point of time has to evolve as we recover and we rebuild and we part of this structure but I do welcome the opportunity to have that flexibility because at the end of the day we 've heard that this is a matter between the council and the crown I 'm I you think it 's a meadow between the CCC which is the council the crown and the citizens of the city and they have a right to be involved informed and actively participate in the decisions for the future of that place that they call Christchurch so with that being said I 'm happy to support the recommendation thank you Andrew thank you I 'll quote from the mayor just a few moments ago in fact who said it 's tremendous that the government want people to have their say my view is that it 'll be even more tremendous when the people of Christchurch are fully engaged with this process when the government is listen to what the council and the people of Christchurch have had to say about this and when that information that 's been provided the insight and the vision of the people of Christchurch is influenced not an opportunity for council to lead by example by following a robust process in terms of its own submission to make sure we get that 's absolutely right and see what so what needs to be said and working to the best outcomes for Christchurch that are presented by this opportunity the other thing I would say is that this needs to be about the whole city needs to be inclusive so not just about the central sitting but about all of those suburbs have been mentioned down the number that happens as well I welcome the amendments which have been made to the report that 's in front of us or the resolutions in front of us today and that 's actually been part of some some very positive and iterative conversations which have happened already today and that in my view org as well for the conversations that will continue to have as the process evolves and the report that 's in front of us is in fact about a process and about a process that needs to be inclusive flexible nimble reactive open and clear and which the submission and the wider piece of work that can respond to and be inclusive of the views of all of the counselors around that table around this table and all the counselors as representatives of the communities out there and you know we 're certainly in touch with the community board chairs the community board members community members we have a fair idea we 've just come through a long term plan process we 're very aware of what the issues out there that the people are concerned about our so all of that will feed in through this process and on the basis that it is nimble reactive flexible open clear transparent inclusive all of those those are the things that have been talked about today and that it produces results that maximize the opportunity I certainly support the process that 's put out here today Paul yeah like I 'm really happy to support the submission on this transitional process I also think that it actually highlights a shift in the government 's thinking towards crisis in and its transition and how it 's best to go approach which are really really really happy to see it actually offers us an opportunity as a council who represent the people of Christchurch to if you give the input that yarn he 's talking about and have that influence on how our city evolves and on a big supporter people know the central city but I 'm also promised and of the connections that come into the central city and essential city as only as strong as its suburbs that surround it and of course if we those connections and make those suburbs successes in their own right we will actually strengthen the city center at the same time so I think I agree that the the approach needs to be slightly wider than the Finch city yet to add to a suburban areas because that 's where growth is happening and to say that you know I 'm really looking forward to this new a collaborative approach with the government and the shift and balance of of control over the city that will happen over the next five years and I think it also highlights the government 's really come a long way as a council over and they recognized that and and they given us this opportunity which is you want he poured it out there that they didn 't have to do so in getting over the job of rebuilding a city thank you just the the last thing that I wanted to say was and I found a website that just summarized it really well for me which were the six C 's of successful community engagement because I think this is what councils do stand for so there is no point thinking of ourselves as a council we 're representing the city in this regard so what we are doing is on behalf of and worth the members of our communities here are the six C 's of successful community engagement and I think we have to commit to ticking the Box on all of these as we go through this process capability the members are capable of dialogue that means talking to each other but it means listening to each other as well that 's what dialogue is if you don 't have getting a monologue from me right now but dialogue is core critical you 've got to be capable of dialogue so capability commitment mutual benefit beyond self-interest the public interest has got to be protected and all of these discussions going forward because you know and I you think of the possibilities I know that the government 's been very focused on the on the anchor projects but for me it 's the spaces in between the other ones that can be activated by a view of the public realm but also a view of what the private sector can bring to the vibrancy of our city that 's going to be occurring and those spaces the whole purpose of the anchor projects regardless of what people think of them the whole purpose of them was to provide their activation and that commitment to Christ Church contribution members volunteer and there is an environment that encourages members to have a go or take responsibility or risks and that sense of the possibility you know I heard the deputy mayor use this expression this is a city right now where anything are prepared to have a go they are prepared to take responsibility that prepared to take risks we need to as a city continuity members share or rotate roles and as members move on there is a transition process that sustains and maintains the community corporate memory so important how often to communities stand or fall on one person that one person falls over or move somewhere else and the whole structure underneath just whittles away and finding ways of keeping communities fully engaged is really really important collaboration reliable interdependence a clear vision with members operating in an environment of sharing and trust if there is one word that goes with leadership that is trust have to be trusted to be able to be leading and actually leading does mean collaborating because leading actually means looking for the leadership capabilities and others the best leaders that our history are those that where people can say I did that myself because they 're not seeing the leader taking the ownership they 're actually allowing others to own the results and the last one which i think is incredibly important next trust and respect that are expressed in the actions of the community and that 's why every single one of us are sitting around this table we 're here to honor that trust and earn that respect and continue to ensure that the expressions of the actions of our community are able to come to the fore so that 's my monologue and I would now like to put the motion all those in favor say

    "text": "the supplementary no no I put them somewhere right there it is okay so the first isomer is the residential red zone offer recovery plan comments and I I will move there and do I have a seconder for that Glenn Livingston I have them in terms of this particular paper because it 's in my name I thought that I just explain why it 's come so late in the piece on this particular recovery plan the the crown put a preliminary draft plan out for public comment and my recollection is that there was something like 800 submissions came in on the convert on the preliminary recovery plan and so after those were processed this draft residential red zone offer recovery plan came out but only allowed two weeks for submissions so I was completely unaware that the submissions closed today at five o 'clock so i do apologize to counsel us that it is so late and that 's why i emailed you all a copy yesterday and asked you to read it carefully because it does contain you know some issues that have been in the be something that the council would have commented on in the past but I think it 's solutely vital that we comment on it the staff provided comments on the preliminary draft because they felt that it was important to record the council 's interest in the recovery plan given our obligations in relation to infrastructure provision our financial contribution to crown property purchases on the port hills and our role in aiding the recovery of the citizens of Christchurch from the effects of the earthquakes and I think that the the point that I 've made and verses that it would have been better to have a more collaborative approach from the outset and you know people might recall that I sit on or asked a question of staff on Friday last week at the district plan review would it have been better if we had sat down and work through the the residential redzone proposition with Sarah and perhaps address some of the you know sea-level rise and or coastal erosion and a nun dae shin and flood risk issues at the same time obviously dealing with those to deal with them as opposed to the earthquakes issue but recognizing that some of those issues were clearly directly affected by the earthquake itself may have been able to be included within the recovery planning process and and the answer to that question was yes that would have been that would have been good so I think it 's important to make that point in terms of the questions that the draft residential redzone recovery plan or red zone offer recovery plan what it asks for as it asks for the whether we agree with the chief executive preliminary view on a new offer to buy vacant red zone land and yes the proposal was that yes it 's the same offer that was made to insured residential red zone homeowners to do you agree with the chief executives preliminary view on a new offer to buy insured commercial same properties yes it 's the same offer that was made to insured residential red zone homeowners so I 'll just skip three for a minute because that 's the substance of the report for do you agree with the rapaki babe red zone properties and I 've actually it 's kind of almost like kick for touch here because I don 't know the answer to this question and we really haven 't had an opportunity for me eight of you believe that the principles that should apply as consistency with the position on the offer that ought to be made to uninsured homeowners and as in accordance with the Crown 's obligations under tato BTL waitangi because obviously land swapping is one of the proposals and they 're so their land that is not suitable for development because of rockfall risk could be swapped for for other land and I mean as a matter of principle I do support the idea of land swapping do you agree with the chief executives preliminary view on a new offer to buy insured privately owned red zone off properties yes it may be that people would wish to review their position and light of the issue is discussed above with reference to meters sit out in the Supreme Court judgment and it 's basically saying that and some parts of the loving at the moment so that was that was why people may want to review that at the stages that remains a voluntary offer and so let 's go back to three and i 'll walk through that and i 'm happy to answer any question i believe that the council needs to take the view that sara is wrong to discriminate against residential red zone homeowners who for whatever reason found themselves uninsured at the time of the earthquakes and there was a feeling that I had reading through the the the draft recovery plan that there was a selective quoting from the Supreme Court judgment so I 've read that judgment and great detail and I know it 's a majority decision which means that there were other does that sit on the bench that felt otherwise in terms of the process that ought to have been adopted but what the Supreme Court said was that the government should have done a recovery plan and the reason they should have done a recovery plan was that it allowed for public engagement it allowed for a submissions process that was like to receive you know I mean I was in a privileged position being a member of parliament I had noticed before you know we had a meeting before the actual announcement was made but for most people they heard it on the news they saw it on the Internet they found out that their homes were going to be Reds owned by public announcement there 's no question that a lot of wraparound support was off to people around that time but there was no engagement no to and fro no real debate about it the we 're the opportunity was allowed for a review of the decisions that have been made and a small group was set up to review the red zone boundaries but again not so much a general submissions process and certainly not around the offer that was made to allow people to move on and what the what the draft paper does and I don 't think that this is and I 'm not saying this in a negative way I 'm just saying that this this seems to be a misunderstanding about Reds owned so I was insured so if my neighbor was not insured is the right comparison my neighbor and me is that the right comparison because make offering my neighbor the same as me doesn 't diminish what I 've been offered it doesn 't change what I 've been offered it doesn 't affect what I 've been offered so why is it right to compare what I 've been offered with my neighbor and should bind Ava be Shaboom neighbor not be offered the same because they were uninsured I know the story of a neighbor where the husband didn 't agree with insurance he 'd had a fight with the insurance company and he refused to ensure the property she was desperate about that but you know that was that was the way things were and their household and and it had been for a number of years I 'm sadly he passed away and she immediately started to sit about to get insurance for her house now she was comparing a number of insurance companies on Friday the third of September 2010 she decided which to see them on monday she was uninsured why should she get less than me you know so I you know I do feel emotional about these particular cases but it 's because I have listened to the personal stories of people who didn 't self insure they didn 't deliberately not ensure there were people stories over and over again who just simply didn 't have insurance on the day that the earthquake happened so my viewers is that we should compare apples with apples let 's compare to uninsured houses but one in the red zone and one in the green zone and so we 've attached the story of one of the ones in the greenstone to the submission and we 've got a picture of the governor-general governor-general helps out in Illinois and there he is helping out an Illinois and here 's some quotes from some of the people that Habitat for Humanity are helping are at their wit 's end for them there seems to be no way for their problems to be resolved and then to have these strangers turn up at the 's fantastic and moving and for most of them it does get emotional most of the volunteers are from Christchurch and they 're dealing with their own challenges the whole thing is very much about communities helping each other the difference between being red zoned being red zoned in Green Zone door the difference between being uninsured and the red zone and uninsured and the Green Zone is that the possibility of compassion the possibility of neighbors helping of communities helping of Habitat for Humanity helping and habitat for humanity was funded by the New Zealand Red Cross it was funded by contributions that came from all around the country and from overseas it was funded by what was known as the Prime Minister 's fund they didn 't sit in judgment of people who didn 't have insurance and neither should the government so that 's the position that I have presented in this paper and I 'm seeking support from you for it the Supreme Court decided that we shouldn 't make a judgment about the individuals they could the government could they could go up individual by they knew of cases where there was not a conscious choice not to ensure their properties a couple who paid insurance premiums religiously but were in the process of having a financial advisor packaged up a complete insurance offer for everything with a four-day gap before the September 2010 earthquake a couple who had overlooked changing insurance cover unto their name because of stress from a cancer diagnosis and caring for dependent family members this couple was insured at the time of the septum uninsured at the time of the September 2010 earthquake and their insurance come had refused cover even though they had had insurance with the company since 1972 a claimant who had understood that insurance was in the hands of her bank and a claimant who had not paid his insurance premiums for two months prior to the earthquake by oversight these are the real human stories that sit behind why people were uninsured on the fourth of September there aren 't many of them there aren 't many of them in the red zone and there aren 't many of them in our country because earthquake required by their banks to take out an insurance and maybe banks should be a little bit more vigilant by requiring people to maintain insurance and ensuring that they 're maintaining insurance during the course of the mortgage the owner of a house and the red zone with a 2007 valuation of 300,000 would receive an offer from the government of just over 70 thousand dollars for their house this is eighty percent of the land value only based on this draft plan somebody who was uninsured and the Green Zone could have the Governor General come and help repair their house and Habitat for Humanity repaired dozens of houses in the Green Zone for people who were uninsured so I think that it 's much more important that we look for fairness and consistency that we look for the possibility of compassion by assisting people and the situation and the last thing that I want to say is that there is a footnote in the Supreme Court case which I 'm surprised hasn 't really been focused on and it was a surprise to me when it was pointed sarah paper dated jun 2011 enumerated one of the cons of developing a recovery plan as being that there may be a commune to expectation that their views may change decisions the Supreme Court said that the requirement of the Act that such important decision should involve community and Potter 's not just a matter of procedural form it 's a measure of substance the legislative history made it clear that contemporary ins were to have unput under the rebuilding of their communities and basically any argument that consultation would have made no difference carries little weight and I think we should say as a council it carries little weight with us to the thought that the crown might have closed its mind to anything that the community thought about what was an appropriate way to address the challenges of these damaged areas that were people 's homes neighborhoods and communities is very very hard to accept so I 'm seeking the endorsement of counsel for this submission to be made by five o 'clock today in the name of the council Glen and Paul yani Andrew thank you as large d red I would like to endorse that and have it noted that I think well in my view the insurance struggles that people have had post-quake bear out that argument that insurance companies were known as scary i 'm talking about something else yeah we 're difficult to deal with before the quakes and after and that there actually were a lot of people twixt and tween and offer if you call it an offer people were and how to down the phone to actually leave their house so I 'm actually you call it an offer wasn 't reasonable underneath the quote about the governor-general I noticed there the problem with the approach talks about people being on the other side of a fence or a road if we look at for instance a street not far from where we live in that horseshoe lake area de Vil place that 's literally the case one side is red one is green and those sort of scenarios are quite plausible there that final comment you made before about community input sends a bit like an eternity can ISM know what they want they know who they want for their elected representative you know to open it up to consider the possibility that the community could have a view beggaring so I strongly support your submission yeah Paul I will be a supporting recommendation this will ask a question list and relation to what difference does it make to the government with very short or long does it actually make a difference at all yes depend if the property is insured then the amount that the crown can claim back from the insurance obviously as increased and they can claim for the land damage from eq c yani thank you I just kind of appreciate the work you 've done on it and much as the sentiment that you 've made just um I was um did you consider that council should actually be given the red zone offer things kind of like bizarre that we 've given away a whole bunch of our social housing through the cost share and we never got an offer for our social housing but I was raised that secretly with the government I mean if the principle applies that we want it you know we want people to be well we weren 't uninsured when uninsured but because we were like that that 's not it 's not a scope why not what could we we 're not that with this is only focused on uninsured business and empty sections it 's all it 's focused on it 's not is there anything else you think should be taken into account no no but this is what the I mean I 've tried to keep these are the specific questions we were asked and we are not we were not uninsured all right but if you look at five do you agree with the chief executive I many of you on the new offer to buy insured privately owned red zone properties we say years sex is there anything else so I think there is scope and here to make that point it was signed off on the cost share agreement I have a process in place where we are raising all of these issues and as I 've already informed counselors with central government that we wish to review the fact that all of our social housing was was handed over to the crown without any compensation yeah but surely I 'm not going to put it no I think it 's a wrong process to do because this is all about I mean the real issue here is the fact that uninsured improved red zone properties are not being offered one hundred percent of their capital value and I think that it 's important to remember that the reason that we are making the submission is to advocate for our ratepayers who are equally deserving of treatment because equal treatment because they are equally ratepayers whether they are insured or not as a relevant to the question and I don 't think it 's appropriate to raise a separate issue that we 've already raised with central government other than through the process that I 've outlined I think that 's the distinction between the rate payers and yeah well if you look at the first paragraph I mean we can debate it that 's that 's fine the second economic analysis of the value of the way in which the return offer has has has been conducted any sense of how much government have received what 's happened in terms of the tape they go no so I do think that that 's of interest I know that at one of the briefings that we had from one of the insurance companies we were advised that in some instances the crown would have received more than they paid out under option one which was certainly not impossible in my view but was a surprise to me that there were a number so I mean that will be of interest I think to a number of people particularly those that sold their houses for less than they would have got had they had they actually settled with the crown for option two so and I think that as far as the land goes the agreement that was signed for option two was that if the crown received more from eq c for land damage then they would pay the difference to the homeowner to the former homeowner it had an that 's noted that we lost valuation of two billion yeah that 's right and it 's been a significant I did actually go online to see what my new rating valuation oars for my section nine thousand dollars for 540 square meters yeah so but it 's a significant impact on our rating base so I think you know it 's right to raise it it 's a it has had a huge difference on our balance sheet Andrew thank you I just wanted to make some comments and maybe a couple of suggestions around paragraph 4 in the submission the what 's described here is the rapper key bay resident properties now the this is quite unique in terms of the issues canvassed in the draft recovery plan and also quite unique in terms of some of the red zone considerations and there 's been considerable frustration to the people that but are involved with with this within the rapper he community now the first point I would make is that until I read the draft submission from government from sara i 'd never heard the settlement a rapper he pays the geographical feature which is the inlet where the water comes into the land the settlement is rap aking or otherwise known as the rapa keep are so i would suggest and again you know that community would never refer to that place as rapper ki bang they would refer to it as wrap a key or a Peggy par so I 'd suggest we we ourselves dropped the word bay from our submission out of sensitivity to that community and also the fact that we have that local knowledge and I 've got a copy of the top of map in front of me in fact and it shows it exactly the way I 've described it so if i change it to formulate of you on the rap hockey offer noting that the reference to wrap up ebay does not accurately describe the area correct yep and if we just drop the word bay in both the the title of paragraph four and in the substantive paragraph itself well no but that 's the question that there are all right so okay so you won then the second point I mean I appreciate that council hasn 't had an opportunity to formulate a view on the rapper key offer but I wonder whether our paragraph goes far enough in terms of sensitivity to the particular nature of the tenure and use of this land and I 'm wondering whether we could just insert some additional wording again picking up points that are made in the syrah document but something along the lines of in accordance with the Crown 's obligates Scotch I think we need to go further than suggesting it 's just obligations under the treating that we should be looking at so that they offer ought to be made to insured should applies consistency with our permission on the offer that should be made that ought to be made to uninsured homeowners so put another to leave another thing there it 's a coma a coma fully takes into account yet and acknowledges the implication of the tonga took a home and a fully takes into account and acknowledges the implications of yep the tanger took her a ho and maybe we can nature of the land and it just means that not only do we say there are obligations under the treating but we say that there are particular sensitivities and particular cultural considerations that need to be taken into account which may be over and above handed down from each generation whose bracket yep nature of the land yeah great thank you yep that 's great thank you anyone else I 'll open it up for debate then then I think I 've said my butt as I did before and that the case over insurance is very strong and that this side of the quakes proves that insurance companies have always been difficult to deal with and that 's why we had to push it was outside of cool Council prisoners but that 's why we pushed for insurance advocacy and resolution we shouldn 't he yep great yani I strongly support making this request I tried to do this as part of the cost share unfortunate council didn 't endorse that at the time but I do like that this has caused huge grief and anxiety to a number by the earthquakes and I do think we have a moral obligation to advocate strongly on their behalf for the right thing to occur I 'm having said that I 'm disappointed that we 're not requesting around our social housing because when you look at this offer being cinder to commercial and also comment made at the start around looking at opportunities for people that haven 't taken up the offer to be extended I think it actually makes sense I appreciate that we 're going to raise that through another forum but if i go back to what 's at the heart of my support for the submission in the main it is the fact that everyone should be tweaked trick treated fairly and i don 't think it 's fair that we didn 't receive an offer for our social housing on red zone land we didn 't make the choice to read zone that land and we 've lost about 15 million dollars worth of property as a result 8 so 8 million yes so it just seems to me that you know if you take of fairness because outside of people 's control there was a red zone process that had no community and put into it then i can 't understand why we wouldn 't include our own social housing it seems odd that that was able to be given away basically for free without any public consultation any public discourse and in fact ironically reflecting on the discourse we 've had subsequently we 've seen that people felt really strongly that we shouldn 't be disposing of our social housing land so i 'm happy to support the submission i endorsed the comments that if I and I welcome this council looking at taking a new position than it previous had under the last term of council and I 'd encourage you all to support it I guess I don 't want to vote against it so you know I 'd like to move that we make the offer there 's an amendment for the our own residential property within the red zone i 'll appreciate if there you know maybe a second remote maybe not unfortunate because this came late we haven informally is there a second or third that amira there isn 't so thank you Andrew and then Ellie thank you i 'm really pleased to support this submission some of the issues dealt with here are examples of you know certainly not good practice there are issues here that have been dealt with that have been inherently unfair that have produced some horrendous outcomes and huge amounts of unnecessary stress and anxiety to some of the people already worst affected by the earthquakes in terms of the stress and the distress that the earthquakes caused so you know to to be submitting here on aspects of a process that added to that stress and distress for many people and you know where that stress is still ongoing a number of years later I totally support the approach that 's been taken here and the paragraph on page three that kind of sums this up for me the situation is now dire for those who cannot afford to accept the offer the residential redzone land clearances have created an untenable position for many who remain not as a matter of people really living in a way that they would never ever have dreamed of and have been put in a position that they haven 't been able to get out of purely because of the circumstances that hopefully response to submissions like this will resolve so I 'm very pleased to support this submission and the tone of it and I encourage counsel as to UM to do the same le so on to endorse that as well and thank you for your work that you 've put into it I think this is the first time that I 've seen the issue so succinctly put in one place and not only based on fact with the backup of those facts but the humanity that sent us as well and communicating that was this was inherently unfair on so many levels but how that affected people who were already in a very Duggar stressful place so I just wanted to thank you for the work that 's gone into this and I 'll certainly be supporting it today to close it off I I 've actually been quite shocked in people who were uninsured the reason that people are being asked to accept an offer is because the land was red zoned not because they were uninsured if they were uninsured in the Green Zone they could have got help compassionate help from people whose reason for being is to help others the number of people who have said to me well it 's good the government 's increase the offer from fifty percent to eighty percent but actually that 's only of the land value not the whole value so how can you move on if you get eighty percent of your land value and land values and parts of the yeast are very low as i know so i think that it 's really important to remember that we should not be falling into the trap of judging people for circumstances that that none of us completely understand and i think that there was absolutely no reason the court went through this there is no reason to do a case-by-case assessment of whether a cases are deserving one or not and that 's when i 've spoken to this situation because of this or because of that you know somebody who was in hospital and the bills just didn 't get paid they piled up you know so all of these reasons why things happen do we do a case-by-case assessment of where there are cases a deserving one habitat for humanity and its funders and volunteers did not judge people in this way and neither should the government there is no moral hazard and implementing government policy fairly and consistently across the areas which the government without any any of the protections of its own statutory processes and with no consultation unilaterally determined to be residential red zone and and that was the point that the court made if they 've done a recovery plan at least people would have had a say at least people who were in the red zone who were insured could have been asked do you mind that we pay the same to your neighbor who was uninsured because I tell you I wouldn 't I wouldn 't mind at all I actually think that that 's the only fair way to story so judgments aren 't necessary in this case fairness and consistency the government made area-wide decisions to create the residential red zone and they should make area-wide offers to people that they want to leave so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "then consents David would you like to there 's nearly a few comments okay yep we opened our last meeting with a patient from Robert right from the building control his men but he gave us an exceptionally good briefing on the continuous improve project that operates a program i should say that operates within the building control unit and i believe it 's something that could be well utilized and other parts of council where staff have the ability to raise issues of concern changes to policy rules of around the program they call the vault where things get in and they get elevated to various levels of staff and that within the building control unit and dealt with fairly quickly so it 's an exceptionally good program and i would recommend that it has looked at for other parts of the secondly they the building control unit report itself things that came very well there the residence um statutory time frame is sitting around ninety nine percent and commercial when the high nineties as well i think last time with um that 's that sitting pretty well we control unit is sitting fairly comfortable with that they 're a confident that they have all issues sitting as factory manner for that visit and lastly just so some of the work that the regulations and consents can be touching on where we 've invited the enforcement unit to report to the count to that on a on a bi-monthly basis that that 's about all for them very good thank you and you 'd like to move that and second everybody just just one other thing perhaps Paul may load of the of a mural quality regulation review task force quite doubtful we have met once so far just looking at structure and improvements with rules reduction comment on that but come up I 've received some information back from like Thailand and rather than looking at what can be done to reduce ruler swapping the counseling currently is doing and I think you 're doing quite a lot in that space and however there are some similar hanging fruit we can also pick off to actually improve some of the processor to do it the organization has got whole yeah we are currently sort of a using move forward the other thing too is a known with the mirror of C wants us to look at the public art and thank you I was going to bed to that hinder and I have asked the staff to actually look at it it 's a process we need to unpack and there 's a different pass through we need to completely unpack and we put it back together so they come in as over one piece of work yeah and this is two different routes that you can go down and you know I must admit have to apply for a resource consent just goes Lu shutter shutter is over years of you know we don 't want anybody putting anything any no no I agree with that I agree that they have to apply but it would be really good of the community of course the community boards you know first you know like the sculpture that we unveiled yeah exactly you know that why that had to go through a resource consent process of the scale I had licensed to occupy but I mean the whole thing that 'd be reviewed but we tell you I think I think it 's a committee that and its opening some quite interesting avenues and bit of work to do yet even while share that information with the committee event next meet council to have a look at what the cat of it you as I say the the council who if you reduce issue you say you are the things I did much more streamlined mentor okay well I 'm just I 'm just sending a note to my office to invite you to all three of you to a meeting next week which I have organized with Jackie Dean MP who is representing the minister on some of the work that 's being done on regulations red tape issue so and I think that would be great that she saw that the teams already working on these issues but comment on that interesting enough yeah let government rules reduction mostly based around the building yeah stuffin and it was actually stuff the government actually implement shouldn 't be a meeting held and they invited developers long and seemed to be mostly council bashing leave a nasty looking at people confuse what mb issues what the building code and the council 's issues I think they had mold them all the other day yeah and the other the other thing is that I mean I actually spoke to Jackie Dean on the phone and I I said that you know some of the regulatory and pulse are actually a requirement of central government it 's the only way that we can you know address issues so sometimes Parliament with the best will in the world you know opening up you know communities having involvement for exam loko alcohol plans creates a regulatory framework for decision-making which is actually sometimes counterintuitive sometimes counterproductive so I 'm just saying that there are issues that central government imposes on local government having been one of those and the consequences of those are not always obvious to those that are looking for the easy ones and the low-hanging fruit as you say so I think we need to make sure that people realize think that would be really helpful so I 'll make sure that you get the invite to the meeting all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we move on _"

budgeted costs and what cost controls are in place I don 't know if you 've had any information back on that but I 'd really like to understand it given that we are incurring huge costs and I think having huge rate requested further information around the district plan plan reviews and budgeted costs and our spot cost controls room phase and that 's coming to the next meeting but I mean I guess a fundamental question is um do we have any cost controls in place because between cities are select and the reports going back to the committee both in the me no point having a debate about it here we 're going to receive that at the next meeting I 'm just worried that between now and when we receive the report further costs are incurred that have a rates impact that is not something that we well we 've already we 've already decided on the long-term plan that that would be absorbed within the strategy and planning our budget so it won 't be going over the line without an agreement from this council so we 'll come back here for a decision if letters to be the case but at this stage we decided as a council that it would be absorbed within that budget Paul just noted a 4.5 and sy yet

claims update as a thirtieth of April 2015 I 'll move that Jamie can second up and yeah I don 't want details I know that it 's it 's you know seemed to do but have we got any idea about an insurance settlement or any sort of reporting back time frames or when we might be in a position of having ordered what can you say publicly Peter I don 't think I can say anything publicly on that other than the process we work through is to provide updates and gain guidance from the insurance subcommittee around around the progress around it is as fast as we can to get the best result we can and I know that doesn 't give you any any detail at all to go on council Johansson but that 's probably all I can talk about this point terms of timing there 's a capital program review obviously that has quite a big impact are we going to be in a position by the end of the year to have any column it 's why we flag it is one of our key uncertainties around the the timing of our debt profile and it 's actually referenced in the Treasury paper just a couple of items ago as well around the uncertainties around that and also around the impact it has for capital release as well so we understand that it 's a key uncertainty within the plan and we don 't have certainty and when the timing on that will be resolved okay okay so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried debt write-off christchurch yarns limiters oh you 're you 're conflicted have a seconder for us David just a Christian on on these this one for in the next few food do we have the ability to put a registration against the title or all the security against properties that these people own so that when they get sold where you think the answer was an unsecured creditor on this one so I don 't know what you 're talking about registering a security means we haven 't got her security to register most of these tend to be limited liability companies which have very little ability for us to chase through we 've tried to debt recovery actions that within our power and we 've come up short on these ones there 's nothing to get there 's no legal instrument we have to put something on the land if it 's developed or so to get the money back other one just moral persuasion moral persuasion is full flat here too right I just I mean I don 't know how other counselors feel but I personally feel we need to be talking to probably central government around us companies liquid a set up another company sell off the the thing with having these outstanding balances back to us and we having to write off the dead that was it a man yeah well that 's why I 'm raising it because it does seem to me that we need to think about some sort of legal instrument that that attaches to the title to the land around so that people were buying it they can check one of these places house in New Zealand actually bought the property but the question is is front ending this and rather than talking about it after the fact because after the fact if you 've got an unsecured if your unsecured then there is just no capacity if the money 's just not there because you at the end of the line and there 's a lot of people who join the queue a long time before the unsecured creditors and they are employees who are owed wages holiday pay and redundancy and I don 't think anyone around this table would want to you suit that priority so you know right up there and so are the fees for the receiver so but I don 't think that that change either so what I 'm wondering is is that the front team so this was for trade waist charges and I think the question is how did they get to the point of how do we get to the point of being owed eighteen thousand dollars by a limited liability company you know and maybe that 's the front ending of the TSA 's that do we have to actually take a stronger position because i know that i 've seen emails come through from people concerned about having to go on monthly billings and forward Billings and and complaining about doing that but an actual fact this is the cost of getting that wrong and that has accumulated sums of money which then have to be written off so it could maybe that 's something that could come back to strategy and finance Peter as a report on on the front ending of some of the risks around or managing risk around the accumulation of dick by limited liability currently do to manage the risk at the front end yeah and get guidance from strategy and finance around those parameters yeah that 's great I 'm 3.7 on page 140 and I know it 's a separate item but it 's all related to the debt write-off well no does a separate item let 's deal with it when we get to global development so Christchurch yawns the most i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those approach i know that 's carried and now dip right off global developments New Zealand a message is that that 's the one you want I 'm sorry I feel bad oh oh sorry did I say that out loud okay so tragically move that seconded by clean huh is there any discussion about that one corona items or whether it 's something completely different I just don 't know what they 're saying it trying to learn from how this keeps happening and put in place mechanisms to stop us having to incur this bad debt the reason is no comment is it 's not a mechanism so i purely comment here on what we can do and what we have done and the outcome of them yeah are we not anything we can do through legal avenues we 've exhausted our legal avenues they 're in liquidation and there are no funds available for us okay I know that there was a bit of a surprise that that they were put into liquidation I don 't know that we were expecting that ourselves I mean I know that I 've got a bit of a surprise because I mean business this development was one of the ones that I remember that the first time I really heard of it was when they were basically you know sort of offering you know sections before that even got consents and things like they 're at a home expo that Sarah ran when it was first set up back straight after the red zoning decisions beckon June so this must have been in July 2011 highfield was one of the development developments that was actually sort of kind of presenting to the public at that form and I was the process to be to be actually publicly putting their stuff out there but you know that counsel was holding hands up okay the view coming from that direction the council was holding thry I can 't wrong but the background set out at the bottom of page and 138 yeah we will live on them letters and 2013 legal proceedings in 2014 and proceedings filed and December 2014 as well yeah yeah there are multiple owners that I mean it 's a it 's a very problematic development has been from the start but anyway yes close cop will incurred before 2013-14 so I didn 't either first planetary absolute like those costs the ones that are unpaid Blee include included before two thousand thirteen and fourteen when we were writing to them saying boy I suspect that to be the case I don 't want to know that wouldn 't you and looking at those things like if we 're writing to them saying and pay us and we continued to occur include cost you would want to know that that yes system yes I 'm exhibit in continuing to yeah well can you check that because 3.1 says between 2011 and 2016 inclusive counsel and voiced highfield but it would be good to know that all of that was prior to the leases for going to be exchanged from late 2013 I 'm sure it is the case but it would be useful just to know that and if you could just include that in your report back on the on the issue at the street and Finance metering just cool all right I 'll pop the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed to know that 's carried next one debt write-off global developments New Zealand limited I 'll move their second to Jamie any discussion Yanni cuz I 'll just tell me what the statutory alone judge is and how you actually put it on a property no I cannot oh yeah have you are you able to assist but if it go and set up the what I 'm sorry I 'm please take a seat at the end of the table mr. Thompson because and tune them make sure that are it can be huge through the system we 're good to go now yes statutory land charges is a bit like a mortgage in that it 's a piece of paper that secures at Dayton is registered against the title to a property not always available there are rules around when you can and when you can 't register a statutory lien charge I 'm just not sure this particular matter whether it wasn 't investigated I 'm not sure either field was not honored okay so there may have been a good reason for that that we weren 't entitled to put a statutory lien charge on it but that 's basically what it is it secures I did then just like if someone doesn 't pay their rights we send liters and we say we 're going to put a charge against your mortgage and your bank and we 're going to threaten with XYZ and that 's for a tiny fraction of what these debts are and we see there 's no ability to recover those costs that doesn 't seem with respect to this one the remedy and 3 a 1 that new processing check to ensure all fees are paid before they actually get the code of compliance certificate that 's a very big key in a big lever in that process has been documented within that bc a quality manual now and staff have received training the other aspect and that 's that will form part of what we report back to around strategy and finance is that joint paper around count applications and a consistent level of scrutiny at the front end so that scanning the front end and it 's also ensuring we get the payment before the code of compliance that to some extent goes towards the the concern that you have that we lived pocket and they can just denied them so perhaps this was still a bit of a legacy on our loss of accreditation I wouldn 't like to call why but it certainly isn 't something that we want to heaven going forward no but in terms of end-to-end process and ensuring that our interests are protected every step of the way I mean that wasn 't you know I know that this happened in in 2014 and we lost our accreditation and the middle of 2013 but we didn 't get it back until you know the end of last year so I you know I just wonder if it 's a little bit of a legacy issue I just clarify is there any limit part for companies clean new companies with no history with the council until the bells that they can wrecker before we start saying you have to pay this before we go another step further never mind about code of compliance yes now what am i bringing that back to oestrogen finance babe yeah I can see that the process it going by the emails that I 've received by somebody who 's still on a month-by-month payment schedule who is furious about it who wants to go on to a proper accounting system there are protections in there but it it seems that this is an would be a mechanism for protecting it 's not as showing a code of compliance in a sick way mechanism yes but the sort of when the age of that debt in there and we keep an eye on that through some of the reports you 've seen coming through that there is any sort of yeah clearly it 's a bit high and some of these instances we know if there 's any other instances like have we reviewed why this actually happened and whether there 's any other instances opeth we have reviewed why this has happened and hence the remedy city under 38 d and that was all the control mechanism that will stop this opening other than that and the general processing check sheet that 's being developed that 's a mechanism for understand whether this was part of like normal processing or whether this has just been someone just forgot or someone didn 't took a box and now we 've got a chick she would normally pricey season plus we were supposed to have payment before this into the doubles issue but just in this particular case for whatever reason it didn 't happen for me to be absolutely crisp on that I 'd need to refer back to for me have we asked housing New Zealand to contribute yes they they did not say yes they give a reason they 're not legally obligated to provide any recompense to us for this all right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no just it says 2016 and 3.1 so probably just the slight change view hey we haven 't reached three are 2006 up 3.1 under high field it was the previous one I understood as well have yeah a little bit oh I see it 's probably meant to be 14 actually but anyway yeah but it but it doesn 't make any difference to the to the document yeah ok so I 'll move the whole recommendation that reporters the whole be adopted seconded by Paul lonsdale put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried item number 20 _"

    "text": "at year no and so spell Carter so yeah this shouldn 't take too long okay right so the item 12 part a meter the groins proposed renewal of playground equipment do you want to speak to that so this obviously came back to the board following our first decision for some reasons pointed out by some of the counselors um we 're actually happy with the decision we made now we understand the concerns but we 're aware of those concerns when we made the decision so we we 're happy to reconfirm where we we stood to start with you mean being that the animal playground be renewed yep and and this is on budget for the LTP yes and out of here I haven 't got the what are the numbers on it ok bet with the same to feature the same equation that just got so that 's if it what 's the cost what does it that suspending and this was this carry forward from last year it must have been because you you your paper said that funding was available this financial year on exact details up there i 'm assuming it to carry forward but this is tied up with some NZTA funding that they reimbursed council for but for the sun as part of its being relocated as part of the Western years SAS bypass yeah so well it 's not exactly been relocated because of it yes but that 's obviously reached the end of its useful life as well no playgrounds 482 team no no the play grass stain where it is is the fort that 's been relocated it no big cats both actually it has to be honest thing we come to the end of its life and if it 's tough me with you answer these people being very confusing but I was under the impression the playground is being rebuilt in a new location in other amenities also being moved the existing playground will remain because his 18 years life the fort is gone past its use-by date a new rebuild is that correct yes I 'd fortis past its use-by date so that has been removed the playground as being relocated partially June due to people are going to be congregating in going to in terms of using a picnic spaces so that 's sort of main drive for doing it the the rest of the equipment of the stage was to remain where it is but we don 't believe it will be very heavily used in that space it 's I think the board asked the question could there be moved to somewhere else in the city but it may be an option can you clarify the funding that this is part of the compensation package if you laugh I know it was part of the capital works program so it 's not part of the conversation that NZTA are providing for the groins that is they were separate so the funding for this project has was split over two financial years 2015 was the first lot of funding the intention was that the project would have been signed off and june and the end the second part of the funding coming through this year for doing the installation as the report and go through in the june majoring report to Council we know that I was carried it is from the last 150 thousand for the whole project yeah um Yanni thank you um I was interested that you made a comment that the project funds don 't include a nuclear the disability equipment yeah I didn 't hear that the problem under 4.2 funds elekid this project do not extend to include any further disability equipment so there 's nothing as anything in terms of accessibility equipment at all sarah said the the original plan we put forward it was requested from the board to to relook at the equipment we are putting on and we made amendments to that plan which is e amore went out and we consulted on and we included additional equipment to to make it excuse me a more fully accessible playground and have you talked to you if the disability sector groups around what what their needs may be or how those facilities no it 's not directly on this project that we have with other produce in the past so we do know what they are looking for terms of accessibility to two submissions again they well the three that came and all together yes please sorry yeah that 's sort of one of those funny I know I know I could well why would you make a submission I made me go there for a picnic you go there you know like it 's not a neighborhood park it 's a destination it 's completely different process has very hard one to consult on entities of the the audience you 're trying to catch because you 've got no strong you 've got a constantly changing audience and you you know I don 't completely get us well I just thought but and I went through masters and where they actually built a whole playground with the community and I was a really neat contrast to what we do which has built playgrounds for communities and it just seemed to me that whether there was any opportunity to further engage with the disability sector around addition equipment this is a destination so you right and it possibly is an opportunity given the interest in this SB to actually enhance that says it is know a really good experience yeah yeah you know everyone 's read it we know Turner gardens and central city yeah I think with the groins to you 've got to look at what the groins as a reserves about and it 's more about the whole environmental side of what people go there for like eight for the lakes fishing though just watch what the groins provides as a pack it 's not the people don 't if they go into a playground that let 's go to the groins it 's neither plan they sort of the playground is an add-on to a desolation there is really used for picnics that 's used for as you say fishing the the walking around their area you know it 's a completely different it 's not a it 's not a part it 's not a playground park no it 's got it 's an environment that has a playground on up yes where 's my gram provides that additional facility we 've people are visiting it so we haven 't built it around around that that we know that 've really children to be able to be occupied as well as they outside of there 's other activities they can do the groins I mean the botanic gardens and in the future of the margaret Mahy part playgrounds are two specific sites but i don 't think that there 's any harm and just asking staff to to connect with the disabilities mighty around and like i said we have done that in the past with other playgrounds and with just just general information gathering with with the different groups as well around what they pick up on that were here i think the discussion and it 's something that we could actually pursue yeah it isn 't it on later or you know yeah yeah absolutely all right so would you like to move this pauline and second ave le i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then is there anything else that you want to raise know everything else _"

playground has been referred to that committee yeah and I think that 's probably a wise decision and this considerable interest I will say that I stand by our community board 's decision and but I I look forward to the debate around the committee table just on 4.1 still on the first page of the report exposed soil that mcvickers forest now it 's my understanding from speaking to people in the community and it 's not just one fallen trees that are being cleared from that now you know yeah it 's quite there 's quite a lot of timber being you know 30 year old pine trees been cleared from the area and there is quite a problem in the area with erosion and going into kashmir stream and into the earth get river and so anything that could be communicated to he can about monitoring doing it but we just we want to protect the quality or that he 's get from being eroded even further have you got staff working what you 're on that i have not received any information but you know there is a resolution of the board so yeah but i just think that you know staff have the relationships with Environment Canterbury and it might be worthwhile who which which elt leadership in which one enforcement and columbus so yeah so peps if that could be drawn to her attention will do they thank you thank you in just on the proper page 85.1 the waste transfer station and send them this is as i 'm sure you 're aware quite a serious issue for the cinema business community in it it is really undermines the integrity of the massive and you know the consents have been granted and and we would but we would hope that the businesses that have been granted the consent would reconsider and one of the reasons that this has gone this particular waste transfer station has been able to go there is because require an authority on this and without the ago he never could have happened the community board was told in 2012 there anything like this can I begin because we did have Scully 's demolition yard Ian anything like this account again that we were they would let us know but it 's it came in under the radar and just as as the consent for the crematorium winning and November this win and December just before Christmas so 2 E can and I just like to ask that from at least from council perspective that anything like this that the community boards are flagged early on the process when consents are lodged so that we have a time to actually have an informed decision informant position but it went to eat candy said we can at which then it went to counsel to so there 's parking and signage can see it for council when in this environmental and that noise and evolution dust but I presume that the council this community would have had an interest in beige in what sir and the EK in one yes um when they come yeah but I wonder if we should formally raise it with commissioners when they come we have a regular session with the commissioners from a Kenya yeah be very good sense from what Paul living on from what pulsing but just the guards to limit of notifications and what we can and can 't do but i do think to give community that of what 's happening in the area especially when we have a sensitive eerie light sudden but just his a master plan which we put together with their community totally undermines integrity of this organization to a degree of those that have worked on those Master Cleanse yeah yeah I agree that 's been bloody faster yanny I think it 's two issues here one is um we need to meet with kiwiRail until through actually what their community responsibilities are because you know they 've probably got servants of a team that corporate codes of social responsibility and actually this is like a pattern that 's developed in our city over the last decade where unsavory activities go and kiwirail land and create actually meet with kiwiRail and talk through where they are and and where we are in terms of allowing these sorts of religious activities the second point is that we do have notification things that we can do special circumstances and we need to make more use of those as a council despite the changes to the RMA I think we need to subbing a lot of appropriate because this is the second time now we 've had things that have been raised with the community boards or counselors around notification expectation with coring that these things still go through nah know if I 'd and the opportunity with the keikain commissioners is impact up through our submission on the pollution their quality review is that we need joint consenting over land use and ear judge and at the moment there 's two two separate processes to hearings to two things and it doesn 't actually connect the dots so we get pervious outcomes and if I may meta me pick up on the first point that council johansen was made I would I put in terms for Sid them a large chunk of spray and Heathcott it would be good if there 's a requiring authority that kiwirail talked to the community board before granting can see Pat for things other than and transport use it would be good if there was a process by which we were kept in the loop yep Tim we 're given by kiwirail after the Scully 's debacle and it wasn 't 12 unacceptable what happened there that QE rail would actually be take with us and they hit idea with regards to special purpose rail land as that you protect it for a rail use it cetera if you look at the east side of the railway lines that from Colombo street the rail corridors very very narrow but it works fine and there are there are buildings built up to the railway line there 's even a sound studio further down so that obviously works and it 's fine with this piece of land not only here 's the railways I 'm soldered eh we 'll go blend but they 've also I think they 'd allowed a 25 or 30 which does not have those buildings all those businesses so do not have been with the railway line so there 's no connectivity dear there 's no they 're not in any way shape or form involved in rail so that land should or could actually be redesignated and would not affect the rail corridor at all because it ocean was the railways at all but it has huge effects on that bit talking about revitalization of communities millions and millions of dollars being put and invested into colombo street and we have these things happen it 's just ridiculous i like the idea of meeting with them i just read this statement of intent while you would in 17 part from no dividend whatsoever forever in fact ongoing investment commitments and there is it there is no mention whatsoever of possibility to any community at all so yeah so I mean that 's for a government-owned entity Jen the fact that they actually work in the New Zealand community and affect their communities around them is pretty awful actually well I think that I should write to the chair don 't know who the cherokee we 're a little young yeah no no but who 's the who 's the chair of keelaurow it 's aboard anyway I 'll find out who the chair or so if so can someone make a note for me that old all right so that feeling Spencer that the met so what we 're going to have a that the if you go down to that the report be received and if you put that the mayor that the report be received and that the mayor famous John Spencer and that the mirror that right to the chair of kiwiRail with respect to concerns arising from the what is that the utilization of railway land yeah but I don 't it 's not histories it 's it 's generally and I 'm the impact on the king and the earth you know and the impact on local communities or we okay we 're there as impact on local communities because I mean the utilization of the land is irrelevant where it 's like in the middle of nowhere but where there is impact mere yet and then take out the back how 's that that the report be received in the mirror right to the cherokee we 're l which is kept it or one word hey why don 't we see what the result of their litterers then we yeah from there it 's not going meeting for the sake of meeting yeah hey yeah okay so who would like to move there tum sicken DePaul is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you thank you very far now look at some Tim 58 so I think we should stop and have a cup of tea I 'm just a weird oh you know this there there is a part a on the shitty papanui so and we 've still got beer would Pegasus but there are such a thing there I just wonder because because bill would pick us as he hit I mean Oh Mike do you want to do surely Papa know before we break for a cup of tea yeah come to break for morning tea because there 's no one here from the next to community boards so we can refer those _"

    "text": "some extra money for us to spend even though we 've just signed off on an LTP that says that we 're going to review all of our capital expenditure just saying Kerry all funny you might you say that this annex road yes I know Rajee Reuters but the parking are some so yeah so the daniks rope has been delayed so and we only just slowly just got an email about that this morning so if you turn to the board 's recommendation Mike and I have just had a brief discussion and we 'd like you to delay the implementation of nine point one point three on page 49 and nine point one point five because we don 't want to put in extra parking before it 's actually needed otherwise it will be used and then you 'll be wanting more parking because well I thinking I think we should let these matters lie on the table I 'm you know I we 've agreed that we 're going to do a complete review of our capital program and to put anything on me or even on the budget at the stage would be an appropriate I 'm quite happy for it to be considered but but what year is the as it required to be considered now so will sometimes some of these are within the Wigram Magdala length area which is being constructed and those nonfat 1.3 or not but 1.5 are within the NX road during of Drive area which has been delayed for 12 months we just found out about today okay so which so you want to proceed what some of these now yep Jane can we just note that the board recommendations are contrary to the staff recommendations and the staff advice remains what it was backing up that the recommendations we put forward so I think we need to get Paul Burton who the active streets and transport manager to speak to the the board recommendations because they don 't align with council policy necessary can you I 've read the paper i mean i understand it doesn 't align with council policy but what I 'm trying to get now is is that as it as are any be made made now or can they wait till the annual plan I thought the those outside of the NX me and rice o within the big room made to the link should be made so show me exactly which which ones you want to have considered today well all of them excluding nine point one point three and nine point one point five so from page 49 that 's all the recommendations set for two on that page and the final recommendation on the following page so you want but what about the oil-soaked see so it 's in its including the rectum door mean much so so you 're not so there 's not proceeding not proceeding I 'm so you want to approve the installation of approximately 40 on street car parking spaces at the major the place end amygdala place and 26 at the western end approve the installation of temp rechargeable car parking spaces on land apostle to the least cost neutral and the vicinity of Magdala plat well it doesn 't say that it says that if it 's utilized it will be it sites are identified for the planting of trees and the planting of replacement trees include both to compensate for trees loss during the development of the would grow Magdala link project request that environment canterbury investigate the wider issue of citywide bus routes etc etc ya know alot I 'm I 'm I 'm really unhappy about a report of this nature coming by way of a joint recommendation when it involves the expenditure of significant money without a detailed staff analysis and a proposal for a serious detail stuff ineligible es I read the staff analysis and they are recommending that we don 't proceed with us because we don 't have a policy on off street parking outside the CBD and this particular area has taken you know the overflow outside of the CBD and so it means it won 't last forever that is correct and businesses are supposed to provide off street parking account of it is parking yeah for office for the earth consents with staff and with ground customers where those concerns were granted for the construction of those buildings and it was a 'd be one of the first people to say that no that 's don 't provide any parking but the design of the project is absolutely fantastic and it 's the sort of thing that we want to see but the situation is not something that could have been envisaged when the original consents were granted but it would have been envisaged when we consider the long-term plane don 't imagine that you talked about this particular project and in detail we did actually because we took it off the budget and then put it back on but we didn 't have a consideration of the parking applications at all but this has over I thought the victim would renege to the link was from the previous annual plan the money yeah yeah so was it any bet that 's why we are not we 're asking that the river Meg to the link parking be granted but not be any experience well oh yeah okay well we 've got a recommendation in front of us were all clear what that what it is so Yanni wanted to check with about thirty six thousand dollars a year Eddington sorry car park that we 've done very 20 about 25,000 Lawson addington for the officer at car parking that we 've provided oh sorry I failed city I don 't know that yannis directing his Christian to staff so look maybe which gave us staff comment first row but could you comment on off street parking and the eddington area as part of your clients as well losing money and what the risks are associated with this okay if we provide it yeah Paul I think you Madame it full burden acting get a manager transported city streets I 'm just conscious that the staffs rationale for not supporting the gourds recommendations is outlined on on page 46 four point three point one three to four point three point five just really wanted to emphasize two points one really around the precedent that this possibly create particularly with the looming make cycleway program which we 're rolling out exactly the same sort of such situations where and we made position where there 's an expectation that we will supplement the loss spaces and probably one which could really come come back to bite us as the behavioral issues associated with these these car parks particularly in industrial areas where there 's no activity past sort of 5 530 at night I 'm really concerned that and no lighting that these will become congregating areas for antisocial behavior but just just answering the question that you 're answering the asking counselor around around suburban off street car parks run by council addington is an example of a situation where a car parking regime was introducing the eddington commercial area because of this very issue of migration of activity into the into a suburban sorry I 'm at a loss we 're at where is the public car parking and Eddington court theatre with a court theatre by their own voice why street no woods it 's older off the Bolshoi yeah okay yeah no no that got a motor oil in that car park was established yeah to supplement the loss of on street car parking in the addington area there 's a consequence of the installation of on-street parking restrictions yes didn 't eventuate know very poorly utilized it 's the comment here that where people are expected to pay for car parking off street and suburban areas it doesn 't always pan out the way you anticipate it too so are we losing money on that correct how much 25 thousand a year well the loot is not quite that bad because the lease lease expires shortly and we have managed to sublease some of the area for car imports for their storing the car imports have come and so so it 's not all lost so we 've managed to recover some of that cost we people paid putting the president because we 've already set the president actually failed but it 's cost a lot of money and it means that it 's obviously underutilized so it 's not that 's that we have is not a silly terms of other solution which is obviously amending the road design to incorporate more on street parking how much work have you done around that I wanted you as you see in the plans quite a lot of work has accommodate room on street parking in fact that that 's that 's what nine point one point one is about and that 's something that we can support because it 's it 's on street it 's there 's no expectation that arif and it 's really just an attempt to replace some of the car parks this let 's be lost due to the design of the project so and what 's the cost for those Magdala is it useful to look at the attachments and that if you just go this 5.1 has got the costumes so Magdala on street as 27,000 capex and is that right is that it 's 27,000 be on page 47 page 47 dealer west on street 27 thousand dollars for 26 car park brick and 138 or pigs that is my 88 is 300,000 hey the east one is 300,000 just cut at the staff recommendation is that I thought they were just recommending the on strange correct but the staff report though with respect to say that they can virtually guarantee the occupancy of that area of land is going to deceivers I don 't seek to do that when lit Wilson stood to carry the RUS wild who should we carry the risk of putting on our car parking it 's three dollars what is it three dollars 10 per hour I mean what they were talking about he was Lee people would pay on a daily basis to park their cars in those areas and to be time restricted parking and other sections I 'm just trying to understand in very simple terms the board recommendation on put 11 what that costs to counsel us as if I knew the 27,000 which is the 26 but then there 's another 40 which I don 't see how they 're going to be fun no that 's going on is there are two different recommendations 6.1 which is the staff recommendation as 26 on street car parts full stop that 's what the staff have recommended so I 'm happy to to move the staff recommendation but I 'm not happy with the with the balance now tell me you hit a question sorry it 's kind of unfair to 've hit huge problems and issues with parking and Eddington and we spend it a lot of time on that and obviously count some money staff time etc and person I don 't think it 's actually come to the right solution but that 's really affected that community very badly so but if you look at this area specifically we don 't have the side streets and the off streets that we do anything tins the would it be fair to say that endless theory Birmingham drive at the moment that the parking solutions individuals and companies putting at taking up it would be interesting at least like that Park on here sup nike and all sorts of places I mean there is a problem there and this is going to add to it and we 're trying to look at a solution it 's all very well saying a lot you know through the bills consent they 're allowed to do this and they may shift in the town but some may not there is an issue here we 're just trying to sort it out we went boards after hearing the delegations or the deputations and and seeing the size of the of the problem and asking staff to go away and come back with some options which they did and those options were fully costed and presented to our community back buying community boards and I was just going to prior to finding out about the email that said mr. circulating around now I was going to really compliment I 'm staff and and the process of the two boards coming together on this and getting an acceptable solution to the problem and now it seems that at the last minute there 's a there 's a big heck happen and I 'm really concerned that we would lose what we were hoping to achieve by listening and consulting with the community and the businesses in the area and coming to an acceptable not perfect acceptable solution and in finding that that can 't happen it makes us look like government what part of completely review our capital program didn 't you understand completely review our capital program we 're asking people to make serious priority spend and not spend because we have got financial challenges and to put more money on our capital program budget that wasn 't even raised in the context of our LTP butch for goodness sake was only past you know a week or so ago you know that 's the challenge that we 've got so i 'm not i 'm not saying that you should walk away with nothing i 'm thinking that the staff recommendation as as something that i could certainly support today that 's not saying that we couldn 't in the context of the review of the capital program look at further recommendations paul and then pauline I 've got a really a solution here that last year maybe address a number of issues including preps putting more parking as you know I 'm a big a public advocate for parking but the central city has been rating its Parker 's forever and pre youthquake we used to bring in about three and a half million dollars a year and profits and a city parking is it the time since we now have a decentralized city should we be putting parking meters in on street parking areas around these commercial hubs and other parts of the city things we will get revenue out of that which will help associa build more car parts for these people if they do so wish but it 's a way of actually maybe controlling all day Parker 's that take up parking spaces we you know commercial businesses need to have that traffic flow and that change of parking regime so my question is should we be reviewing where we rate people for parking throughout other parts of the city and commercial areas Pauline I just mumbles for clarification I thought that Paul I thought you said that staff supported nine point one point one on page 49 of the good he did well the staff recommendation is to support the 26 on street car parks but I was saying as a supportive on street car parks to address parking shortfall per se supported but the recommendation is for 26 not the 40 I think you well if we 're going to have a some kind of compromise that 've asked to have passed passed but if we 're not can we at least have all of nine point one point one so there is some it 's 4466 yes but it 's 297 thousand nine hundred and ninety dollars kept eggs for the east option which is not the staff option that 's an addition to the staff option of 27,000 115 so you know i 'm i 'm just not of a mind to spend that sort of money without having considered it in terms of the capital program but you know I 'm one-person one-vote around the table and maybe that other councilors want to completely walk away from our decision to review the capital program so well maybe we turn more of them birmingham reserving to run car parking which is going to create more issues that depth but i know i know but that 's the sort of situation that we 're going to end up and it remains entirely on you know the pleadings on the on the particular capital program you know sort of projects doesn 't help the what we have from start to finish that means that you join the queue with everyone else and you look at the project compared to all other objects and and we we are going to do a very in-depth analysis of this we have undertaken to do so there is a lot on the line and we need to get it right so asking more to be added to a capital program when this was known prior to our sibling our our long-term plan I mean this was considered at a joint meeting in June at the beginning of June the eighth of June you know so it could have been a matter that was brought to our attention before we settled the long-term plan it wasn 't brought to our attention and that time frame it 's been brought straight to council now without going through the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee and you 're perfectly entitled to do that but I think that it 's important what I 'm saying is is that personally I 'm prepared to support the staff recommendation I 'm not support to prepare to support the that review of our program but I am happy for it to be included and the consideration of the capital program going forward so I I do support you and principal you know around the review in the capital program and I understand it it 's important but you know just speaking for my community everyone 's going to say but speaking from your community yeah and I know I know but it is my job it 's a community board chairperson to speak from my community and just to say that it is about managing the downstream effects of dislocated bit of businesses yep no I understand that I understand completely but there are also people whose roads are so damaged that their cars get damaged every single day that they drive on them you know that we 've actually got to think of the whole city and this is a temporary effect because there will be a shift back over a period of time so we have to think very carefully about decisions that we make but anyway you 're on the capital implication of this because I meeting along with turn so the 26,000 am assuming can be accommodated within the 27,000 can be accommodated within the cap cost of this project for Drew about the three hundred two hundred ninety seven thousand i 'm assuming as a bit of a stretch ditional capital the total capital can be accommodated within the within the project all of this capital is three hundred and forty-six thousand dated it in the car budget so no impact on the long-term plan that 's correct other than there would be a savings if it wasn 't career and I think we 've got answer that we 've got to stop thinking about things that we 've committed to as as being is not being opportunities to return money for allocation on a priority basis so you know just because it can be accommodated with a nicely trying to understand it yet though if we go with just the West Magdala place with on Street the potential to return 300,000 of capital very little objects and bear to their for reprioritization somewhere else right thank you sir I just 120 m okay nine point one point one has been suggested as a possible compromised situation would provide 66 additional car parks on street what what would be the cost of that so just to do nine point one point one on its own and maybe it 's here somewhere but I 'm having difficulty seeing it so though 297 plus 27 115 they 're just take off the Allied Telesis one okay thank you so look I 'm happy to test the water I would like to move the staff recommendation with the balance of the rig the balance of the community board recommendation to be referred to the capital program review seconded by Paul lonsdale is there any discussion yani think they 're really interesting about this debate is actually the big project that we 're spending all this money on an industrial area around slowing down the road removing car park it does call into question why huge capital expenditure for this area and what the benefits are that we get and I 'm not saying I disagree with the attempt to kind of slow down the traffic and improve area and how it 's being used been more money providing car parking seems a little bit contrary but you know I think this does need to go through another round of consultation if we really want to get a solution for this area to work well then if we 're spending you know I think the board proposing 1.5 million dollars of expenditure then that really does need to go through some sort of consultation process the way up where all our priorities are again we 've got areas that are broken in the city that we 're not going to fix for 30 years this is providing a higher level of immunity in some areas we 've had growth and in transition so you know I appreciate the work that the board have done on this but I do support this having further work done around it as part of another process yep pull as you know it 's my sustainability that I am you know the fan of making sure that our workers and our people who visit these centers or areas are able to park my 's it 's we start pointed out with a cycleway program and the removal of a lot of parking it 's going to set a prisoner for a lot of other areas and we will come under pressure the other part that I 'm you know I 'm sort of confused about is that so you know we have been slept around through the long term process about or sell down of some of our assets and and we have committed to our public that we will work as hard as we can to reduce soul down where we can so the capital review is actually exceptionally important that we actually looked how we can actually reduce our capital expenditure and adding stuff now and all stuff through the long term process we were trying to remove and we ended up putting the world and they had to remove so I 'm just really hesitant of actually allowing anything to add to our capital program until we 've actually had that full review I 'm Glenn and then Tom thank you i would support your approach i think with the that epimers the two processes can 't_''_1634.2 be divorced from each other and clearly there are parts of the city that basics attended to mmm Tim right to the earthquake this is a busy industrial area in with industry comes workers and so they 've got to go some impact somewhere here here if you go into that area now you 'll be lucky to park by eddington raceway or if you go the other way to be you 'd be lucky to find a party outside Helton jets and factory quite a way away now we 've all following the earthquake we 've also allowed companies to go and subdue the 30 plan and have very few parts supplied for the visitors but also their workers so it 's getting worse and worse so we 've actually got to do something and I don 't believe that the 26 car parts will even touched it but we 've got a shortage anyway that 's what we 've created some solution and there is another issue of course with you excuse me we 're debating the matter so yep I as well which is requested Environment Canterbury investigate the wider issue of citywide bus routes feeding into this business industrial area because I think that that is genuinely picks up one of the issues which is some of the bus routes haven 't quite matched the movement of of staff yeah funny there anyway leaving all that aside i will add that nine point two point one to the to the loss all right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried oh sorry and recording no Thomas Kendra and Jimmy chin thank you now there 's the balance of the report so that we need zip down I just think that the it 's that the report be received so it 's not that as a report as a whole bit doctored oh I suppose is it now that we 've amended up yeah okay as amended that the report has amended be adopted okay so moved by somebody david glenn i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's all of the hard work on that _"

    "text": "very much pork thanks Sarah hagley theory made community board hope no part a is obviously an interesting meeting good morning Oh meetings got two meetings to meetings in here don 't you just want to traverse them both yeah yeah yeah there are no parties between those two part meeting to this two meetings but you 've made some some Richmond mums and bubs very hippy your long term clean decision the the the funding for fixing or rebuilding the avery park for fantastics and thank you very much for that they are very happy we have the next page we have held a meeting now and bromley to gauge the extent of the odor issues in the area with the wider community it was a really constructive meeting and we 're currently going through the information that we gain from that at the time and we 'll have some more information from the community board to counsel on it some sage really soon and they catch the community as well ongoing issues that 's probably a low key things there anything on the other meeting house the Phillips been a lot of people to jamel to work and and the open day was fantastic there are a lot of amazing community groups working out of the air collaboratively really hope it can last a lot longer than the the one year official lease that they 've got a wonder the the initial lease is for a year from the ministry for using the site and then it 's month by month after the edge but it 's making a really big difference in the area especially with the loss of the school there now got some we had some site where people can still connect and from ice so and so a range of things and so you put this heat there 's the creative arts create about the Oscar program the Mount Pleasant pottery group earlier the Phillips down community center still there there 's youth development program why dude range yeah and they 've got students from cpit have been helping them with some branding stuff which looks fantastic and yeah the community garden yeah well hang on we 'll just got you want to finish is that 's right tannery jetty proposal it was am I really interesting when we r is still a lot of work to be done there the it will look it will be an amazing enhancement to the area of the river Sushi 's relocate and you know with the other groups that are looking at linking up along the river to it to enhance it in but this still work to be done on how that would happen in the funding of it so yeah it 's um the border is supportive of the project but it is in the Reverend so needs various concerns end in this statute of funding that needs sorting out so the the council resolved some time ago to have that section of the river sort of along come not here are some things to get a plane done for their area landscape and and other things and you work started on the ear you know I just saw from wonder why we aren 't utilizing one of the best landscape architectural schools in the country or probably in australasia Lincoln University it is this Kabir this can be a part of this study you know actually do this I mean I just I just think that we need to capture the resources that are in our community now yeah the design for the actual GT and bridge and things r SQ designs and but that Hollywood you know we need to get that hole stretched up through the industrial area so we really good to get that stuff might just have a talk to some of my contacts out there Yanni and vent because we do have a resolution that council will prepare an overall landscape plan for this area and was we doing funding on budget is part of money on budget that will help us we 've got heart enhancements or we 've quite repairs happening further up a run with the Wolfson cutters ankeny rubber and we 've also got the million bill I think would be really great to use it and I think now everything to seek to go so I just want to give away update because I did meet with staff and work through what we bucks also in one of the plaques I think with some schoolkids from Thorrington school so there 's a great history of involving young people it 's a very bad place there this can your debt it 's what it means for that so i 'm just-just i just wanted to draw just to make the comment on philipstown one of the it 's not a team but one of the things objectives is that that hub is really wanting groups that actually are involved and engaged in the philipstown community what are the risks identified was that you could have a lot of groups coming and actually no but just using that space so what you see is a really fantastic I think partnership with a whole bunch of collaborative engagements and doing things to help and work with local people when it 's fantastic one point I just wanted to draw your attention to which is of concern is and I don 't know whether Sarah wishes to comment the community board was looking at funding so it 's discretionary response fund the management of waste from one old silent community center and the council staff and operationally spent more money then it would have cost for the board to probe 22 discretionary response fund that so it all stems from the fact that they wanted to use placements from the red zone that we no longer being used will events for the community to clean up that area on the basis and they were told that they couldn 't do that and the bins with seized and we 're now having as a board to pay for what should be a particularly a council operational budget through our description response fund and with our boss the goodwill in the community and that has been a pretty sad story really of how not to do things and the costs that we spend trying to get resolution and investigating and actually out far outweigh the cost of it you 're just in aden those buns to be continued over the sarah was just a comment on that and it was a point that was raised at the board ahead head um they had had some buns from the red the community and they 'd used those on the village green site which are the site of the new community center and library that will be built shortly and the rubbish from the marker the the local rubbish had been going in those council had been picking them up and because they 're being done to the side of the road and but all of a sudden was discovered that they weren 't supposed to be there but because then the land is not rated currently council cannot there 's something in the in the paper works is the council can pick up rubbish from it because it 's not even though it 's a council site it 's not rated before they come pick up rubbish so it 's actually more expensive for the council now that because it 's coming out of council funds to see our discretionary response to pay a private contractor to come and pick up waste from their site which is a council-owned site it just just a lot of towing and throwing in not a lot of good community communication at the time sounds like off one that could be looked at I mean we did have a request here for full council desert to fund it out of operational costs and actually just get the buns there and picked up because it 's cheaper than being the discretionary he responds money yeah okay okay follow up on the heath get that the tannery proposal has been just his element in that area and it creates an incredible sort of catalyst for the cleanup of the heath get as well yeah and I just don 't want the amazing work that a stir and Zekk k songs have done to lee be lost so given that we now have that money in the long term plan I 'm wondering if we could just and I don 't mind if we use Lincoln or any money I think it 's a fantastic just wondering if we could actually get some stuff on to that now our Jane I just wait until you were doing something else to ask so this is the tannery and all of the things that because there 's a duty things that he 's got and then there 's the cleanup that a lot of the community groups they are doing and we have now got some money on the long-term plan to do it could we just sort of bring this board so that it doesn 't so that actually starts it 's underway as it is it on budget for this year oh and just how we can actually help with that tennery their whole historic precinct development that they want to do because it 's just yeah but I also one I kind of want what I mean the idea that staff will go on and do a landscape plan no no I just think that we want to get community engagement yeah yeah yeah okay yeah item three prior to the earthquake there was the mid Heath get asked to play in which got which took probably about 10 years to get together and there 's huge community and put into that and title by and so hips that could be used as the template to save time and to kind of sick and navigate a lower head get to have a master plan not just one area of it and to link into the MIDI it because it is one river flowing through the whole lot the other thing is maybe approach your community now because if you 're looking for firms with regards or they 're going to be looking for fans for am so the the tenor egt yeah we 've seen a beings financial aware that the communities are getting either to try and get the best bang for back if you 're like three guards to the same thing you is with a dollar to you know to a day put in and try and get more bit about putting money into an ownership of that GT if you see if you and John I 'm saying but whether the planning 's from Lincoln or whatever is late yeah well I do have to say that you know that it 's not just a lower the upper or the murder he 'd get us one river and we 've got a master plan for the middle but it 'd be great bits as well and to do one because it has been put on hold there have been changes in the the lighter tests etc through whole environment those communities have not forgotten that we hit her yeah and so it 's a major major project but you know I mean one of the one of the values I guess of our city is this you know pristine water you know we can turn on a tap and drink the best water in the world and it 's an extraordinary place to be and it sees something extraordinary about us but not heaven clean rivers doesn 't go with our you know it doesn 't fit with us so but we 're going to need more than an approach at the river to solve the problem so where people wash their cars you know not on the side of the road going into our our drains but actually on the boom so that they go unto the ground you know that that 's the sort of that 's the sort of change and culture and behavior that we 're going to have to stop wasting water you know we 've got we 've got so much that we need to do as a city and actually we could we could make this a real campaign amongst our city to to be to be what we what we say we are you know like and I 'll go back to the fact that you know if you 've traveled overseas you know the value of turning on that tap and getting the best water in the world there 's just nothing that compares with our water pool I think you 're making the two confused and Harry project is a particular project that they really want they actually do look after the area in water and I think that if we allow you know this pressure to go ahead and what it before it takes I think you might find that it wrapped laid out along the river and allow actually take care of their section and I think you 're quite right there are other issues that we face as a city that we need to deal with you agree with tannery has approached it much like I suppose recited on some respects there is risk of you know and the future them not surviving the way we 'd like into and I think by allowing them to add to what they 're doing now will actually help keep them you know together and moving forward and I in a way that is commercially successful but also successful for the for the community itself yep all right um andrey referring to paragraph eleven in the second report 17th of june one proposed management and parking changes ferry road and waterman place I note the Board considered this report retrospectively so the work has already started now I 'm very aware of the the parking issues in that area yeah and I know that there was correspondence and deputations from business owners and I mean community members that use those businesses would have an interest in this as well given that the work is already underway and has been for some time it 's complete um alright so the work is you know lately it 's been complete the month so any 'm just interested in how this report came to the board after the work was already underway or possibly complete and how you know you 're proposing to make some changes to the parking plan by leaving the report lying on the table but the works already done how did that come to be and how is it going to work from here on because me having repeated me something that 's in so we 've hit okay that 's exactly so having people coming to make deputations about something that 's already happening I mean it 's not an ideal situation i was just in transportation which read at it before the work that the lines went on the road and that the consultation wasn 't complete by the time that scoot had finished their work council staff had worked through more suit i thinkin drawn up some plans of the white lines and the parking and the cycle lanes council staff looked at that they made some significant changes to make it better and those were the ones that were put on the table we were told at hadn 't seen the changes that were going to be made at that point what 's happened since then as that we asked her to see if we could have more parking we 're told at the time that the packs that were currently they were not fully used most of the businesses in that area we 're not retail so those that are wholesale type type businesses although there is one being rebuilt there at the moment what came back to the board was information as you they 're making I mr. purchased and fiction did I makes you work him with the most effective property owner which is a property owner the furthest away from where the parking finishes there is an opportunity to he 's got some on more on-site street parking so I 'm working with staff to actually sort of progress that so I just made so effective because quite right it 's a it 's a toss-up between safety being a main trunk line to achieve parking and obviously because it 's an intersection and because of the development on the on the eastern of that I 've web in place so it is safety but the other part is we 're going to be very promising on of the business on the other side and that particular property owner is struggling to get tense for the building because they identify the parking on the street now being removed as a real barrier so we just need to work through but it really was not much of a choice safety and ensuring the traffic keeps moving it was really the app that need to be progressed yeah Yanni so this goes back to and the board 's formally made this request that scope design should go to community boards for approvals so if board had delegated authority to look at the proposals through the scope prices it saves a lot of energy and time and given the lightweight agendas that the boards are getting there 's ample capacity for them to actually do that work in a time-efficient manner so you know I think there 's two lessons from this one is that there 's no delegation to boards to make any have any workshop yeah and also the master plan sister children with master plans through areas and outline development because very mad had an outline development plan but a bit like noble things get changed or amended really bad traffic now yeah well we will make a note of that to go to the delegations workshop because it 's another one we 're picking up examples of things that ought to be dealt with by community board so I agree all right so Paul you 'd like to move that yarny I 'd like to see conduct I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "that 's good yes very much okay thank you very much Pam thank you great so now we move on to the little son mount Herbert community board meeting okay his lead to the conference Oh Elvis is lit room oh the building yeah yeah yeah excellent isn 't it beautiful you can sing you a report Paul welcome you 'll see an hour report a number of references to the Littleton port recovery plan the hearing for that was held at the naval point club there were Penna lov3 cheered by zagreb pinkest and the hearing at the hearing i was very proud of the number and the quality of the submissions that came from our community at many of which supported our position that the that the plan did not really address some of the social and cultural needs of our community so we are standing by now for the report from that process and I think we 've got a port recovery in party meetings she drooled for next week to review that 's those come out this week sometime great so that was all I wanted couple of things one congratulations to the board on the engaging communities best practice award for album square and and please pass on our congratulations to Angela on her long service award for long-standing contribution i would add outstanding contribution to the community through your role and the I just thought I 'd mentioned the governor 's Bay gt2 just the way that the community came together unsubmitted on the annual plan the long-term plan was inspiring was just gray a capable group a great deal of capacity here again so I 'm just really hoping that we can see that to fruition as I as a collaborative venture rather than a council initiative mmm Andrew yeah I am went to the governor 's Bay jetty group last meeting and they 're currently being really proactive working on an MoU that they want to present Council as a way forward so they 're actually driving this really strongly so good yeah excellent I just had one question for polar and it relates to what Pam was saying about the cemeteries is there a similar situation to what cam described or the other part of the peninsula to what we 've got in in a Corot with cemeteries yes I think there is and the mirror loaded to the to Littleton cemeteries which are more or less full I 've made and and that there 's an it was a new cemetery built in diamond harbour that was supposed to take a lot of interments going into the future but it 's been found that there are drainage issues and I think was a project and the long-term plan somewhere to address that but I 've support pans cool cool for pets a bit of a review of the cemeteries master plan because I remember we submitted at the time that Pam 's quite right at people do want to be buried or the ashes kept in the community a lived end belonged and I 'm not sure that the cemeteries master plan enables that for all communities and I would say that would be an aspiration for any of these looking to develop a city which has got a whole lot of coherent communities in it pets the opportunity to find the character of those communities might might be something you could look at again hmm it might be good if the work that Jane was suggesting be done with with Parmelee a corollary were bored were also able to extend to Paula and Littleton man herbert board as well given the situation that Paul is just described yeah I think that 's good yep yeah thank you all right let 's lobby Thank You Jane Pauline um listen 0 is it still current the plan for an echo asymmetry over here somewhere um staff are working with there 's a small group in diamond harbour are quite keen on green burials and they are working with them but that there hasn 't as far as I 'm aware there hasn 't been a solution found for I mean there 's a few one-off opportunities in the diamond harbour symmetry but I 'm not sure that a solution that will be sustainable the future has been sorted out Oh does that work still in progress yes we need to kind of beefed it up a bit or so anyway we if Jane pavot seen someone to come and talk to us we can talk about that at the time but i don 't i don 't know that there is land available at the moment that has been identified for this at the moment okay jaani i would be kind of reluctant to a full review of the cemeteries plan but i think an update on their actions because there are a number of detail actions and and it would be really good to get a report on where we 've got to I think we have cut some of the budget suitable an impact but it would be good at least be able to explain what those decisions will mean the I guess the more pressing thing and I don 't know whether board has had any visibility as district plan glad did as a tool to designate land and to change the current zoning a lot of ones on the peninsula and and we 're residential so there is a rezoning going on at the moment and I don 't know whether there 's a process by which that that identified or at least yeah using that mechanism to actually start getting some of the slain pull aside that 's probably the more agents though the actual mechanism to diet so here of what 's happening through the district plan regarding I mean yeah is the board making submissions around where those designations would go or the boarding events offered we have is all about looking for an additional site for littleton but that 's something we probably should be thinking about can I suggest when going reports back that that is a pretty quick but the problem is that there have been all kinds of Investigations looking for alternative sites that haven 't come up with anything in a part of my problem is I 'm I 'm not able to I 'm an account I 'm not fully briefed about what what work is being done in the past and whether there have been any sites that have been identified okay thanks thank you Andrew you 'd like to move this and seconded by Glenn i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's Carrie _"

amazing and what 's the snow like I wish you could show us outside I will know I want to take you outside I still have enough to start my front door and there is a snow shower that 's gone through we 've had a lot of rain with it and of course the snows melted but purvis advice for anybody at this time of the year a stay at home exelon no mates council seed money to open our roads and let 's just stay home and you skype gosh you should be the NZTA safety announcement person but there you go look perhaps we could move to your community board report we 've got the report of these 16 amazed yes morning that was the issue of cemeteries it 's on page 9 no page 5 and we did bring it up an hour long term plan but by a community a number of members in our community including our clergy and that we 've got no space other than prepaid plots and second two achievements left a necron and that 's in all of the cemeteries that have been identified in the cemeteries master plan we did some time ago asked for a review of the cemetery masters plan adopted in 2013 and a reply that we had it was not I 'm not due for review but we would like the council 's look seriously at what we could do for a parole we 're quite happy to get together as a community and find a solution that would be appropriate to allow our members of our community to continue to rest where they want to and that Zechariah they don 't want to go to devotionals they don 't go to Ron at one nuit you want to rest where you where you you want to be hmm is there a I 'm a no I can 't remember the exact details of this because wasn 't there some discussion about some land that was sure about that I have investigated properly but we 're just asking could we could we pursue the matter further and I think we were aware that the may not have been any more land that was appropriate for a cemetery but there may be ways that we could perhaps not at a wall that 's put in somewhere tidy up the cemetery removes some of the old vegetation that is a bit scruffy and just look at it the best way of providing the an area for further burials okay I 'll invite Jane per foot to say something push your button I 'm happy to get a staff member to talk directly to Pam and just take this forward did you hear that Pam yes Jane said that she was going to get the ball roll nothing hahaha she said that she would get a staff member to make contact with you to discuss this further so but at least that gives us a basis for proceeding and and that that enables us to more enables you to to explore what what the possibilities are yep glencoe thank is this because most in tumors today HD are in fact cremations they far outweigh burial so I 'm not sure how critical this is but I you know I understand it is fuel it continues to be critical for a crime we have no not that I 'm aware of any special area for for ashes and that certainly people are still requesting burials please Ben but if they were if there was if there was a wall for ashes that would provide some significant increase of capacity yes that what indeed and maybe we need to as a community look at ways that we might be able to do that okay that 's good all right is there anything else in your report that you 'd like to highlight it 's always interesting things better than the essence of this new technology well even I just thank the City Council for taking an interest in us over the last few days our roading contractors have been absolutely superb and keeping in contact with us as to what was happening and here we are two to two parts of you weren 't based and sunshine and heat Lee where we were having snow showers continuing to come through so we do appreciate the support that we 're given as a community while we 're in these situations but if we just stayed at home and waited for things to Thor would be not less cost on all of us including the council on having to keep the roads open thank you very much and obviously i was going to note too that I went to the launch of Iona Farrell 's book the other day at the university bookshop the villa at the edge of the Empire I think it 's called but stunning book but she I ran into a number of people who are very happy about the decision on the activity management plan around the akaroa museum really happy people so ya know it was really good feedback excellent um Yanni I just I just was looking up the cemetery 's master plan and it did say that there 'd be a joint conservation plan for all three of their Corral cemeteries and also that there 's here vegetated so I just want to check is that what are you aware of any of that work happening or that extra capacity I know none of that is that has happened and I think the further down in our notes there we may have seen something that we aren 't be involved in prioritizing activities included in the master plan the conservation plan is about more about heritage and looking after those symmetries in that sort of vein rather than what you know having plots and areas available right but in terms of the Anglican cemetery it 's got extra capacity if needed and is there an issue with that well we need to we need to look at that and explore that idea okay that may be what i was thinking off because i know that during the LTP process there was an issue raised about the potential for additional land utilizing existing space so but but I didn 't realize it was the younger can shoot church 's land but but there may be some sort of arrangement that we could come to where and cemetery so mm-hmm there may be a church lane but there 's also the dissenters and the Catholic what they 're all next to each other I just love those separate cemeteries isn 't that cool the history mystery but anyway all right symmetries go back to the 1860s 1863 1873 yeah so there are all very early cemeteries yeah well out there were two cemetery thought in Little John you know used to live below one of them and it was just amazing going and exploring the headstones and you know seeing the history I mean there 's so much history and headstones isn 't there anyway so um Andrew would like to move that the report be

    "text": "specific Cougars on it speechless no noise I keep saying special that did a split was the terminology and ER the operative or is the terminology under the operative plan right it 's not because I 'm special we didn 't think they were especially that the most epic purposes that they have pletely in recovery so as was touched on briefly earlier i just wanted to oh hang on wait one second just because i have two apparent i note no one this is a standing order that i wasn 't aware of but i would like to move that the meeting continue beyond eight hours s standing order 3.37 SP plasma five o 'clock seconded by pauline Kotter I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie no no is it I mean I 'm actually I 'm actually personally confident that we finished by five duty I am so I know that Jamie has to be somewhere at six I 'm very confident we 'll be finished by 530i so sorry just just to go back as was touched on confirm that we have now removed the provisions of the central city flatland recovery zone which and our intended to be covered by the over overall chapter the specific purpose flatland recovery zone so I 'll move on to the minister 's comments in relation to the specific purpose wetland recovery zone which can be found on page 142 recommend a hundred and in the food that 's the central city right yeah so I guess one of their requests was for the for the objectives and policies to be replaced to be consistent with provisions that we had pre billith previously discussed right I have since her had a meeting with the officials that had made some sort of had suggested these this recommendation and advised them sort of there had been a change since the last time that we had had had the discussions and that was really in terms of the legal feedback that we had received in terms of the duplication with the natural hazards chapter and it was really a matter of making sure that you know that that duplication had been had been removed to the wording of the objective which is to include the words inappropriate and infrastructure and i guess so it wanted to include infrastructure is that is considered to be a key part a key component of christchurch recovery I 've also made an amendment to the interim use of land policy just to make it very clear as to what activity is proposed to be accommodated within the zone and the entry hearings I don 't think they need any further amendments a appropriately dress the issue so I could move on to the next one of it so I just what what were the previous the previous I see you 've just added the word an appropriate and infrastructure so I 'm previously the reason that I 'm asking the question is is that I think that there are some businesses that are still operating and the flatland recovery zone who would be very keen to see that Landry zoned out of this area because you know they 're right on a main route they you know the businesses operating perfectly fine but this of course would not existing footprint and so but presumably that through the submission process they would be able to submit on that to the independent hearings panel and this but this is this is made clear at the outset that this is really a holding pattern it is not the final word on the zone because I kind of want to repeat that because obviously there are people who are still living in the zone there are people who still operating businesses in the zone there are people who still owned land in the zone and although they have increased the offer to people who are uninsured and have increased the offer to people who had businesses and and and unoccupied land to a hundred percent and the uninsured to eighty percent I think that there are still some people in those areas that don 't want to accept that offer so it may be that and I just want to make sure that people understand that we 're not doing anything to make a final determination on the future use that this is simply an interim status to allow a status to thing that you 've just outlined there is what would come through either in legal submissions kicking off the hearing or in a very high level piece of evidence as an overview piece of evidence so in a situation like this where we are not having hearings ourselves we would we would would we provide support for a four or advice or I mean how would we help people that would want to make a submission for example to be raised owned or would they have to take legal advice and appear in front of the hearings panel they don 't have to appear they can put a submission and they don 't have to appear their submission still has to be considered we don 't as officers provide legal advice they would need to get their own legal advice but the situation the overview of the context of the situation that this is a holding zone and there will be a further process that Sarah will go through to with the public to determine what should happen on that land long term that can be set out either in hearing on this particular zone we we can develop further information on that like an information pages we have done with other issues and of course we will be available when the submissions open on the planners hotline and we will be going out for meetings that kind of think their people to raise those issues but so but it is perfectly acceptable through this process that people apply no but they wouldn 't would that 's that I know because lead yeah they haven 't actually done a recovery plan so it wouldn 't be unconcerned with anything there is legally existent that it wouldn 't be unconcerned for somebody to apply to have their zone changed from SP said yeah that 's correct yeah yeah okay I think having an information pet would be very good thank you good set all on that you 're happy yep people are happy we 're on to so now we move through to the more minor changes you 've just finished the what I would call the be very here the more significant chapters proposals and the rest are changes to stage 2 particularly and also I just want to bring to your attention the integrated schools designations and the commercial Richmond working men 's club so what you 'll leave yep then we could start would go through definitions general procedures and rules and leave out transport subdivision development and earthworks because there 's either no comments made by the ministers on these on on minor changes to these chapters or they 're insignificant just clarification or yet more matters leave out utilities and energy just briefly go over the changes and rural spz burwood landfall it 's already been mentioned to you but what 's actually in that zone and as I said before Richmond working men 's club and designation so five to ten minutes for each else what can we start with the ones that will take the longest so okay so we could start then with Richmond working men 's club Thank You Ellen why indeed just to remind counselors we talked about this the other day this is a situation where the panel during the area of the commercial chapter this issue was raised the council notify a proposal of this being zoned so really this is just information for you it 's not a minister 's comment it 's really just to tell you that this is a proposal and it 's really not much else you need to do with it other than know that it 's happening right thank you I think we had us we had a discussion around it did the couple weeks ago the people were generally are you happy with that because it 's in your patch I think it 's in your patch or is it and build Pegasus it 's restaurant than yours yeah I never quite sure where the boundary is that 's it right but it certainly it 's just to be notified yet the panel can get third parties comments on the proposal they 're not saying it 's that 's what they were notified they just want to get it out there so people can comment cool ex would do specific purpose burwood anita 's already indicated that it 's no longer going to remain in the open space chapter what will 's comments were to zone burwood landfill and resource recovery Packers a specific purpose zone we have inserted a new chapter and for the specific purpose zones chapter 21 point 12 and is an accompanying section 32 report that 's being prepared and either purpose of that chapter is recognized and provide for the existing and ongoing need for earthquake to waste recovery and disposal activities at these sites with the final outcome for the progressively restored area for open space recreational purposes I guess that so there is a zoning shown on the planning maps which includes these specific up the current specific special-purpose landfill zone as well as the area of the brrp and the area niners site deep and so hopefully it is we set out various permitted activities that have provide appropriate land-use activities there to facilitate that their operation which require progressive restoration and anyone have any questions so this little purpose zone when it becomes operative word when the plan becomes operative provisions they are just sort of thinking of them yeah it could be well two things it has to be before Matt moment that trans wastes are applying for consents to expand at the moment and ought to extend as a special purpose zone sort of take away any ability for local residents to anything that 's happening in there or not a fair seeking their consent I think it 'll depend on time frames but what what we 're proposing through this official purpose own sorry specific or so is that is the same as Watson the up in the current operative plan if we sorry the purpose of doing this is because it needs to be open for longer now it 's not going to be returned to open space as we initially thought they need to be open for longer Sarah does it say mmm a provision to allow activities have their happen they 're in it for a longer time yes yeah beyond 2016 beyond 2008 new trailer supposed to attend the process of applying for consents to do that very thing now as the as they 're entitled to because currently we 're operating under the operative district plan and these are all Sydney had absolutely no only a waiting matter I don 't actually have so under the provisions of special-purpose zone would have the fiend operations or I think you 've said it 's the same it 's the same I think the only thing that 's different is noise I think I 'm giving the operative plan like the noise provisions are exceeded then it 's a controlled monotype Timothy but it 's going to be the noise standards that is who the rest of the district which if you don 't comply it 'll be discretionary activity um so I 'm just wondering for good strengthen it rather than having the same like kiss string is a classic case we with the railway lean translates and David refer to their company they have applied to go and the if achensee and gothic and seen that something to appeal but like the impact on the redevelopment sudden them is really unacceptable Ambani wisely I 'm just going to wait I was waiting for you as soon as that weird trance place came out that it sunny day we 're going to hear a comment station between legally tell me very specific it 's only because the railway zone isn 't it too no no this is the beer would resource pack oh sorry I penguin every pair so it was a good try I 'm doing that I 'm actually incredibly impressed that you managed to get it into the debate when it 's not even on the agenda persona so do special-purpose railway is it a seagate meza yes this is a Pacific I we keep his own beer words regret guy or couldn 't La Mesa public class what is it of sorry is he burwood landfill and resource recovery Park it 's got this amazing long acronym BL RRP so are people generally good with us yes right moving right along thank you definitions for your decision sorry designations for your decision to include whether or not and to stage three and I 'll hand this to a deal hello it sorry talking to paragraph four point eight of the reports and attachment 3 the reports paragraphs are start on page 14 and so this is more of a procedural measure what we need a decision from council on today is whether or not to include some new notices of requirement which have been lodged with the council into the district planning process for notification and decision so just as background the Ministry of Education has lodged 26 new notices of requirement for its state integrated schools and a notice of requirement is essentially a proposed designation now these are existing schools they 're not new schools so they were lodged in the usual way and the resource consents team helping processing them the minister has sought that they be included into the district plan for notification and both the results meant for that and the order and council provide for that that councils discretion attached as attachment 3 is a memo from Melinda Smith senior planner and the resource consents unit she has been processing the notice of requirement to date and has provided a memorandum which sits out who view on whether or not the requirements should be included into the district plan essentially the main differences between continuing a resource management process and Laura or including them into in airoli a notice of requirement has lodged with the council and the council will consider there and make a recommendation to the minister and the minister then considers that recommendation and makes a decision and then there are appeal rights to the environment court under the district plan review process it 's a bit different the council wouldn 't be involved in the decision-making although it could make submissions on the on the requirements the Minister of Education wouldn 't make the decision either the decision would be made by the independent hearings panel and there would be no rights of Appeal so there 's pros and cons for various parties but in the round Melinda Smith from resource consents considers that it would be okay to bring them bring them into the district plan review there 's no reason not to and there are some efficiency benefits to be gained from doing that essentially the notification requirements are the same the directly affected parties will be involved in effect under the district plan review process they 'll be even wider full public notification of these proposals so the them into the district game review for decision-making so but that the MOA loses its requiring authority status and this regard then it loses the ability to a decision to make the decision and that they want that pros and cons no appeal right so I the designation could be confirmed earlier right but expensive is it more expensive for us it 's hard to say um well we 're only a submitter really on the process yes when they do it now we become you know we 're the ones paying for the you know yeah today I mean the question that I 'm really asking is what the Ministry of Education like to fund the additional cost well they have paid a fee already as normally there 's a ten-thousand-dollar fee for notices of requirement and they have because as essentially a bundle in their existing schools so it 's not as difficult to understand that they anticipate the effects for example so they 've paid a fee not the normal fee so councils costs head being meet up until this point yeah not designated this is there cloudy skies I understand that but then I 'm not designated their schools and the current servants the state schools are all currently designated and he 's estate integrated schools and they are not physically the look have you got the paper yes so the question is what is the difference effectively between operating as a school and being designated as a school area in the DPR the benefit of a designation is you don 't have to operate and with the rules of a district plan so there 's more flexibility for the Minister of Education explain what that might mean so for instance that doesn 't mean that it means that they don 't have to come back every time if they want to bring a new classroom on or extender classroom they don 't have to come back and get individual consents every time once the designation is passed and we understand what they will do on that site what the design for the site owners is an everything else they don 't have any further regulation that they need to meet under the district plan they however which gives council an opportunity just to consider the you know the bulkan location type aspects of the project so if there was a proposal for a new classroom for example stitch into the school under a designation process that Minister of Education would come in with an outline plan council would consider it and can request changes to that so that might be the sighting emotion to boundary or height or anything like that but the minister will make a final decision on that only be for school purposes the operation has to be in accordance with their designation purpose and it 's usually education purposes of it what purpose would you be worried about such traits of land suddenly deciding that they wanted to do a quasi commercial venture on the nose and I happy okay yeah so if there was a development proposal that wasn 't in accordance with the purpose of the designation the underlying rules apply and in this case is a school zone okay right okay all right yep that 's fine thank you so you 're accepting of them being given to 'm speaking to page 10 of you report four point seven point 10 the stage three provisions for the rural chapter consists of three new rules all related to landscape provisions on banks peninsula plus methods of discretion relating to significant landscapes on banks peninsula in the coastal environment so the minister 's comments were fairly minor yet they can be found on page 146 in 147 in terms of officers response to the comments and so keep it fairly short and sweet recommendation 207 The ministers commented on reducing prescriptive pneus and built form standards and whether or not we should consider non-statutory guidelines so just as I said this is introducing three new rules they currently exist within the banks peninsula plan they protect or manage effects on landscape matters and in particular the building reflectivity rule works very well and is quite easy to read efficient effective so I 've recommended no change to those and we also currently already have a non-statutory guideline for landscape on beach peninsula and recommendation 208 was on page 147 so just the following page and this comment from the minister a policy it 's actually a matter of discretion in relation to the coastal environment and they wanted it to be broadened to a whole range of effects so I 've accepted that and just recommended some wording to refer back to the objectives and policies of of chapter 19 very good well good yep thank you next one is general rules and procedures and then we have definitions and then we 're finished so the stage three for general rules and procedures just deals with some of the overlaps I 'm particularly with the natural and cultural heritage of relays hey NS a-- sorry page 147 page 152 and majority of these are quite small changes I think the only significant one that I wanted to highlight was recommendation number 26 which is on page 149 very small an addition to my recommendation ok so the minister 's comments were in relation to the activity status for temporary activities and sites of ecological significance in the coastal environment and the minister 's comments we 're seeking that the activity status be raised to discretionary or possibly non-complying on the that I 've made looking at some of the sites of archaeological significance and these are actually some of them quite popular venues for events and such as near Brighton Beach and so I 've made some amendments to the rules identifying particular areas and where temporary activities would be permitted within sight psychological significance or within the coastal environment so there 's exceptions for things like races I so they 'd have to get consent every time they go over a river things like that and what I 've added is just an additional exemption for particular zones so for example most of littleton is within the coast environment overlay in this additional exemption would allow him for activities within Jones while still protecting coastal environment outside of those areas yeah now reading I don 't think make a pattern and we need a specific recommendation I can 't use it unless 2.2 years refer to that sheet six point to point to enter that under six point under 39 2.1 years 06 point to point to amend away one was it this is a recommendation 26 remediation 26 the page handed out which you can attach to the minutes according to the additional page tabled at the meeting that 'll do okay very good finally definitions yep what page here are two sets of definitions related recommendations if it is relates to the definition section of the central city chapter and those fans of our recommendations 1912 194 on pages 137 2139 of the table yep the first two definitions that relate to rules relating to the temporary activities by then the aging rules and procedures section of their citrus City chapter which I believe Allison may have already felt well oh okay I 'll deal with recommendation 192 first which was the request by the Minister for a definition of effective lame drainage in relation to the port way related rules sorry I can 't see there where is it on page 13 FC right at the bottom it 's actually effectively or knowledge and so the actual wrecker bid directory ministers comment has written at the bottom of page the rest of the relevant materials over the page right and Ellison 's actually got that with the two men that have different definitions of actually required I know because it is in a party and it 's clear from the context of the policy what affected land drainage with me so accommodation right in relation to the recommendation 191 before it again just in my look at an itch Ellison 's recommendation she stopped with that and the list of activities that on a particular role so it wasn 't i wasn 't really dig mission-related is such to say thank you william the temporary tivities there 's a of activities that are covered by it which includes most of the events and all the activities it didn 't include temporary military training activities so what were seeking is just to amended to include all the activities that are covered by the temper activities and sorry sorry you just completely lost me I mean not hearing hot place been long day when I we 're on one create from the type of 138 137 had the ministers come in at the very bottom of the page and the actual changes are on the top of the the speaker recommendation 165 which is not below it I think that 's supposed to say 195 but I can 't no I don 't know what that is seriously I 'm lost its recommendation system recommendation 161 saris for sexual recommendation that once I one as some his address that is not below that 's way above is enough one sec fast what page is that on one page 244 sorry 244 oh I have it get out of out-of-sync like that yes ma 'am have I got a 240 424 what document are you reading I think it 's patient what page 124 da page 124 oh sorry there 's something wrong with my hearing I know that my eyesight 's affected but I do a bit pits so what sorry what okay this is getting silly now one two four one two four ok in its 165 is it or 161 the proposals of activities is more consistent with the definition of community activities includes activities that would have them fix some of those already proposed it 's all I 'm saying for sounds like it so a little bit unclear but refused your are more than that could they can 't agree I 'm afraid but I always thought that was just me so tell me the patient of community activities and the title of the role so it 's it 's a little bit unclear Alice I them they 're not actually requesting an additional definition here what they 've requested in the rule is because we 've listed a number of activities that are permitted which is recreation education cultural entertainment and all those together fall under the definition of community activities yeah so we 've changed the rule to say community activities instead of listening each of those individually but it 's not a definition it 's as simple as that yeah it 's all you 've done yes it 's all you 've done yeah basically it 's a good idea it sounds good to me any infects the ministers will be happy with it Oh God yeah the balance two recommendations were in response to the ministers could sooner an unnecessary duplication or revisions and technically from yeah and they wanted of specific activities of name that 's it 's been their theme throughout their representations do you know it 's one of the things was one of them here but um in relation to the balance to recommendations it 's about the reintegration of the central city provisions back into the balance of the plan and the case the definitions chapter specifically and effectively only eight of the existing central city definitions which are specific to the central city will be relocated back into the definitions chapter all of the rest of them will actually be deleted because they the central city chapter as that character sets relies on a repetition of the stage 1 and stage 2 definitions okay right got it all right that 's good so thankfully commercials related section the other of course as the stage three of the definitions chapter is say which is effectively largely natural and cultural heritage and while page if nations recommendations 12 12 on pages 6 to 14 of tables effectively will start on page 7 because the first two recommendations are generally general recommendations seeking greater clarity etc which recommendations yep I people might go to the one by one with any meticulous anyone was at a particular understand that what I would like to talk about oh I presume that the language around customary harvesting and all that 's been signed up things sorted out we 've rechecked it with the minister 's staff in there hippie words yeah but it was actually a bit of a miscommunication okay in but but but this is something that 's acceptable to Marty as well you know thanks trying to thin Awaran manaphy Noir yeah yeah yeah cool yep such an ass vegetation its all full okay yep yes well I might have to start using the word I might need to hit two so using the word reconstruction more fun that definition that 's very good yep I mean is there anything that we we should be specifically referring to I mean it 's always had going through these documents ahead of a meeting you know in the sense of just not having a context I found it easier to read the minister 's comments documental and that made yeah is there anything that you would think oh my god I should have eaten that to them no not even when that report comes out and the hearings panel says slam somebody for doing other thing I should have warned them that this would happen certainly I mean most of the comments that the minister have made have been accepted as beautiful more other yeah yeah okay all right that 's all good so it comes to the of bringing to your attention and minister 's comments so now you can hit particular regard to them what I would seduce though is that we add another recommendation regarding the 26 integrated schools designations okay you approve those coming into the district plan review okay six point two point three there there 26 and created scores disintegrated schools state under greatest all schools that have the 26 you know our applications notices overfly meant no the state and Arab League 26 notices of requirement relating to state and to state integrated schools be incorporated and stage 3 district plan review notification thank you yep is there anything else that you it 's all the year and Michaela understanding is that on the basis of those three amendments everything else that 's being discussed today you 're an you 're accepting of you know those three amendments will be made to those relevant proposals before notification yes so the notification notified material would incorporate those three members yeah yeah ok so we 6.1 receiving the minister 's comments and having particular regard to them we approve the staff recommendations and response to minister 's comments found on the draft recommendations table refuge of attachment to as amended and then we 've highlighted three amendments we are approving the recommendations table incorporating any changes made by counsel as the report summarizing the council 's response and reasons to the minister 's comments to be provided to the ministers before notifying the provision set out and 6.5 we are approving any changes to be made to the stage three proposals chapters to address minor errors before notification that you guys approve the draft stage three proposals chapters planning maps definitions and appendices and section 32 documents with any amendments according to 6.2 and and notes missions may be required okay no it 's fine now what about that one that we had a little bit of controversy over earlier on the little yes hospital no no of the not be set back for the node in facility hospitals no the one that we we decided that we would take the minister 's advice no the what was it early on no no um sorry I thought I thought there was one thing I 'm sure because uh what was it it was um no maybe it maybe it was maybe I am thinking of the Hospitalers I thought it was did argue over but there was I thought there was another one that we you raised that we should discuss with the Minister Minister of Health or his officials about the 10 meters four meter a shoe yeah and and I thought the decision the you know the decision wants to go with 30 in the team said yeah but see wait to see what you could resolve in the meantime that must have been I can 't remember I just I thought a quite a debate over on the central city but ok I 'm just going completely made now so we 'll just give it away so i will move this heavily and somebody would like to see conduct phil and i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you very much very much I put it from the possibility of a submission on stage three and this is the last public meeting that we would have on the district plan review great and so from here on we 've got obviously time schedule you know for meetings but presumably we wouldn 't need those no that 's correct we don 't need to a week no that 's correct I suggest perhaps we stick with Friday 's and potentially they can be reduced from two hours to one hour you what there would be for the most part updates to you on how mediations and hearings are going yeah I have every every month I have a we 're in a number of us have a beauty si si or would you prefer to keep the wind stay then and take the fridays out that might actually be better yeah it wouldn 't need to be every wednesday i come to most of me I 've been very good ok you know so I think balls will stick with the Wednesday mornings because there are eight tool yes 99 years cream and then that 's that 's quite cozy because then people got other things that they can good right okay all right and if I don 't need them will will cancel them and yeah the sooner the sooner you as soon as you know that they 're not required then bar Wednesday 's is not required thank you thank you your whole thing was a real we realized he 's a mountain of work that sits behind all this so thank you yeah no please no we 're and I 'd like to reiterate that i know that it has been challenging on on occasions and that the process has left a lot to be desired and you know if I could have had life over again beginning of the process rather than have to wait till I 've actually understood the whole process till I got to the end of it no yes yeah but this okay I mean I you know I mean I 'd said it has been what it has been and I think people have coped under incredibly trying you know situation and I think counselors have performed extraordinary but we couldn 't possibly have got through all of this without the entire team behind you Brigitte and you yourself for all the work that you 've done think very much okay _"

    "text": "good afternoon again silvercity natural hazards recommendation by lake one page 131 of your table and page 12 for the report projects report apart from these standardized advice notes that we 've got that Peter referred to earlier we 've got a relatively major amendment to address the minister 's concerns about more closely aligning the Central City natural hazard section with the stage one proposal and we propose deleting all the objectives and policies in the section and cross-referencing to those equivalent objectives and policies in the stage one chapter that 's the most significant response and the other recommendation 181 on page 134 of the table some other rather minor amendments to address an inconsistency in reference we 'd refer to a residential zone rather than the specific purpose with flat land recovery zone in respect of the high hazard provisions so that 's in high flood hazard provisions where land as such a subsided or as so just at a depth where it allows a greater than 1 meter depth of water so effectively that was another little a minor relatively minor inconsistency that they pointed out so and that was effectively it thank you very much okay page 89 a recommendation number 119 that 's where it starts and there was a second lot of recommendations which we can deal with at the same time for we state three amendments to open place a chapter 18 which is on page which start on page 147 a recommendation to 10 I will deal with those together because they are very closely linked to the main thrust of the comments from The ministers were around the way we 're dealing with biodiversity and protection of indigenous flora and fauna and they wanted a little bit more emphasis on for now from flora so the policy on water open space and water and margins has been amended accordingly to add that emphasis as well as the protection of biodiversity on the adjacent land and not just within the margins as would be defined by the definition so that 's the main change there and the other change is that The ministers were seeking a better integration between chapters and 19 coastal environment 8 in chapter 9 or equivalents in natural and cultural heritage chapter 18 and 60 general rules general rules and procedures that integration again was to do with how we deal with protection of specific values or special values of either biodiversity or landscapes and special features in the drafts we were all in all the chapter separate chapters we had rules that would be referring to either landscape overlays or biodiversity now all that has been pulled together into chapter 9 and instead of dealing with with those issues and the respective chapters for other zones we are relying on chapter 9 to deal with it right across the city so any references in the other chapters have been removed and that applies to open space as well now natural and cultural heritage chapter chapter 9 that 's right so that 's the main difference that should simplify any cross referencing to that another one was a request from the minister 's to retain or perhaps reinstate if you like the specific purpose a zoning for burwood landfill site initially the advice we got was that that was going to expire in 2016 in accordance with a change of mind and that site is now to be used for longer than expected and also long-term there are plans to keep it for any unexpected events in the future such as another Waco suchlike so it is proposed to remove it from open space natural zoning which which was applied to that build landfill site as part of the bottle lake forest and that will be a specific purpose zone and that will be dealt with under special purpose specific episodes and chapter and these are really their main changes as far as the open space is concerned in the central city and chapter 18 thank you can I just ask about the implications of keeping BRP open for the futures plans for recreational area which we 're in place prior to the extension the site is limited to the area which is actually used for recycling so it 's a defined area and that 'll be mapped on the maps the other parts of landfill that are not being used for recycling or four cavalry and will be turned into open space so it 's not that recreational development post was going to happen they 're all still go ahead east side of it is going to be redeveloped and I believe it is already being developed for recreational purposes yes okay yes yes no I 'm Phillips oh it 's all right no that 's just the disaster which starts in here it 's 4.73 on the report I 'm 4.72 I 've been fun 4.79 sorry and its recommendation 100 and both I think we just start at 4.79 it 's a very brief item yes I recommend that huge implications and 19 is it no but in the event just to put anyone on what 's happening there the the council would have notified its proposals to the minister it will warn the minister it basically rezone parts of the basin for a low density residential zone around the end around the edge of the basin that 's not needed lots of room of the base and we 'd prefer to refer to a rally people know that it 's on the rise I 'm higher ground that 's correct it 's real oh grandma numeral four and page 2 of the comments under the high level recommend our users oh yeah so the the ministers response was that the that proposal would be contrary to the land use recovery plan and to the regional policy statement chapter 6 because that area is not inside the urban limits and that 's that 's correct the reason was notified the reason we put that zoning there were twofold firstly when we did the assessment we felt that the remaining land outside those areas designated for the northern arterial extension and the storm water basin was suitable for some form of urban development and we anticipated that the perhaps that the loop review may proceed a little more down the track that it has but clearly that I think the minister has responded in the correct way that we probably have no legal position now to notify any urban development in that area and so we will be notifying a stage 3 a rural friend zone that area and no doubt we will get cement will probably would have received submissions on that seeking a it we do notifier and by that stage things may live it clear with alert but it 's unlikely the other measures which are concerned here obviously are the notices requirement for storm water and the northern arterial extension both of which have been heard and a decision has imminent and so we can 't really rizzo anything until the boundaries of those requirements have been defined and of course the the the other matter is the council 's decision on the long-term plan to hold back funding at least in the interim to for the Northern arterial extension now without that extension it 's got to be quite difficult to put any urban rezoning around the cranford base and because the access into there is quite limited but we won 't be we won 't be putting we won 't be addressing that until I mean we 've gotta wait for the zoning on the designation I mean the designation decision the only way to do so all that 's done is just created a new time frame for considering the funding so that 's correct so we 'll that I think that there were people who had a view that because we were going to go down this track that this was going to produce a result so i allays been in touch this morning but as i understand it we have approached as a council the UDS partners to ask them to support a change to the regional policy statement which would enable an easy fast track change to the land use recovery plan the utes partners basically came back and said no it has to be done within the context of the loop and unfortunately the loot process is not the quick and dirty that we 'd actually expected it to be given that the loops only been in place for what two and a half years and and I think people expected it to be reviewed after had been in for a little bit longer but it was late and its delivery as you might recall we signed it off when we got elected so it doesn 't actually come into effect until late in 2013 and then in 2014 owned in 2015 we 're even two years in the and in its existence but the detailed analysis around the around the review has actually slowed things down it even more so because you can 't have a district plan provision that is unconscious tante with the loop and how 's this inconsistent with the loop because we don 't have a basis for residential development there it 's gotta be it 's not identifies not identified on the loop as a place for residential developers only stuff that is specifically identified with an alert because we once the regional policy statement which has been operationalized by the loop that 's why the two are connected muscle to move identified land in a general sense it wasn 't the specificity that you 're suggesting that there was because when you look through the roof the qualification for the land that should be included yeah is actually the same yes I agree yeah but the thing is is that if we if we promote this then the Utes I mean sorry the independent hearings panel will just say sorry it 's unconcerned with the land use next thing so that so how do we we have to well I mean but anyone who applies for a plan change will come up against this problem so even if we applied for a plan change even when the people so much against the designation remaining in the rural fringe or liberators they will find themselves up against it we will continue to work behind the scenes to push for an amendment but you have to remember that UTS partners and other districts would like to amend their zoning as well and there are elements of there are property owners and our own city who would like to amend as well but they 're not within the loom as you say this qualifies on every category in terms of transport routes key activity centers proximity to the whole nine yards and and it wasn 't something that could have been promoted at the time of the loop because it was the designation restore water that actually enabled it to be re-designated as even so ironically the loop which was to free up land and create more housing and circle on the story yeah even though it and the pointers is that we couldn 't have put it in the loop at the time because it wasn 't_''_939.26 in the regional policy statement and even not being on the regional policy statement wasn 't a barrier to people getting into the loop as we saw but the designation restore water is what made this search for Urban Development and once that was resolved then you know we really actually had the basis for the the residential so in a way we have to accept this advice it 's we don 't have to be happy about being in this position but we do have to accept the advice and what we can do is continue to work behind the scenes with both ekel with Sarah to see if we can get some movement and potentially other UTS partners to see if we can get some movement on the regional policy statement and then subsequently the loop no no I when we notified as it is there 's no there 's no point not notifying the leaned it 's going to not notify it it 's got to be classified as something there are a number of people in it are quite agitated about the whole thing has been flip-flopping for god knows how long what if the minister intervenes can he over right up with the sea wrecked or not yet yep he can no sir but it would have to go through that would have to be in the loop he 's got to have a legal basis for it you know that the use you he 's had thus the use of what is it section 27 powers that 's right he 's been challenged in the court before and he will only utilize that and that would be a mechanism to amend the loop through section 27 but he would want the sign off of us and he can and the other partners and to the Utes he would and the other partners to the loop who are why my query sell one and okay he can later well nzta is not a signatory no no but no no the signatories to the loop unite our who seemed service it 's a shame that worms in it but you know how you have you ever heard that expression timings everything you know if the storm water issues had been addressed earlier then it would have made it unto the regional policy statement so because it would have been clear that it was going to be re-designated urban because it meets all the tests yeah yeah the regional policy statement goes great back before the earthquakes yeah yeah so the regional policy statement the you d is the urban design the urban development strategy informed in fact lead to a plan change that was being promoted at the time of the earthquakes to the regional policy statement so the sequence of events as UDS urban development strategy they agreed we 're green fields brownfields development would be across the Greater Christchurch area so included that those outer reaches of so on and why Mac christchurch city across the board it didn 't include banks peninsula because we weren 't amalgamated at the time and then the utes informed the the regional policy statement and all of our district would sign up to there and make amendments to our district plan in line with that the regional policy statement as the overarching document was changed and plan change one which was the implementation of the utes on all of those land use issues was in court in front of the court at the time of the earthquakes and basically the land use recovery plan and the section 27 designations that the minister made right at the very outset they were all based on that prior information and I see I 've always regarded the loop is operationalizing the clan change 1pc one year so and so now we 're in a situation where we can 't amend our district claim to be unconsumed with the land use recovery plan so I mean it is a technical blockage and I always think that if there 's a technical blockage and there 's a will around the table to find a solution then we should try and find the solution so I think we have to accept the staff advice that we can 't notify against the loop unless we notify your advice and and accept the it 's not advised at this stage no because it wouldn 't be fair but it would be better that we did that we notified rural fringe and then those who have interests and the alternative can can make submissions because otherwise if we if we put up a proposal then people would think all that 's okay that 's all going to go through but it won 't so I think they know what we need to do is to say to them they should appeal but we should continue to work behind the scenes to get the loop I mention submit they should definitely submerges to the independent hearings panel and we should continue to do everything we came behind the scenes to hurry up that review if the ability to no no no but this council has as a part of this review of the loop has indicated in its submission that cranford Basin should be reviewed but my understanding with the process for the loop the land US recovery plan is that that it 's that they 're using the then then it will go through the normal RMA route until it how long 's this process going to I hope it goes to the RMA wrote that section 60 of that you changed the regional policy stick that could be some time if it goes through a loop process and as Bridget said that may not happen immediately that that is probably the quicker process but it goes through an RMA process that subject to all sorts of process it 's protein appeals that kind of thing alert process would take roughly but depending when it started but it certainly be shorter than going through a signal few months oh and I be probably six months or something like that or a year but the minister has to be willing to do that and my understandings of data is that the process now for this review is more to identify areas that need change but then to hand it back to an RMA process just on that fully if we 're looking at wanting to review the move you our partners why make and sell and may have some speak the processor well not necessarily it may actually slow it down because what would need to happen is all of these different areas need to be weighed against each other because the whole purpose of the UDS originally was to stop ebon sprawl it was to try and contain the surgery so we would want to be careful that that is not undermined so much so that you start getting over and sprawl on various it 's a quite a key factor in every us progressing something could have another effect somewhere else well it 's just that the city what the urban development partners are saying is we shouldn 't be looking at just one area when there are a number of others that people want to be considered as well with respect to opening up greenfield areas and so that that 's the intention I think behind having it go back through an RMA process rather than just look at cranford base in itself it is highly likely this racing certainty in fact that we 're going to get a lot of submission seeking rezoning at the because over a very brief memo on of us all sets out and you know the implication yeah that 'll be a good idea because i think we probably won 't get asked questions about it and it might be good to do a briefing particularly foot oh I have people know people that live in the area and the yep history will not pestering me to ask any questions always gone so it would be very healthy until you 'd like to have of us huh nothing else that would be very helpful to have that Italy you know I think I think all of us would appreciate things sorry so that we could see money so that they can see the situation that we 're in submission to the hearings panel if there 's no to raise the issue right okay yes so people people need to have the issue Bray 's yeah and it can 't play detail in the time frame it does and in the thing is is that we 're not going to have this hearing for ages are we this particular way let you see the point that I 'm making us is that if we continue to work behind the scenes and if there were a change you know between now and the end of the year when the hearings are held and that would help so I don 't discourage people from from making a submission I mean that the time frame hasn 't changed for the submit for the hearings to be held yep but we 've got a bit of work to do to persuade people that this would be I don 't four to five hundred houses right there we 're absolutely got and absolutely and I think when you put it like they 're heli I 'm sure that it will you know I 'm sure we 'll be able to yeah it will resonate and the right places all right so that 's that one thank you and we 've got the special specific paper split a burger at Catterick _"

perhaps a Miss PCB would landfill we should talk to you about and commercial Richmond 's working club I would talk to staff about anything of those others that are more critical okay so if there 's anything that there any notices of requirement I 'm sorry there 's a part in the covering report on page 14 that talks about the notices of requirement so maybe three of three metres three metres okay all right so how many more components of the Central City chapter have we got to go you have the rest of the general procedures and rules signs lately and recovery natural hazards open space and that 's it okay then they 're not flatland recovery yes because essentially the comment on the report is just something that it 's been combined into the main topic right so we don 't have to worry about that no okay and with your leaves and then yes I 'll just go and speak with the other chapter leaders of those other things just to see whether or not they feel they really do need to bring something specifically to your tension yep and you can carry one of my exes all right all right we 're on to alcohol so in terms of the general rules I 'll just cover off the other subtopics except signs and then i 'm scott blair will come up and answer any questions do you have about the sign provisions I in terms of the other subtopics most of the comments were minor changes or Corrections or clarifications I think probably the most of central issue is around the tailed alcohol provisions yep so the ministration what page on the big page so this is page 1 30 on the big charity on the big page recommendation number 177 yeah on the is to rest of the city in terms of removing the provisions relating to sale of alcohol on the grounds that they repeat provisions that are either in other areas of the plan so covered by the noise rules and the traffic laws or repeat provisions that could be included in a local alcohol policy under the sale and supply of alcohol act okay and you 're recommending against thus mio conditioners is to retain the evidence so I mean I think that 's absolutely correct i think there 's been a fundamental error and the officials that have given advice to the ministers and the reason that i say that is that the only things that we can cover in the local alcohol plan now that we understand that provision of those provisions very well the only things we can be dealing with the harmful effects of alcohol we cannot be looking at the harmful effects on neighbors to premises that sell alcohol after certain hours so we cannot actually do our job as regulators in this area in terms of amenity and the impact on neighborhoods think that anyone who 's kind of lived close to a pub owner residential area will know that it 's not just noise and it 's the same issues that Ellie raised before the smoking outside because you can 't smoke inside it 's the chattering into the early hours of the morning it doesn 't actually matter even if you 've stopped serving alcohol you still on the premises after a particular hours if you 're in a restaurant setting you 're more likely to be finished at a particular time and that 's what this has protected against and I think it would be absolutely wrong of us to accept the minister 's advice because I don 't think they 've taken correct advice on the difference between the two provisions the RMA provision and the salad with a provision that we fear summary and that 's that 's the legal advice that that we 've received on the rest of the district alright moving along and so the general rules also covers lighting and glare aircraft protection a number of other sub topics but the changes are on any of the recommendations between pages 122 and 131 on any of the subtopics know that a little time that 's I mean though we go into the signage pretty minor yep thanks and the next one is guides signs right what page is def on the big sheet on the thick sheets the substantive issue is at page 121 think I can be mercifully mercifully brief with us the minister the comments that came back from the ministers were we 're on the whole supportive of the approach taken with some minor amendments to some of the policies but the more the only really substantive change I would say as they sought the having of the allowable size size of a sign and the central city business signs and the Central City mixed use zones which we have agreed to all as officers we think the council should agree to yeah and that 's that 's about it so it works with a multiplier the wii u had say 20 squids 20 meters of road frontage your allowable sign would be 10 square meters the crown is suggesting crown is suggesting that 's behaved too so that if you had 20 meters of the road frontage at be tense or building frontage of 10 square meters of sign so it 's just to bring it down that would be commensurate with the wider city plan rules that we 've that we 've promoted right okay Apple yeah suppose it were they look well the brightness of those signs is it some controls are met it all there is around the there is in the rules package and as I recall that has been submitted however the ministers have not provided and comments on those so i think that the ability to really stays at the stage naughty all right all good yep picked up something can I go back 12 page 145 so clarification and often just um then the solution near 13.1 four point three point three point nine amenity whether the timing directional design of knighthood bull or unnecessary lights during the night sky fit been taken out only for the central city well the grounds that the the ministers suggested removing them on the grounds 's expected to be acquitted hi general degree of lighting there that would be too onerous to have that as a matter of discretion because that assessment so it 's retained for the rest of the city but within the central city it wouldn 't be a matter of discussion what do other cities have implies something that do they have any protection of the night sky or something there 's a some district lines were there they have a specific reason for it so for example around the st. john 's observatory and the kinsey district plan they have actually quite strict rules around lighting but it 's generally tied to a particular area where they 're trying to achieve a nitrogen I 'm sorry I just I 'm in a really bright central city also if it 's posts into the city and I really like to watch the sky does anyone see Venus and Jupiter last night and the night before is amazing here um so I mean not all lighting has to have an effect on the sky surely we 've got technology that we can think there 's this standards I 'm still apply within the central city so there 's still a maximum lights bill and that includes to the horizontal into the sky all it 's doing is removing this as a matter of discretion also because it 's it 's quite a difficult thing to quantify into SS so which is considered towards the central city of it it 's not an appropriate matter of discretion but there 's still standards there in terms of the maximum amount that olathe could be generated oxidants I 've seen him offer some pratik this course it 's not actually open slather that you can hear ya the rules are still there yeah thank you alright thanks mom which one try silage hey sneeze absorbs much _"

    "text": "again page 11 on the covering report we started in terms of the attachment 2 and in the table of the minister 's comments we 're at page 80 and we 're looking at recommendation 109 on the whole and the minister 's comments are a relatively minor and and address mostly mechanics the there is one substantial issue however in terms of the non-residential activities that were listed as permitted activities and the chapter as it was forwarded to the ministers the comments the Crown 's comments have asked that the provisions for non-residential activities be pretty much the same as those that were in the central city recovery plan where the approach that the central city recovery plan talk was quite restrictive to non-residential activities they say it was on the basis that they expected an increase in residential activity obviously within the residential zones and to support increase that increase the residential population to support the central city the central city business zones and with it as well that the activities that might have established as permitted activities in the central city living zones would be better central city loving zones were close enough to the central city business zones for the residents of the central city living zones to have access to those to those non-residential activities and specifically we undertook a review and specifically and within this recommendation 109 priests permitted activities for preschools for spiritual facilities for education activities for healthcare facilities for veterinary care facilities and for places of assembly have been deleted as permitted activities under the structure of this plan and it would be commensurate with what the ccrp as I understand it that that resource consent applications to establish these activities within default or discretionary activity in terms of the other recommendations that they are as I said mostly in terms of mechanics and if we turn to say page 84 where the Central 's the plan as forwarded to the ministers made temporary military or emergency service training activities of permitted activity and the comments have come back that in terms of the ccrp that these were restricted as discretionary activities and that and that they they thought that and they should be provided for as restricted discretionary activities consistency with the ccrp excuse me will say consistency work and with the ccrp they could be the bait could be deleted as promoted activities and returned as restricted discretion activities and then the rest of the the rest of the recommendations are really a although we should look at specifically look at recommendation 111 which talks about amending the non-residential activity policy to reflect that to reflect the CCR peas approach to non-residential activities and that is the recommendation that worked that of that I 've made here and that there are some quite substantial amendments to policy excuse me 13 point 1 point 1 point 1 point 2 and that there are quite a number of let 's change the theme if you like of the policy from one of being enabling of residential activities to one of controlling them so as to so as to support the recovery of the central city business science and to support the recovery of the residential zones and from veer on from page 85 through to page 86 sorry through to page 203 they 're just issues of of mechanics the minister 's views on how they could be consolidated most of which have been taken up the one that they have recommended a restructure of some of the some of the built form standards and to permitted activity standards I don 't want to delve too deeply into it but my analysis is that that wouldn 't suit or does not suit the residential zone structure of the wider of the wider city plan and the structure that have been that has been recommended to the ministers originally as closer to the the wider suburban residential zone structure and that should be maintained generally good door Paul any Glen you 're looking worried just the implications of this as you see it for say pitches its crew giving us an early scenario there might be that they would be that instead of establishing within the central city living zones themselves they 'd be they 'd be in Carmel encouraged to establish within say a central city mex do so or a business zone itself now they I guess the geography of the central city has such that most of the study designs with inconvenient walking distance of the of the of the central city business science as well so there is some I think there is some logic to the minister 's comments I know that I mean would just be mean if I didn 't mention what Yanni would say if he was here but you know putting know about putting our salvation army you know Citadel replacements of the dough and the slept being in a residential area rather than back where it was or a location more convenient to to that use and you know not using good residential land for residential which it 's replacing and I mean obviously there was a lot of focus on the the other church that was to move into the other site but they got tuned down by commissioners but you know they I think it 's you the desire to use residential land for residential we are possible especially in the central city yeah it 's great I suppose it is that consistency to you mean as you said there 's the other block man with the criminal case up and that wasn 't allowed to change it to stay residential sort of him what was the Manchester was we used to be a Manchester Street yesterday I 've caught amaechi 's relatives yeah but what was the I 'm trying to think of the name of it a majestic church majestic that 's right so but it 's the inconsistency why they don 't allowed majestic church you love the Salvation Army so that 's confusing for people as well so how did the Salvation Army get to that residential side I mean because it was it was residential housing I 'd have to come back to you on ya would be worth knowing the answers that question because I know that you know yarny has raised it simple try and see because it 's on the corner of Colombo and it 's all free at all also got the school has taken over another which was a very large building they had huge amount of units you know residential units and it 's now school when the suppose under utilization as comido single-story classrooms which ones that back terrace and oh yeah yeah yeah that 's right yep yeah so but generally speaking we think that this is a good change I think it would be closer to the to the ultimate ultimate goal of increasing the residential population yeah yeah okay is that okay all right yep moving right along central city general rules and procedures page on the big sheets on the big sheets I really wish that gone through and tab these what order is it and what 's after is it after living as it I 've done 18 sorry 181 I say right I was miles away but this video we have our acoustic consultant here today I might ask we do the noise section first summary can walk you through what the significant changes there and if you have any questions noise section here which pages are what pays only 125 135 recommendation number 166 gosh so for the noise section we have recommendations 1662 169 which are only pages 125 126 now um all in all mode the comments from the ministers were quite minor but um we have to done here to give you a better perspective I 'd like to refer you to the planning maps on the overlay um it doesn 't have a pic on page number but if you count from the pages from one is 770 giving the cover page and it 's called the central city entertainment and hospitality precinct overlay planning map it 's on the 71 including the cover case what 's the plan inmate number there 's no pending map number it 's an overlaid central city entertainment and hospitality precinct or relay what 's one of horrible oh and there are many makes one not the natural hazards on natural hazards the actual planning map but it doesn 't have a planning Mac number so if you come to the seventh page eating disorder so we 'll travel I am I looking for central city entertainment in hospitality precinct overlay yeah I careful got it everybody 's got it everyone got it right now just to give you the same this map to you this overlay map on the green dotted lines or category one precinct yep yep that lines are category 2 yeah and then the rest of the central cities category 3 yep okay so we go into a recommendation number 166 on page 125 which is a minor but yeah it 's just a number page number 125 recommendation 166 and the minister 's comments so the the minister 's comments on that recommendation is just to UM provide greater rationale in the section 32 which we have accepted here on to explain this because recommendation 166 and 167 are related and you need that overlay map to understand it what the central city recovery plan did was to introduce amendments to the city plan and what they had done was that um there 's a permitted standard for each category precinct and if you exceed the permitted standard it automatically becomes a restricted discretionary now what we did with this fellow city noise provisions you propose that if you exceed the permitted standards by 10 decibels or less it is restrictive discretionary but if you exceeded by more than 10 decibels by more than 10 VD it becomes the non-compliant activity so this has been on their recommendation number 167 they only wants the non-complying activity to apply only to category 2 of victoria street and category three areas only so that means the category 1 which is the green dotted lines and the category to the red dotted lines in the central city zone will become restricted discretionary if it exceeds the permitted standards there are no non-complying activities for those recent areas and um so what does it mean in a row space you know what look what does that mean you have to apply for what you non-complying you can it no if you see more than 10 in decibels what she 's saying it becomes a non-complying so non-complying activity has to be assessed against the whole of the Resource Management Act and the policies and objectives and the plan yeah it 's the highest barrier and the ends of consent the sound barrier quite getting out I thought there was actually different noise ratios for the central city part as a post Victoria but look at this map by the same they are it 's essentially the same there 's same yes and we will apply the years you 'd have to go back to the rules here we are can you tell them where to find it in the plan in the victorious we have a nighttime that finishes eleven o 'clock and the central sea is 1am that 's from the noise ratio prospective that 's right that doesn 't stop you opening later it 's just when the noise rules change from daytime to nighttime and so does that mean if the bar has a queue outside which is you know quite a big queue and it 's making considerable amount of noise would that be regarded is non-compliant if they 're queuing on the street didn 't know because they 're not part of your site but you deal with that with liquor licensing and the likes if that becomes a problem you simply object to it next time they try to renew their liquor license can I say that it 's in page 248 24 8 of the spatially 241 noise sadness or category I have seen oh just to double check so table 1 that category too and it 's on the left column qualification so it gives you the hours in an actual fact the limits are slightly different to the daytime numbers like a more stringent for Victoria Street really acknowledging that there 's quite a lot of established residential around the Victoria Street area so that the crown doesn 't want the rules to apply all in the green area or the would you know to have an uncle banks data set all that 's right so the issue is and this is something we 've proposed district why not just in felicity is that is a gradation from permitted to discretionary and non-compliant the idea being that if you don 't have that it means you could have an amplified rock concert somewhere that produced enormously high noise levels and it 's still only a discretionary activity yet the effects are much much greater than something that 's only marginally above the rules so we think it 's important to have that gradation that once you get a restricted discretion you could you could resolve that couldn 't hang yes is our philly cursory look at your application you 're only your discretion is limited to me noise it comes non-complying you can still do it but it 's a much bigger ask you council can look at anything they like it is right so I think the basis of the proposed rules is that the level of effects are not the same if your if your daytime rule is 60 decibels something producing 65 might be perf acceptable but something producing 75 probably isn 't so why should they have the same activity status I think the other thing is that discretionary activities suggests that there will be sites in that area where that level of exceedance of the noise levels is acceptable but a non-compliant into it he suggests that in most cases and exceedance all that noise level of in this case that extra 10 DB a is not acceptable so there 's it 's quite important when you 're using either discretionary activities or non-compliant activities to make that distinction and by making a discretionary activity you are suggesting that in fact that there will be it by that much those levels by that much I think what 's been introduced it here is that in fact in most cases it won 't be acceptable to accede to play that much its dominant as you say Sunni fight may not be acceptable but I see a victoria street the ads from live in a culture to seal in the morning the maximum is 75 decibels yes but that 's I like a one-off maximum that 's not a continuous level and why even arrives assuming that it doesn 't actually apply to the outdoor air is it doesn 't apply to people in outdoor areas during daytime the data so up to eleven o 'clock at night people in your outdoor area don 't get counted after eleven they do yes I just yeah I just I don 't think that what people want to have happen here and what life 's really like when you live in the inner city two different things well these these noise rules are reasonably lenient particularly you know no no I 'm I 'm actually saying that if you the other side of the river so not even and frame on casual street and that you know Bridgewater waiver it was cool used to be rich water hisses at Bridgewater yep it was quite very close to the bridge of remembrance yeah the one so quite a large development yeah you talk to people who lived in there they could hear the struggle if so and that went till quite late that 's right interestingly that one was more an issue that the in terms of these rules that those bars weren 't complying with those rules right if they had been the problem wouldn 't have existed so the problem largely got resolved when when the bars controlled in or was just a little bit better right and then there was the other one there was accommodation built alongside Henderson 's development what was that called the no the no no no they think the lane you know what oh yes poplar and I 'm not popular the one so square thank you it sounds as much feel yes yeah yeah yeah yeah so there were lots of some of the complaints there happened after the ownership changed and they they no longer owned the bar as well as the apartment right and some of those problems are really more because premises are not complying with the noise rules more than than Elizabeth being wrong ok so I 'm satisfied the nozzles are okay the minister 's comments simply relate to the non-complying status I think it 's important the comments here absolutely right a discretionary status almost says we expect this to happen and a non-complying status really says we expect this not to happen doesn 't say you can 't there 's a much tougher ask and I think it 's important I just couldn 't you hear I mean it does seem the shame that you can 't have something in between non-complying and discretionary because if you if you think of the and I probably got some sympathy for the there anacor the green dotted bone category one you know that because there is designed for night night clubs and you know facilities that can stay open later yes it is they already have a relatively small area so the point is once you 're ten decibels over that you 're starting to have effects beyond that area as well which starts to come back into your category to category three areas so that there 's the problem and if you had a very very large area then yes the Ariat parts of certainly of the middle of it where you could do exactly what you write because there 's no buffer is what you 're saying re area is always a little bit so there isn 't a buffer for noise not when a we 've tried to but you 'll see if you look at that overlay map that you 've got the northeastern the southwest corners really directly a joined category three yeah I mean what I mean what what I 'm trying to do is just make sure that when we go in front of the independent hearings panel and that we have submissions made obviously by all the businesses want to open nightclubs in these areas that we 've got a robust mmm position yeah um and I 'm of those people and can 't_''_1592.22 wait to be able to do it again would you know want to get that balance right yes I want it to be in vibrant and exciting place to be but they also want to see at night and that is ultimately the challenge and I think the minister 's recommendation really tries to push it in favor of the noise producer and and ignores that balance of the noise receivers yeah but I don 't think and I think that it 's I mean it 's hard to say because you 're backwards and forwards but this might be something worth having the conversation with officials about who are providing advice as you know that there may be thinking about noise is something that 's contained within an area but of course you can put a line on a Mac you know it 's a little bit you know making a sort of disease free zone and yes you know the disease can 't move you know over that line quite right hmm just like the boundary between so on and Christchurch si to mention very bad one of the things that I find a little confusing when we 're talking about these sorts of rules is why there is an or how they can 't_''_1664.85 be a consideration or inclusion on it on information and it 's about the noise in the inner city and i 'm thinking of friends that I have who are living in the Peterborough apartments sort of opposite James done right there by Harlequin and what have you and the noise that comes from the pub fare now the pub wasn 't there when they built those and when they moved there and quite clearly if there were there was double glazing there was better insulation what have you the noise would be not a problem so it 's really important to have the vibrancy and be able to live with a bit of noise yes and these measurements of noise just on their own on the street is great but surely it 's got to be done in association words what our buildings our homes our apartments are made of well I 'm glad you mention rules yes thing is the decibel readings and these this information you 're talking about is put in place and considered in together with the building requirements and insulation there yes right yes sir there are for any new dwellings close to these areas there are construction requirements for some to sell insulation or these noise levels here am I trying to communicators so if you 've got houses that are being built new houses as you 've just see those measurements that you 're talking about might be absolutely fine but the noise measurement for houses or homes that are already there it might not work for now I know you can 't put something place for everyone but is there also considered and licensing and other things that can control activity we 've tried to strike that balance to some extent again the reason victoria street is a little more stringent than elsewhere is recognizing that there are so many existing houses right therefore we 're not going to do anything for them so it has been a big long process in weighing all those things up there problems one is because often sleep with windows open and there 's not a lot you can do with that but there are things they could potentially do the other is that that bars often don 't comply with their noise rules because problems out of harlequin was producing noise that they weren 't permitted to do so especially delicious roast meals that 's the real but anecdotally what I 'm hearing from people and if it Toria students a perfect example but not a Pyrrhic victory you had some spring up around a whole lot of homes that are already built yes so open windows and people breaching their license or whatever anecdotally I don 't accept that from what I 've heard from people living in the area they have windows shut and people are operating with them because when they complain nothing can be done as they 're operating within their license so all I 'm trying to say is for example would you have a different application of the rules all levels of the rules for Victoria Street where you 've got a large number of and yet other areas that may spring up that are going to be new that will have that will be different again in essence they are in essence that 's that 's the way that the entertainment precincts work in in this intensity yep that 's why we 've permitted higher levels in in the core of the city right as opposed to victoria street victoria street will always be a challenge that some of it I don 't accept that all the bars are compliant have been complained they mostly are now but there have been some notable exceptions early on a lot of those problems have now been resolved to some extent also the problem is gradually resolving itself some of the problems was people queuing outside that 's largely gone because we 've got a lot more premises open now you 're having smoking areas out onto the street for example up and that 's one issue for some people living in those Peterborough apartment yes and I 'm aware of that we 've been engaged to help resolve it right I guess thank you for the wait to go big I did I love living in the inner city it 's just you know I know I know the best of all worlds really yeah it 's on the edge all right no that 's good thank you thank you for that so that covers our recommendation 166 and 167 about the non-complying activities yeah and then this recommendation 168 which is very violent and 169 also will we 've accepted with minor amendments ya on that um that overlay map just renaming the title it used to be central city noise overlay scanning that yeah we just keep spinning because the sale of alcohol is also using his map okay yep and yep and it 's now consistent with a December 2014 version of the central city recovery 10 right okay all right thank you brilliant now look as we haven 't stopped for a cupboard do you want to stop for a quick cuppa you want to just grab one and bring it back and keep working or do you want to stretch leagues and stretch leagues all right so we 'll starting we great cop or a comeback on _"

    "text": "very good now we move on to Central City Central City so the central said he is chapter 13 well that 's six and 32 and the comments again the first place and probably most useful place to start would be on page four attachment to at recommendation Roman numeral 15 if I just start there because it 's probably one of the more major changes to the central city chapter so this is the great big one page for minister 's comments central city integration yes Venice 's recommendation 95 delete from draft proposal general provisions that are already including other proposals and replaced deleted provisions of that the one yes yeah so the in a nutshell what the ministers have recommended is that the simplicity kept that not be a standalone chapter that it be integrated with the rest of the proposed replacement district plan and at the same time and a muzzle mention it now because it 's all overlaps they meant that the objectives and policies be more specific in more aligned with the strategic directions decision what has been what is proposed in response to fully integrated into the replacement district plan and that is proposed to be achieved through a number of steps first of all at this point in time in terms of stage 3 notification of stage 3 including provisions in those other stages three chapters that are being notified now they relate the central city in those aged three chapters so the stage three chapters I 'm talking about in particular the natural and cultural heritage chapters and the specific purpose flatland recovery zone those provisions will be notified now so the intention is that in fact what has been done now is that the provisions relating to those matters that are within the central city are included within those main topic chapters now we 've also taken what were the general Central City objectives which are objectives that covered not just a particular zone within the central city but the central city in a wider perspective and have proposed to include some of those directly into the strategic directions chapter as additions to the strategic directions chapter and the one remaining one to be incorporated into the commercial zone chapter in what is left of the central city chapter is an indication of where those provisions will go in the main topic chapters so it indicates that the central city residential zone for example will be located in the residential chapter and so forth shall we just point you to an example of that for instance just in this big chapter here if you turn to page 200 m at 199 just above the hidden earthworks there 's a box an advice note that says where this part of this chapter will actually sit once does just once decisions have been made that 's just an example of what Pete is talking about page 199 in the dirt in the draft chapter there 's a box with an advice note in it that 's what Peter 's been saying that will indicate where the where the actual rules will sit once the decisions have been made so that there isn 't a standalone chapter any longer and the last aspect of that is that its proposed that the staff come back to the council with a recommendation that the counselor City provisions into the remainder of the replacement district plan so on page four of attachment to to the council report you can see there in the officer recommended revision of wording first of all the indication that natural cultural heritage provisions and flatly and recovery zone provisions energy variation of those chapters now second point is the amendments to the specific so a strategic directions objective three point three point eight revitalizing the central city and then item three the advice notes that will be examples of advice notes that will be included in the publicly notified version of what remains at the Central City chapter any questions coming okay just moving on then the next point on page 10 of the report which is the simplicity business they 're mixed use zones the minister 's sought an amendment to the policies to provide a basis for the height controls in the central city to achieve low rise building environment so addition tipping proposed tune existing policies on an appendix to on pay a 889 sol just adds within both Pollock their objectives and policy that one of the just to just to make sure we 're all on the same page what peter is doing now is is going through their comments on the central city chapter that are in the covering report which highlights the substantial comments that have been made by the minister so he 's just done the first and the second and now he 's going to move on to all transports own their antony what pages that in the report page 11 yenna no but and and this big report error on page 95 being by the sky 38 the slake its recommendation 88 and 89 on pages 1661 so i got my number Shawne 1661 sorry straighten it again so starting at recommendation 88 which is a change to objective 13-point 1.3 sorry recommendation eighty-eight right there on page 68 yeah it 's on page 68 that 's right see page 68 hey thanks bikini on page 68 recommendation 88 so the first is the change to objective 13-point 1.3 and in the second is the change to policy 13 point to point 1 point 1 point 3 I really just indicating city that means and inside the frame now it means inside the poor evan usual fighting musician because there are height limits in a number of different zones and i thought that the whole purpose of the frame was to not have a distribution of commercial activities across the central city is net the opposite of what the central city recovery plan and teens the or is it just one of those little ironies when you try to need a plan that 's being devised outside our planning process with our own plane its distribution perhaps was not well I just wanted to fix the right word because you what I think that all the ministers asking for us is actually contrary potentially to the central city recovery plans purpose is what what 's the minister i think was wanting is an indication that they want the commercial activity to be spread at a low scale through the central city rather than to be concentrated in a small number of tall buildings that 's that 's what they want to say well what they wanted the land values that now you know I don 't_''_671.55 I don 't know that I can 't see that what they 're asking for just just running to the situation at the moment is that we do have we have proposed height limits within the central city reflects those height limits that are and that have come through in the operative plane from the Christchurch central recovery plan so what is missing is a policy basis for having those height limits and that in fact was missing from the recovery plan itself so what all we 're doing is introducing as a policy that there will be height limits seat to achieve this low and more spread out distribution of commercial activities rather than concentrated in a few tall buildings I think we hit this an hour original sin city playing yeah I 'm not a we link to the philosophy i 'm just wondering whether they 've actually cook their own guys but anyway let at the end the day we have to be consistent with the Christ you central recovery plan that does have height limits in it and this is really I see this is just to allow the height limits that are covered by this is fatima can be stuck it right you 're right exactly Jamie and Jimmy will remember that I thought we actually came up that policy basis when we submitted our own plan you know in the discussion on the height limit seven out of it anyway yeah let 's came out of sheer an idea it 's what people wanted so that 's the end of the commercial and mixed-use provisions and it 's probably best if I hand over now to check to deal with a school zone so what pages this on the biggest agents so in the first report which has page 11 is yeah yeah I know world of 100 0 100 of the big title thank you um from recommendation 140 so the report Brigitte 's outlined the most kind of substantive issues they 're really most of them were about making the rules a little less prescriptive a bit more clearer and a few minor things like adding a few more permitted activities to what they could do with accommodation so we 've done those those minor ones they 're quite straightforward and I suppose the three main things that they flagged to ask us for which things that I 've chosen not to run when I wanted to flag with you to check be happy with that so the first one was about lyndhurst hospital which is the site on the corner of Montreal and b li I 've proposed that that is no longer so into the hospital now there isn 't another zone which fits it exactly the choices really had we 're going forward with a hospital zone which you will be aware is the zone that we want to put on our larger big fish and extensive sites really where we want to see intensification and lyndhurst hospital is very much not that the DHB advises they 'll probably flick it on in the future at some point and they wanted to refurbish it but not to redevelop it as such so along the southern side of B liao you 'll probably be aware that the central city and recovery plan has its own of motels and an awful lot of healthcare uses along there so in line with that so it 's not to be inconsistent that 's also what the proposed zoning has gone in as so that 's what went to the minister and his comic they came back and said no we 'd prefer it to stay as hospital zone but I 've kind of no good this way why no I mean it will be because the rules are more restrictive for what they can do in the residential zone as opposed to what they could do under the hospital zone but the way we 've gone with our hospital zone is that actually each site we 've had to kind of almost do site-specific don 't form standards so and the way we 've gone with it is making the heights go up a lot but we 've gone for these wider setbacks so that they can intensify as long as they bring it in and because of the small size of the site it 's not that appropriate to take that approach on that one so have minister 's on there a talks to the DHB we did a lot of dialogue going along with this and as I said no their feedback was that they wanted something that in future would enable them to have other options I am so what does enable them to hit other all this is the problem the other side of Bailey as part of the stage 2 we 've got this corridor zone yeah no I know I know it doesn 't apply but it doesn 't apply in the central city no there isn 't another one that gives them that kind of flexibility but as I said obviously all the uses along the south southern side of b li are these kind of things so it doesn 't give them the permission to do that obviously but it 's at the same approach that has been taken for that South Sider be like so that means that if they wanted to be a health clinic like you know two doors down or where orders you know that there 's lots of health facilities on the on the south consumed in the same way that the other health care because some of them are in fact residential properties re-purpose to health facilities that 's right so it 's been a tricky one there 's no ideal fit for it really no I know but no no it 's a planning it 's just a planning tool but doesn 't the planning or the zoning have to reflect the actual use of don 't know what it 's currently a hospital yeah but not in the sense no no no I know but yeah I know I know what you mean but I think that I think that I understand that issue but I asked you whether you talk to the officials that were advising the minister and I use that deliberately because there isn 't the DHB I 'm not the Ministry of Health at the dialogue and I assure its the Ministry of Health or do you think that seer has been advising the minister on this one well the comments all came through from the crown of the whole didn 't live through it so it 's comments RM collated by Sarah but they come these proposals go to all of the ministers and then they callate all the responses back in I 'm not clear whether that comment that came from the mystery of house or some other minister might be worth just checking out because I mean this is one that you just wouldn 't really want to have a big focus on and I thought it was just quietly leaf the way it was it might be the best thing to do you know since all approach I mean the thing is is that ultimately I mean what can 't you have it so that so that it its underlying designation goes back after after it 's um you know if it 's not no longer used for a facility didn 't_''_1150.87 we put that designation somewhere else all hospital sites have an underlying sewing provision if they 're not used for healthcare going forward they 'll be used for something else well that would automatically be central city residential zoning would go into that one right so does anyone object to that being a hospital in the meantime even though that it doesn 't quite fit our new version of the hospital it is a hospital yeah I 'd need to because of the way we 've looked at this we haven 't looked at the new rules package for that site so what so so wonderful that so tell me exactly what you 've called it on the plane now but at central city residential zone right so and it 's got existing youth rights as a hospital yeah so the alternative would be to say leave it as a hospital but its underlying zone would be residential that would be although yes we would have to come up with some full standards for it because we 've amended a lot of the other Hospital standards right there no longer appropriate but there 's the reason we 're here today is to decide with you whether you would like us to do that yeah just you know I 'm just saying they just given a number of issues in the big picture and what we 're wanting to focus on in terms hearings panel yeah just to let you know from a heads up on the submissions that I 've come through on the stage to the other side of be Leah Pegasus health you know the 24 eye clinic they 've come in asking for a hospital 's only because they 're saying they use it for the same kind of things and not be really hesitant about opening them up to a hospital zone as well given the whole idea is it 's just the larger sites you know that we 're really going to intensify in the future so I 'm just wondering if you know if we do it for lyndhurst what they 'll think you know about the other con but learn who 's already have do they know they do so that 's different and yes when you can 't fit Pegasus are likely to move from their current site don 't you think there might be another reason why they might be seeking that designation I said that mm-hmm what are they right next door to Wow yeah it 's called the Southern Cross bingo 's what 's going to happen but I 'm just saying maybe it 's a little bit better to take an approach that says what are we really focusing on here what could sidetrack and does it really matter in the bigger scheme of things when the underlying zone is the zone that you choose now yeah if they cease to use it for that yeah yeah so we 'll need some guidance on this when you pass your full recommendations if you 'd like to change that we can do that before it 's notify well I mean I 'm the one that 's kind of you know sort of playing devil 's advocate here does very well I mean we could we could just put up a quick amendment here that would resolve there because you 've got a risk what what recommendation number is it can you scroll down from the top please thank you no no there 'll be a recommendation and the big she are bigger patent right so is lyndhurst it 's page 101 yes yes recommendation 141 yep we would add in there that this rip return to a hospital ccc hospital know that we yeah that the that the lenders hospital site on montreal street remains owned as central city hospital zone yes agree with ministers yes okay wonder metamaterial whether it 's necessary to also indicate that there needs to be a rule package developed to reflected small scale and that an appropriate rules package be demoted five developed and notified and we will leave that in your capable hands okay um so there are a couple more matters that we didn 't run with came back from their commerce the first was that they wanted some of the rules to be repackaged to align with the designation so the designation that 's on the hospital site at the moment they 're building right up to the road boundaries essentially but we don 't quite know where this car park is going to go and effectively what they 've asked a long Rickett are now where we 've proposed a 10 meter set back from that road they wanted us to show in the designation that there 's just a four not gone for that is that a we don 't actually know where the the hospital whether new car parks going but also the whole point of a designation is that they can they can do what they want without having to align to the the rules of the zone and we 'd be unhappy to see a 10 meter a four meter setback along that area we think of 10 meters more appropriate so I mean we haven 't done that anywhere else in terms of putting Errol 's the same as a designation so we 're so that one sudden we took that 's in the report and then its recommendation 143 on page 105 143 so I 've got and I did I am getting glasses I 'll just you know wait just her just saying so the UM the area that 's hatched in black is where the designation lies on the hospital site so the area you can see a long riccarton ave that frontage there that 's they want us to to write that the the setback there is four meters and the rules back the reason we 've gone for 10 meters is because as a whole the hospital is going to be allowed to go up to 60 meters provided they meet some of the other built form standards and therefore a 10 meter setbacks a lot more appropriate yeah when you 've got that kind of scale of building potentially going in so this is really whether we make our rules align to to their designation Reggie and we 've got anything to talk about the way designations and the rules packages need to alone or that help sorry I 'm a little confused I don 't know why but what what are they allowed to do at the moment so at the moment under the proposed rules package we 're saying a 10 meter set back along the Riccarton Avenue you know what are they allowed to do at the moment under their designation yeah they can they can do they haven 't got to tell us what they want to do so they 're going to build a car parking building on that riccarton have frontage but we haven might sit so the reason they put the four meters but they want don 't quite know where that 's come from they 've asked for this for me to set back to ensure consistency with the existing car park designation yeah so are you sure that 's not over on with the green hitch where 's the car plaque building at the moment oh no it 's not there at the moment it 's a new one so in addition to the one that 's going to be replayed the acute services buildings going up the back of backing onto hagley park on at the front and that designation onto Rick 's and have is going to be a car parking building so it 's what you 're saying is by allowing them to amend at 24 meters across the car park that could then affect the amount of setback for the actual hospital buildings and reduce it from 10 meters to 4 meters right along that in holt that whole front of record and aired not just the black hatched area so that 's the concern yeah yeah become oh no the brutal sort of brown it fit is the yeah but the chapel 's next to it a few years you 're saying that you 're worried that it will bring the whole building for how could it possibly bring the whole build a lot in that area obviously so that they would just build around the slit all chapel do you are we worrying about something we don 't to worry about and Phil don 't know I just wondered if F in fact it 's reduced to four meters does that of does that affect say the foot the footpath as well in the area which council we have to work for our whole roadway including the footpath no not the footpath know it would be from the footpath back into the site except if there 's a huge building to you know straight in beside the footpath it must have some impede could be compromised an immunity at the surround hagley park is a little blood up to the road might not look that great to the car park right you know for me impact from the parkside tune and when they showed us the planes is this an impressive under the sea or the large of the setback with such a very high building not only is that an amenity issue but also there 's not that sense of all there 's not a shadow and it 's not the odometer is nori Aoki so is there why the team is a bitter alone to hold a freaky rabbi me now only there only seeking it on the bit that 's hatched black but yeah it 's whether we draw that on and it stays like that because you know the end of the day they can build they can build what they want on that designation there are rules don 't constrain them so it could be one that could be left open for mediations I 'm really confused because the minister 's comments specifically seeds reduce the team meet a setback to for me to step back from reckitt an avenue to ensure consistency with the existing car park designation but there isn 't a car park not a nation that car park which is not record on avenue no that 's right so are they planning to put a copper another car park builder on the site where the green with the black hatches yeah but it 's called acute services building designation says us but they 're putting a car park building and an acute services designation and then saturday would be a car park the point is because i don 't know but we had a chat to the dash because we take we had concerns we had people coming here about the concerns about what the interface between the park and the and the and the building would be and we met with the DHB and they were really open to having a conversation about how to you know minimize the visual impact on to sort of screen us and our loving and caring sort of way as you do with building interfacing with park trees and plantings and various other things and hence in stick back buildings and I mean we had a really good conversation dit hard to believe that they want to do something the frontage I spoke to the consent planner upstairs he 's been dealing with this and the latest plans she could show me it was some kind of undercroft car parking and then summit grade but that none of none of that was finalized so it wasn 't an enormous no it 's Eureka now you 've reminded me because the other cub ha car parking goes down with a lot of storage activities and it 's below ground leads me at a kind of visitor doesn 't because of the structure of the land and by the building scaled yeah the difficulty is that there isn 't a degree position yet they haven 't confirmed their outline design you might say so by putting this rule in it allows it to remain at 10 meters and potentially can be negotiated through mediations once i mostly does what what is it now 2 meters is what with with or suggest it now in the operatives man and the operative plan it 's four and a half meters so we 're extending we 're extending because we 're enabling them to of package for the hospital zone wider setbacks higher height limits but given that that 's so you just told me that there 's an existing requirement on four and a half meters under the opposite plan under the operative plane but it 's the first time that i 've heard there because we 've focused on parking but an actual fact they 're not talking about parking at all they 're talking about the building and they 're asking for the retention of their existing sit there that would yes i think that 's what their meaning here when they when they say to ensure consistency clear it but as you know we 're reviewing the district plan they 're wanting to go higher so we 've increased the he said no but I 'd really love it that you were sitting there saying and they 've agreed but they obviously haven 't and you know well they haven 't agreed because there isn 't a confirmed design plan yet no but that 's very open to having that conversation if they know these are sensitive interfaces I 'm I 've got a question from someone who lives on grace your dad it 's just come three to me why would it got to do with this Christchurch hospital is everything to do with it because the maximum height immense size being as to 18 meters six stories and I 've done some server via street and they will lose a son to seven months of the year I was talking about lund who 's to gain know that stretch of women of course I 'll crash it on us oh you know we 're on Christchurch hospital will come back like a woman 's right yeah i just heard the word hospital sorry and forwards is the labels right sorry um I just don 't know what to do with this we 're not just you know I just I just have this awful feeling that we 're ending up again Anna and a potential conflict situation which we could avoid but a little bit we could might I say though that the process for before these even get to hearings as we are encouraged by the independent can so that will reduce the number of issues that do actually go do you know how much this is costing the counts at least I do but potentially it 's whether or not we want some certainty in there to allow it to remain open to debate these issues and to negotiate them through mediation or whether you would like it till it would like to let it go and just remain consistent with the current existing operative plan I 'd love to know what what the general view was with the arm dhb hmm or do people generally happy to notify that the 10 10 meters all right well it may end up back here all right carry on okay so the final one is that they we have a rule where any buildings with a footprint over a thousand square meters that 's the gross ground floor area they need to get a consent and the reason that we 've asked that is because of the impact of I mean that build that could be a 50 x 20 meter building is quite significant the impact of 've asked us to delete that that rule obviously we 're quick bit concerned about that the sites aren 't that big in terms of you know the overall scale we 're not talking to burwood size site so the impact of a thousand is is pretty large and like to keep that one in can I ask about so integration you can terms the surrounding environment surrounding environment also how it works on the site as well that 's pretty fundamental to me yeah I think so for me something we 've already gone with in the stage to stuff so the hospital sites outside the central city have got this rule in them I think we have to keep it well I 'm just the only thing that I 'm worried about is is that what the overarching desire to just blend us into the entire plan is is that you know what 's a requirement under the central city recovery plan which went through a completely different process than this then becomes really the rule throughout the city and it hasn 't been a very good it example because they don 't get a say over what the central city recovery plan hairs and it but I guess that 's this that 's how it is ya know what I mean I think that yeah I mean some of these hospitals do they do and the residential areas have a major unpair yeah can we go back to year crush each woman 's necrosis Mossad are allowed to build up to a maximum of 18 meters and the residents of grace what our are very concerned because they 've done a survey of 18 meters and how that would impact the street and they would lose the Sun through that winter period about seven months royal on the street Nathan was built to that full height so that 's why the setbacks apply at the residential boundary as well as the street boundary that 's why we increase the size of this is max any have you done a suit do you understand we had an urban design modeling done for each of these hospital sites to look at those very issues so it 's been a them intensify the use of the sites and provide for more but it was before I mean how many stories was crash which one month five stories it was for a five-story talk I suppose what it could mean though is that maybe maybe they 've got used to not heritage mode maybe they 've got used to not having a high building a baby nothing like a Porsche that isn 't something that came through in the minister 's comments about the height provisions changing or anything nice so we can 't we can 't change that now and its existing use rights on that site us or not yes it would be yeah so they would apply for a resource consent and that would be I mean they yeah and not they last for 12 months that 's right that they have a period within which if it 's not a continuous use you know then they do let 's yeah but there are there have been extensions to that I 'm post-earthquake I believe you 're right yes right okay so those were the main ones yep that are in the big pages or are they all generally quite a little smaller ones just know wearing tweaks and things okay now that 's fine so people generally happy that we proceed all right thank you very much what 's the next element CCC live in zone living wrong _"

    "text": "I 'm just interested in exploring a little bit further on page 51 the relationship between demolition and deconstruction and rebuilding because we did have and we 're proposing to take out the words demolition includes deconstruction and rebuilding I would have expected from a heritage point of view something which is demolished or deconstructed and then rebuild would no longer necessarily be a heritage item so if we looked at that in terms of maybe the time ball station in Littleton for example there is deconstruction has already taken place and the rebuild will hopefully occur and if when that happens the the item will be a reconstruction but will essentially be a replica rather than a heritage item and we could relate this to the cathedral of course at least in part as well so I 'm quite concerned to see this definition of demolition including deconstruction to rebuild been taken out unless that 's picked up somewhere else that gives a similar level of protection because you know deconstruction is demolition regardless of what 's intended afterwards and the heritage fabric of the building is destroyed as can speak to the actual technicalities of the definition maybe Brendan about the particulars from here to the point of view but but the change to that dim and definition was to say that it does include deconstruction and its relation it 's relative to whether it 's a substantial significant element of demolition and but it we have taken out the the rebuilding aspect of it so that deconstruction parts actually still within the definition it 's just further up at the start of the definition but the rebuilding is that 's a different activity so that would be a need to be reflective for instance as an alteration for which consent would be required though the protections afforded to a heritage building with these changes in place are not diluted in any way the protection and do you mean overall look for a particular type of activity so when we look at the changes to wording which are proposed in this document the effects of those changes doesn 't make it any easier to demolish a heritage item regardless of whether the purpose of demolition is just to all of the protections that were in our original draft remain in place after these changes have occurred yes that 's correct so the diff the policy for demolition remains the same to avoid demolition the activity status remains the same if non-compliant and the essentially the definition has been improved it 's sort of a technical point ready to to say demolition doesn 't actually in code rebuilding so it 's still got that strength I react to it no that 's fine i 'm happy with that Thank You Barry just carry I 'll match the cells did you want anything further on that under floor because I mean we could clarify there are many instances where we 're dismantling careful dismantling of a building taking the building apart storing it temporarily and then putting it back together you 're still using the same fabric of the building and I 'm quite often you have to tape linings off you have to remove windows you have to take floors up but so long as you can do that and put back predominantly the original material obviously you will as demolition that 's that 's part of getting into the bones of the building to do the repairs so and that 's something we 've we 've been doing well you do it generally with buildings yep all right so that adds to a greater level of comfort than i had when i first read this that 's that 's fine thank you i guess i 'm curious with it three shoulders I 've seen one proposal over the cathedral where does actually involve taking it down to considerably so we 're a who is that trigger and ending what 's built back is actually a replica not with instructions it it is it is there 's a fine line obviously between between the percentages that you 're dealing with but most most of the time in my experience we 're dealing with more of the building being retained originally in its original position and just components that you have to to take away in order to to strengthen the building or create better servicing of the building internally so yeah each each case is different and and the an extraction of original material and keep everything in place but sometimes you just have to accept that there will be quite a substantial removal of original material and I suppose the Town Hall is a good example of that where in order to to the ground works you 've got to take a lot of the building apart but it 's all being stored it all go back in there any more questions on the Heritage otherwise we could move to the trees topic which is the final topic for chapter 9 on with the trees okay so Maurice and let 's go is going to talk through the key highlights and you can go thank you um yes there 's we are in um recommendation number 79 you 33 a recommendation number 79 actually the ministers have only one one recommendation in this some significant resection and that is to delete the rules relating to trees in road corridors parks reserves and public open space we do have this schedule of significant trees which lists the significant trees only on private land now we have proposed this new are the street trees the trees in the road corridor excluding the central city parks reserve end of public open space now the reason that the minister 's recommended made this recommendation is first is that they said there 's no threshold significance second is it is contrary to the sections of in section 76 for a of the RMA and third is that the trees are able to be protected by reserve management plans or asset management plans now with their first reason we have used height as a threshold for significance in protecting trees and according to our Council arborists by the time a tree which is six meters high street trees between like 20 and 30 years old and a park trees between 17 and 20 years old now this represents a significant investment by the council already in maintaining these trees it is not the intention of the council to protect the shrub borders or hedges in parks which may have reached 6 metres in height so it is proposed in the for the trees in parks reserves and open spaces to protect them those that council 's position is not contrary to section 7 64 a of the RMA because this rule only applies to what is called the urban environment allotments and those the public spaces open space and parks and reserves do not fall under that definition and also about the trees that are able to be protected by reserve management plans and asset management plans many of the parks many of our parks are not reserves under the reserve management act so not all have research reserve management plans and even if we do have some reserve management plans they do not protect all the trees in the parks it 's not it 's not enough to protect them so it is we considered appropriate to have three protection rules in the district plan for an independent decision maker to consider and assess the range of adverse effects for the removal of and damage of trees to any tree greater than 6 meters in height in a road corridor or 10 meet excluding central city or 10 meters in height in a park reserve or public open space so that 's the do not accept to delete the rules as councils position is to protect these trees there are other two points that we 've made here I don 't know if they 're they 're just minor if you want me to go through them they 're just a policy regarding to for better clarity and also that is recommendation number 80 that 's the rewriting of two policies and then recommendation 81 is just updating section 31 page 59 and 60 you have you have any questions on significant trees all of chapter 9 I suppose the only one thing I don 't know if you need to capture that and the set of resolutions but there was a particular point I made about that little bit of ongoing work to just add those dimensions to the Heritage aerial maps not just not for every single here heritage aerial map but there 's a so hopefully that 's captured within the overall recommendations but I just want to flag that for your consideration _"

    "text": "we 'll get back into the enter the session and the next chapter that we are dealing with is natural and cot natural and cultural heritage so if you could name the page on the big page what 's the pages on the big pages it 's chapter 9 and all your chapters should be in your miracle a page number and the page number and the fixed sheet is starting on page 39 drop in the table okay good afternoon and so captain I natural cultural heritage I just quickly run through the documentation hang on hang on hang on we 've got district and review stage 3 which ships on nine what so forth what what chapter nine natural and cultural heritage for each other that 's the minister 's comments it 's four point seven point seven it 's our pages 7 and 8 and chapter nine he has paid disseminating the report the cover and report check tonight at denying that 's correct natural and cultural heritage so the package of material that makes up Captain I know the the actual planning provisions so I 'm so would you like me to talk through what their checked it entails and at section 32 material just briefly yep so we 've got those stage three okay would you would you like what it does except that I mean this yeah this is the last time that we 're going to do this so the trouble was is that I mean I I don 't like this any more than anyone else does but that we 're all of the documents that we have to look at at the moment it 's hard to look at them on a screen because there 's several different documents so you 've got the the summary of the comments of the ministers on the that the council report and its pages 7 a-9 of that report you 've got the comments by the minister the actual for comments themselves are on page start at page 34 of the minister 's comments and you 've got Stage three proposal the council final approval chapter 9 and stage 3 for council final approval section 30 okay okay but this is the main document the just just so we 're clear the see all the section 32 the supporting rationale documentation is the books it on the table over there and the other samay section 32 the planning reporting in a lot of appendices of the expert analysis yep and the chapter 9 just to reiterate from prior meetings includes the checkbook provisions and but also you 'll be aware there 's a set of schedules it go with chapter nine so that 's a list for instance all the schedule trees here are two items yo and they 're like and something to alert you to as well that the ministers have commented on chapter 13 central city in a clear recommendation for the whole natural and cultural heritage proposal is that it is dealt with within chapter nine instead of with in chapter 13 central city am with in chapter nine so that is covered off in a specific recommendation okay so I 'm just to introduce TV Hogan and I 'm Caroline rekelen and we have other planners and experts available today to help answer questions now so I 'd like areas and topics 9.1 29.4 relative to this chapter and I could just introduce some common themes to start off with about clarity of wording direction and the policies improved drafting and structure there 's some general sort of themes that flow throughout the all of the topic areas including to the definitions in for instance and more precision around some of the mapping and yes so I think it 's probably best to just get straight into the first topic which do is going to be speaking to and that starts on page 39 of the officer recommendations table alright so on top of geary on dealing with is indigenous biodiversity and ecosystems so it 's listed as 9.1 of chapter 9 and as caroline indicated the minister 's had a number of comments about this part of the chapter it was really about clarification of sites of ecological significance and how they differ from what is currently turned as other indigenous vegetation that may exist around the city and may have significant significance values with the net and so in response to the minister 's comments there has and i 'll just i 'll just pick out the the key points really am starting with the definition of other indigenous vegetation and the ministers had some concerns about this definition it 's quite a long winded definition that comes it 's been carried across from the banks peninsula district plan and the way it worked in the previous version was yeah it was a definition setting the definition chapter and you referred to that you had to go to that chapter to see whether or not you qualified as what does was classed as other indigenous vegetation enough that triggered the need for a resource consent so the ministers weren 't happy with that and had some concerns that have missed out a number of significant factors across in terms of indigenous vegetation so what the key changes was this as deleting that definition in integrating it into the rules within the chapter so in terms of the recommendation that relates to this its recommendation 45 on page 41 of your a three attachments who and which outlines the recommendation and the reasoning for that and then I wish to see what has happened to that but essentially it 's the definitions being slim down and converted into rules within the district plan such that it provides some simplification the rule is upfront for people to see and it 's quite clear that if you trigger that you need a clearance of any type of vegetation within that those vegetation types you will need a resource consent now as a result of that there has to be some other restructuring of the rooms with them this part of the chapter and once again that that is has actually simplify simplify fan and clarified the rules so it 's made them a lot easier to read and it 's clearly defined between if you 're in a site of ecological significance is a number of things that are permitted that will not think those significance values once you go beyond those you will need a resource consent likewise for areas outside of what 's defined as other indigenous vegetation once you go beyond what 's permitted you wolves at regular resource consuming so in terms of just some general so that 's on pages 42 and 45 unfortunately there 's no easy way to explain some of these recommendations because they 've all entered they all intersect with each other and in response to one recommendation that that 's resulted in a number of changes but hopefully this is the best way to do to outline the key changes for you it was exactly that we 've we 've removed a definition inserted into the roles tidied up simplified and strengthen the policy framework and that 's that 's what we 've done and is that going to be generally acceptable to you know the government officials when you appear in front of the hearings panel yes we actually worked with Department of Conservation and trying to actually understand a lot of their comments and worked with them to try and reach some sort of middle ground as to what they believed was would would be workable and we haven 't quite gone fully towards agreeing with them totally but I think what is there is definitely an improvement on the previous version and is quite clear and to trying to do with indigenous biodiversity okay all right so that 's where are we which recommendation now does that how many recommendations is that a project so it covers recommendation is 42 254 so that takes you through to page 46 okay let 's go to page 46 then were there any more questions on indigenous biodiversity and ecosystems then I 'm sorry Ellie this isn 't the place to ask it because this relates to inertia we 're dealing with kept Tony scream at the moment I know this will come after will this essentially strengthen then the requirements of say for the sake of argument in GTA putting in or widening roads into an area that has biodiversity significance or cultural significance will it strengthen the requirements for them to address those compared to the situation we have at the moment generally speaking only in the instance if it triggers one of these rules relating to clearance of indigenous vegetation don 't_''_786.29 so so it relates to yeah clearance of vegetation but not as that 's really my pic well that will then get picked up by stronger than the co-operative 10 now and specifically in relation to Ward ways or just it 's probably a question it check the list and son team yep yep theme thank you this might be neither here nor there but we have a biodiversity strategy this is something that like colony has wanted to really promote further so is this you know what are the implications of this for that piece of work the council is it to this shouldn 't shouldn 't inhibit achieving those goals and objectives of that strategy this is about under the Resource Management Act a particular requirement to protect areas of significant indigenous vegetation and habitat significant fauna now to be significant they have to go through an assessment in that criteria sits in the regional policy statement so once an area has gone through an assessment in text the box for significant in it can be identified in the district plan and those are essentially i guess you describe them as the jewels in the crown whether the highest level of protection and then whatever the binder is the strategy wants to achieve things like that so it 's part of the big picture I 'm just trying to interpret what it means to remove that definition whether it would serve to undermine no no it doesn 't all right moving right along okay unfix IBM the next topic is the the landscapes topic and it starts on page 46 of your officer recommendations so I think in summary for the section 9.2 speed work in response to the minister 's comics and particularly around improving structure and the clarity and simplification and for instance the number of tables that which the rules forward then have been cut back to just three tables previously it was fourth in our based around whether it 's feature is outstanding or significant or natural character in the coast previously it was geographically based and also um yes some the policies as in roles as clear line of sight between the directions sort and how they 're going to be managed so that was there but it 's been it has been improved so in terms of key recommendations there are quite a number of recommendations but like to to sort of drill down into some of the others then um I 'll be guided by you on that and so the first one recommendation 55 as was from the minister 's to clarify the difference between the various overlays and considered consolidation of these where they have similar retreat implications and where a distinction is maintained and sure this is clearly reflected in the rules oki oki officer recommendation here has been to restructure this part of the chapter by landscape classification as identified in the three objectives which are outstanding natural features and landscapes and the other two that identified under the officer recommended revision of wording on page 46 in the policies have been amended to follow the structure and consolidate the house for how to manage and group specific activities together under the policies the one policy so on the next page 47 57 was this was a key concern I think from the minister 's about removing the detailed descriptive text about qualities and threats from the policies and include this information and an appendix with cross-referencing and policies and rules and what the values of the the qualities of the landscapes are or each of the different one was than the policy framework is apply an appendix so the recommendation is to retain the existing structure however we have found steps to reduce some of the length and repetition within that so that improves the the way that that reads our recommendation 58 the next one down was to review the rules to a ensure there is a clear and appropriate link between the activity status of an activity 3 ship poses in the limit of the scoby I mean if you did what they asked would that affect the actual meaning of the document and what would happen is that the the those values or qualities would be sitting in an appendix yeah but a bit make them unenforceable oh sorry yet I wouldn 't say that they would be unenforceable but the way that it structures it there clearly out front within the policy so they have very very strong and directive lee but the ministers have asked us to put them appendix so tell me what would that happen if you put them in the appendix and I I couldn 't comment legally as to exactly the waiting that they would be given and I think possibly they would still have strong wait or near equal weight however I think actually are clearly articulate them in the policies as as a preferred option it 's the option i 've been pursuing it 's still considered to be an appropriate option but it 's not what we are being asked to do we 've been asked to take into account the minister 's comment so i want to know whether following their comments would somehow weaken our district plan but which i 'm hearing it won 't and so if it won 't why don 't we just do what they ask and then we won 't have an argument so the steps that have been taken him so the qualities as i read now have been shortened in length and some tightening of wording so they read a lot more succinctly and it 's yeah you could do it either way but i would recommend it they are us not to accept their advice so I 'd kind of like a little bit stronger reason for not following their advice than we think it would be better useful and the officer reasons here it 's about visibility having them directly visible as you read in conjunction and yeah I may not disagree with you but there 's not the question you 're going to be asked in front of the independent hearings panel and we can seek some theatre legal advice for you on that today I 'll ask somebody to pursue that with our legal counsel if you like yeah well I mean if it 's if it 's no big deal yes I understand why have an argument about something that I think part of the issue and trying to take the pressure off project that I understand do I understand yeah and also we get from the independent hearings panel at times you know whether it is certain whether it 's clear but this is what needs to be taken into consideration and if it 's hinde in an appendix then that also has some that well I mean the other option is as to as to as to do this but then offer up the appendix offering is you know like so in mediations we could oh no no but actually prepare the appendix as if that was right you know and so that you could sort of have it there as a kind of a look with we 've got a preference for this but you know the council 's not going to die on a Dutch over we 've prepared the alternative which is the appendix with cross-referencing we have that available to you we 've put it up here because we think that we 've now managed to you know reduce it in length and and therefore address probably what was your real concern which look was that there was too much detail in there yep but with but you know if it is what you want then we 've got it ready to go it 's just that I 'd hate to have any time waste of debating something that just doesn 't matter and indeed what what you 're go into informal mediation you know we put up revised chapters where it could be considered one way or the other however there there may be other interests of submissions and this chapter who consider it should be in the policies for the reasons that we 've discussed but take on board while you 're saying we have bigger fish to fry yeah some recommendation 58 was to review the rules about ensuring there 's clear and appropriate link between activity status of an activity through two poses and the level of significance of the area affected and consolidate the rules for activities requiring similar treatment across different areas so that has been largely accepted as you can see under the officer recommendation with the mix of landscape classification geographic areas set out again under the outstanding natural feature and landscape grouping the significant features and landscape grouping in the natural character and the coast so people clearly know if I 'm in one of those categories I go to that our chapter this is a very interesting article written by one who 's the guy on the in Littleton that his back lawn was a natural landscape or something significant natural landscape and there 's one more recommendation of a significant level and the landscapes topic which are drawing attention to is the recommendation of the ministers which was to amend so every and it relates to officer recommendations 60 on page 48 which was to amend policy to Eclair to amend the policies stated to clarify that the assessment identified and the policy is to guide future to be completed rather than to be used an assessment of resource consents so this relates to future identification of lens scopes and this particular policy related to doing future identification and it 's been reworked edge need to clearly state that it 's about cultural landscapes and by the council 's commitment to work with a terminar anotar who in perpetuity ruining her to develop a approach around developing cultural landscapes yet so that also ties into the historic heritage section of this chapter your end and a yes just something to signal as well in conjunction with it for the historic heritage chapter there is also future a commitment the ruin an afore ye taboo why he chalice and it 's clearly sitting out there and I guess an overall comment for this chapter as well that there will be a need to do future plan change work to bring about further listings in the future yeah so they were the key kind of ones I 'd raised about the landscape topic I don 't know whether you want to go through any of the others or go straight to the historic heritage topic 9.3 what I I don 't mind what what two people have you just proceed yep okay and so if you turn to page 50 and the comment there at the first gray box now that 's um relates to recommendation 166 and that 's actually that was actually within the chapter 13 central city about applying comments made with respect to i think it was meets that were meant to say chapter nine apply them in conjunction with chapter 13 so there was a series of comments made about chapter 13 has start carriage and they 've been considered in conjunction with chapter nine you read it through so in summary the the minister 's comments really asked for a stronger reflection of I think of the recovery context for heritage buildings places and to if I could sort of paraphrase the comments 2 mor more clearly articulate that within the policy framework in the rules and so they have been redrafted to their effect on to the extent that officers sinkers necessary and for instance one of the policies directly references the extent of damage incurred from the Canterbury earthquakes another another key point was more clearly articulating why there are two heritage groups for heritage items and settling so Group one high significance and group two significant so there 's a number of recommendations and that chapter and to draw your attention to as well and so on page 50 and recommendation 66 was too now this is the effectively the catch-all delete from draft proposal 13 general provisions that we 're within that check that they 're also related to other proposals so with the real officer recommendation as the provisions for natural and cultural heritage rests directly under Chapter nine started back into chapter nine and then it on the next page page 51 recommendation 58 and there was a set of recommendations relating to the rules the definitions clarity for plan users in removing unnecessary restrictions to enable recovery I won 't read out the detail of all of them but you 've got that there and so there have been a number of amendments to some of the Heritage definitions as described in that table and I think we 'll come on to them when we get to the definitions fiction of the of the chapters I could draw your attention to an example for instance the alteration of a heritage item has been amended for clarity also for instance the definition of heritage upgrade works and also as a to highlight there in terms of reducing consenting as under point for on that table here to upgrade works the amendment is to include the provision for temporary relocation of a heritage item to allow for recovery works related to ground foundation retaining wall remediation so that 's actually been a change in activity status from restrictive discretionary but still enables a a good level of control for the council around that type of work on the next page recommendation 69 and relates to five of the minister 's comments this primarily relates to the type of activity for heritage buildings which is reconstruction and the minister 's requested that the Svea controlled activity and some associated comments recommendations around there about the definition that would be associated with that though the officer recommendation there amongst a few others is that the provisions are amended so that reconstruction of a heritage item as a controlled activity status at the moment it would be as proposed it would have been a restrict discretionary status so it 's considered an appropriate level of control that that type of activity would thought to be a good outcome but there 's an there is a need for the council to inform how that occurs and put potentially put some conditions around it as well so on the next page page 53 recommendations 721 so concerns were raised about the Heritage items in setting aerial maps these are the large a three maps they raised concerns about that they should be checked for robustness for accuracy and that they should be indicative only so if you turn over the page to page 54 the office of recommendation there is that the aerial maps are not amended to become indicative and that just a I guess explain what they are and I do have a Mentos visa here to senior advisor here as well if we have any questions on the detail but those MEPs outline we are here to the outline of a heritage building but also the outline of the Heritage stating that it 's important because rules are triggered with respect to either in activity is proposed to the heritage building or within its setting for instance a new building so officers would recommend that those they are not indicative they 're actually lines on the met when they form part of the plan however what officers have done is check them for inaccuracies robustness taken steps for instance to improve the usability in certainty by adding the property boundaries onto those maps and we would also become request it there ongoing work from here to notification to add some dimensions on to a few of the Heritage maps for instance to say from this point to this point it 's a six-metre dimension we are not easily read from the aerial map as it stands so and there would be a specific recommendation that 's Lecter 's and the table they 're going down from there on page 54 and this links back to the comment I made at the start about having a clearer rationale for why there are two heritage groups and in summary the policy framework and the rules have been amended to reflect that most distinctly at the policy level and also in the matters of control in the metis of discretion and in a small change in one of the roles but it 's predominantly at the policy Direction level the medical profession in on page 55 there is a change to actually have a slightly higher level of control for one of the types of work such a heritage investigative work so recommending that for group 1 heritage buildings it 's actually a control page 56 recommendation 75 was to add policies recognizing the need to recognize and provide for earthquake recovery seismic and building code upgrades adaptive use reconstruction and to reflect the continuous data recovery and the minister 's actually asked us to consider some more consistency with some of the policies and the operative plan for the central city so the recommendation there is to actually amend the policy which directly provides for the ongoing viable use of heritage items and settings to directly refer to damages resulting from the earthquakes so as you can see in the revised wording there there 's a sentence edible part sentence added on about including recognizing the extent of damage so it has become day-to-day work for the Heritage team and for the planet of work and a post earthquake recovery context but we have certainly taken on board that recommendation to more clearly articulate that and so that can be managed through the reasons consent processes and then the final quite a one-eyed highlights as on page 57 recommendation 78 about reducing regulation but only where it is appropriate to do so and effects that it 's actually one of the high level recommendations so I 've talked to you through a couple of the shifts and activity status with the decrease and control lordkin Sentinel reconstruction when it 's going to be controlled as opposed to restricted discretionary I 've talked you through one other one to do a theater investigative groups for group 1 and 1 year to signal is for signage actually what officers would seek is that there is an ability to notify applications for science as opposed to having a non specifying and non notification clause yes so that 's that 's the set of key ones i highlight I don 't know if you want to take any quick have any questions or particular and so the the way that the heritage and I might ask Amanda to come up so the way that the heritage provisions have been drafted is to make to give a good level of protection a high level of protection around heritage but also to enable day-to-day sort of work to adapt buildings to enable ongoing use and I think the way at what other sort of land-use activities need to occur and how they could occur and making sure that that they tie in well with the Heritage context and the need to protect the Heritage places that would be subject to that in the future sorry what steve sara who are responsible for putting in the bus interchange the baby they 'd be subject to the same requirements too and i 'm not familiar with the particular case that you 're referring to but if something fell within a heritage place or a seating in these controls would would apply this regardless of ownership yeah there 's a shelter going adjacent to hinder trinity trinity church in Chen 's Emporium building which is just going to be moved there I mean what won 't_''_2206.0 the situation there is that you 've got a building it 's a boundary issue basically you 've got building this that 's right up next to the or proposed to go right up next to thee to the boundary of the road and the road is also being used by the public for the boss 're trying to do is to negotiate that the the super stop is moved slightly further down the road the problem is yes that the if you are going to build up to the road boundary you 're potentially going to have a conflict with anything that 's built in the road and these are these are structures in the road that you 're the super stopped you have to you have to have I suppose some degree of flexibility in your planning to anticipate that there will be a potential structure in the road and I suppose the r is still flexibility in the plans to pull hands back slightly so that it doesn 't conflict with any structure in the road but there is a little bit of both pull the building bit rather than they the building isn 't in its final location at the moment it 's it 's notionally planned to to sit in a particular part of the site and ideally it would be it would be up to the road frontage because that 's where the building was prior to thee to the to the road boundary but but we we do have to kind of take into account that there may be structures and also trees in the road reserve which we have got no control over or the private individual has got no control over so there 's not really a lot we can do there will be some conflict can I just add in terms of the settings and how those have been met in some instances we have gone into Road reserved for the settings for example the bridge of remembrance you 'll see if you look at the map we do include the road in front of the bridge of remembrance to protect views and relationships in effect there but we haven 't done it consistently for all our building say in the central city we haven 't consistently included the foot part but if we did that would cover off the editor protect from shelters vision highest so in fact to get any real sore visual protection for that run teacher to say in fact these probably aren 't strong enough yes so um where is whether so it would depend what size of what is being proposed and whether it triggers a consent requirement I think it so as a balance so trying to make sure that there 's enough sort of protection about views and how things connect or a scene together with a heritage building but also about allowing for these day to day activities to occur but that would be if nice if the reasons can sit when needed that 's the type of thing that will be considered through the process ok thank you because clearly it would be great shame if impact because of the bus shelter which we all want if the trendy Cheapside was to be obscured won 't be the Trinity Church such it is going to be the champion yeah and probably that that wasn 't anticipated when they and design me the way I explained here _"

    "text": "which really go over the top of all of these actual chapters that we looking at today and many of those high-level recommendations simply refer to these more specific recommendations on each chapter anyway and they they relate to the statement of expectations or counsel having particular regard to the minister 's comments and clarity and consistency so we should be looking at the high level recommendations perhaps we can do that at the end of the day and make sure that we take those recommendations across all of our chapters this is my punishment for the over speaking the deputy me earlier I didn 't get my cup of coffee nevermind nevermind somebody else will tell you here at me I 'm sure do you wish to take coffee breaks I think it 's I don 't know no no no no we will have a coffee break and I might get Jamie to take over the chair for the next chapter but I 'd like to get this chapter dealt with before we before we break so and I know that 's putting up very late but I so um so what is the what is the motion that we need to have on the floor in order to debate it it was raised earlier that you would like to move them one by one so potentially and the general recommendations I have up there we can just say approval for proposal number kaput approval for chapter five does everyone want to do them one by one or do you want to do this one boats and you don 't care about the risk so I mean no that 's not true that you don 't care about the reefs but they you don 't mind about the risk being dealt with them block so if we can if we can get a general sign off on this one but we 'll do this one separately so we are going to in relation to the natural hazards chapter five aged two or three whatever it is back to part two we 're going to agree to receive the minister 's comments what will go back up can you can we go back up and just cut and paste make any changes to the draft recommendations officers have made approve the recommendation to work so do you just need 6.1 6.2 is it right devour you do need sorry six point one two three and four you before we can deal with gimli okay link yes ok and then 6.5 is the actual chapter itself approving it to go out for notification okay so 6.5 so copy and paste so is that enough for natural hazards receipt receives the minister 's Comet and just put natural hazards early on two years natural hazards part 2 natural hazards part 2 just put on the top yeah natural hazards part to receive the minister 's comments in her particular regard to them approved the staff recommendations and response to minister 's comments found on the draft recommendations table as amended approve the recommendations table incorporating any changes made by counsel as the report summarizing the council 's response and reasons to the muscles comments to be provided to the ministers before notifying the provisions and approve the draft stage 3 proposes chapter 5 is take off the ears yep chapter yep do you need definitions and appendices for this yes yeah and section 32 and section 32 document yes with any amendments according to 6.22 we haven 't made at the station we 're just holding our open from going out because who oh oh hang on oh I 'll have a look in a minute and I prove the draft so that sorry what it says 6.2 16.4 but we haven 't got 6.4 so because that 's the minor amendments yeah so just take that any mean that 's according to 6.2 above as proposals for notification on 25 July 2015 well I 'm happy to move that do I have a seconder for that our poor lonsdale so any discussion this wants them through the clarification on does this refer to you know 4.79 on the printed in the report I mean some of those comments on you know it 's all another section that we coming to on cranford bass in there a minister 's comments on it and there is room in here yes we are only dealing with for ages 14 to in here of document that we 've been going through it only deals for chapter 5 so here are here in the documents we are dealing with the covering document four point seven point three we are dealing with chapter five natural hazards proposal for counsel final approval chapter five natural hazards part 2 and the stage 3 section 32 for counsel final approval chapter 5 natural hazards part 2 which we are amending with the recommendations that we are about to adopt that are in the big table are we clear thank you okay right so are there any is there any discussion on the resolution yes David Wright deal with me look it 's no no real secret that I hold differing viewpoints on of hazard management matters generally predicated on many years of experience of with our coastline and a keen interest in coastal and aquatic matters these have been a lifetime interest where principal focus of my and where the principal focus of my degree in geography and geology some people may think on the climate change denier and perhaps at times I may convey that image however I about one to one-and-a-half metres millimeters per year for the past century in my opinion climate change is influenced by a number of natural phenomenon not just the influence of man post-industrial age and I have a strong concern read the reliance on computer modeling based analysis and question the science that is developing our position on coastal methods particularly those related to coastal erosion and consequential coastal inundation here throughout history planet Earth has experienced significant fluctuations in temperature sea level and atmospheric composition there are many variables that drive planet change notable levers are astronomical ie the position of Earth at any particular time and galactic cycles learn the positioning relative to earth and now there is the obvious influence interestingly geological carve analysis carbon analysis indicates that there was more carbon in the atmosphere in Roman times and is currently present in their atmosphere is therefore quite evident in my mind bandar death is going through yet another cyclic all period of warming and cooling even in the past decade we experienced a period of cooling and sea level rise is not very much from the trends of how long the current warming process may last however there have been minor fluctuations up and down since 1997 LAN levels have generally lowered in Christ post earthquakes over Mars most of the city apart from against the port hills and the southern end the spit where uplift has occurred to that in many areas have experienced sea level rise already the greatest impact has been in the avon river mouth and the well and around the bexley wetlands we 're flooding and coastal inundation maps will generally concur although our coastline is lower than level that our June system is a full advancing see wood and we show no sign and a lot of focus on the science behind the development of coastal hazard arosen zones in coastal hazard inundation zones these proposed zones are based on computer modeling carried out by Tolkien and Taylor I had experience of modeling carried out by talking to Taylor in relation to wave run-up in conjunction with resource consent hearings hope heights in the 1990s a few years after the consenting conditions were approved the model was proved to be faulty or minus thirty percent the height of sand dunes with Saturday meters and now the generally accepted safe height to provide protection against tsunami surge is five to six meters I 've yet to meet with Tonkin and Taylor to gain any confidence in the data and modeling the acceptance of this report although peer review choir reputed peer reviewer but one of similar ideological thinking has huge ramifications on planning and mitigating works and is important to be for them to be absolutely confident in the resulting outcomes there are many and varied opinions when it comes to climate change and associated sciences for as many scientists who would argue that sea level will rise to extreme levels there are equally a number are very conservative I am concerned that we continually use tonkin and Taylor and do not seek any advice from scientists that may have our conservative or contrary we are an accreting coastline the creeping at significant rates in recent years has also been increased concern about the frequency of extreme weather events these continue to be their continued number of these and the consequence of Waimakariri river will correspondingly increase and the impact on calculations for coastal erosion I know then the peer review report the comment the sediment budget and brackets input to system calculation is very general but probably the best week that can be achieved with the nation used and in brackets the knee were 1998 report on I emphasize in 1998 how can we be confident in a computer model that cannot possibly impact estimate impact of increased sediment accurately and within reasonable margins of error I am reminded of a quote I can 't remember who it is attributed to but assumptions should be reasonable and evidence-based 1995 hearing on wave runner also raised issues around the invisibility of experienced local knowledge and that matter has been to the tortalus today ongoing as a matter of great concern as to have a considerable amount of local knowledge and experience can be recognized and given equal consideration in determining and in determining and outcome particularly in projects where there is high community interest and often considerable angst feet a bit often trotted out the mentor of Ken 's in the freak in hindsight it 's probably most appropriate the wisdom of the people far exceeds the knowledge of the experts it was my intention therefore to vote against the approval of the hazard chapters of the district plan going to the intervention hearings pedal subsequent notification on July the 26th I 've already voted against previous chapters being sent to the independent panel and will be consistent in my opposition I do so because I have grave concerns about the science involved that has determined coastal has it arosen zones that in turn affect coastal hazard inundation perhaps the more important reason for my opposition to new zoning and process which it has arisen is for the people who live in the communities the zoning planning repair rebuild options have huge implications for these people costs could be huge and insurance companies may view these areas in a different light all of the variables but that may arise will have a significant bearing on their lifestyle some local people would even go as far as saying it 's a covert method of closing down parts of the city we are now similarly subject to future coastal erosion and inundation processes but that received positive treatment as opposed to their area that gets a perceived negative dispassionate appraisal interestingly we are happy for a school to remain open although it could be in long-term and a coastal inundation area and schools on higher ground close we need to be signaling messages of learn to live with water messages of adaptive planning evaluating climate change over shorter periods and adapting if required as we go I am encouraged by drop work and the resilience strategy of the city oops are putting people boots and recovery strategies I am less convinced about the robustness of computer modeling upon which we base the planning of our coastline ultimately how it affects long-standing communities and their redevelopment our coastline is an area of the city that has constantly been underfunded underappreciated and undervalued for decades it 's time to change the negativity for this part of the city into positivity and realize the huge potential sadly at this moment I do not think there 's an appetite to achieve this and I will be striving to plan to live in adapt progressively to any change in their environment that a course occurs in a positive and responsive manner regrettably I 'm also quite sure that once its report is released there will be a tremendous outpouring of concern from coastal residents there was sufficient against proposed earnings and the science behind them of a proportion that I believe has not been seen before a Christchurch thank you for your indulgence thank you very much and I think it 's excellent that we debate meters of such significance in a respectful way so thank you Phil um I to majored in job at the University probably started my papers and geography before David dead and but have completed some postgraduate Papers as well and I think what 's important is that despite here earlier training and experience and affect our role here is one of governance and and hearing the science that i have had present to me I have to say I 've been highly impressed I was particularly impressed by the science which was presented to us by khosla scientists from a geography department at with the environmental coastal engineering which we had when we had the presentations of ëem and I 've been similarly impressed today for example when we had the presentation in relation to the information that is going to go out to the people who live in close your jeast and I did not find that I think the way that the messaging which we the way we are communicating with our local people is far from a motive it is actually based on facts and evidence and the best evidence we have what is important is it in fact an impressive is that the evidence we have around coastal science is joined up with the other part with the other dynamics which have had our city posted during the earthquake in post-earthquake there 's no question around sea level rise except perhaps for a very very few we hardly any scientists who would really debate that now and the the history of even though the last 50 years when most of us were alive in fact that there 's been 20 centimeters at least of see civil level rise probably East I think that thing aspects which were covered in the natural hazards chapter particularly the sand dunes are hugely relevant for the protection of the whole city not just the east and so contrary to council east it 's with confidence that I am very happy to support the recommendations in front of us today okay the other comments Glenn thank you always to make three points at this point think through this information I am a happy that the information that the data is sound that 's not to say i 'm aware of any pics on the community in terms of not only physical but social and a key part of this will be as the music or victor communities finding their own ways in which to disseminate information elected member i feel whichever a part of the city i represent and i 'm called to be both award at a city council that I have responsibilities to haitian is i put before the community and that community has the opportunity to continue to obtain that information in fact i would be reneging on my responsibility now would be reneging on my responsibility if i did not contribute to ensuring that that information went out the can i have talked before about one of the root words of education the way I heard it was it you carry the Latin and it means to be let out and I pick up on the tompa and taylor report that this is a an iterative process it will be updated and going back to my first point it will be about the community but i think kind of walking into the information taking it on growing in their understanding and coming to their own mind because they are intelligent they have been aware of some of this information before certainly in the South new brighton area they will want information more information they will want greater certainty and it is really critically important that we get this information out and i 'm quite happy to support these recommendations today thank you i dislike to make a final comment a life lines report was prepared for our city back in the 1990s it was instigated those involved in our lifelines the Orion our energy company and and all of these and the focus of it was was to was to look at an all-hazards assessment of our city what were the risks to our lifelines it identified the extent of the list liquefaction risk in the city some would say to a tee to a fault absolutely to a fault I mean that 's what produced it in the first place i guess the map it produced was mirrored almost exactly in the februari the quake and so someone is has got to ask why did we allow developments to occur in areas that took no account of that risk and that 's because people didn 't take the science they didn 't process it and they didn 't include it and planning when I was a politician I traveled the length and breadth of this country is the opposition spokesperson on civil defense there was a big difference between visiting civil defense and small city and small towns as compared to large cities in large cities I met with the civil defense team and small towns provincial New Zealand the civil defense were hand and glove you can 't have planning decisions if you don 't think about what the impact might be and in the event of a natural hazard coming to fruition people use the phrase natural disaster there 's no such thing as a natural disaster there is a natural hazard there might be an event that is caused by one of those hazards what is the disaster as its impact on people and the impact on people come so if it occurs in a city if it occurs where people live where people work where people play where people are located we had a massive earthquake down in Fiordland a few years ago but I think the year before our first earthquake that wasn 't a natural disaster it didn 't impact on any people disasters occur when they impact on people and that 's what we 've experienced here can we ignore a risk that we under that we understand and a risk that is being assessed not just here in New Zealand but internationally I ask myself the question around the liquefaction risk I believe that we never believed that we would have an earthquake of the extent that we did but we 've always been exposed to the Alpine Fault we know that will be affected by it and the awards I believe until what occurred here in Christchurch our belief that the that the extent of the shaking even though the the period would be longer that the distance from the epicenter would be sufficient to protect us from the degree of liquefaction which we experienced and febri I don 't believe that anyone now believes that to be the case which is why some time has been taken to get foundation methods and building methods right for building an unknown risk environment if we were able to go back in time we would ask ourselves questions that I couldn 't possibly have posed and I 've said this on a few occasions I couldn 't possibly have posed before the fourth of September 2010 what why what was anyone thinking that it was okay to build unreinforced concrete slab foundations on the edge of a weekly and susceptible to liquefaction I meant by that before the fourth of September 2010 and so the truth is is that we 've ended up in a situation where we we 've had a known risk there are known consequences but none of that has featured and planning and that 's what we 're here to do is to notify a chapter four planning purposes so do we only take a short term horizon no actually we 're legally obligated to take a longer term horizon and actually I 'd much rather be in a position of living in one of these environments knowing that I 've got a council that 's prepared to think in the long term and to give me information so i can make plans for the future then to have a sudden residential redzone decision thrown upon me and being given an unpalatable choice of accepting a rating valuation at 2007 or nothing or in the case of those that were uninsured a movement from fifty percent to eighty percent of the rating valuation of the landowner but that 's a another story risk and consequence have led us about as a community before mitigation adaptation and avoidance but the big hairy question that nobody really asks and answers as who pays the price who pays the price when something does go wrong and the particular case that we 've experienced here the cost was shared was shared in the port hills between the council and the crown shared in the residential red zone between people who lived there in the crown and the insurer 's depending on whether they were rebuild or repair or whether the finances fell a particular way the truth is that the insurance industry will take a position on this even if we don 't and so the question I posed to council as this do we really leave only those who can afford to self-insure to carry the cost to bear the burden alone because that 's what not notifying this chapter would do it would say to people if the insurance industry decide to take on board the recommendations of the scientific evidence that we haven 't has have all around the world and they decide that they 're not going to insurance in these areas anything that 's going to impact on people 's ability to know that they 're protected at least after the event with an option to to leave or to move on or to repair and rebuild are we going to leave them to really fend for themselves because not everyone who lives in one of these coastal environments is actually in that category of the very wealthy enjoying the coastal view which does happen from time to time around the country or do we take a community-wide viewers a city and say that the very point of local government is to take on these challenges and that 's our role so I would like this to be notified I would like the independent hearings panel to sit in judgment as it were of the science of the hard work that our staff have put into this particular chapter which I really do admire and and to hear the evidence and enter here the concerns that are going to be raised by many of the people who live in these environments and know that their council is order to ensure that the best solutions are able to be achieved so on that note i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no and that record david Easter 's no and that motion is carried and I 've just had a a note from Phil Clearwater so before we pray there Ivan Thompson Ivan would you like to just stand up please I would just like to inform oh I 've turned it off I 'd like to MP form let 's eat ado I would like to inform counselors there Ivan has been awarded oh my god what are you telling well it doesn 't give me any free membership free bar type of the concrete okay Ivan has been awarded a fellow of the New Zealand planning institute the highest accolade a planner and New Zealand can obtain and the profession congratulations thank you in a subpoena and actually privilege working for the account or for the Christchurch City Council it 's a career that a planner would dream off because of the issues that were faced and not privilege but working for successive of a linked of members and counselors and the genuine commitment that the council has always had for the welfare of its community and the need for a sound plan how so thank you thank you right so look at our minutes 10 to 12 so I think that we should add June now and we 'll come back at what time today at one-thirty yep all right so we 'll come back at one-thirty so ever a longer break that 's your morning tea and lunch combined thank you thanks Vic _"

    "text": "recommendation 21 we 're just given to the last of them now quite rightly the and thankfully the minister pointed out that we 've missed off a couple of rules out of one of our areas for the flood ponding rules now the flood ponding areas are the natural ponding areas that people are most familiar with probably Henderson 's base yeah the lower sticks cranford Basin as part of stage one we met that area but we didn 't have rules and as part of stage 3 we 've got rules that promote for the most part of very similar to the floor level and fill management areas except in regard to subdivision and new buildings and those rules were and they 're reviewing got dropped off so we 've got Philly restrictive rules in that area because we don 't want new subdivision filling of those areas and new buildings right in the middle of what 's a natural ponding area let 's go yep yep yep on that noise and I found the inflammation Brigitte that I put the note down for you otherwise we 'll Pauline guess today what you 've just said about putting residential on natural ponding areas my understanding is that there 's a part of the cranford basin it 's been identified as being appropriate for build not only an energy a technical sense but in our services sense ultra-fast broadband is there this public service access it 's 15 minutes walk to Northlands and so forth I my question is how do you rationalize what I 've just suggested with what you said previously and we will come to cranford Basin as a specific topic but the areas around cranford Basin that have been highlighted potentially for even development are on the higher lying areas around the edge of the base and they 're not actually in the basin much of the land that has been put forward in the notice of requirement for stormwater of course that is the area those are the areas that John Fiona 's really refuse she said cranford base so I using any actual weight isn 't yeah but with the water park the development is really the room okay so this is clear I we have what the ministers of highlighted is that we haven 't provided the rules and the appropriate place in the chapter so we 're adding them up and if you use it to like a no board since Henderson 's basin but you need to actually look at the planning maps and see which part of Henderson 's Basin has actually mapped as vulnerable to flood ponder gear sale increase because of some of the issues around us and of course some of the submissions that we 've had can we be clear and differentiating between areas because when i hear transferred base and adds to a number of people probably including the submitters it suggests the whole area include in the area that is higher that has been identified as bug literally just the ponding area and this is just the flood ponding management areas because they were allowed to keep the FMA title unlike the other one right I 've had to learn a whole new set of weeds for floor level and fill management what I 'm asking is and I always talking on their own sorry to sound and we are not talking about the residential development potential the area we will deal with that later and the day yes we should call it yeah or the year the cranford room okay so moving on now to recommendation 23 yep and here it 's again dealing with the the policy that we 've just referred to that refers to those ponding areas potentially are to address counselors concerned there instead of saying including the Hendersons Basin etc etc we see including parts of but I mean the thing is that these the whole area was as a natural ponding area and we 've got a variety of sort of management regimes over there area and we 're not identifying all of their area as ponding so you know I probably prefer to just keep it because this is a pot keep it at this high level but be clear in our explanations into the future that it is just part of that area that 's vulnerable the main change that we 're promoting here is that deletion of the word ervin and that 's already but we 're just making that clear now that because of the rewording of parts or provision of rules as part of the stage tree that we just want to make it clear that it 's not just urban areas there are some rural areas to other areas that are better we want to be subject to those rules the main reason for their change them yeah just the urban yep now the underlying danger but really it is removing that so it can apply more widely not just to urban areas and recommendation 23 which is the last one is really more of a I just tidying up a little inconsistency here and I 'll need to take responsibility for this there is some reference in the section 32 reports supporting the stage 1 chapter 2 doing a cross-reference in the slope stability table to existing provisions in either zones or district-wide provisions and this minor change here creeks data makes it consistent with the stage one indication and the section 32 okay that concludes the amendment and I had with me Janice Carter who can respond to the was mentioned in the New Zealand coastal policy statement and in the regional policy statement if you 'd like to hear nuts to that question the other of those some documents actually provide levels particularly museum coastal policy statement which I have here doesn 't recommend any particular sea level rise in it rather that it 's a consideration and that that it should be taken into account and a major or an allowance should be made for sea level rise but it doesn 't actually state what that amount should be a policy statement discusses various scenarios to sea level rise but it doesn 't actually recommend a particular sea level rise number sorry I 'm sorry to be interrupting but I 've just been taking advice because the cranford Basin issue is a very live issue later in the day and there is a certain requirement to be signed off by central government if we are able to notify the what we want to do in the cranford basin so and we 're working very collaboratively with it keen to make that happen so yeah okay sorry I my eyes off the ball but I did see a phone call from a very important piece of which I thought if I got Kate to address that then we could make some movement this afternoon I 'm hoping we can yep Phil just can 't react what you see Jenna so does that mean that infect the the was that we refer to 50 centimetres out 100 Anton does that mean that that 's like based on regional science rather low national I understand that I 'm talkin and Taylor have based eyes on the IPCC and recommendations much I think heard from mark over maybe four so that 's the international governmental panel on climate change and has that the adoption of the 1-meter sea level rise was a recommendation and a previous Tonkin intelli report which has been adopted for stage 1 and has been carried on through in this report to give various scenarios I think so clearly you might have said they 're based on sort of international focus rather museum as yet to re-adopt them is actually referred to in the Tonkin and taylor right so is it is at the end of the recommendations on natural hazards or we still got recommendations re sorry the figure here today was 400 mils rather than 515 yeah that 's 50 years it is so that 's what 's again that 's analyzing the Tonkin and Taylor reports over bit different all yeah and that 's based on his analysis of the International information and relating it to New Zealand situation thank you alright so have we done recommendation 23 yes you did right sorry I apologize so that 's the end of natural has natural hazards I do wish to draw your attention to the high level recommend _"

    "text": "right yep never G do you want to start off this or whoever 's taking us through this is to start off with a general overview of this part of the chapter okay and then the changes yep this part of the chapter extends existing provisions in the first part of chapter to apply to rural zones specific purpose owns and open space zones in terms of the floor level and fill management areas and also for repair of land in those areas we do stop there and make sure that you all have in front of you the natural hazards chapter 5 yep the section 32 us behind it also have your minister 's comments table open it that 's very bit of culture that 's right it is not other people would you re that members they are of this recommendation 13 recommendations what okay well there 's two numbers on the page let 's say they bought teen onwards page wash the table page 14 an attachment PO and then there is the actual minister 's comments but you don 't need to look at those because the minister 's recommendation so if we start at the top of chapter 14 those are the actual comments but you 'll recall that in the cover and report that I see two there was a paragraph or toll on each of the chapters that we were looking at it today which had the most substantial areas that officers want to bring to your attention the rest of it is what you might call either clarifications or Corrections or more minor material what we need to focus on is what 's in the covering report that 's the most abstained of areas of the minister 's comments that we require direction from you on with respect to the draft recommendations from the officers so we need to have particular regard to the the minister 's comments and in particular that there is substantive ones which are in those paragraphs which are the paragraph are natural hazards as on four point seven point three on page five of the covering report the covering report is the small report that you would have received last but yeah this one here it 's three and it looks like a normal council look as a report for this committee that 's correct page five four point seven point three outlines the substantive issues raised by the monitors ministers which piona will go over however the table lists every one of the minister 's recommendations in relation to this chapter starting at page 14 and then what fiona has done has incorporated the recommendations from officers subject to of course you agreeing to the draft recommendations or not that 's what we have for today ok so if members are really now one of the key aspects of the minister 's comments or seeking justification for the two tiered approach to the coastal hazards management so we 've done that in terms of beefing up both the introduction and the section 32 report would provide a lot more explanation now to tier is the tomb that the ministers you will too staged approach which is identifying areas at higher risk and the from coastal erosion in the next 50 years and that those areas at a lesser risk and up until 100 between fifty and coastal inundation from a 50-year event and also at a list of from the 100 year of the event so we 've described that clearly in the policy and we 've also expanded the policy to provide for modification of existing buildings where the owner wishes to reduce the risk from coastal erosion and seawater and inundation and we 've got a supporting role for that so that 's bringing through the National coastal policy statement requirement to encourage redevelopment to reduce risk as there 's a regional one that they refer to a regional coastal policy statement that 's right there 's also policy there and we 've provided extra analysis of that too and that directs avoidance of development in high hazard areas which include coastal erosion and coastal inundation and so but they 've also provided are some exceptions so they 've said that you could always we are appropriately mitigate possible to appropriately mitigate the hazard that can be done so and so that 's where we 've used that identified those areas and the 50 to 100 year bracket either in terms of erosion or inundation is being potentially able to be mitigated so we 've got Lisa controls in that area so what 's the predicted sea level rise in the regional coastal policy statement I 'm sorry I can 't answer that but certainly in terms of n negotiations with vironment Canterbury they were keen for us to get the most up-to-date information and that you know by Tolkien and to I understand yeah I understand that we 're required to do best available yes I 'm sorry I can 't answer that without referring to that I thought it was half a meter but I 'm I don 't know if I 'm referring to the national policy in coastal policies day no reason it I 'm saying it is is that isn 't one of the reasons that you would have the two-tier approach is that the that the guidelines that exist at the moment from I thought they were the ministry for the environment but I 'm I had looked at the regional coastal policy plans on not one hundred percent sure if it 's repeated there but if it 50 year and we 're talking about a meter for the hundred year isn 't that a justification for having the two if they 're still settled at this point five which I find incredible at this time that they still search with that guidance but I don 't know if the number is included in the regional policy statement because we don 't we can 't ignore it camera and outs of it but I can tell you that the Canterbury regional coastal environment plan does provide for two different coastal zones one looking at areas subject to erosion in the 50 year time frame and also in the 100 year time frame so it 's also bringing across that existing practice but do they I 'm yeah I know that 's not answering your question oh and I 'm just quickly looking at it to see if i can find that answer I have asked someone to go and find that answer for us as well okay I 've got it got it sitting here on my phone I just can 't get to the answer quickly enough of policy guidance about the height as the the ministry for the environment guidelines of 2008 where they they talk about point five but suggest planning 4.8 of the meter sea level rise over the next hundred years yeah that 's them up to date but does that I mean I well the only reason only reason I 'm saying is is that are we going to get in trouble getting to the independent hearings panel when it looks like we haven 't accepted the advice of the ministers well we had our own expert technical advice presented as part of the stage 1 hearings where we put we 've provided justification to the author of the token and taylor report actually provided justification for adopting one meter and i understand no no i 'm not talking about the height i 'm talking about whether we should have the tomb other times there well all I can say is that the minister 's there was no objection to it as actually just wanted to explained and leave them in the comments I can 't thank you because I mean we that what 's clear is that their objection wasn 't to us having that approach that the two-tier the two-tier it was the fact that it wasn 't explained in sufficient detail and the section 32 which it narrows read thank you I 'm just trying to make sure that we are very clear about what because I mean you guys are the ones who have to front the independent hearings panel and we don 't want to have any doubt about what we 're sending you off to do the other matters one meter they identified as that there needed to be a slight old potentially an alteration to policy 562 because we were saying avoid previously avoid coastal hazard mitigation works and they identified quite correctly that didn 't relate to the discretionary activity status that we propose for that rule and so we 've taken a slightly less at risk restrictive wording and by saying restrict but still go through all the various criterion a B and C under that policy another less be divided in 5 is the absence of a a policy on changing climate a renovation recommendation 30 to see that we 're proposing a policy there that 's an overarching policy that would set up in the general policies within the chapter we haven 't referred to climate change per se because that term is defined in the Resource Management Act and has a relatively narrower jurisdiction than we 'd like to have so we 've used the term it changing climate to be a bit more all-encompassing with a agreed with the minister 's comments in that regard so they 've asked us to specifically refer to climate change policy also asked us to do the same thing in respect of tsunami and we 're reluctant to do so and so far as that we 're providing for our tsunami mapping for information only the advice to us through the veneer 2014 report and other area own risk advisors has suggested that much of that that information because it 's what has potentially significant consequences there 's a very very low likelihood like the distance sauce tsunami that we 're mapping and to for information as a likelihood of a one and and likelihood of occurrence i should say and so with those three load levels of likelihood we 're not comfortable giving it the recognition and policies we 're saying that error their existing policies provide enough recognition for that and so that is explained quite extensively under recommendation 15 and the the analysis that we 're proposing to put in the section 32 report then that 's on page 16 and 17 right part of that question was about providing a comprehensive consequence assessment my sought advice from a risk management advisors on that and we provided some explanation on that as well it 's always like any of these assessments you know they can be as smaller as large as you like so we 've referred to a process that could be gone through but we 've also referred to lengthening that effectively has undertaken a consequence assessment in that report and it advises and makes disclaimers very clearly at the beginning of that report that it should only be used for strategic planning purposes and so that 's that the direction we have accepted and explained that an yeah I just wondered whether again you know this is going to be a yeah so what the ministers seem to be saying and their comments were that they were concerned that that we 'd only look debt the that the likelihood rather than the consequence and so that this is a much better description of of the nature of the three tsunami scenarios that we face but you know I 'm just a little concerned that that I mean I wasn 't quite sure what the ministers were getting it to tell you the truth because I mean is it that people were just concerned that they 've seen the pictures in Japan and that we have to think of the worst possible scenario when we plan otherwise we just wouldn 't live and crashes really and I think we can take some comfort from the fact that we have we 're proposing these very extensive provisions and tombs of the the findings of the tonkin and taylor report to restrict new development in those areas that are most affected and if you look at the mapping you 'll and asian may think very much coincide for large parts of the coast yeah yeah okay and I think too then that 's when you start drilling down into the rules that you 'll see that those activities such as hospitals and residential care facilities where there could potentially be an intensification of people either visiting or resident that those activities need to go through a consent process and while we don 't have rules and this chapter in regards to tsunami you know that the risk profile is certainly there in terms of the mapping so that will form part of the assessment of if you were building a rest home you wouldn 't necessarily want a builder and a place that would be hard to evacuate exactly yeah do you think that I mean have you talked to officials advising the minister 's about whether thus approaches that will be acceptable to them because I mean I 'm what I 'm trying to tease out as whether we 're going to end up in dispute in front of the independent hearings panel well to be honest we did some sort of mixed messages about how far they were prepared to provide us with some indication of what they really wanted there so effectively that they 've fled that and no we haven 't got any further than that well what shall gut feeling on it um well I 'd like to think this we get adequate actually you know like I said we have had advice from our Peter kingsbury a risk management person who also deals with the e can risk management people there and and I think this should suffice but and it can 't view on this I well they 're actually leading that research there are leading additional research and cooperation with environment I with University of Canterbury researchers and and working in with other then providing information to us about regional studies as well about tsunami up the east coast of the North Island that could potentially affect us that 's more the regional and local source one so we 're relying a lot on Ani can for that information yeah I mean you can see that the questions that I 'm asking you know what what are going to be points of contention and I 'm getting a degree of comfort that you don 't believe that this will be one of those no and I think some of the arm people that providing and the administers advice they 're not aware of the existing the extensive warning system that the council has operating down here that 's a relatively new system of you going the website people can find that information very readily but people that don 't live here aren 't aware of that the same right and you know we 're also planning at a local level whereas you know central government level as you know you don 't always have the same understanding of the the relationships between local government and also on the ground so I think once we explain it a bit further they 'll get a better understanding of how well paired we are ok alright highest level also i would say that this is a can approach to how we 've dealt with stability Len stability issues and the stage one natural hazards as that type of approach unfortunately we haven 't yet had a decision out of the hearings panel to guide us as to whether that was acceptable right okay all right next but as a recommendation 16 as I mentioned earlier we 're proposing an additional policy therefore to provide for the modification of existing building so we think that we will give people some comfort for those that are in the floor level and fill management areas they 've already got our rules imposed in terms of additional buildings or new builds of course a lot of people that are looking looking at repairing this will give them a little bit more support in terms of having other options to address that the rest and coastal hazards into the future so what does C allow that links that then into a role that provides for the modification of existing buildings to reduce risk so but we can 't write a rule that says that you can 't increase risk potentially that that could be linked into that policy possibly are one could argue that the existing matters of discretion are a resource consent requirement which will be going outside your footprint you know you could also justify you know address we could explain that we 're addressing that concern you have your worship through the floor level and fill management areas and the controls that are there and post on you know new additions to existing buildings and new buildings it doesn 't quite answer that the issue that you raised an artist in building slurring that seems like it 's a little bit of a loophole but we need follow that up with the building officials yeah it is it is a loophole and it is quite concerning but but but I mean the bigger picture is that there are there are heaps of people in these areas who are repairing their properties without building consents and even if they 're not increasing their risk than not reducing their risk the other thing I need to point out as part of the stage one provisions there is that public awareness provision so we 're hoping that that will link into Council wide information over time I mean there 's learn more permanent formation of course people will be aware of these things but you know I think the potential there for to keep building on existing information to increase people 's awareness of that risk and so you know I understand that it 's just whether people have the capacity at this moment to address an increased vulnerability and if you 're not rebuilding you know it seems to me that you have the problem you have a problem if you 're not rebuilding but anyway that 's been the case since februari 22 just took this thing through that our recommendation 16 the few extra provisions that we 're proposing or rewording to make sure there 's better alignment between the policies and in the the rules and assessment matters so effectively that 's very much what we 're explaining their and providing some extra justification again in the section 32 report to explain that you know I mean I hate to say this but that is exactly the sort of provision and the reviews that I would love to have to protect people that are now exposed you 've got to have an activity status for the area that would trigger the resource consent but there isn 't one if you 're not doing anything location of your building or your footprint or damn yeah but then that would be increasing regulatory requests and that would be that we get they would get hammered from on day one but I think that I mean it 's almost worth ensuring that the the commissioners know that this is a problem with our regulatory frameworks because it is a crossover it 's a crossover between resource consent district plan and building act and building consent and there 's a you know that yeah as a real problem for for these people that can 't protect against the risk that they now have anyway it 's a bigger challenge felicity we move over now to recommendation 17 that provide some identification of the minor amendment that I referred to earlier in terms of restricting host or mitigation works on page 20 page your 20 of your table link to that too as a new district wide rule that applies to general rules and that was opposed by the ministers they thought that that should be in the natural hazards chapter so we 've added an extra column to the coastal hazards rules table to provide for that now just provide you a little bit of background there are a lot of coastal protection works around the whole district and and at the present that activity isn 't identified and any other plans and what happens if somebody wants to rebuild repair or put in a new one it 's just I 've generally falls under the activity status of a building and at the moment there 's not really sufficient assessment criteria or matters of discretion to really assess that acura well in a comprehensive in a sustainable way so that 's what we are proposing by identifying that activity coastal hazard mitigation which both as a by defining it giving it a policy and also having a rule that applies not only within those coastal hazard management areas but also across the district yep some of the minor amendments to the matters of discretion there outlined because we 've other dealing with consents versus subdivision and some were better dealt but because all of them so they 're relatively minor amendments they 're moving on to be commendation approach to mobile hazards that the minister 's sought us to approach has a total hazard management using a multi hazard approach but unfortunately it wasn 't really described but it seemed that they wanted us by reference and further comments about condensing the hazard maps it seemed to imply that they wanted just a hazard map as sort of like a generic term across the whole of the district and we are not comfortable with that position we think the while it looks that hazards max look very busy and the planning maps look very busy in some areas where there are multiple hazards we think our multiple Hazards approach of having all their unique hazards that we know about and that we 've got and for most of them we 've got controls that relate to development in those areas having them there so that people can identify the the complete risk profile associated with the site as much generic type of mapping so that 's their justification there in the recommendation 19 that we 're proposing to put in the section 32 report an important I thought that they were really making the point that you 've got to be able to electronically delayer it you can add us yeah we are no but a notified version of the chapter people be able to tune on and all these different aspects of the hazards but also we 're told by idea at the GIS stuff that when the plan becomes properly operative that that factual even easier to apply over hunt remember I can 't remember where i read it but I thought it was was in one of their comments that they wanted to they wanted to be able to delay us electronically and that can be done currently yeah I know but what should I know they 're saying the mapping of hazards is very difficult to interpret given the number of layers that apply we understand that this we resolve to an extent when drop proposal 5 is notified by electronic MEPs that allow layers to reduce the amount of overlap and the maps and rules and to take a truly multi hazard approach to management by condensing and I 'm rationalizing the layers and rules while we acknowledge that there may not be sufficient time to implement such an approach and response to these comments and before notification we encourage the council to continue work to improve the mex for the replacement plan I don 't know what they mean by if I can explain that they 're actually looking at PDFs at the moment so they are yet that 's available to Meili electronic surgery and that 's what we 're all we were looking at effectively the public are looking at as well the council okay yes but once that 's notified on the twenty-fifth of july you 'll be able to look they 'll be able to switch layers off just as you can do at the moment with the stage 1 and stage 2 mapping ok ok so it 's going to improve one hundred percent and also if i can just bring to your attention you have in front look like these one is the full cleaning meth which has all the zonings overlays hazard overlays and everything all on the one map that you will be able to non and off and the other is just simply and hazard so if people do find it too difficult they put just go to the series of hazzard max yeah yeah okay that 's fine thank you moving down to the recommendation 20 we 've here provided further analysis to justify the the approach taken the two-stage approach which I talked about earlier so this is the actual section here where we provide analysis of both policy 25 and the New Zealand coastal policy statement policy 13 31 and the regional coastal policy statement and link that back to the approach that we 've taken for identifying areas at risk in both the 50 and 100 year time frames from the risk of coastal erosion and the risk of coastal storm and uh nation but it 's a fairly comprehensive coverage there okay so that they didn 't_''_1808.64 I wasn 't clear as to whether their recommendation was saying oh apply all of the rules that you apply to that single set of rules to their but I thought that that would be against their own you know sort of statement of expectations because it would be increasing the level of regulatory intervention at a point at which we would consider to be too far in the distance well the interesting thing is that the recent policy statement policy 11.3 point one has been recently slightly amended to provide a bit more clarification and the key thing is that in these areas that are already urbanized that we can either avoid or mitigate and that fear it only that 's the message that we were given these various representatives from both he can and the government ministries saying that in that 50-year area there 's an immediate media immediate risk we want to identify the immediacy of that risk so that people can react and respond to that now but we think in that area from 50 years into the future and out to a hundred years that we have potentially the time to undertake mitigation whether it individually or the council can be familiar with the rolling system and whether there 's any road that 's a strategic link to some part of the district that may need protection and upgrading of the existing coastal hazard mitigation works well i think you know it 's only logical that any development behind that road is going to benefit from that so you know in time these actual areas that are identified and vulnerable now could be can be reviewed and we 'll be continuing to monitor this where as a token and taylor report advisors and potentially some of these areas could be reviewed in the change of status and time it will that entire you know roadway from very Meade bridge through to Sumner for example is along the coastline so you know I mean obviously that 's going to be factored unto and provide tension T protection for what 's that 's behind and as members will be weird to that that 's also what was a strategic route to the port yeah before that I think it was at the Sun the road at the ends bay status of that that route is potentially higher and more of a strategic than other other roads that was kind of like a critical lifeline really and certainly at the moment without Sumner road open there 's no alternative mind you if there were a tsunami coming I know which road I 'd rather go down here okay so that 's fine thank you _"

    "text": "I think the question of insurance and the question of floor levels under the building act and floor levels and the Resource Management Act are related but they don 't they don 't necessarily correlate so in terms of insurers insurer 's the insurance companies are all different in terms of what risk that will accept but and that is their business they want to sell insurance and and what they 're doing is is underwriting that risk for people so this there 's no there 's no question in my mind that they 'll go off risk and all our flood management areas or fourth floor level and fill management areas across the city and those those are met for an extreme event and that 's what insurance is therefore and similarly the building act levels the one in 50 event is still an extreme event it 's not it 's not the sort of event that you you expect every couple of years you don 't you don 't expect those to come along that often so the floor level has to be pretty low in terms of the living room and it has to be much much lower than than anything that is required under the building it today or even in the last 2 19 20 years thank you i 'm just wondering with our conversations with the community whether we might look at having a-- with resources people such as duncan web or dean list or people here just as it was that going too far broadening the conversation to my well i think that the hub they 're going to have broader range i think resin CS that have kind of been brought into the picture because but but i kind of want to repeat that there 'll be none of these houses that are marked blue here even dark blue that aren 't in the current floor level and full management areas so these people are already you know the preparation the problem the problem for me has always been there for people who repair they don 't get an opportunity to against that risk so because they 're not building to the new floor levels thats that 's my issue has always protect yourself and these areas as you can and the floor level and fill management areas it 's kind of only what I 've been banging on about for four years you 've obviously not a nice thing to me I know I remember what happened the insurer 's hold out on them by saying all your foundational damage doesn 't hit the three sure exactly well this person is so ya know it 's a huge area Andrew and then Paul thank you a couple of questions the comments that have been made about the floor management Phil area is obviously a lot of work historically was done in the city there wasn 't that same amount of work as i understand it done in banks peninsula does that mean that there might be more of surprised about some of this for example to a person sitting in per hour than there would to a person sitting in new brighton should we be anticipating that it 's it 's true so the not been for level controls over and above those in the building edged out on being so little river so there 's a floor level and Phil management area for Little River and we 're these coastal inundation zones are mapped out on banks moments yo there are floor level controls introduced through the district in ok so that 's that 's a new thing just through this district plan review yes yes so these people have been watching that they 'll be aware of it from you yeah okay and then second question the presentation that we 've seen this morning is that the basis of a public meeting like this presentation will also be shown at those public meetings yes although i did i did add a little more detail and about the models for this morning but but yes there is the basis of the ones that will use for the public meetings okay and the dates of the public meetings like there are some provisional day to put out but they haven 't been confirmed those yes they have that all right well quite good to get those dates and we can repeat them online so would be good yeah I don 't how we 're good at finance or to save the dates are these or you could say these dates will give you the two sets of dates the date specifically for for the tonkin and taylor report and talking about coastal inundation and erosion and then the dates also for the district plan review drop-ins yeah they said that there is a hub one and I also know that the community leaders meeting last night you know when we when the council sort of said we 'll be coming out you know with these public events there was a little bit of we 'll hang on a minute we might actually have a better way of communicating with our community so we left that open so people can come back you know the sort of paul 's islands etc of this world you know South bright and residents association you know that there 's a lot of you no idea that rather than having one big meeting that smaller meetings you know the opportunity for a lot more people to ask questions and and do so on a you know what we 're trying to encourage yeah I 'm Paul and then Vicki it 's just on just carry on from what you 're talking about with the people here the aqua doing repairs and don 't have the opportunity to actually remediate for coastal inundation the other issue is it with these lon consented repairs as it we find that some buildings an actual fact that are on poles are actually getting lowered because of code further until the the issue where flooding could occur so they whether piles been sunk in different spots on the house through the earthquake what the repeaters are doing is taking it to the lowest point so it 's easily lowering the we actually have found one of those examples and people refer to more than one that there is one definite example whether his occur where 's Ian sure it didn 't have to give well they might have been EQC but they didn 't have to get a building consent because of the number of piles that was fingered with and so they lowered that this is alongside the heathcote River just wonder though with these non-consenting issues whether we need to have some mechanism and these flood level and full management areas some mechanism where they have to be consented when it 's anything to do with the foundation okay is that mechanism that we can change the consent rules in our district plan but but I wonder whether are we able to require that that that floor levels aren 't lowered on these areas I mean is that possible these are these are these are works being carried out under the building Act I understand rather than the resource management deck so the Resource Management Act rules in the district plan rules are only triggered when someone needs to apply for assistance here and that 's the problem all right we need a solution because it is I mean you know I me know the apocryphal stories aren 't you no actual evidence but there is there is a case they have found the case where the floor levels were lowered so smoothing the smoothing the foundations so that they went down so they got a level house but the next chapter just so there 's no surprises when we come to it and the impact of the Alpine Fault Line and just what it may mean I just spent an hour with the geotech engineer what that could or might mean across the south and actually and and just I don 't notice that anyway so just a heads up that it would be nice to have I 'm on there but for the next one but I 'm assuming but now if you want to yeah that 's right oh gee lesson stood at the University can 't_''_511.21 we actually a couple of months ago for a decent series of talks on the the alpha and fault rupture in a nutshell main absolute you know west coast anyway on the Alpha environment it 's gotta feel it will be catastrophic Christchurch it will be significant what you 're talking about is obviously less of ground accelerations probably an order around point 3 g 's but for prolonged duration so we 're talking one and a half two minutes plus so what you 'd expect there in the damage you would expect some sort of base and subsidence how much we 're not sure and then obviously there will be some stuff going on in the port hills as well not to the magnitude that we 've experienced but we do expect some some slope stability there it was interesting to hear her there was a lake and fueled limpet they were able to actually measure the last 26 eruptions yeah Alpine Fault Line and they 're reasonably regular interval how long has been and and but I 'm just wondering if there is it was quite fascinating in terms of the length of the time that her an event would take and the geotech engineer I was speaking to you was remote many of the buildings because they 've been constructed with the end the manner in which they have would be quite safe in Christchurch and he was talking about some buildings and other parts of the South Island that wouldn 't be and but just is through anything different or unusual that we should be learning from what we now know about that that we _''_627.12 the question of whether you can answer that now or when we come to that next well I mean I think that what 's obvious is that as that and the natural hazards space the risk of flooding and the liquefaction prone status of the land inextricably linked to each other so I 'm not I 'm thinking of is there something that we should have included that we haven 't okay obviously we 're going to learn debt and coastal inundation and Coast all but the natural hazards chapter we 're going to get move on to the knee that 's why I just warning and better go to ask those questions do it the next one if it so he 'll particular about the fava beans so it 's really different from another velocity of approach to the ground chosen CP for Christ 's huge taking account of all the source of the Alpine Fault the pool has passed fault which would most probably give us pretty serious station as well as well as other local source of significant regular so s is pointed out we did the anything long enough it eventually falls divisions two months of shaking is an awfully long time even if relatively cheap to announce you know the Christchurch probably might see circling above anything else yet so you 're going to get very similar effects but also but also i should add i 'm sorry that that those natural hazards were dealt with in the stage one set of tremors and and we are expecting a decision on that clearly shortly so so just the question and you don 't need to answer it narrows is there anything that you can think of as a geotech engineer that we should have included in this part the natural hazards not the coastal inundation cuz i appreciate but this is what this part is we 've already done the first part of the natural hazards yay no just teaching so we studied earthquakes in the effect so thinking what us in our city we we know what will pretty much happen and that 's been captured yeah I think I think that you know dealing with the the two parts of the one chapter helpful to public understanding as it could have been because in some ways looking at the floor level when full management here is at the same time as looking at these would would show that the pictures are you know pretty much the same except on the banks peninsula where it hasn 't been met and there are new mapping areas here but that but they 've now been cooked and included and the floor level and full management areas anyway so I think we 've we 're getting to understand a lot more about our city but i think that to raise that assure about the impact of the alpine fold i think raises go it drifts into the area that I was drifting unto before which is the building code and they 're building it and actually the requirements around foundations and the areas that are most susceptible that have remained available for development I mean that phrase tc3 sort of caused all sorts of horror but it was designed to provide foundations that would readily either absorb or be easily to straighten houses without lowering them so in place now are actually secured against that but you cannot remove the rusko it 's going to it 's going to happen one day and it 's a question of how do you best ensure that you 're in a good position to do more than just demolish buildings and start all over again we actually want to be able to retain the economic value of our properties our communities our homes that shaking lasted well then you are the only person in the room that didn 't know that I mean everyone knows that it 's going to last for over a month you know it was a lot more than a minute yeah but it 's dealing but the point is is that the extent of the shaking in terms of the you know in terms of the impact that it has on on the land is as liquefaction and lateral spread that 's what the impact does so in the areas that are susceptible to liquefaction we have written rules about the type of building you can build it 's quite a lot of new information possible of what we 've learned because obviously graphic learning lab for earthquakes in the last four years dramatic learning lab and I just want to make sure that we 've included that but you 're telling me is the expert in the field that you think you 've included everything that I really don 't want to create this level of anxiety and uncertainty either injected into a conversation that we 're having around coastal inundation and coastal erosion this component of the natural hazard chapter and I mean I straight into this area to when I agreed with Paul that lowering lowering the you know the platform for a house in a risky area is madness it 's extreme madness but the what we the answer we got was that the natural hazards chapter of our district plan our district plan itself cannot deal with that issue that issuers as a building actor show and it 's a it 's it 's it 's only an issue when resource consents are required the question that I still have at the bottom of mind as should resource consents be area like this because I can 't for the life of me understand why we can 't fix it it 's just beyond my comprehension to go on it sounds a bit over the top but it may just really make it as a megadeth sheep but how I mean how could we write a role and here that says that a resource consent is required if it increases the level of risk if the proposed if any of the building will increase the level of risk and a full floor level filled management area or within a coastal inundation area I don 't think as it 's as simple as it sounds to be honest and those people that are building the homes already have existing use rights they no no no they 're not building this is not building exactly but repairs as well and the insurance company organizers they don 't require resource cuz they don 't require building consents that 's right because they have existing you sciences no no it 's not because they have existing use rights that does not apply to building consents for the life of me I can 't understand why we would allow people to increase their level of risk or to have their level of risk increase for them by their insurer or by a pc it 's just irresponsible prices Lincoln Lee and look into that that 's not a district 10 issue but I can but why is we 're telling people what they can and can 't_''_1108.95 do and in particular areas why can 't we tell people they can 't increase their risk help me help me understand why we can 't tell we can tell them if they 're building brand new that they 're that some things are non-complying some things are you know discretionary some things or whatever but we can 't tell people that they can increase the risk for their property even though we know that it could be sold at an increase rest later yep section 71 of the building act that talks about natural hazards including inundation I 'm sure flooding as well so if it was shown that your property was a subject to a hazard then bulb in come sit but they don 't have to get one because they 're only yet so I don 't know how that 's the only framework we have once the application comes in to do something without that we don 't know but if yeah I know but and what I 'm what I 'm asking us are we without the work to work out what could be a resource consent requirement because it seems to me that this is the only place the district plan is the only place where we can actually require people not to increase the risk and we can look at this further but my concern is that the Resource Management Act only deals with the new development that 's securing its respective but but the ministers have asked us what are we doing about existing you know residential and you know I mean we 're going to move into this area in a minute but I mean what it just seems wrong to me that you can 't protect actually people from what their insurers and what if you see are requiring can that how can that be right you tenth of what we do is to stop that from happening anyways to manage this yeah it is so you could who knew you couldn 't build new and you couldn 't you couldn 't if you require a building consent you couldn 't do what they don 't but because you don 't require a building consent it doesn 't you can increase the risk that 's wrong yeah and it 's a nun 10 thing I don 't know whether you can look at that but can 't_''_1263.27 we right can 't_''_1263.93 we write a brawl and hear that simply says that you know that given these areas these mex that in these areas you can 't do anything to your due to your residential property to increase the level of risk that you will be faced with can 't_''_1283.149 we please we mail about it we may or may not be a can-do organized days we cannot use the building act sorry we cannot use the resource management act in the district plan to control building that is controlled insert a rule that essentially works around what would otherwise not require a building pcs so I think I think what we really need to do is talk to our residential building consent people and get a full understanding what levers they can hear they don 't have existing use rights provisions they don 't have if that if a building consent is not triggered they can require nothing that 's right so in a building consent provision as only triggered at a certain its level of structural change that 's right so I just yeah okay it isn 't a bit a little bit careful too because they 're the building code is different to the mb guideline so yes I guess you do so you know we have to be that careful which one we Yogi and the mb guidelines are you know they could allow their Stefan well yeah but the codes stole that and it appears in some repairs are handled under the mb guidelines not actually the building code all right okay we 'll stop beating a dead horse tragically anyway so you 're ready you thank you very much _"

    "text": "just I don 't know just just let him that 's the the comment was made about sort of removing up to 15 years of sand really predicated on the height of the sand dune that you are dealing with in the first instance if you go back to the the high storm surge we had in the 1990s there were June 's that we ended up with escapements of 10 or 15 meters in some places now Mike Stevens had the June system at effingham Street lowered to about three or four meters at that particular time that June system recovered within about within weeks a month so the higher you have a gene we have genes along our Coast that are some of them are up to getting close to 20 meters above mean high water Springs and yes of course naturally you will have a big escarpment and those students will take a long time to recover but the lower they are if they 're all around the the resort 's consented height of 8 meters they will recover very quickly the higher they are the longer you 'd like to comment on that as well in back tom feel free to yeah so I 'll just the background for the linear coastline obviously it 's a different setting into the sort of that the Avon Heathcott full of coastline you basically ultimately you 've got two parameters you 've got the the sediment input from the Y Mac that 's getting pushed down the coast so that at the moment is causing a general net accretion or growing out of the coast now what the the modeling arm is taking you to come does increase sea level rise so that 's the negative effect so you 've got a balance of basically we talk about a budget so is the amount of sand be enough to offset the amount of sea level rise now bearing in mind that June 's comprise said they 're not an engineered structure they 're very vague no resistance to water basically so although you can have a sizable barrier if the water level is a living increase time it will you know impact on that barrier and ultimately take away with the sea level rise when NASA will take over I 'm Phil thank you I had a follow-up question too it 's around what you referred to you know national national policies kind of like needing to be developed to assist us but could you just perhaps just tell us a little bit about what other countries for example the eastern seaboard of the United States what kind of policies they have to provide I guess protection from more future sea-level rise but also tsunami and all that but what 's the policy Oh seasonal policies do they here I mean your question is pointing to what 's what 's happening around the world and indeed the number of cities around the world are also great lling with the issue of climate change and sea level rise and a number of policy approaches have been proposed and the the most difficult one is as deciding in you when you designate an area for retreat we knew decide you 've got to have put in place adaptational mechanisms so things such as the floor level controls that are in the Queenslanders over in Australia where the bottom story of the building is essentially open and able to be inundated in a storm event and you only saw your boats down there and anything else you bring anything valuable you bring upstairs before a before a storm comes along or whether you indeed use those areas for temporary activities for example there are um there is a motor camp up north up husband way which is within a coastal erosion II rare and they 've shifted their amenity blocks further back and they they 're sitting on piles so they can shut them again if they need to because they face exactly the same uncertainty of you know how how fast things will happen and when the next audience is going to arrive in terms of legislative and policy instruments there there are there are instruments such as zoning we 're areas are zoned and progressively the zoning moves back from the coast as you as you get stored offense so you have a rolling easement back from a coast and you don 't allow any development close to the coast and keep your housing and your infrastructure back beyond that now that that sounds as though it 's sort of easy and gradual but of course with infrastructure there are large step changes required sometimes so that can be quite a difficult process and that needs to be thought about on 50 and 100 year time frames which are well beyond the reach of the district plan which essentially while it looks out 100 years there 's planning for what will happen within the next 10 or 20 years and ender 's then updated and they 've also been insurance schemes proposed an America I 'm not sure if any of those have taken hold but I 've seen proposals for disaster risk insurance schemes essentially where the state or federal insurance scheme takes over the risk but doesn 't allow a rebuild so if there 's a storm event that they get their insurance and they 're given a place to settle somewhere else so there 's a relocation policy following a disaster so that 's a sort of a based response so you you essentially allow people to the risk and then the relocation and the event of a disaster Paul policy you talk about is that like a very isolated reason I have Appa so where will you take the take that insurance software something happens they buy you out and you can 't go back we can do into that properly um yes and no it 's the red zone offer was was in response to a single event and then fixed in time this this is responding to the wish of people wanting to stay where they are but nothing but not realizing the risk yeah and I know there 's a risk but addressing the reality that if a major event comes along then there 's there 's no possibility of going back so where is that specifically applied that was proposed I 'm not sure if it 's actually in place but that was proposed in New York after after Hurricane sandy well yeah that was mostly New Orleans but it 's it 's in response to long-term sea level rise and they 've got in New York I mean you 've got the time of Hurricane sandy or before it no follow no good hey it was a different hurricane event differently home of it but it was a different at the eastern seaboard of the states but was there earlier then sandy yeah yeah because there were a lot of things happened after sandy as well yeah which also had needed yeah yes yeah so but it 's did it but you don 't know whether it was actually implemented or not no no I read the proposal documents sound I mean it sounds quite interesting because one of the things that you know we don 't really know as you know sort of time frames and I mean we are based on predicting the future to a certain extent and I guess what the science is telling us is that you know given certain events occurring and an unknown specific timeline you 'd be better to think about what would happen if something occurred and planned for that as well so not just think about you know an immediate solution I mean night you say the red zone was just event was that you know is it better to be thinking about how we might manage this in the long term and should this be thought about on a national basis as well because I imagined that coastal properties and some parts of the country would be the most expensive properties and the country and yeah so I mean it just does raise some issues about where the liability would lie when there 's a known risk that you 're planning for the eventualities of and how you would actually respond to that and what would be an appropriate way to do so yes it 's right I do i do think it is a national conversation as well a dull question it 's not like you question are you planning a lunchtime today because I just yeah there 's a whole pile of peoples that some other life going on 12 30 12 30 to 1 30 okay 12th Izzy thank you so much is that what it says good oh there was a good guest name was on it 1231 teen like my point around the closest part always been you know historically the most expensive real estate because they have the views out to the sea but globally coastal areas property values have dropped by about twenty percent that 's one and I just just like the climate change is primarily sea level rise is globally one of the biggest challenges in the world if you know the common knowledge that we 've got most of our communities at the sea and on top of it I think post-world war two we had this big shift of let 's go go and stay by the seaside so there 's a lot of valuable assets which counters with the coastal erosion so it goes back to some basic issues and just the last comment the literature doesn 't talk about retreat now they call it managed realignment yeah what up yeah but the thing is is that it 's about choices and it 's about timing so I mean and there are two things that don 't match in an uncertain environment so you can 't really say that people have got a choice when they live already they live there so and it 's hard to have conversations about 50 years hence when you know your generations of a family have grown up in a particular area I mean I understand this because you know I 've talked to people who were red zoned you know out of their dream homes and that the shock of the suddenness of that you know I almost want to turn this into a positive conversation about how instead of dealing with a shock they 're actually we can prepare communities and actually think about how we finance what could be a longer-term solution for some properties but it 's really hard when you don 't know if you 're one of them yeah i mean the issue for christchurch is that we 're in that post aftermath of an earthquake which has compounded these issues there 's no doubt you know you can talk about fifty or a hundred years of sea level rise you know with a couple of bumps so the lands drop sir we 've been shunted into this you know he said the fast forward button what the science is telling us so that absolutely the next question is where do we let 's take it on board and let 's see what we can do about it who can I can I ask a really challenging questioning if which is unlike me if if we had instead of taking an approach around the residential red zone if we had taken the approach that instead of thinking that as purely a government response to an event and a an urgent solution for de-risking the environment for insurance and all of the reasons that set find the reeds owning if we 'd sat down together with central government and collaboratively worked out not just sea level not just the aftermath of the earthquakes and liquefaction proneness and lateral spread proneness and various other things related to the earthquake if we 'd actually looked at this the sea level rise and the and the coastal erosion issues at the same time judging that there would be a different conversation about liability to pay could we have come up with a with a more inclusive set of maps that we just taken a little bit more time to do that we could have perhaps come up with a solution that might have worked and the long-term better certainly I mean if if you if you ignore the current legislative framework for example and if you ignore the question of who pays hmm then then you would you would take an all-hazards approach and you 'd look at what had happened in the past and how that 's reset the risk for those areas in the future and well while in the district plan you know we 've met the the flooding from rivers in the running from rainfall events and then this coastal inundation or separately and then we 've shown the tsunami areas we 've zoned areas that are subject to liquefaction and on the hills with zoned areas for land and stability risks we do need to think of all of those at once in any one place and then think about the time periods over which they operate so you know there 's it 's quite complex in terms of both that spatial arrangement of the of them are almost certain you know in terms of intense rainfall events in some low-lying basin is across the city I know they 're open D and tidal flooding and you know well well the title and unday shin incorporates the level of sea level rise and looks out 50 and 100 years there are some properties that are at high risk today here and they were at high risk yesterday and they were probably at high risk ten years ago as well some of those properties so there are some that there are in a much more difficult situation than others but but there will be there will be many of those that have had their rustic just a bit category that are at hope have been at high risk for some time there exacerbation by the earthquake that 's right and that to me possibly was a missed opportunity for us to collaborate with government over the you know potential zoning areas because i 'm not there is a side of me that thinks that there were gaps and that process that can only be explained by or not looking at flooding as an issue i think it was a response to the immediate damage and without thinking about consequential impacts and risks yeah the timing of the district bag review with a natural event as ideal for the capsule to make significant changes in the future and there is no better place in the district by anyway that 's being done to be able to change the way that development center the one that I mean I agree with you entirely which is why I totally want to have this dealt with in a short timeframe the problem is the incredible stress and anxiety that complex issues like these on top of the red zoning decisions on top of the failure to resolve rebuilds and repairs on top of the you know lack of certainty about what people are actually doing I mean in a way it couldn 't be at a worse time so it 's the best of times in the worst of times and we 've heard the tale of two cities introduction several times since the earthquake unpacked it so i guess people and their kind of hopes and fears and how we support people and manage all of us Helen referred to I think some work that if you said if I got the right Helen the commission of the environment was doing about impact on communities and I 'm just wondering if that might if for example if we were to invite the Commissioner to talk with us to if in fact that might really assist us were there planning sorry if we were say to as a council to invite the commission of the environment around the work she 's doing and especially how it pertains to Christchurch if in fact that might be further and it 's notwithstanding their excellent information and science we 've had from from very very good people in as well but it 's one of us wins the winds Phoenix report you okay so I phoned Jen rights office and the report was due to be released in the middle of this year I I understand that it 's now going to be later in the year but I don 't have a think it would be better after the reports out yeah so because that will give us a much more you know sort of focusing le the earthquake so we were all waiting for the next Rumble and what was going to fall on what have you since then we 've looked at how to live and accommodate that and there 's a sense of stability and I don 't know how else to describe it you you 're more confident moving forward when you know you 're living in an environment for which you are better prepared or prepare for and I I 'm notwithstanding what you 've said about the stress and this doesn 't it elements and organs we 've got flooding but certainly not coastal inundation but to be able to know this and to be able to plan and build and live a life that accommodates this is that positive i guess moving forward no no and that 's why I 've always felt that the natural hazards chapter gives us an opportunity to have a public conversation that is very much front of mind so moments I 've made these comments before that you know with children you know something happens and you 've got a teachable moment or this is a teachable moment for a city around issues that probably just would generally even terrible expression but wash over people as it as a general you know view that it would it would be kind of like it 's fifty hundred years out it doesn 't have impact me but if we look at this from a community perspective well yes it does because the farriers you know like the residential red zone you know that made a huge difference to our communities you know entire communities were wiped off the face of our map and a very short space of time so this actually gives us an opportunity to and I 'm saying yes I agree with you that it 's positive because people can see we can plan an advanced proactive now yeah and we 're not talking about retreat as you know the front end of the option I mean that was the option that was chosen for the residential red that district plan operates our district plan operates on the basis of adapting about you know so mitigating so floor levels and fill management you know those sorts of things can enable us to live in an environment that could be exposed in the future we can look at what are the impacts of sea walls but you have to look at what that then does to the to the estuary for example so there are all of these different things and there are different mechanisms for managing wet lens for example can can can tone down the strength of a storm event you know all of these things the science that we understand we can make ourselves more secure against those future events whatever they are so it 's it 's a really important conversation for us to be having which is why we 've focused the next four weeks on the education so that people can submit to the independent hearings panel I gleaned then David thank you and just based on what Ellie said if i look at the all right campaign for instance a lot of claims so that 's lack of certainty not knowing the outcome at least this provides outcome although it 's still pretty tough what I 'm what I 've heard over the last year or so and the some of the affected communities is also so Ian used before that phrase I noted that somewhere here it was managed realignment of her adaptation so it was also seen as an opportunity so people aren 't necessarily it 's to retreat they 're talking about opportunity one thing I would say is we talked about a council response by way of the city pan the resilient cities etc the initial feedback I 've had from some of the South New Brighton and South Shore community leaders can we also please have was from the council they still want investment they accept the realities of of the data but they still want the council to to be there and to support them so not only in these ways here you know that they still want us to undertake responsible planning but also investment so I just wanted to feed that back to you an iterative process they mean they want this in but the how question is that yeah you know and they 're happy for us to you know to sit down with us and to work out how to actually kind of disseminate the information I think lesson number one that I got after the sep tember earthquake you know and we 're having the 5th anniversary of that this year you know I remembered the very first public meeting that we had and Bixley actually and the number of older people who said that the pacific park subdivision should never have been built you know then the local knowledge is an important part of understanding the environment my great grandfather in Dunedin said to my dad they should never build in on Abbott 's with no this is decades before it collapsed he was dead right so local knowledge you know this without any science yeah now it didn 't want if the little situation but it 's about responsible planning yeah I 'm David chapter on e then I 'm not sure when I want to talk right we the presentations finished so what we 're just asking questions I 'll hold my dissertation too low right so you haven 't got any questions for though no alright so there any other questions that people want to ask yes Jimmy you because this kind of see they were knows the nature disaster not only the hydro city only probably because the new zealand 's kind of the Enola LePage is whole island is I 'm not sure whether know we might consider Bashir with some other cities like Oakland torrent Gajo bonita valentina sexual weather later information no can share share share is name etc I 'm not sure we have done or not yet it 's absolutely we can and we 've been watching quite carefully the approaches in Auckland with the Auckland unitary plan and we will no doubt be working quite closely with Wellington which is joined 100 resilient City program so yes absolutely we do share information with other councils le three I just I missed that really under the focus on the coast itself what if any is the work around the East jury inundation and I just can 't recall what and those plans that you showed up with those Mets that you shows how far and that comes to you know the I clearly can 't speak it 's been a long week mission are you talking the other side of the Easter II rather than the spurt yeah yeah superior mean bridge in that area oh you know let me go back we don 't have all of the maps on this presentation we 've only got a selection of them Brian but there is that one showing the theory Mead Bromley area so this is the this is the 50-year inundation storm event the light blue with point for me to sea level rise and in the extent of the 100-year storm event with one meter sea level rise so you can see that coming and the mower heathkit there and across theory Mead not much going into our power but tipping across towards lynnwood at the moment we have temporary softbank 's putting emergency defense that are taken into account for this because the secluded in the lidar so are our only sort of resilience that we have at the moment oh no no no sorry okay can somebody explain that this is just like water an underwater out so this is not about how where the the coastline moves to or anything like that the inundation is just water on the ground it may not be breach of floor levels you know so because it depends how high your houses hey no no coastal erosion inundation no no this is this is not this is not the reach of the tide this is just a storm event so this is like our floor level and fill management areas this is mapping what happens when you get a major event yeah I think there 's a bit of misunderstand i think that if people don 't understand this and i thought that this had been explained so i must have switched off at a moment and thought that it had been said these Mets do not show where the new coast liners that these mex do not show the permanent state of appears these maps show what happens in a hundred year horizon so that doesn 't mean that all of the houses in these areas will be swamped and covered in water it may mean that the roads are wet weather than they would be now coastal erosion is a separate set of maps and and coastal erosion only affects the coastline funny that yes but that is essentially part of our clothes fine it 's not verification that this is actually the worst scenario at high tide is that right shouldn 't event coincide with the high tide this would be the kind of the worst scenario so well the way the modeling is done it 's it 's about a 50 year of in 10 to 100 year event so a year the influence of the high titers is is built into that modeling that takes the predictive sea level rise at that time ads in the extreme events that 's for the inundation so you can look at that as a storm events like a rainfall event you know being drastic and overtopping everything and running in where 's the coastal erosion is because he that coastal erosion lines are simplistically where your coast like maybe at that time but you know you and the this one pretty much Maps the floor level and full management area so these people that live in these areas have already had notification under stage to that they are in the floor floor level and full management area as proposed to the independent hearings panel so you know that um you know I 'm at people people in this room will be in the filled floor level and full management area I am I 'm right on the edge of one where I love you 'll be in one Glen because it 's just down the road you might be just on the edge over this over the edge yeah you can check online you are you outside yes yeah I 'm not I 'm just I 'm just on the inside so I 'm right on the border of it but you know i mean the you know the floor management areas have been in place since the flood management areas as they previously were known have been january two thousand eleven so people people know about them people knew they were coming on because i mean i recall i recall when i was a brand new member of parliament and you know just doing a little bit of history here that the brand new and the east actually at the time so i wasn 't a brand new in paper and the Easter Wars brooklyn 's was in my electorate and in brooklyn 's they had the three floor levels so they had the 50-year the pre building act level so they were some that were right down they then had the 50-year building eight level and then some new developers had come on and decided to seek their floor levels at the new variation 48 levels because they knew it was going to be operationalized and who did I get complaints from I got complaints from constituents whose properties were like this so their profit because the subdivision was built up here the fence actually provided only and it might have been a normal-sized fence on on this side of the property but on this side to their neighbors and I 'm watching that now as we do rebuilds n repairs through our parklands for example I went and visited someone the other day and you can look over the fence at the next door neighbors this is one of the problems of well I personally think it 's a slight problem with lack of integration and planning around a mixture of repairs and rebuilds and oh I think I wrote a little bit to that effect or to the council back in 2011 but there you go Glen and Ian Andrew thank you if I couldn 't just reflect back one concern about that which i have and i have sent her an email so but if I could ask it publicly it 's about the floor levels and a concern from some of the community that houses are built to a certain level and then a new level comes out how is that affecting insurability and the bank ability and the cover on the house yeah there 's this some anxiety there are you happy to talk about _"

    "text": "a consideration of the natural hazards chapter but we agreed last time that we would start with a presentation on natural hazards we 've had the ability to do that for ourselves and now we want to have it essentially online so that people can see the presentation that we 've had to fully appreciate the process that we 're going through so just quickly before we start that I 'll just quickly run through the order of play so we 're going to do the stage to natural hazards which is coastal erosion coastal inundation high hazard flooding areas first that will be followed by the natural and cultural heritage chapter the coastal environment chapter held over from stage to the central city the specific purpose zone flatland recovery which is the residential red zone and quote marks cranford Basin provisions to be included into the residential chapter and then some minor changes that were notified in stage two but need to be amended to allow consideration of stage three meters as a package and and some of the special purpose zones are in that particular grouping as well and I just want to make a quick comment particularly in light of the headline on the press this morning and and then we 'll go straight into the presentation did you I presume that will do them chapter by chapter is that that is what you did last time and then there is a group just an overall recommendation as well yeah sit so I just want to start with the the newspaper report this morning because I think just to see it a little bit of context for what we are doing here today and I 've got no no problems with the article itself the problem is the headliner and often is that person who writes the article doesn 't write the headline that the sub editors job is to attract people 's attention to the story and so and you have to capture that and even less characters then I tweet so you don 't have a lot of space to send a message that draws people 's attention to the story so thousands of homes at risk there 's a compelling headline you 'd want _:_153.95 is that thousands of homes are not at immediate risk we 're talking about time frame that spans 50 years and spans a hundred years based on predictions in relation to sea level rise and that is what we are required to do by law as a council we 're required to look at our coastline we 're required to make these assessments and we 're required to put in place rules for development in those areas that will be exposed to risk in the future so it is a very good well it 's a legal requirement for us to do this in Christchurch we 're faced with the situation where we are doing what would normally be done over a 10-year period in a very truncated timeframe this is good for the city overall overall to have a district plan completely rewritten and three years is good because I recall dealing with one component 11 plan change under the previous arrangements and it was of course the flood management areas previously known as and now known as the full level and no floor level and fill management areas took over five years from the beginning of the process to what was variation 48 plan changed 48 it took from 2004 in its inception 2005 and the notification through to 2010 to be ready to be operationalized it was operationalized on the thirty-first of january 2011 just three weeks before the devastating earthquake that changed our land form forever so to take advantage of what we 've been offered in terms of having a an opportunity to change our entire district plan in this time frame I think it 's a very good opportunity for the city but it does mean that we are having to address hugely challenging issues at a time when the very communities that are affected by this are hugely challenged themselves challenge with decisions around rebuilds around repairs around floor levels around full management all of these issues are affecting these areas the one helpful element to throw into the mix and relation to the story this morning and the headline is there most of the homes or a significant number of the homes that are going to be notified of the potential of but in particular coastal inundation are already and the floor level and full management areas they 've already been notified that they are exposed to that risk and this is just simply repeating the level of risk that they face coastal erosion is more challenging because we have an accreting beach and so the con set of coast to erosion is hugely challenging for people in an environment where people understand that their beach has moved but of course our coastline has moved over millennia and that 's a time frame that we 're not having fortunately to deal with but our coastline used to go back as far as Nancy 's always called us on the corner of record on road and immediately office at hagley park so the other side of Headley Park used to be the coastline of Christchurch it has gone backwards and forwards but that is over millennia as I say the timeframes that we have to look at our 50 years and a hundred years fortunately we do not have to try and predict the future and that respect but this is not our which is that the independent hearings panel will decide this we 're not notifying this today we 're making a decision as to as to what is notified today and then it is notified in four weeks time and at that time it will go to the independent hearings panel so people will make submissions on what we notify today it is the independent hearings panel that will hear those submissions and they will make the decision so you know lobbying councillors you know putting you know sort of pressure on the organization it 's it 's not it 's not helpful when it 's not useful what is really useful is that people understand what is actually what we 're based the our decisions on and what the independent hearings panel will be looking for and we are here to assist our communities make those submissions so on Thursday next week we will begin with a a series at the hub so at the east gate Center I haven 't got the exact time but we 'll have the times online at the hub that 's the beginning of before it as notified on that on July the 25th the we 've talked to community boards with talk to community leaders that started last night and what we heard last night was that people wanted to work out their own ways of engaging with the council and so that it could help a meaningful submission process and so we 're inviting communities that are affected to let us know what it is that they would want from us by way of support in order to help them with submissions but also to help them understand what the chapter that we 're notifying says the other thing is that we have made it available online for people to be able to search their individual properties so people will be able to go online they can do that now the trouble was is that the the newspaper did kind of preempt that and we didn 't quite have it online before eight thirty this morning but it is online now so anyone who 's already gone online to check their property and they want to and they couldn 't get on there now and it 's all up and running available for people to do it said dub dub dub ccc govt t dot nzd coastal hazards thank goodness i had that in front of me that was a there was a there was a very good interjection thank you very much so i hope that that sits a bit of a framework and atone for today you know and thank you very much for agreeing to come and present to us but you know today as an opportunity for us to have something online that people can reference and the can help them get through what is going to be clearly a challenging time obviously for many who are in these areas who haven 't thought of themselves as being susceptible to a risk but I repeat the fact that the risk is not an immediate risk it 's not an immediate threat but if we don 't look at the risks at this time going forward then I 'm we 're going to be setting up a future council for some pretty hard decisions that could be avoided by have available to us so on that note I will hand over to you and ask for the presentation thank you thank you as you 've noted Christchurch is a low-lying coastal city and the coastline has moved in past times and residents who live close to the coast are well aware of this they understand the natural environment and understand the potential for storm events to both disrupt their lives and damaged properties so the council 's undertaken a series of studies into coastal hazards over the past few years the first one in 1999 was undertaken by Tolkien and Taylor the second was released in 2013 and this third more detailed study was specifically commissioned to support the proposed mapping of coastal hazards in the district plan so just to have a look at what 's in place already Environment Canterbury have to coastal hazard zones in place and they show the land with limits of the active beach system so where you have both accretion and erosion processes operating and that coastline moves and announce and that 's over a 50-year period and then over a 100-year of mapping there are new scientific methods to model and predict the outcome and there are new statutory considerations so that 's why we are updating this week new coastal hazards assessment work looks primarily at to coastal hazards that 's coastal erosion and coastal inundation and the district plan also mets the tsunami risk that 's max that 's mapped looking at the maximum probable event which is a distant source tsunami and we 'll look at a little more of that later but the token and taylor report itself simply addresses the coastal erosion and coastal inundation now the coastal inundation which is flooding from the sea is mapped in terms of a 150 event and a 1 in 100 year event the coastal erosion we 're looking at what will unfold over the next 50 years and over the next 100 so the inundation work there are two models used for the unen there 's the simple bathtub model which is used for the open coast and the areas around akaroa and littleton and it 's exactly what it sounds like it 's just all water level up along the coast the water will come with sea level rise over the next 50 and 100 years and in storm events but within the Easter II we 're using a dynamic model which is a name to flow and that 's simply because the bathtub model would overestimate the flooding in the history and up the lower reaches of the oven and the heathkit if we use that one now just before we get into the detail of the report will just take a small diversion into the numbers and we often talk about our 50-year events which is a return period for a flood and scientists will also use the annual exceedence probability so that 's the likelihood of a flood so a 50-year event there is a two percent likelihood of that event in any one year if you look out ten years there 's an 18-percent likelihood of that event and 10 years and if we go out to 70 years and you might own a property for 70 years then you 're pretty sure you 'll get one of those is the seventy-six percent so what we need to remember when we talk about this is that these are random events and we 're talking about probabilities so it 's nothing to do with regularity and predictable timetables study areas have focused on coastal hazards where we have settlements and where we have key road links so that 's why these study areas were chosen so the open coast from the Waimakariri south down along this foot and the settlements around akaroa harbour and lyttelton harbour so those are all mapped end up online now well we 've always had coastal hazards we are now faced with an increasing threat from global climate change and particularly sea level rise so this work has used the latest science to plan for sea level rise of up 2.4 of a metre over the next 50 years and up to one meter over the next 100 years now that is drawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and their fifth assessment obviously we will continue to monitor what these predictions are and update this work in any future studies now as noted before the national policy for at least 100 years into the future so that 's why we 've looked at these 50 and 100 year periods are going to coastal inundation this is a is a simplified version of the diagram that you 'll see in the tonkin and taylor report and it just looks at the mechanism of flooding from the sea so coastal inundation is caused by a combination of factors a storm event comes with a low pressure system and that pressure system effectively lifts the level of the sea on top of that you get the effect of waves driving onto the coast and if you get all of that on a high tide you get these quite significant storm events and there 's a photograph the era of New Brighton back in July and you may remember their recent examples of the storm damage and Wellington over the past few weeks that 's looking north from appear so there 's a number of detailed maps on the report and you 've got them displayed on boards around the room and these are all up online this one 's the based and incorporates progressive sea-level rise so the lights blue shows the reach of the water and a 50-year storm with point four meters of sea level rise incorporated and the darker blue shows the 100-year event with one meter sea level rise incorporated now you need to remember that while this is mapped over the terrain and looks as though it 's over the top of those buildings there the maps show the extent of the flooding and don 't indicate the depth so the flooding is generally deeper closer to the coast and shallower on that higher ground and mend this one is them the lower heathcott veli and indicates the pattern of flooding around the theory meet area and you 'll see that flooding tipped back towards the city through Lynwood there and that 's quite a different pattern of flooding than we would have seen prior to the earthquakes so if plates have changed the patterns of flooding across the city and in some places where we 've got half a meter or 1 metre of subsidence we 've effectively had our 50 years or 100 so to coastal erosion now the concept of shoreline retreat is the sea level rises as relatively simple as the the water level comes up the line of mean high water Springs or the reach of the high tide migrates in land so that that one 's relatively simple and that 's the sort of model that 's used around the Acharya and Littleton coasts but on the open coast where we 've got a plentiful supply of sediments there 's a number of different processes of work of that work so it 's quite convicts a very dynamic environment and so there are quite sophisticated models that have been built to predict the likely behavior of this coastline over time if you look at the model rule be pardoned if you look at the model you 'll see on far right hand side there 's an arrow coming out that 's showing that long-term accretion so that 's showing the supply of sediments and the fact that that coastline is constantly moving out and expanding the beach and the June system that 's interrupted by periodic storm events where 10 even 15 meters of beachy send you away and run event at present and for the next 50 years or so the models tell us that that beach will continue to accrete so the supply of sediment will keep pace with those periodic erosion events but somewhere between fifty and a hundred years or beyond that will turn and the the retreat due to sea level rise will start to overtake that long-term accretion of feet now this is just an example of the data that 's gone into this and apologies it 's a little hard to see on that dark background but it 's showing the monitoring results for the June at hood street and New Brighton and the trend over time is for that June to move out and the beach to accrete but you can see that interruption by periodic storm events where you get a rapid regression of that coastline and then you get a build-up and then again you get a storm event that takes it out so sorry is that when it goes below the line that 's the storm event so win the line starts to go down there 's a that 's a storm event and then you get that rise as it builds up again and then you get the drop and then the line shows the overall trend here 's a yeah no no sorry I was just simply asking for a description of what was in front of us I don 't want that will leave questions to the end so coming to the maps the the issue of coastal erosion is is well illustrated along the spit where you have got the modeling on both sides so on the open Coast side you 'll see the coastal erosion zones which are and the lights green for the 50 year period and the dark green for the 100-year period are very narrow so what they 're doing there is essentially mapping the active beach where we 've got those systems of those processes of erosion and accretion operating but on the history side you can see the much wider zones where you 're getting the line of mean high water Springs and where the high tide reaches that 100-year period going to an example out on banks peninsula this one is per hour and you 'll note again you 've got the light green which is the area within which we expect the shoreline to retreat over the next 50 years and the dark agree over which it could retreat over the next 100 years you also note that there 's no mapping on either side of that soft sandy beach area and that 's because the majority of the shoreline around both a grower and Littleton harbors are hard cliffs and there 's no no erosion expected their terms of the number of properties that are affected the these these numbers as you 've said are all online this morning so within coastal erosion zone 1 we have a little over 2,500 properties and coastal erosion to a little over four and a half thousand properties now the mathematicians amongst you will be doing mental arithmetic I know and Eddie coastal erosion wine and coastal erosion too and finding it doesn 't doesn 't equal the summit bottom and this because of course there are a number of properties which have a little bit of coastal erosion zone 1 and a little bit of coastal erosion zone 2 and of course they 're counted in each of those but only counted once on the total and similarly for the coastal inundation zones we 've got a little over 10,000 and almost 13,000 properties and those zones 1 and 2 and 17,000 although now as was noted before those 17,000 properties over ninety-five percent of those properties are already met within the floor level and film management areas so that but hazard there is well known and it 's a combination of the of the fluval pluvial and tidal flooding drivers that we 've talked about before from the rivers from rainfall events and from the sea the additional properties are largely because we 've now met these an undated zones out on banks peninsula so those banks peninsula settlements will now have the floor level and filled type controls looking at tsunami now this this is the mapping of what is predicted to happen if we get magnitude nine earthquake over in South America and whether tide makes a big difference to the impact on our coast so on the right-hand side we 've got a map where that deep dark red is showing where water is more than two and a half meters deep and that 's the tsunami arriving on the high tide now this this is met for information purposes in the district plan but our response is primarily a civil defense response so there are warning systems in place and evacuation procedures that would be undertaken now we 're taking this presentation out to communities and as notices we had a session last night with community board chairs and community leaders and we 've put together some brochures which give a plain language explanation of the work that 's been undertaken all of this will be available online we 've got a series of public presentations during July and as well as the district plan drop-in sessions and of course that property search function is up and running on the website this morning and I did test it it is working yeah very arts being tested around the room now well this replacement district plan the information is of course being used by a number of units across council and no doubt by by other councils so it will feed into the natural hazard strategy work that is part of both 100 resilient cities and the natural hazards strategy being developed in cooperation with Environment Canterbury and our neighboring councils catchable university and the Canterbury District Health Board of course are also involved in these initiatives the council is also responding to the threat of climate change rise and the development of its infrastructure program for example moving water supply wells and land if we get salt water intrusion into the aquifers the installation of pressure and vacuum sewer systems and looking at coastal roads and via the routes for those in any defenses that are needed also worth noting that there are options for managing both river and tidal flood threat now these will inevitably be a mix of taking care of our natural defenses particularly the dune system along the open coast making room for our rivers and that may indeed relate to future use of the residential red zone susceptible to tidal flooding and then looking at hard engineering options we 're also of course working with Wellington so climate change and sea level rise is not only a problem for Christchurch it 's a threat faced by a number of towns and cities around New Zealand and worldwide so there 's already been correspondence between the mayor and the Minister for the environment on the need for better national policy guidance on responding to the challenges of climate change and we 've also worked with the parliamentary commissioner for the environments team that is investigating the vulnerability of coastal communities and potential adaptation responses so we expect that report to come out later this year in terms of the district can review I don 't want to get into the detail of that except to say that there is a two tiered approach to coastal hazard management as we have had in the past so we are retaining that two tiered approach with the 50-year hazard zones in the 100-year hazard zones with the more restrictive rules for the high risk areas and as noted that tsunami mething questions right Allie quick one on the GC that shot of the water the mendation of the governor 's beta t what happened cause that was a tsunami event that was a quite a large one America yeah Brian that 's about mid sidemen 205 so it doesn 't show the possible so what 's the data on Tim right thanks and the height of the surge at that when the tie was midway you what what was the height of the pursued sort of the from tsunami yeah clean thank you my understanding is the recommended Sandrine height is it saw the 78 meters from beginners that you 'll I had paintings about a days until Im thank you for the clear presentation and those we booklets will be good for us this counts as two of course but I just want to ask you about so that one turning points you refer to where the round the dunes with you you see the accretion will turn between 50 and after fifty and a hundred year time span could you sort of just elaborate a wee bit more on crucial point too painful yes and it comes back to the probabilities in the random events so do you want to go back to that slide cuz thanks bets don 't know o XO wanted to do yeah because i think that 's that 's an area that you know that it 's challenging for a lot of people because because of the accretion go to forward I think the picture is better that one year yeah so I think I think the thing to the thing to remember here is that these are models in predictions and there 's a famous old physical chemist niels bohr who said predictions are difficult especially about the future and and then is true so what we 're dealing with here is is random physical events and we cannot predict with any certainty exactly where and when the coast will be you know at any particular point so these these models around the open coast what we 've used for the 50 year production is a probabilistic model so we we 've got a 66 percent likelihood that the coastline that that will then for the for the 100-year event we have looked at the potential erosion so we 've gone to a five percent likelihood for that but I I 'll hand over to n right dr. Enright to talk more about the processes at work because he 's a coastal scientist and we 'll be able to give you a better a better understanding _"

    "text": "Jamie I 'm voting in favor of us having a future I 'm voting in favor of us getting audit sign off one of the fundamental jobs of accounts or was to actually put together a budget I know that sounds relatively straightforward but maybe it is used to some finding a way to actually pay the X with Y is simply how you balance the books if you don 't have audit sign off you don 't have a budget if you don 't have a budget well you don 't really have a democracy or a city because you might as well pack up and go home because you 've failed as a council and I believe that as a council we haven 't failed I believe there 's account so we 've worked very well together to put together a plan which which isn 't going to please all the people all the time as Ellie said but it I think it is an across-the-board compromise I think that it 's very cognizant to the fact that recovery isn 't about one thing I believe that the are putting together a budget that a council needs to do is that they want a basic stand they they want that the toilets to flush they want the water to run they want the roads to be fixed as soon as possible and I think you need to make sure that that 's happening first and foremost on your energies are go into that but then there are other things around that it 's that 's the seat of the of the chair but there are leagues that hold that up and that 's an economy that 's the infrastructure that 's culture there 's a there 's a whole HUDs it 's about having an affordable sitting no no one air speed on its own as important as it may be any use if you don 't have the rest I 've said this before but you know having a having the finest flushing toilets and the southern hemisphere doesn 't mean that we 've recovered if you 've got no one living there to actually flushed those toilets then it was a bit of a waste of that you 've got to know that people can get jobs see you a jobs and born yeah absolute that Lee there but then you need to be able to have a house to live in so you can actually get to go to work great that you can actually drive on cyclone or walk down to be able to get to their job as there lots of available sections and gore yes there is but there 's a declining population there are so many aspects that need to be coupled together to try and find that find that equilibrium that 's we strive well that 's that 's the job that we try to do every day when we have those decisions and we have those debates because there 's no one answers about people 's judgment cause with their experiences and their knowledge and their expertise to work together and try and find out where that we 're that sweet spot is for the city I believe that we can put together a plan today and have this past it meets all its sign off and it delivers a city to have good quality of life today a good quality of life tomorrow and a future that when chessmen I get married we have children that hopefully our future children then we 'll be as proud of of Christchurch 's as we are because there 's what it 's about as a 10-year plan it 's about sitting down that vision I am proud that we 're actually are going to be two percent cheaper a two percent lower rates rise than what oakland city has just signed off i wanted less net you can 't_''_187.459 please all the people all the time and there 's nothing about this plan that pleases me entirely i get that though i would have liked to have seen lower rates there but it 's still two percent of a lower increased in auckland and we 've had one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the world we 're at the stage of recovery with rubber hits the road and we have so many challenges and we 're putting together something which is which is two percent cheaper cheaper New Zealand which is the one that 's larger than a larger city in New Zealand the only thing that I 'd like to add to around this is I fundamentally don 't think that the citizens of the city get that get caught up and the People 's Republic of Christ or anything like that so much I actually think that it 's pretty basic they just want to know that what they want is going to be there I don 't think they give a hoot about who owns it when I go to a car park building I want to know there 's going to be availability I want to know that there 's going to be an affordable price to get that service and I don 't think it really matters who owns it I don 't think that necessarily a contracting company you have kept city care that that is listed on paper is doing the avon river precinct procession subcontractors that are doing it you 've got Johnston 's contracting is what you 'll see there so it 's not actually anyone anyone company the ownership of the companies so much is the strategic element I think you 've got to look at the big picture of this and what makes a strategic asset strategic is it just the fact you just want to say that you only because it 's the people 's republic or is the fact that you can ensure a quality of a product or service of the city that you 're there to help and I believe that we call items strategic because they deliver a benefit so if you can deliver that benefit to the people of Christchurch I think it 's irrelevant who does it I 'll be 20 more seconds and wrap this up ultimately I think that we 're a council of partnerships and I think that around the car park buildings whoever is delivering out whoever we as long as the something is delivered for our people that 's all that matters you get out of bed to make this place a better City doing that with this plan finally I didn 't agree with the likes of the removal of the northern arterial a as a strategic asset because I see it as the Rhine of the future I see it as the effectively the key core strategic power port of the city I sorry data port of the city if you will but be that as it may we 've worked together we 've got a plan there and I want to thank all of my colleagues that I 've worked with over this time the auditors the staff that have put in so much work and also the mere who sit on a platform of unity and I and I think she 's done that really well we haven 't_''_351.32 agreed all the time at all around the table but I think that we have been united and I 'm really proud of that and I 'm proud of what aliens done over her time as mere so far so you 've got to be a big boy about this and you wouldn 't_:_365.21 your batter was along the way and you lose your battles along the way I won some I lost some but at the end of the day you don 't and and now you endorse the plan together and I think they would send it s i didn 't get everything along the way but that 's fine we now need to sign it off and do really the one thing that you need to do as a council and in sign off a budget so i toid you all to support that as we 've had the debates along the way so thanks to everyone and and let 's get the job don 't get on with it a clean thank you as a ward councillor I 'm delighted to see the affirmative action taken boards you brighten by way of an additional 3 million into the master plan it took me three attempts to get this council to adopt a master panda christchurch partly caused by the fact that there was only one ward councillor for beer would pegasus while while the other stood down and i could get the support at the time but i 'm delighted that money will now flow to promote that plan i believe that once the yeast recovers the will be too as a city councillor I 'd like to vote for this plan financial covenant we have the net debt to revenue ratio upon which our financial strategy is rested in which we cannot exceed 250 percent is now predicting a peak of two hundred and eleven percent giving us the three hundred million dollar head room twice the amount as councillor buck said before i 'd like to vote for this plan because the great for christchurch initiative will save 178 million over the life of the pan much of that do to our good procurement policy enabling good whole of life cost savings the only policy this council had prior to this was a tender policy which was so short I could have tweeted it to you but this policy enables whole of life cost savings it 's also the visible expression of this councils transparency right to the vote for this plan because the net interest expense reduction following reduction and interest revenue over the life of the plan is projected to be 194 million dollars like to vote for this plan due to the tied up with our cost share partner because they are significantly behind schedule we are making savings see on page 114 of today 's agenda and I quote the rebuild of facilities included under the cost share agreement are significantly behind schedule any delay in delivery reduces our borrowing and operating costs wittingly or unwittingly our cost share partner go shaving themselves and by association us the cost share agreement they are unable to meet their own deadlines over the anchor projects the multi sports complex being a case in point the first three years of the plan our commitments there were to be 15 million dollars fifty dollars are fifty million dollars and in 50 and a half million now due to that delay the commitments for us a five hundred and twenty thousand thirty six million and then 37 moon a trend is emerging with them whether it 's with the projects and which we are tied up such as the multi sports stadium or the earthquake memorial for those they want to do such as the convention center they can 't get them across the line in qe2 will have been running for two years and do for a repaint it delays to continue for our part delays caused by planning and I 've been advised that we are addressing that for our costs year partner in others in this city as we 've seen delays are caused at pre-construction particularly around developing business cases and moving from procurement to construction even if these issues ironed out soon the delays will remain construction prices will increase in the meantime they were one and a half percent a month two years ago undoubtedly much higher now causing projects to be revised resulting in less pressure on our financial strategy as we as far as we are tied into projects with the crown I would have liked to voted for this pain on the basis of their evidence that things will get better but Wednesday was the tipping point for me because following a more than reasonable amendment from councillor tuna which was that any release of capital and years two and three of the LTP occur only is absolutely necessary by means other than the sale of company far-reaching review and reprioritization of all aspects of the capital program with the expectation that all budgets will be fully interrogated and reductions proposed where possible the council still resolved to take assets off its strategic assets list apart from the port the airport and Orion notwithstanding that one of the now apparently non-strategic assets city care had a dividend payment in in 2014 higher than the port 5.7 million over and against the ports 2 million in comparable to the airport 6.6 million but now apparently and amazingly it 's non-strategic debt resolution by this council enabling it to sell down or off assets without going through a special consultative procedure leaves us exposed to review diminishes our transparency and undermines our democracy all because of this persistent feverish desire to sell down or off assets taking the line of least resistance and kayaking terms we call it taking the chicken route because it 's easy and the face of factual evidence the will of our community by four to one eighty-three percent the sense of loss of control over its assets is noted in the agenda this council support this recommendation thank you like a few around this table that 's nothing to say I 'm not a politician as there 's a first time I stood as a counselor and I stood as a counselor or so I got it I should say because I wanted to get a city up and running and the read one of the reasons I wanted to get a city back up and running as I 'm a one-eyed Canterbury in my family is and I hope that one day when my children spread their wings and fly they will fly far and they will fly high but at one day they will come back and East in this city and to do that we 've got to make some our decisions and I 'm sorry the term was used to chicken route because no decision around this table made by anyone or debated has been the chicken route I believe I 'm really proud that we 've managed to keep like rates as low as they have if you look at the Auckland signing off at nine percent we are I think that this whole city can be proud i 'm really proud that we 've kept community funding at previous levels we heard people talk about the most vulnerable in our city that is a far wider term than it was before so I 'm really pleased with that through the arm hearings we listened to submitters and we really understood that a three key assets were a Ryan and the ports and they add strategic there 's no question about that we also heard through their to hearing people wanted things right across the board people wanted and you could be look at it negatively and say that was selfish but when we talk about resilience and when we talk about vulnerable we talk about our whole communities through this plan of putting pools in New Brighton and investing in you brighten and the east we 're looking at a pool and Boston we 're looking at Paul 's in the southwest these are things that our communities really need not only do we need that emphasis truck sure repaired but we need to be moving forward as also need to put that it value back into the resilience we talked about rather than a spear when you see something positive happen that gives the city and the people in the city of left so I think we 've really got to move forward we 've heard about the UM the returns than the dividends over the last ten years well we 're here and we 're now and we 've got to make some decisions and they are hard decisions and I am really proud to be sitting around this table with the people that I am moving forward and so I am supporting the muse recommendation thank you okay brief thank you I stood for counsel on a simple platform of finance community and strategy I believe with all the hard work we 've done over the last year we 've solved our financial problems have a clear strategy and a defined pathway for further examination of our expenditure and our revenue plans as mentioned our debt profile is much better than expected we have cut operating costs and we have prioritized a capital expenditure we begins next week we have opportunities to look at our debt structure and see if we can lower our funding costs and it 's clear that we have multiple options around a capital release program many of which will not involve equity sales so I 'd like to thank Peter and the finance team for all the hard work they 've done in this area and the continuing work that they will do I 'm really excited by the progress we have made with our engagement with our communities we have signaled very very clearly our desire to empower them to make decisions about issues that concern them we have proposed a new community currency which will provide another way to support our local economies I 'd payment for community contribution and build a more diverse financial platform we have also looked at how we can work with communities to help them deliver projects and outcomes that they both want and have the ability to deliver and manage themselves whether it 's jetties walkways parks playgrounds whatever they choose reminded of a well-known Ronald Reagan quote where he said the we 're from the government and we 're here to help what I want our organization to be saying is hello we 're from the council how can we help that is how we want to engage with our communities I 'd like to applaud Carlene and her team for their clear intention to make the council in enabling and responsive organization that serves the community I 've been involved in strategy development for a long time and essentially it boils down to this where do you want to go and how are you going to get there if you don 't know where you 're going any road will take you there we must be clear where this city is going and how we are going to take of it the challenges are numerous infrastructure housing climate change immigration financial markets these are big global issues but they affect us locally how do we regenerate and build resilience into our city how do we recreate a city that supports its citizens health and well-being because in the end that 's what it 's all about but as all these we develop more affordable housing how can we build smarter and more resilient infrastructure how do we respond to the issues of flooding and heavy rope how do we get the right creative talent to move to our city and stay how do we develop a more sustainable financial system an affordable rates which is a key issue for many of our community now that this long-term process is out of the way thankfully we need a really good conversation about how we develop a compelling vision for our city and how we deliver it with that in mind I urge you to support the mayor and i should say at this point that she has done an incredible job in Mendeley difficult circumstances by urge you to pass this long term plan and get on with the job our job of taking the city into the next phase of regeneration and long-term resilience thank you just to conclude the debate I wanted to make one point to start and that is that the foundation of a democratic society is one which relates and is accountable to its citizens and us in a strong position as a council to stand on our own two feet we haven 't been able to do that up until now because constantly we 've been in a position of expectation expectation around insurance recoveries expectation around further government contribution to our horizontal infrastructure spend but those expectations are not something that we can base our long-term plan on and as we said right from the outset because we don 't know what we don 't know at this point we have to make this LTP a base case that 's all it is it 's a starting point it 's a platform for the next phase of our development as a city and i do want us to think positively and optimistically about what we can leave as a legacy because i don 't want our legacy to be a constant refrain about the financial challenges that we have to confront i want to think of the disaster that has happened to our city to actually be an opportunity to do things that we never thought we could do before i would like the way of doing local government I would like to see governance change in our city in a way that is empowering and enabling and not directive and controlling and I think that people might hear what I 'm saying when I 'm saying that so I do want to talk about how important it is that we don 't stand on the sidelines criticizing those that went before and those who made decisions based on the best possible information that they had at the time and actually made decisions when neither of them understood what the others position truly was and and so I will list the challenges that shall we certainly did get blindsided by and know that the deputy mayor has highlighted some of those but signing obligations to fund anchor projects regardless of insurance recoveries but assuming full recovery for those assets in the three year plan would have failed the audit process that we are required to meet and establishing a long-term plan over ten years so the three-year plan was not an accurate document and that regard and it would have failed the audit test infrastructure component of the cost sharing agreement would include reinstating all damaged infrastructure when specific reference was made to eligibility under the civil defense and emergency management arrangements and I remember David East and I going to the civil defense in an emergency management plan to try and get an assessment of what eligibility actually meant but there is no question that the people who signed the cost sharing agreement for the council believed that all of the earthquake damaged infrastructure was covered by the cost sharing agreement and it has been a shock to a number of people within the organization to find that that was not what was signed up to but there is further discussions that we need to have with central government and that regard so it 's not the end of that particular story it just means that we can 't include it on our long-term plan not being clear enough about under insurance I mean I don 't know why anyone thinks that the rest of New Zealand should pay the price for our under insurance why should we pass on to the taxpayers generally it doesn 't matter who was to blame the truth is is who is responsible and we have to step up and take responsibility for the financial situation that we are in during the process of bringing and quarter mentha and Cameron partners we 've been able to assess our financial position in a way that has really assisted the process of the long implant but one of the documents that I found and there were two documents that I was particularly interested in the first document that they found for us was a Treasury paper advising ministers brownlee in English and November 2011 about what would be the basis for a cost sharing arrangement with Christchurch City and this is where the New Zealand would come to the party in terms of supporting Christchurch and these were the principles consistency with recovery the financial pressure on the council from cost-sharing should be such that it economize as innervates and restricts its expenditure to high-value users but not such that it is unable to play a full role in the recovery so it was a direction to the council fairness both the crown and the council are under pressure and cost should be feared shared fairly between these parties durability the arrangement arrangement should leave the crown and council with sustainable finances in the short medium and long term there for the analysis of cost sharing options should be more focused on the overall impact on council and crown finances rather than on component cost-sharing elements I think you 're seeing where the mistakes were made because actually the principles are great but it 's not how it was applied and practice when it came down to component cost-sharing elements incentives cost-sharing should incentivize prioritization that 's what we have to do we have to prioritize our work accountability and value for money specifically cost-sharing should include good performance measures to track recovery progress most importantly both parties need to make a more than nominal contribution to costs to effectively manage these costs and so the principles were laid out at the end of 2011 at the end of 2012 the crown did a full assessment or he completed a full assessment of the council 's financial position and was required 740 million dollars everyone knew the scale of the problem back then it was december 2012 but there was no public transparency about the challenges that the council was being asked to take on it 's a shame that people were allowed to run for election not knowing the truth of the reality that we would have to confront and it seems to me that one of the things that we do with this plan is put it all out in the open there is nothing to hide it is all now crystal clear and what we are doing is we are allowing the next team of people who sit around this table or who put themselves forward for public office to actually do so and the full knowledge of the financial challenges that the council has and the fact that the council has the capacity within its own asset base to address those issues and there is nothing and passing my resolution today that says that we are selling core infrastructure assets what it requires is if it is needed the release of capital that shows that resolution would enable now but the thing that I really want to talk about is actually not about the finances I kind of believe that there 's been a lot of discussion around that today I want to talk about what people came to talk to us about that weren 't weren 't here as part of a campaign that was generated these were the people who came with the house of their communities to the for whether they were communities of place whether they were communities of identity or whether they were communities of interest they called on the council not to do things for them they called on the council to partner with them in a whole new way of doing local government whether it was to rebuild a GT or whether it was to develop a strategic overview for the Arts it was do it with us not do it for us and several networks like creative communities offered to help the council tackle the wicked problems of our age from homelessness to preparing for the impacts of climate change their submissions highlighted the enormous talent and share it with the city we 've been asked to join a time bank something which could be a precursor to a new way of paying rates as we 've heard the Canterbury employers Chamber of Commerce quoted Harvard 's Dutch Lynyrd who said we need to be thinking about writing the great tale ones of our time life 's changing I mean things are going to be so different are we going to have buses and the way that we have buses I mean the taxi industry around the world has been completely thrown into disarray by uber and will we have an uber bus system in the future I mean we don 't know how things are going to change and yet we 're making major infrastructure decisions based on the way the city is now and yet we have an opportunity to build for the future I mean I honestly think that we should be working with our community and thinking about different ways and actually we should be leading the way we should be the most sustainable city in our country but unfortunately we are we made to knock down buildings that are perfectly that are perfectly repairable the chamber also said that the underpinning focus for our future has to be place making not building buildings and that 's what brings people to the equation I found the chambers of mission to be incredible they said we need to create dynamic planning models supported by nimble delivery using multiple financing models phased processes and incremental improvements and they set out some principles that give a framework for investment decisions they said decision-making had to be open and transparent they said crown and council should operate as a partnership they said a city with a thriving central core needed well-connected suburbs so it 's not just about the central city it 's about connecting at all Builders has capacity to allow for growth learn to live with water and we want our eastern suburbs to flourish and I think that what they 've managed to sum up and beer submission are the challenges that our city has had to confront but this is an opportunity for us to put an put in place really a line in place a long-term plan which says we can stand on our own we don 't need to have additional support from outside that doesn 't mean we won 't be asking for it I certainly will but what it does say is that we have the capacity to take on the leadership role that the city elected us to undertake as we move into the transition phase which has been announced we 're not far away from a transition recovery plan being put into the public arena and I will be very interested to see whether the people of Christchurch think that we are ready to take on that leadership role and I hope that this decision enables us to do just that and on that note i will put the emotion and we 'll put the screen up so those in favor press use those opposed say no and that is carried thank you very much and we have another set of resolutions which I believe we can move as a block _"

    "text": "this is the this is the this is the one that we will debate so I would like to perhaps invite the deputy mere to to start the debate on the long-term plan for 2015 20 25 you know that 's that 's fine Andrew thank you and there 's much in this long-term plan and in the mayor 's recommendations which now form a part of it that I do support particularly when compared to the draft long-term plan that went out for consultation I welcome the lower rates increases I welcome to reductions in the capital program I welcome the additional funding for new brighton I welcome the reinstatement of the full amount of community funding and the proposal to leave the core infrastructure assets Orion report and the airport on the strategic assets list that 's the reason I 've already voted in favor of the majority of the plan which is in front of us four options today because I am happy with it but there are some parts of the plan but unfortunately I have some real difficulty with this plan involves taking the lancaster parking off to strategic assets list it puts forward the position that these assets are not strategic I find it difficult to see how the council providing quality public transport to keep its people moving on reliable buses can be considered not to be strategic among many submissions pointing out the importance of central city parking the Central City Business Association which is not to remove off street parking from this list these issues were well debated earlier this week when we rate an amendment to keep these things on the list of strategic assets but the key point is that this proposal will make it easier for council to sell these entities without further consultation with the public and I can 't possibly support that this plan allows for consideration of capital raising by ways other than the sale of assets that 's common sense and I welcome that but at the same time it also still allows for the sale of 750 million dollars worth of assets which I can 't possibly support it proposes consultation prior to the sale of the core infrastructure assets on the face despite any consultation the plan fundamentally allows 750 million dollar assets to be sold we 've already gone out for wide community engagement and then formal consultation and then a hearings process the result on each occasion was the clear majority opposed the sale of assets so why after that would we continue to support the sale of SX and have yet another round of consultation late last year the People 's Choice council has agreed to consider the sale of some assets if that was absolutely necessary since then the conversation has progressed more work has been done more options have opened up and there are at least two reasons why we now believe that there is no need to sell we believe that we can significantly reduce capital budgets so that we bring spending within our means some work has already been done and there 'll be a full review of the capital program after the first of July I absolutely welcome that and I intend to do everything I can to ensure that that review will be as thorough robust and far-reaching as possible I expect that but I believe more could and should have been done already to reduce the size of the capital program before the 30th of June this year in order to alleviate the need to raise capital in the first year of this plan the limitations on our ability to do this have been one of my biggest frustrations and I know that shared by others in recent weeks we also believe the capital can be raised in other ways for example by placing debt on the council 's companies via internal capital restructuring even preference shares are back on the table an idea that we first promoted back in December 2014 we put up a number of amendments earlier in the week reflecting this alternative approach that presented an opportunity for the Mayo and for those counselors who have supported the sale of these assets to pull back from that proposal and in doing so to fully respond to overwhelming opposition to the proposed massive sale or potential massive sale of the city 's assets but they did not take that opportunity the People 's Choice continue to support the retention people 's right to have their say in what the council does and the people 's right to be listened to and will continue to do so it 's been suggested that this is an ideological debate in fact this is a beta debate about respecting people 's ownership of these companies through the council there are no surprises in what I 'm saying today comments I made at the time of the adoption of the draft plan for consultation were consistent with what I 've said today then I said that even though they were part of the draft I disagreed with I wanted to go out for a consultation because I look forward to hearing what the people of Christchurch had to say about it well we 've now heard from the people of Christchurch we 've heard that an overwhelming majority said that they did not support the position of selling assets in our companies and it 's for that reason that I cannot support those parts of the plan which do allow that to happen and which I fundamentally disagree with pinky Paul I haven 't to debate so much about the plan because I 'm AC in support of the plant I think it 's a good one well I do want to talk about though we 've come to and how we 're here today and if I reflect back to the earthquake in September 2010 liked most was I wake up in the morning remember bedroom and almost ran outside naked think that God I didn 't put the juicing out off and I was at that at that moment I realized that I needed to step up as a person and try and do something about the situation we found ourselves in so I decided to step up from my communion or written the Business Association and at that time I were pretty hard to get the city back on his feet after the febri earthquake I knew things were quite different it was a mess of earthquake and it did their repairable damage to our city and I was at that point four days out that I came up with an idea and it was the restart project theory how to and really hard to make successful but we did it but it was made through working with those people to achieve that goal and you don 't do it alone and obviously coming into the council elections a number of opportunities come up where the mayor stood down the current mayor at the time and tim carter stood down and i looked at the opportunity and actually i ran against lee n but partly to build mandate for the city and lee ain 't got that mandate and unless you proudly here as a counselor and endorse your proposed plan for Christchurch you know we 've debated we 've listened in a community and I think with now we 've got the nuts and bolts of a very good plan and as I said earlier this week it 's what those nuts and bolts we can create the vehicle to take us to a better future and I think we 're going to do today if we adopt this plan so you know we can argue all about the sale of assets not sale of assets I don 't think actually very clear we will try not to sell assets we want to find other ways to if you find the income or the revenue we need to actually go forward and the best way forward but I think this plan gives us the flexibility to create that bit of future you know as I said it 's a massive earthquake we 've got a big job ahead of us no one expected this here and I make sure you again proud to stand alongside my fellow councillors here and bring this plan to fruition but as I say you know it 's a it 's a big job big decisions and I don 't think anybody realized how hard this will be in this particular term you know as I said you know the restart project was hard and I think this tumor council is harder than anybody ever expected we had unexpected surprises within our finances with unexpected surprises within you know deals have been done prior us taking on this here but with we 've stood up and face those challenges and I think the plan actually table to support this plan let 's bring those nuts and bolts together let 's create that vehicle to bring us to a better future thank you um Ellie thank you say when I first saw this draft of the LTP I would have liked rates to be long I think that higher rates not only affect people on limited incomes who owned houses but also affects a large number of people particularly in Christchurch now paying very very high rates however this would have meant or we could have done that I felt by greater capital release but the effects of this on the lower returns from the entities releasing the capital I understand is counterproductive which is a shame because I still would like to see those rates lower much has been said about sales of assets now I didn 't run on a platform that preempted what I 'd find it counsel I don 't have any political affiliations Iran to be a part of making the decisions which are best for Christchurch and for our or and there 's been a lot of give and take very patient as some of you know I should be more tolerant shut up Vicki however we were elected to lead to listen and learn and I think that we need to remember that the consultation process and hearing from our people is a key part of decision-making however consultation is not consensus consultation is about information gathering and gaining feedback and we as elected members are in receipt of all of the information needed to make an informed decision there 's been a lot of movement since the consultation but you can 't please all of the people all of the time we 're governors of the city I want to get on and govern let 's actually get on and do it I would like to acknowledge my colleagues though in the PC can 't_''_677.519 despite not agreeing with many of their positions it is healthy to have a variety of positions around a table it 's a reflection of our people in the city and some of their views as well I also want to acknowledge our staff who have worked incredibly hard worked incredibly long hours none of us wants to see capital release if it can be avoided it clearly can 't owning for the sale of owning is not fair for those still dealing with broken pavements roads pipes and community facilities you cannot have your cake and eat it now counselor Turner mentioned an overwhelming majority of Christchurch people not supporting asset sales now this is entirely unsubstantiated and in fact many that I have heard from were very supportive of doing what is needed to be done to return our city to a level of a and repair that we should have at this stage of our recovery I 'd also like to acknowledge our merely an delzell who 's worked so diplomatically and effectively to progress this LTP to the stage please support this today we need to make decisions we need to make hard decisions that 's what we were elected to do oh well I 'm really pleased to finally be part of the debate this long-term plan which has counseled long stills refer to yesterday that it must include the vision for our city and as other speakers that the zero and actually a TV a balanced budget it 's also a privilege though to be making such important decisions on behalf of our city and also for future generations really and I actually welcome the changes that the mere encounters have agreed to around lowering the lower rates and that there 's some protection for three of our major strategic SE it 's like Orion little import company and closer to initially abort but the the LT long-term plan package actually I think could have done a lot more as counsel tuna indicated to reduce air capital spending I also think it 's unnecessary to sell up to 750 million dollars of our assets at this stage and in fact that the stats on the submitters show quite clearly that eighty-three percent of those who submitted about assets in particular they asked us to retain our city 's assets and I believe we must listen to the people many of the people who submitted about their could not understand the need for speed on this and the haste and they questioned also our capability to develop to I think the messages we got weather really the assets belong to the people they belong to our community and in fact even people who supported the sale of assets said look only do it when in fact the uncertainty has been clarified that there 's no urgency to do this and they also asked us to Claire to prioritize their infrastructure repairs and I unfortunately have found that the there 's been insufficient availability of resources within this process for us to actually do that effectively and I believe actually if we truly had the well in real determination we would have got a better result I certainly clearly recall David close as the former chair of this council strategy and Finance Committee pointing out that over the last three years we 'd under spend our budget by three billion dollars and clearly following there there would have been ways we could have made more savings we also in many ways when we heard from the people we heard about two cities and it was like a tale of two cities and one group who are fixed who are but another group who are actually quite tired and weary and where their streets and their foot paths have not been fixed and Jim anytin pointed out that in fact we are a low-income city that half of our population in Christchurch earn under thirty thousand dollars a year and had a third of our people pay rent for their homes they live in rental accommodation so and that the city as a whole won 't benefit from the sale of assets Jim also pointed out that with Orion for example since 1969 else that he had received over a billion dollars in dividends that 's pretty good so why would you sell it I also recruit referee called dr. Garth pent urging us to take time because in fact if we if we straight if we lead to the time for air the repair of air city that the immigrants who have come in with their families will make long-term they 'll become resonance long to him and become citizens to content continue to contribute to the fabric of a city I want to call me to be out while the sub from Berlin following us emotions that some of their major assets are going to remain strategic i 'm actually quite said that there 's an intent today to read us rebus because that it red bus company is part of the provision of our public service part of our city 's public transport which we 've had since the time of the closure of transport board and in fact it 's a flagship of the different companies who operate bus services here and in fact sets a very good standard for the achievement of a well-run system and owning red bus in fact should give us leverage to run our transport system and so red bus is more than just the money value it 's a key part in enhancing our public transport as one of their councils goals I want to thank our staff particularly around transport because I think they do a tremendous job in the constantly especially with the exciting announcement today of the government contributing I think it 's 40 1.6 million dollars of funding towards our cycleways is a tribute to to transport area so the other part of transport that I would like to have investigated and I think we need to do there 's a time for annual plan is that there were submissions on light rail which I certainly agree with so today I urge counselors to certainly sign off the full funding for your cycle ways I think that building your cycle ways is a great example of sustainable development in Christchurch ants with some sadness I can 't support the whole of a long-term plan because I can 't support the delisting of those other strategic air suits and I think though that air council must show at the time of their next annual plan that in fact we can really address address our budget was more sustainable alternatives and still achieve a bit a balanced budget thank you thank you David thank you look I feel really privileged to be part of the council that 's dealing with this LTP and it 's probably not probably I think it is the most significant financial consideration the city 's ever had to deal with now the earthquake it 's really required us to think outside the square and adopt initiatives that that may be unpalatable to some but in reality there 's an inevitability about some of the things we have to do and I believe the things that we are doing today really quite fiscally prudent I 'm going to plagiarize a comment that I heard in the last couple of days ago from Tom Hooper the chief executive of CDC he said in them said to me after meeting that the approach that the city needs to adopt is what is the city need to achieve the rebuild objectives that it wants and become a preeminent city in New Zealand and globally and then address the address the issue of how do we fund them though we could ask the question you know do we need to come invest an infrastructure yes we do does the city need a stadium the library or 50 meter pool yes it does does the southwest area need a new sport and recreation complex yes it does doesn 't you brighten need a promenade in a hot salt water we need to identify what we what the city needs to rebuild and to become a the preeminent city of New Zealand and then find the ways to finance those proposals I really believe today we will adopt a very good plan that will be the platform to rebuild our city and a manner that puts Christchurch in the forefront of new zealand and globally so i am going to support the mayor i think it 's a very good proposal she 's put forward today and I urge other councillors to do like was Thank You Pauline but we know these are challenging times for the people of Christchurch and for their council and consequently this is the most challenging LTP that any council around a new zealand will be signing off it 's a first for me as a first term counselor even though i 'm one of the third longest serving the response to our draft was huge and we listened to many residents who made the effort to come and speak about the concerns and it was an incredible turnout of people we 've got to do that and I thank them for that but I must emphasise that many were positive with great ideas to utilize and embrace the opportunity our recovery and our generational regeneration offers us many of these ideas are around our natural resources walkways adventure parks gardens beaches and I can see Christchurch quickly becoming a sought after destination for accessible outdoor pursuits eventually we will have an amazing city arguably the best in New Zealand but we know this is going to take time as all good things do and one of the most important projects we have of course is our cycleways 13 separated psychopaths they 'll be safe they 'll be beautiful and they will also help reduce the cars on our roads we 're committed to working with ekn to get our public transport running well and consequently being well patronised residents can be forgiven and thinking that not much is happening at times but look around the roads the underground pipes our hive of activity also a pain in the proverbial at times but a huge job one of the if not the most consuming an moment as the land drainage recovery project the cost of this over 30 years could be as high as why point 22 billion dollars currently we have 440 million over three years assigned to that but once again I must stress the level of investigative works at the front end of this work is in the cycleways as yet unseen the amount of physical damage to our land our rivers our pipes is massive and it will take years and years to reinstate to pre earthquake levels we must be patient I find it pleasing to see the rates increases we 've reduced to 7.9 three percent I know Oakland signed off nine percent yesterday and they haven 't even had an earthquake I 'd like people to give some thought to the value we all do receive for our rates we have three big plastic bins that are moved from our properties our waste to per week turn the tap on drink the water wash the dishes the water leaves the cig push the button in the bathroom gone libraries apart down the road sports field the roads we and the approach eats the list goes on rates the charge per household within maybe two or more people benefiting so when we really think about it our rates give us very very good value and we heard from submitters those who came and spoke and those who submitted in writing over 80% wanted us to retain heiresses which is also my preference I 'm optimistic that it will still be possible to retain our asset base once our unknowns become clearer in the following months Christchurch people have diverse opinions and so it 's natural and right that we as councillors also have diverse opinions and our representation role we 've worked well together to achieve a shared goal and it is to make the best decisions for the people of Christchurch and we will continue to do this as a team as more options emerge to fund our regeneration once again I must reiterate that i will be working hard to retain area sets and i 'm pleased to hear other councillors have also expressed this desire as we move forward to future choices and as more of hours of work into this LTP months in months in months I think staff fellow councilors in the mirror it has been a moveable feast and i support the majority of the ltp content but because i 'm committed to retaining area seats i 'm compelled reluctantly to vote against the substantive plan thank you okay thank you and this is the culmination of what I think has been probably about a year in the making it just feels like longer and I recall when we first came on to cancel this time and looking and seeing a number of things that were surprising and shocking one was the insurance arrangements which I found mildly incredible and the second was a cost share agreement that said regardless of any insurance receipts we will pay this match which just surprised me that anybody would sign and and all of us are familiar with insurance and that you would never sign something like that but actually the most surprising decision that I found coming back onto council was that post-earthquake when the entire infrastructure had been destroyed or damaged in some way at post-earthquake the council had agreed to invest up to 350 million in creating a new company called enable and there was to me actually the most surprising because post-earthquake wire council that must have been able to see that it was faced with huge capital costs would do that when the government had already said we ride ultra-fast broadband so you 're going to get all the benefits regardless that was to me actually the most surprising of the decisions and I think that in looking and and that has been part of the problem so in looking at how we get out of that I note now that in this revised plan that the rural rates differential has gone which is nice thank you the the second and part of it is that contained in here the Headroom has now moved from where we were unsure about it being a hundred and fifty million so the Headroom has now gone and every year except 2022 300 million at least and that 's been done by the concept retained in here of seller of in some way releasing capital least 173 million we can look now at a range of options that weren 't there at the beginning of this process and i like the words in the mayor 's recommendation noting that the reprofiling of capital expenditure has already had an impact on our debt profile we may not need to release tranches two and three of capital in years 2016 17 and 17 18 which also means that we can consider enable once it becomes a mature business the capital release program in those years will therefore be fully reviewed so I think that we can actually and I like the fact that Orion the airport and the Seaport have been listed as strategic assets I think if I think we can actually get to where we need to be with that in any way selling those major assets and if we look at the dividends from those companies we haven 't in the past few years invested heavily in the rebuild of both the airport and the Seaport and there is an opportunity for those companies to return that favor I would think so I think actually without affecting those assets which we have now labeled strategic in terms of their ownership terms of the red bus actually I think it impedes what we can do in public transport the red bus company sadly does not set the rules for what we want to do in public transport it can does if by owning red bus we stuff up our chances to actually have control of public transport urban public transport and what is just an urban area rather than give that control to e kin which is a large rural area or includes a large rural area we actually impede our opportunity to do major things in public transport what I like about this plan sorry I 'm going to go two minutes at one minute over time is that we have rebuilt the community in this plan the city is always about people and in this plan we 've got a horn bleep all we 've got a whole library with what the limb would pull we 've got the Riddler 's library we 've got the Brighton saltwater pools we 've got the their transport mode so that walking cycling and public transport are at the top of our Trek a preferred transport mode we are although it never affects rates dealing with housing and homelessness and we are even looking at possibilities around food forests and electrification of our own fleet those are things that to me make the city a place where in my view anything is possible and that 's where I want the city to be that 's the place I want the city to be where anything is possible where we actually feel that and this is a community that feels that strongly and that 's what I think the plan does to make a place where anything is possible the budget is the foundation and so what I think we 've got here is a budget let 's listen to what people have said and actually starts to create the foundation for making that Heather Thank You Jimmy as the mayor mentioned you know in the consultation document the council long-term plan 2015 and the 21 is a key document to explain what services the project council also council master consoler public over their long-term play and give people a meaningful opportunity to influence this spread through a formal consultation process so the public feedback is the most accrual information to make this plain more practical and make people 's needs if we reviewed our the counselor information regarding to the systematic analysis overall this in older occurring the long-term plan the meeting agenda appendix a we can see the council receive the 2829 Cody submission it was about 83 percentage a poster a sitter sales so it 's equal to 2348 as opposed to a CEO sales and also they emphasize some or reasons why not to sale de asis the loose of revenue privatization still producing rate rises taking a short-term view those of control and accountability those are tangible benefit osito and also they give our son of a suggestion can reduce rates increase and offset the asus sales or instant i go for our ties info charge of repair and the sprayer program all over long period rather than just in the first of three years to do everything and also focus on cold labor of so and also try to continue we negotiate the Costa sheer agreement with the domina and negotiate we start ensure a sexual so based on this information the residence and the community have been released as a six significant signal to us to keep the asus rather than to sell those the acs that 's why I in favor returning a current strategic aces still to be remained on the list rather than to be removed so yesterday we have you no vote regarding to those two five aces like a city tail Labour 's enable than Hester park hong castle arena in the council of austria park in the beauty sh 0 if we took the aces of the least we would be show four cardinal democratic process and robbing the people of the chances to have their say in a fart should happen with name I remember the in the last term cancer because I 'm second time counselor I would like to emphasize they these cases are high radio and belong to the people belong to the community of High Church so I 'm keep the aces so yesterday I still know to keep for the aces no I need a change so this my consistent position but regarding to some other the issues of right to show the one positive one negative positive is eventually in order vanna Louie recreation center HIV from the community Oh or from the local community they emphasize max emission for many years but why now I 'm delighted at this offense especially a oh well be repaired in the reopening but the other two facility the tempered on friday in the production renewal problem even yesterday or today you know we have approved to the forward to our CEO to review and the report back to the council at the end of august but i 'm still a bitter disappointed because these two facility happened to follow many years and also lesser this color issue so we need to hire per our ties to fix the distal to facilities so due to the list the reason so it 's difficult for me to overall to support it is the long-term play thank you okay um thank you made the day after the earthquake it will be a difficult journey but progress is certain things will get better and christchurch will rise again it will be clear that no one will be left to walk this journey alone new zealand will work this walk this journey with you we will be there every step of the way christchurch this is not your test this is new zealand 's test and i want to give you another quote it 's a pretty big wish list but it 's up to the people of Christchurch to debate the plan prioritize its projects and decide how much they are prepared to pay to funding I think those two quotes really sum up the situation we 're in today and part of the difficult choices that we have to make you see the people of the city and I agree it 's about the people have never had a chance to have their say on the huger expensive blueprint that was put on to us by central government it hasn 't in my view being a genuine partnership in fact the deficit with that that that blueprint council was going to spend 800 million on the central city the government 's blueprint put two billion worth of costs on there 's no surprise about the convention center we always knew it was going to 400 million that was always made clear to us the reality is that the blueprint has been unaffordable and that was John Key who made that first comment and that was Jerry Burnley who made that second so I urged him to honor the things that they 've said in terms of support for this city eleven billion dollars worth of new tax revenue going into the government 's coffers and we are now having a debate about selling off our assets to pay for something we didn 't ask for that the public have had no right to have a say on I don 't support that way forward what 's really important to me is that we are seen to be voting in favor of our sovereignty and we 're voting in favor of a sustainable financial plan we 're voting in favor of the people we 're voting to be because we 're proud to be called and labeled the People 's Republic of christ church because retaining our strategic and significant assets is about retaining our sovereignty the reality is that selling off your assets that raise revenue and bring an income and have a whole wide range of commercial environmental and social objectives is putting the city at risk and is creating an unsustainable way forward giving away selling off nine hundred million dollars off dividends over the 30-year plan to put into things like a sports stadium that will cost us money as in my view economically ridiculous it just doesn 't make sense I don 't believe that we need to rush there are alternatives and we 've given you those alternatives through this process most of the anchor projects have been delayed the financial Headroom as we 've heard has got a lot more room than a previously thought so if things have become a little bit clearer and that is that most the really expensive projects are going to be delayed which means we don 't need to sell considered approach the other thing that I want to just raise is that there 's a real question about how we pay for growth infrastructure and I don 't think the models working at all so while we 're being told we need to rezone huge tracts of land and the suburbs that has a huge environmental and financial cost and it is an unsustainable way of supporting development we need to get smarter about how we fund these different things for example why has no one considered a regional stadium tax why are we being lambasted in the media for not funding extensions to a northern by the way that benefits the north and our neighbors to the north and yet we 're being asked to also incur the cost of a regional stadium so there are ways of dealing with these issues we need to have more consideration this is about our people and these assets are public core public services so I can 't support what the long-term plan is doing I think you know proceed with caution there are a huge risk to be learned from in New Zealand you just look at Wellington 144 complaints for that private public transport operator that the council sold off a few years ago to a strategic partner infra tongue is that the sort of public transport system you want for our city I don 't think it is and that 's why I won 't support getting rid of these important strategic assets so again I urge you to listen to what the people have said respect the people that have made those submissions and take into account people do not want us to sell off our assets we 've given them the right to be heard which is more than what some of the other proteases that have happened in a silly and what they have overwhelming said is don 't rush into an irreversible agenda of selling off assets so I 'm voting in favor of retaining our assets I think it 's incredibly important to enable the things to happen in the future that have been talked about today for future generations don 't give away that future possibility by selling them off _"

    "text": "so like school wasn 't it everyone 's obviously excited to be here so could could I just restart the meeting it was a june from from wednesday and i guess that over the last couple of days we 've debated and voted on a number of amendments to the recommendations that i 'm bringing to the meeting today and yes so there are a series of things that we 're going to do today because obviously we really want to allow time for the debate on the long-term plan as a whole so i 'll just run through the order of play so that people can follow what 's going on and i guess people can you know think about the fact that they 're going to be everyone 's going to contribute to the debate on the on the long-term plan there were a couple of things that happened on wednesday that didn 't quite well that didn 't quite make it unto the and to the record so i just want to deal with both of those one was when the list of reports went up i include the last of the reports that was to be included and the so I 'm going to ask for the record that Carlene Edwards our chief executive be asked to report on options for bringing some or all current city care operations into an internal council works unit this report to include considerations for incorporating some or all of City cares current services into the council organization or a separate works department including information on reduced overheads and other efficiencies and options for transferring the remaining skip program to council so so that report was left off the list and that was my mistake because I forwarded the wrong document so that will now be included on the list and Carlene will give us an initial update by the end of august on that and the second one was the metrical waterway and people will recall that during the hearings we heard a very desperate plea from a couple of people who were badly impacted by the flooding that occurred in relation to that and the issue that came to council was that and when we were considering it 't directly that the causing of the flooding wasn 't directly associated with the earthquake and so it was in the land drainage operations program but an actual fact it was indirectly caused by the earthquake because it would have been completed if the development contributions had been paid by the subsequent development of the area above which was red zoned and so the opportunity to develop that waterway he 's actually gone from that program which does expose them to some risk so I 'm directing that the chief financial officer transfer the matter coo waterway from the land drainage operations program to the land drainage recovery program and what that does is that an enables that work to be prioritized alongside all of the other earthquake-related flooding damaged so those two measures are and attended to and I don 't know if you need the wording of that to to address that so that it 's in the record as having been sorted and so then and then then we 're going to we 're going to reinstate the Standing Orders that we put to one side in the development contributions paper and that 's a second set it 's on page one 136 of the agenda and so we 'll deal with the development contributions are sorry the second thing we 'll do is receive the letter of opinion from audit newzealand then we will deal with the development contributions then we 'll move on to the staffs recommendations which have been moved and seconded we 'll deal with my recommendations with amendments but will vote on us and two parts prior to voting on it we were a table and agree to receive the impact that the decisions that we made this week the impact that they have on rates and so we will then deal with the two components two parts of it some of the mayor 's recommendations will be put together and others will be put separately so the ones that will be put separately just so you can make a note our items to 4.2 1 and four point two two and then the next set of recommendations are six point two three four six so we 'll vote on those and have the debate at six point seven which is the point at which we adopt the long-term plan and that is the debate that everyone has an opportunity to speak for five minutes so it 's a substantial and substantive debate on our long-term plan and vision for our city in terms of what we want to achieve so that is the process that we 're going through so I would like to move that we reinstate these standing orders that we suspend it and would someone like to second that so i 'll put that motion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those against say no that 's carried can I just ask a question of clarification in terms of the actual plan that we 're adopting how we got an updated infrastructure stroke financial strategy based on the changes or is it we make changes to those after we make the decisions today and I guess the other outstanding piece of information that I 'm still waiting to get which we were given an undertaking is the costing and the timing of the term plan I 'm just a little bit China and we 're those things in our setting Peter so for helping work through how this process is working that we start from the draft long-term plan is the base case there is adapted and changed based on the muse recommendations and the amendments that were passed on the last couple of days or will be passed so that then forms the final what we were able to produce with the financial strategy and infrastructure strategy was obviously correct up until the point at which amendments were made and those any subsequent changes that have to be made to that document happen over the next month before public publication in terms of council your Henson 's request around our particularly anchor projects and those are set out in the main within the draft long-term plan and I 'd refer the counselor to the proposed funded capital program within volume 1 of the draft long term plan particularly pages to 33 through 22 38 with the only changes to that and draft coming up through updates from the ccd you website the the draft and any updates which was really only Metro stadium by one year which was non impactful within the most case that councillors have been reviewing and debating such a situation thank you very much so the next item on the agenda _"

    "text": "just a motion need a seconder yep okay is there seeking to thank you Paul in right yeah need to want to introduce it thank you obviously Christchurch unfortunates had a history of legionnaires and in 2005 there was quite a severe outbreak and there was a lot of work going into understanding what had happened and what could be done in future in 2008 there was a report that went to the Riggin planning committee which gave a pretty extensive review and suggested that council support the coroner 's recommendations in terms of what have been listed below so i 've attached those letters to this report I 've also attached the coroner 's recommendations and findings I personally think given what 's happened recently that we should also be looking to respond and as such i 'm asking for a report to go into what the response and progress has been on the attached requests i think that it 's really important that if there 's things we can do as a city from a public health point of view to address things that the coroner 's have to government for the changes that need to occur that haven 't occurred or to look at what we can do so i 'm really just asking for a report i think it 's important that we do look at what 's happened in the past and recently and recognize that we do we do have a role to play so i hope you 'll support this i think the interesting discussion will be when that report comes back as to what recommendations we were we wish to pursue and just to place on record that I have met with the council staff with the officer medical health dr. Ramon pink and we have actually talked through what what we 're doing in terms of the recent issue of legionnaires and also what what just to make sure that there are you know collaborating over a response because council has worked in the past with with the the cdh be around around this issue and it 's expected that we would continue to do that going forward so there 's nothing nothing more that i really want to add then the detail will come when that report comes back and that 's the time to have a bit more of a substantial discussion this is just sitting up prices for things to occur you 're just yonni I 'm just wondering about the wording of the fury I 'm concerned that there 's a coroner 's report here with recommendations should we be using the words perhaps evidence of compliance to these recommendations would it be a little bit stronger than what you 've got here you 've got progress response in progress would you consider strengthening that wording we do need to hear back from staff and from we need to formulate a report yeah the entire agreement of everyone in the meetings will be for us oh that 's the mover and seconder isn 't no I 'm getting the advice from their variety oh I 'm sure I 'm relying on you the Furies heavy with the reading are just suggesting that it just seems to me there 's a clear directive in these two leaders which followed on some fatalities and this is quite soft in is not to take a aggressive approach with government it 's actually to try and work out a strategy for the things that possibly haven 't_''_227.16 been done to how we can advocate for them to happen so it 's maybe we meet with them anymore an island if we do a number okay so we 're not altering the wording at the moment so poorly hippie with the Pauline you do you want to speak no Tim think I 'm just noticing on page 127 with regards to Point C and if that are within that report that we get back that we multiplications and if they can be recovered from those buildings well it should be in the report because if we 're going to runners recommendation is that these I 'm not sure with its with an area but is it well if I can visit the water fitness regime administered by territory authorities which would be council and the katanas recommending that these tests are undertaken monthly so therefore there will be a cost incurred at least we can recover it so i would like that with you a report so i told it great but we need to know them soak aliens take the note of thing thank you yep okay their problems can i put the notice of motion as moved Yanni seconded pauline and it 's as what 's written there okay put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried okay I now have a resolution to exclude the public it what women it have I forgotten something me to include marsh insurance that I shall I need to include king in bidding so for at and maintain and the resolution to exclude the public I need to allow internet meeting bring King and Beverly messy George from mass marsh insurance for item 19 yep okay so what 's that I 'll move and Jamie or second that the resolution to its Luther public is set out and Paige blah blah is what those in favor please say aye those proposed carried and that 's just in time for morning tea which gives you time you guys center just engage from my feet with _"

    "text": "there are three substantive parts to this report the first is the review of the smoke free public places policy now I think we 've got staff to to speak to this because we 're going to hear about how there may need to be a change to the recommendation so maybe if we hear from staff and then I can perhaps summarize the discussion that we had at committee at that time as well welcome Mike is this your area this is what you actually do i do bits of everything you know right okay i understand that this needs to be a change changing the timing that count that 's for what I run more for coffee so there 's really only there 's probably a couple of points to note the first one is in resolution 6.2 having spoken to the facilities people they 're basically confirming that they believe it 's impractical to get signage throughout all our buildings by October 2015 they 're happy to to start but obviously we 've got a large number of building so we would seek councils indulgence to basically practical issue for the facilities people to get around and do that I 'd just question the the thinking behind that I mean I appreciate that October 's too early and if it can 't_''_95.82 be done it can 't_''_96.479 be done and it 's good that you 're telling us that and thank you for telling us earlier other than letting this go through and then needing to come back and tell as it couldn 't be done January seems to be quite a long time after October saying like three months and always can I guess the spirit of my question is could it be done earlier than January realistically the earliest it can be can we well so that 's the advice we 've been given we can certainly go back and say look council want this rolled out as quickly as possible would be nicely at all out before the summer season start a lot of those facilities that we can target those as well to make sure that pets be there are facilities are going to have a high summer usually keep to those earlier it done as quickly as possible and communicate that to the facilities guys yeah that 's absolutely right i mean the spirit committee recommendation is that you know we want this done and we want it done as soon as possible i 'd be happy with that change and maybe we just add the words or earlier yes possible yeah we 're dealing on yeah and that just gives that sense of urgency yeah thank you okay well good is there a secondary lien wanted to seek and it do you want to be patient about it now okay other just before you are passionate about it are there any other questions right I think Glen 's gazumped you 're on it no I don 't think so no no he just wants to be passionate about it yeah okay so questions we were on clin and then Dave thank you this comes out of an informal conversation I had with a couple of night ah who representatives one who I think took part in the original lease signing with council his understanding is that from the word goes the smoke-free ramp so I know that we 've kind of kind of uncovered a few little complications there to do with the cafe is that you are understanding as well that that was the original and teaching there I don 't know that we can say what the original intention Wars I don 't think any of us participate in the net but it 's perhaps unusual that the discussions around the building of that state would have addressed this matter the issue is that there is a second lease agreement with the cafe from by night aho which which means that we can 't impose restriction on a in a reasonable area around the cafe because obviously it has an outdoor dining area so the prep lovely of actually enforcing an absolute smoking down the ramp is probably too difficult for us thank you i think we 're going to keep working on that Vicki with talk about we have for quite some time are there any other questions Dave sorry I know look I think mine was pretty similar the Queen 's and because this can we now very keen on this I know this is the we kept a huge mega picture for the council really appreciate that but one thing that did come out of sheer an idea which into the touch phone this morning was that an incredibly democratic process where people concluded they wanted a clean green city so for us to proceed over active travel and in the other initiatives where we 're going with and actually not be intentional about this I think would be disjointed so it 's good that we 're looking at extending our policy the total number of smokers in New Zealand is the highest in Canterbury we 've got 38,000 in Christchurch City which is thirteen percent of the population so I think it 's important that we as a council show leadership on this there 's overwhelming support if you look at these statistics by the public for smoke-free areas and I suspect the forthcoming survey from the Cancer Society will indicate that actually smoke-free dining is good for business and it might take some people by surprise but let 's wait for that survey to steps at the moment keep extending that policy keep being progressive because we do want a healthy City what was it for other cities if it was thirteen percent in Christchurch I left another group i have read this report just ticking I do okay Andrew thank you thank you and I don 't have a lot to add to what kinds of Livingstone has said this certainly allows for council to take a progressive role in this space it 's realistic as to where we are at at the moment in the continuum of moving towards smoke-free 2025 there has been some discussion about the the ramp going down to Wooster Street and that certainly has been canvassed in cancer Livingston 's question we also have had some debate around smoking in outdoor dining spaces and so on and the view of the committee was that that 's a conversation we may want to have in the future about the time to have that conversation is not just yet so I think this is a good picture of where we 're at and where the city 's at in smoke free 2025 and the other thing I 'd like to do is to acknowledge the involvement and the help that we 've had from smoke free Canterbury in sharing some of the information with us that 's helped to support these decisions as well so I 'm very comfortable with these recommendations coming from both staff and the committee and I think this is a good decision to be making now as part of an overall forward direction everything I 've just before and just picking up on counselor Turner 's point so if we just could go to 6.7 which is a note in the resolutions and probably I think the size of the cities and buildings and signers requirements have only become a bit more apparent so smoke-free candid we are now saying they are they 're probably not in a position to provide all our signage at no cost but they 're happy to assist us with the signage so we just should note that it is I mean when you think about the number of buildings we 've got and the program they 're trying we need to cover so note that smoke free Canterbury have offered to assist with the provision of signage perhaps not worth but peps towards the provision of signage is probably a more accurate assist towards improvement actually does make good English does it that offered to assist to contribute to the provision it 's much better yeah yep so there 's no absolute guarantee that we won 't and do kinky Tim thank you now firstly thank you the staffer is the same with regards to the if you like the reality of the timing of how much we can get in and get out and like your own suggestions regards to targeting certain places first as an absolute spot-on I think it 's the way to go especially in the lovely weather we 're having at the moment and if we can get up and running soon as possible that we great if we can get the same results from doing this as we do from our playgrounds in our sports fields etc as will be an absolute success so I know personally when you going with with regulating it 's immoral if you like and it 's a really good way to go forward so thank you very much for the work you 're doing and the honesty that you can to us up today Cheers okay great can I put it those in favor please say aye there 's a post carried unanimously thank you very much item number two heritage incentive grant and yet just straight East moved Andrew seconded yani i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and the next one next door at 98 to 100 moved and resting to clean put that those in favor please say aye as

    "text": "they um Catherine Street bridge at Widow first came committee seemed straightforward and I think it still is what the committee asked for it is it being removed what the committee asked for was for the legal requirements around consultation to be considered they have been in ND the staff have gone further than just a hard legal part but have certainly included comment on the processes and people not only that the there is a it is indeed of low significance but the processes that can be followed and I think though this probably I know some councils have pets got some question about the consultation process that we now and to go in terms of whether it is only in forming or whether in fact we should um take a dislike lead if ur approach but councils like might like to speak to that and i 'm not sure if might want to comment too but this relates really well to that previous question so I 'm really trying to understand how I explained to my ward the projects that are going to go ahead other scoot the around it so i guess for me to consumers that the public have no knowledge of this i know you 've done some selected consultation with some key stakeholders but for the local reasons that live in this area they have no knowledge of what this proposal is and have not had no chance to give their views and I just kind of wonder you know how we could actually have a more inclusive process bearing in mind I know you 've said that it 's not significant but if you look at places like Midway bridge for example if you look at some of that he 'll moores lane is another one the community have expected to be involved and they have been able to but not in this particular case so so the specific question as you know when can we get the big picture about the projects that aren 't happening in line with this one all night but it 's related because how do you well the question I have is how do you make a choice to decision not to fix this one and what appoint folks that 's what I can 't understand is three amir amir into counselors are the significance of this protein you meet your midway street bridge which i 'm very familiar with when we look at it in context of separation between other river crossing facilities as it 's a reasonably big distance particularly for the midway street bridge compared to this thus bridge we assist as low one of the ten reasons was the fact that it is about a 35-second walking distance measured by myself between the two bridges the the other issue is that bridge being built in 1961 air various engineers involved in verse have said had the Wolfson cart in the barrage broken effect being built first we were never would have built the Catherine Street bridge because it 's just a duplication of facilities as just so happens that Catherine Street bridge was built first and in the barrage which has a bridge crossing structure on earth was built second and we 've got them side by side as you can see from the from the from the pictures so the the assessment extreme proximity compared to all other structures river crossing structures along that area so it that there 's a 30 that there 's a 35-second walk to the next bridge this one has been closed since the earthquake isn 't it yes in aim that was like this 30 signature okay okay so that 's great is there any more questions I 'm sorry well the helm was line is actually a good no no we 're not doing how much line we 've done it hey I 'm just trying to understand like are we just going to get on a case-by-case basis projects that we say we 're not going to folks coming to us of how this is going to work well through ummm yeah I think you 've got to look at this also in terms of the cost of new report by me you know based on the information provided by scared is that we 're looking at you know half million of plus to re to rebuild this bridge which is something that the council would have to argue employment ltp there is a you believe we should be retaining it and with the fact that it 's got a bridge immediately beside it all fits thank you very much no jaani I 'm going to limit it to the item on the agenda so I 'm not going to make these guys for reporting on the Catherine Street bridge do the entire scoop program for us what I heard from there is we have to move amendments through the LTP to fix the things that aren 't going to be folks like the Catherine Street bridge everyone at first and that 's fine if you could do that but what I need is the information so i can prioritize amongst us project but right now you 're just writing on the catherine street right okay so how 'd you go pretty anymore yeah question sundays um if we decided that we just wanted to seek some local empire given you know if there 's concerns that we haven 't talked to the public about us what would the effect of just doing that over the next two weeks and then having this report we could do two things i would say is is what sort of expectations are you going out there to tell them you know are we going out to consultation as hey we 're willing to put this bridge back on the program is that what you 're telling them so you 've got to actually go out there and say are we informing them that we are going to pull the bridge apart so I think yani you 're going to have to tell our council we 're going to have to tell us what sort of message you want to go out there so if you 're willing to put another half a million on to the program and say we 'd go out with that consultation it 's not what we 're advising what we 're advising you 've got a bridge 35 seconds away basically it wouldn 't be built as we 've said if the if the other bridge have been place at the time that this was built it is severely damaged we want to try and get on with the program to try we feel have got more strategic importance than others stitute comment there is no way to get being for back except for Martin took sorry sorry sorry sorry exit for option for and we 've talked about this and it came to the committee etc and the reason is a number but the the proximity of the other bridge I think maybe on e and crew from rant wrong yani is about communication that she related to so perhaps with through the community board that inform them that these are the options and there 's really only one which is to remove that bridge and then it 's a communication with the community board to the community to say hey this is what 's happening these are the reasons why would that be as is there an option it 's in me as an option but you do note that we have gone to the community board and a seminar on and there were no concerns raised with the course of action that we 've got so we have done that local work it 's just that like in terms of for example the consultation team being involved in hell how that is and zooming there would be hell that is actually the letter is sent to people and maybe so that people aren 't upset them having some opportunity to comment given that council still make a decision today well I guess we would be letting them yeah and I 'm really want to make sure we can make a decision today but is there a way for people to have some opportunity perhaps to have have comment certainly look we can you direct us to what you do all I would say is in the four years and i believe to counsel and i don 't know about to counselors we have had no one come and have had any concerns about this bridge being closed it just hasn 't featured in a public Raider the issue that I 've got is how far do I go because I would say there 'd be some people that would live in Kashmir that would walk their dogs down to their bridge and up the other side and I 'm it 's sort of how bigger sort of circle would you like us to go to inform them that we 're going to pull out a bridge which they 've got a week 35 seconds to the next one I guess the Christian if you we 've gone to that you 've got into the community board there were no concerns except for the issue with regards to communicating with that the community so what 's the community boards roll it shouldn 't they be communicating with their community that they 've been to be contacting that 's it sorry I don 't say it 's a really a rhetoric sorry I 'm sorry quite sure what we 've delegated no wasn 't some I might try and make the same point but by way of a question in that case in informing people we 're saying to them this is what 's happening you know this is our bridge this is councils for each community this is what we 're doing with our bridge the question really i think is what can be done and I mean given that this building who are experts in this stuff what can we do to communicate this in a way that the residents feel pass of their decision about what 's happening with their bridge I think there are two quite different ways of going about this that can quite easily end up with the same result but it 's just about people feeling that they 've had an opportunity to participate in a decision about what after all is a local community asset despite its been closed for four years there will be people in that community or quite possibly assuming that one day they will be able to walk their dog over that bridge again so I think it 's about the the local community rather than necessarily the wider community but what can be done to arrive at a point where the community feel that they 've had a part of the decision to do what we need to do with this bridge I 'm not a communications expert but from what I can gather counselor Turner you would like us to go and say here are the options comment on it so we will be going through a consultation the issue that I 've got with that is that you have then got to have if they all come back and say they want that bridge back in place you 've then got to actually so you know what you 're telling me is to go through a consultation process before we pull this bridge are so that 's really the only way I think that they could be and feel that they 're involved because if I go and inform them councils made this is the reasons I 've made that decision I can do that very easily and say here the reasons for the decision so that they understand why you made the decision but as soon as I say then do you agree or disagree they will expect the process to be able to be participating rhian that other in if they come back we understand that we probably would get most people supporting the decision made but yeah I got the story of the bridge everything about the bridge and it 's also been an amendment yanny just tell us the amendment that the decision to okay I pray the removal of the footbridge of the catherine street-- footbridge be deferred for a month to enable local feedback on the proposed options local feedback on what options yeah options that aren 't a report okay good so you know just just a wee minute before we get in just just before we get into the the end to the debate is there a seconder for that amendment no it 's going to lips for want of a second death okay so you 're seeking to get pro forma can we can we I have the feeling that with the amendment is likely to be defeated so can I don 't really need any comments on it just at the moment but for the emotion so you 've moved the motion I haven 't got a seconder for the motion for the original motion the original motion is that the footbridge should be removed basically you 're seeking there okay right so it 's now moved and seconded we 've got an amendment moved by obviously there 's no budget for one of those options so quite difficult we 've got a pro forma second deck yeah that 's wrong I 'm hoping cool right except that the local feedback can 't_''_855.54 be acted on because there 's no money in the budget just make sure yet neither so you okay radio through okay you can speak to it incredibly briefly yeah yeah sure so actually we haven 't been to our optimization program we just heard earlier today in fact that is a whole conversation to be had about what projects are going to happen and what aren 't and I think you know it 's really important we 've talked about engaging with our communities we 've talked about involving our communities and yet making decisions to remove things from communities without any community input through public feedback I think is not the right approach this actually isn 't going to make a difference because if there 's no money on budget to fix the bridge making a decision today or in a month 's time isn 't going to change the fact I can 't see the harm in talking to local people actually we 're missing a fantastic opportunity that tidal barrage probably needs to be fixed there 's repair work needs to happen in this area and instead of going out with a positive message about what we 're doing to fix this area for things like lateral spread River damage to the retaining walls and enhance this area or two at least fix it we 're actually telling the community we 're taking something away from it now look I don 't have a predetermined view on whether this bread should stay or not I think it 's incredibly hard though for people that have been putting up with a number of things earthquake repairs waiting and waiting and waiting for insurance settlements people have been patient and they accept that we 've got a huge challenge ahead but if we really wanted to take a strategic view which I mean I 'm not going to move today because we 've heard that we only want to focus on the Catherine Street footbridge but I ask all of you the city and work out a prioritization of which ones will be fixed and win because we 've just consigned up to an LTP that have told communities will wait 30 years to fix some bridges and now what we 're doing today is saying we 're not even going to fix this one so you know I just think to give people a chance to feed on is really important it actually does more damage taking things away without public and put then there i think deferring this for a month so please support this if it was in your area and you felt passionately about it then i would expect you know to support you having public consultation on things that you think are important well i am the other ward councillor and i have a completely different view too jaani on this particular thing we 've got a bridge 35 seconds away and I am not willing to spend over half a million dollars to fix it i 'm also not willing to spend thousands of dollars on a consultation which either a proposal or an option community would rather see that money put in the something that actually has more value like cleaning up here 's before assisted come to the city committee and we had a long discussion about it as well but the thing is that something good could come out of this and there is an opportunity for the community to get together and if this bridge goes we talked about this to actually enhance the infant 's to the other one and enhance the access to the other ones through a community paths and some plantings so I think getting the community involved in this decision could have a really good outcome in a strengthening communities way so I 'm really supporting this and if it was in our ward you know we would think differently about just going yep gets done so i agree with yanni we need to engage the people and I don 't think that 's going to a little bit more time is going to change anything and I do think that the outcome will be better um look I i think the sentiment Yan is expressing and then really though I think it 's part of informing people about the council decision so there 's two issues one is deciding on whether or not that the bridge shouldn 't be taken away and the other one is how we actually consult and I put that inverted commas because we don 't need to as counsel on Salem might have implied on food that to do a whole full consultation process there is a section the local government act of course which is about seeking the community 's views and it can be about a decision that we 've made and giving people a reason so I it just seems to me if we if we can communicate I think the important pieces that there will be some resonance who will impact on and we want and will want to know about the way you know the reasons for making the decision so I 'm not so sure that yeah I guess an advantage of delaying delaying the the issue is in fact we could work out the best way of communicative a of communicating this to leader oh I 'm but I 've moved the domain recommendation it is okay thank you but this came to the committee it 's also staff have gone to the community board and the community board should be the ones that are in the Beast touch for this community and they there was no issue raised there I mean the question with regards to informing as an important one but the fact mirrors if this were in my ward and I hear two bridges 35 seconds apart and the situation that we run and move forward there would be no question that I would be more than happy for this bridge to go and I would be telling my community ditch because 35 seconds down this the riverbank is another bridge I think the staff have done a great job with the information with regards to the quality of the old bridge which has been closed for four years okay so I am supporting a staff recommendation and I do think that maybe the question should be asked of the community board that they should have gone out and maybe our staff thank you yes there is actually this is not about bridges this is about communication with communities and the point of Pauline made who knows what might come out of a conversation with the community and by way of example we had a very similar situation to this in governor 's Bay and we had a public meeting in governor 's Bay that over 60 people from that small community attended to talk to them about what councils proposal was for the wharf at governors Bay which was not to repair it and not to fund it out of that meeting came a community group with a number of experts on that community group all volunteers who came up with a plan to repair the wharf at governor 's Bay who came and presented through our long-term plan process a very compelling case for doing so they 're about to be in receipt of some funding to do that and that will enable them to and raise the the remaining two and a half most 3 million dollars that 's needed to do the job and I 'm talking about the value of deferring a project for a month to enable us to have a conversation with a community that could result in any number of positive outcomes either for this bridge or for the other bridge or maybe even not for a bridge but for some other good thing in the community I think that 's worth doing and that 's the reason I 'm supporting the amendment it 's not about this bridge it 's about this community so yannis amendment as the air seconded Andrew that report leader food for a month to a local feedback on the proposal can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed do you want to do it by then your hands okay hence those in favor raise your hand one two three four five six those opposed one two three four five six what does that mean can we phone in a friend so it 's lost it doesn 't pass so we can we go back to the original scry motion which was moved by full and seconded by somebody and that this one what it is sorry what 's your problem Ellie all right okay it 's the same one no it 's the same one that 's here it 's the committee recommendation so to to include can we just pass that on to Dave who i think has gotten that message very very well there are there are two skirt notifies the local community on any of the projects and i think most of you will have seen a number of those around when the projects go and it doesn 't actually normally put in the reasons why but certainly we could work with their team and our team our comms team to actually get the message around so that we inform the local community as part of that conversation about councils and make sure that there 's a pre lead now I don 't know when in actual fact the bridge will be yeah basically once it gets released it would actually go into a program so it won 't happen I don 't imagine tomorrow so I 'm not sure when we just leave it is so we just because he 's had to sit through that debate the best messages from scooter the ones that come with the chocolate attached exam it was Phil it will be good to hear that notion and okay note the staff have been requested to right okay can I now put that no no he 's not he 's not he 's already had as amendment so I 'm happy to put them separately and not a problem

    "text": "I 'm thinking or take the reporters read I just want to raise a couple of issues that aren 't in the report so just a reminder that we 've announced our partnerships approvals so that 's a process around having one convenient point of contact for our customers two parts of a council that involved in determining if a project can proceed and also about us providing consistent and regular information so it 's really about assisting key projects in terms of navigating the all the processes around can sense things such as water supply dealing wastewater trade waste traffic issues as well as establishing if there 's any land contamination and guiding customers through the licensing processes such as food and liquor and getting approval for public use of premises so it really is a partnership approach that it helps to navigate and to streamline you know the approvals processes through the council it officially starts on first of July but we have been piloting proces got really good feedback and improving you know the opportunity took through the streamlined process and currently there are about 85 projects focused on the central city but support development and significant projects also outside the CBD so it 's just a reminder about that the second thing I just want to let you know about is that following some of the submissions and hearings and the staff have been putting together a work day clean-up day out at New Brighton for this saturday along with volunteers so thanks to andrew Rutledge and his team and the parks team really looking at cleaning up weeding mulch and gardens clicking letter sweeping pass and you know providing an event to undertake really a neighborhood landscape clean up so a lot of works gone into that a lot of volunteers are supporting the process including some of the local schools and I think it 's just a really good effort by staff in terms of managing a large project like that they do it from time to time but it would be great thing for New Brighton as well if you have questions if I may just offer a comment on the first one great to see the the costs being driven down and gamers Vicki loves us whole of life cost savings so delighted to see those coming through and over your bike into it could we find a way into their three contracts around that area so there 's that the mall Marine Parade and then the beach which actually is crown but the responsibilities falls to our Park Rangers so is there a way we can have a joined-up process over those contracts to really get it sharp well I have taken this question up with with staff but coming out of that cleanup day could we also have a permanent ongoing tension ality and help it I think that that 's what the community is looking for I think as part of our review all contracts will be looking at opportunities to lean streamline abrogate and thinking about the performance of those contracts as well so there 's an ongoing process but certainly take it on board that you want to see some specific action around there I 'm yes please yeah real focus and it I think it 's one thing that 's come through the submissions is not 's it 's not always deliberate but just sometimes the silos that fall even with contracts so they 're not joined up if we could bring it all together along with that package tomorrow would be that 's what we 're really interested in looking at how we reduce silos how we work together integrating because i also want us to do the basics well like the rubbish bins and that need toilets thank you thank you just add to that clinton is a whole map of the area that they 're doing that i 'll give you later along with the whole work plan and thanks yeah and so Pauline was next it 's on it as well um so this is council leaders that Carlene initiated so because keep New Zealand beautiful run one in September New Zealand wide clean up New Zealand and I think that if this is successful it will be quite good to run one in conjunction with them as well and they provide a lot of materials and things so if that could be flagged as well and and if we can get good for New Brighton to bring the people together and also maybe some measurement of what they get of what type of rubbish there is so that people know hang and we 've got to address this problem a lot of its coffee cups or we can get a message out there hey guys you know just work on what you do with your rubbish would be really good I got with you yep thank you I 've got Yanni and then Paul and then they come thank you I was particularly interested in the carry forward so you know I guess we 're carrying forward 600 million of earthquake repairs but I I 'm still struggling given our long-term plan how that 's going to be reflected in terms of the the things that we need to spend money on and win as what else can we do to address this huge carry forward issue because it doesn 't seem hard for people to understand why things are taking so long and not being done and yet we 're not we 're not spending the money so it 's what like do we need to have a review of skirt to try and find out why these things have been delayed so i 'll just come ending us Dave Edinson to comment as well there it 's a complex issue there are many things that need to be considered I 've included in my paper some of the things that we 're doing about our capital delivery program and about how we trying to make sure that we don 't waste time there 's good handovers a good decision making and and streamlining that process issues around scoot or not just around scoot but there are some of it 's about the decision-making and about allocation of funds and as the crown looks it gets to the end of its contribution and looks at how it prioritizes those so those decisions will contribute to how much scoot can undertake there are other areas that contribute to that such as a summoner road corridor of course 110 moon so some of that its timing there are also some savings and they 're from some of the work that actually happened also some of the you know major facilities rebuild we 're again a contribution to crown or our own facilities it becomes a timing issue so I don 't know David you 've got anything else to add you you you you you you you so there are those reports though go to strategy and finance and the infrastructure committee but certainly that 's detailed on strategy okay that 's fine i guess when i look at what what we 're doing we 've got great for Christchurch and we got fit for the future but it seems to me the area where we 're spending the most amount of money or actually ironically where we 're not spending the most amount of money that we say we 're going to spend doesn 't seem to have any strategic review around the best mechanism of delivery so it seems to me that there 's a bit of a gap but maybe you 're doing the work on there ya know I don 't so do you look on page 28 the capital into in case this review so we 've of projects around sort of quick ones and there are some longer-term projects fear there are probably I guess three things that will happen so there 's the air actual delivery internally so that 's they into in crisis and thinking about that then there 's a looking at the way that we do things such as forecast the program the optimization around that and then there 's the food but around you know are we budgeting and forecasting on the right way sorry I 'm just just to be clear I 'm talking about the skirt 600 million that 's been carried forward so I understand for our own capital projects I 'm talking about the infrastructure repair is that part of that capital windy in process what 's up in terms of how we deliver on Capitol across the organization including skirt it couldn 't it concludes good doesn 't there 's some work around the transition of student really okay so so that 's hot so work to be done and I just don 't raise can I just ask two other questions one is the sin favorite I 've had is that it 's great for people reporting but people haven 't had much follow-up so can you confirm that there 's some sort of review of encouraging people to report but what actually happens to those requests because I mean I 've used it myself and when I 've rung up nothing is good question so your tongue Matt 's nets in Seoul yeah so at the moment that comes into the organization and rather than at the moment having an electronic process it follows it through process so that it 's in referred to the particular departments so we 'll be looking at how that works and how that we how we can get the feedback back to whoever 's sent in the complaint or the issue in a way that doesn 't add more resource so at the moment quite a lot of our calls to call centers are rework where people were put in a concern or complaint and then we 're spending time phoning them back so we need to find a much an electronic way to be able to do say fix this pothole or this pothole needs fixing that that pothole gets fixed within two weeks or three weeks and they 're told because at the moment when you ring up they say well we don 't know quite where that 's got two and we 're so that 's what I 'm talking about how about having a street again and I 'll it to happen it will still be prioritized with all the other work because we have these issues come in in different ways not just in terms of the snaps in Seoul yeah okay and the final question yeah it 's just through the long term plan we 've had a number of people raise concern around understanding where their streets will be repaired or not given that we 've now had the horizontal infrastructure review I presume there 's a public optimization less that 's available that we can tell people now you know what are the Skip projects that are that are happening in the repair projects and what are the projects that will be you know going to be done in 30 plan so when can we present that information to the community so that they can get some visible so the places of discussion between crown and the council regarding once that discussions had and we 've landed all the issues around the horizontal infrastructure then the final program will be optimized and then we will be able to come out timing of that I think fair to say on both sides of it both sides of the table they want to do it as soon as possible but some of the issues will need to go all the way I presume to council here and probably a cabinet so there is a process I don 't think staff have got the ability to take it that likely to be able to be public I know that something that is a section a big section of projects that have been endorsed by the heat and haven 't_''_907.93 been approved by the funders and there is another section a program that was being not endorsed by the head butt bone identified in the independent review that needs to go through that agreement misleading at this point in time but for the council 's own and works in terms of sleep that hearing things that get feeling here brr kind of a five-year dancing machine in the in the plan but they have assumed I presume and look I 'd have to go and talk to Chris Gregory and his team they 've assumed an endpoint and out of the script program I would I wonder just for next month if you could just let us know the likely timetable for all that that would be very welcome thanks man okay right cool first of all just want to say that 's a an explorer aboard the reports seem to be getting more informative for an easy to read this really good and i will say she 's surprised it out of the 46,000 phone calls that tech contact service center actually receive and the nineteen hundred emails there are only five complaints about staff but the question being is actually are those complaints about staff from the same people about the same people not often not so so sometimes they 're about sometimes it 's the way that something 's been communicated so we deal with each one of those at the time because we have such a wide variety of areas that people contact then they 're inevitably going to be different differently I 've complained that about many others receive a fantastic on the whole we get very positive feedback from the call center in the service areas and you know other frontline staff that we here morning Dave I was just studying what I was going to say military meditating you this is thank you look I got to just reinforce a few other comments around the table about the quality of the report we 're getting us it 's more expensive and more informative and memory but to reinforce a couple of points so when the clean made earlier about New Brighton levels of service it 's been my experience that as has been indicated that there are two or three contract the area and quite often one contractors noticing something and it 's not being into the other and so a more code policy on how we just like to probably reinforce a few comments that it has been deliberated on by previous speakers very concern on capital expenditure only going to be fifty nine percent a year end and equally the EQ rebuild accounts for thirty six percent of our budget and yet were only spending then so that 's quite a substantial impact on our position going forward and I would sort of appreciate and future reporting some progress on how we are dealing with those two matters particularly a subject that sort of become a little bit dear to my heart with other organizations on involved with his health and safety raised before and are particularly interested in on page 27 where we talked about types of accidents in May and we list the verbal abuse as being a health and safety criteria and I 'll be quite interested in sort of knowing how much that particular aspect is being a factor in an error reporting on health and safety is it a major issue for us or it 's not a in the numbers a major issue but as a concerning issue and just as severe as internal or so go with parking enforcement officers is it a big issue within it potentially could be I hadn 't got specific numbers but those sorts of areas other areas we even in the way that sometimes emails are written from external people potentially internally as well but abuse of all sorts something that we can 't tolerate and so something that we need to address sort of an understand the thing here that when parents out of it as we go forward and lastly just a comment I suppose on page 28 we list the four strategic priorities for the organization and the first bullet point we talked about we expect to serve the citizens of Christchurch and banks peninsula I think that 's probably a little bit of a disservice banks financial or as part of Christchurch so then we talked about Christ Church and the rest of the document that splitting the two they 're probably exacerbates a bit of division that we don 't particularly want to carry forward I think sure once it really from feedback that sometimes people in of Christchurch but I take that take a point thank you thanks your report Colleen and I was very interested to hear your comments in relation to Davis a Christian around verbal abuse um I just wanted to ask you about the it 's on page 29 with the draft executive leadership team plan and I 'm really pleased to see that and pleased that you know that 's come to to us as counselors I 'm just wondering is there have you got in mind anything away preps that the elt plan can be really like joined up with councils governance and it 's very good point so the role of us is it it 's cascaded down through all staff performance and development and requirements and that staffed determine how they are individually or when their teams contribute to achieving these particular strategies Oh and I haven 't thought about then what that means in terms of our governance but certainly I wouldn 't expect there any of these would conflict with anything that you 're trying to achieve either they wouldn 't Kelly mean can I just really their term I 'm really impressed and to see this and I 'm just wondering if a way that in fact we we can help the council kind of like achieve its visual the visions and the strategic priorities as if as councillors we meet with the ELT to discuss the pain would that be possible in couple could there be arranged and chocolatey interested in there just comment on the mechanic I 'm capital so as well as that thanks Peter jimmy le one question on page 24 the are regarding the issue of complain and with review this information looks like in April they have a mighty complaint but in May is a hung jury and most of them is kind of a particular concern by the street asleep in place of traffic island etc I just want to know the parser difference between this specific complaint in our regular you know so our channel like a service center call center where they seeking the summer issue gathered a customer service request lumber is any difference oh um so we do receive formal complaints as well as in a number of ways and we 'll deal with them as complaints service requests will deal so this is a formal complaint ok if this a formal complaint I just want to know whether we have any process you know for instance we receive this complaint and we have processed until they 're the customer you know they are even other satisfaction but they at least acceptable our kind of response have any that come from a channel si tu NE well a week we might have released further if information and also I review on page 28 one of the four strategic priority for a OT the first one is improve our public service so these information puppies where we were they could do the information for us to improve out of happy stories mate right so we do complaints and issues raised as an ongoing way to improve our service and it 's actually really helpful to do that but are you suggesting that we publicize what those complaints are by maressa public whether can give us a reference you know whether it is we have dealing be some privacy issues in there but we can find a way so that you get a better sense of what the issues are ok thank you I just wanted to make a comment on the snaps in solve which I agree is a fantastic thing that I 've used several times including a test of my lunch which came back with a comment looks nice so just to make sure it would my point is that i 've used it about seven or eight times and i just want to pick up on what yani said i cannot underestimate the importance of getting that communication right what I 'm here as and follow up what I 'm hearing is that something you 're looking at what I want to hear is yes something 's in place in its starting next Monday because I think what will happen is if you 've got people using it and you 're not getting people are not getting that follow up they 'll give it away so i just wanted to really reiterate that and how important it is to have that operating to the top paragraph in the middle column on page 24 remote participation in Council hearings and seminar and of course this is particularly relevant to the more remote parts of the city banks peninsula I guess is one of those areas that really will benefit from this coming to the last sentence in that paragraph until Standing Orders are amended they cannot participate remotely as decision makers so obviously we 've been able to use this as part of the hearings and so that people can send seminars and so on and I 've been in a number of meetings where this has worked very successfully is there any work going on around making a recommendation on standing orders or would it require a resolution of counsel before that would could start thank you thank you okay so _"

    "text": "so this is we 're on to the open mic section section Antony you 've got five minutes maximum and you 're allowed to use that and pretty much any way you want so welcome and we 're in your hands top of my head because until I walked in here and got asked if I wanted to contribute I had no intention of contributing but it is something that has bugged me for quite a while and I 've been here right from the start of the earthquakes and my house is not fixed yet I live closely in a city so I can 't escape the earthquake in april-may I was overseas attending my niece 's wedding and I had no internet access until I got to New York at the beginning of May and I just really went crazy because it was so nice to be able to get emails and check the websites and everything but I was horrified to see on the press website that everything seemed to be on hold the Sports Center the convention center in particular everything seemed to be on hold of those and it because I was traveling on my only had a lot of thinking time and I thought to myself is it really time with Sarah 's mandate coming to an end is it really time to have our David long a cup of tea and to revisit the whole plan for the inner city and I 'm talking here about the areas that are we 're included in the original Sarah plan and I also remember the enthusiasm with which christ church people participated in the share an idea project and I just I just wondered if it was within the Christchurch City Council 's power to institute something like that again I mean we look at the inner city and it is there there are parts where you can see that things are coming together and I 'm cafe enthusiasts and I go every morning to vex cafe and Victoria Street and of course Victoria streets really booming and there 's lots of things happening but it 's not happening in the inner city and there are parts of inner city that really worried me like and there are still buildings there that looked like they have to come down it 's a benzene building which has looked the same for ages and what I really wonder is with things like the convention center rumor has it that mr. Burnley cannot get the money out of cabinet with the inflated costs of the Convention Center and you look at the amount of of land that has been cleared for the convention center and I wonder whether it 's time to have an honest discussion with the government and say well can we compromise on the size of convention center make it smaller and maybe turn the area around it in some sort of parkland just it 's just worries me the center city and I also wound up whether it would be really good to have people participate to help citizens given the opportunity again to share another idea now that they see the blank canvas and it 's nearly five years down the track can we go back that the so many great ideas came out of sheer an idea can we go back to other ideas now that they see what 's there now that 's just what I want to say there is actually decide from the government is actually a lot of private investment going into the the area talked about there is a major development going and down here if the strictest and hear you talking about I know there 's some other areas are fading a little but they I think it 's not a question I was just it was more actually just to assure that sounds like an advertisement private investment going in the other snot not government hmm but there still are a lot of areas that doesn 't look as though anything seven eighty percent of our building is torn down hmm it 's a question um there 's just been a public consultation on Victoria Square and um you know what I did participate in which what she did and one of the things that I race was with so wat Cathedral Square we 've still got all this other public space and the central city that there 's sort of no process do you should be looking at the whole central city including the inner city east side and in terms of one consultation or whether the idea that you would consult on individual projects no it 's because i think it 's the area that is covered by the sero plan that I wonder about because I think that you can have a wonderful wonderful suburbs but if a scent of a city is like it is at the moment it drags down the whole place that 's I think the cities that are really great overseas are ones that have really good centers yeah that people gravitate to I was it more like the house right thank you _"

    "text": "thank you and so these last two moved what Andrew and Phil right so so who would like to debate this I 'll put the question yeah you should I provide some context I think it might be useful if I provide some context on what I consider it means for the LTP and financially well except that I think that people are pretty much made up their minds yeah yeah I 'm not not wanting to be unhelpful or not ungrateful for your advice and no no it says by means other than the sale of companies or she is in company so it rules out any asset sales at all yes I know but yeah but but yeah yeah i mean my amendment i thought would have been sufficient to see a change in the slang but there are some so let 's just let 's just proceed Andrew so these amendments won 't come as any surprise we have repeatedly talked about the sale of assets and the need for the sale of assets and other ways of raising capital and whilst we welcome the broader conversation certainly will support investigation of other ways of raising capital internally through ways of preference shares debt raising and companies all of the advice that we 're we 're hoping to get when our advisors report back on this that doesn 't change the fact that if we don 't believe there is a need to sell assets or to sell shares in companies or sickle cell companies that we would be agreeing to do so so the fact that there may be a future discussion about ways of raising capital which may not involve the sale of assets doesn 't mean that we would agree to and allow the sale of assets to remain part of that conversation so that 's the background to these amendments over the past weeks and over the past couple of days there 's been a lot of conversation around reducing capital budgets in particular and ways of reducing the the work program that council is intending to deliver reducing the size changing the timing of that work program and a big part of our focus on foot on the on capital program has in general and sale of assets in particular so we continue to take the position that it is possible to come up with a budget which allows for capital raising to happen by ways other than the sale of companies or the shares in companies other than by the sale of assets essentially in the first year and that we then expect to see a far-reaching thorough and aggressive review of the capital program and other areas of expenditure in the year between the first of July 2015 and the 30th of June 2016 that in turn would reduce the pressure on those budgets before we get to the time of the annual plan so that we don 't need to be proposing the sale of assets in years two and three of the plan if we 're successful in reducing capital programs to a certain degree in year one then that read that allows the capacity for internal capital raising to be carried forward in two years two and three and if we 're successful in removing pressure on the budget by changing the capital program in particular over that will in fact reduce the need or possibly alleviate the need altogether for the sale of assets in years two and three so this is totally consistent with a position that we 've taken quite publicly for some time it continues to be our position and we do not support the sale of assets where that sale of assets is unnecessary and I would urge others around the council table in response to the many submissions that we heard through the long-term plan process both written and verbal and some of those submissions certainly stated very very intelligently very clearly and very emotionally i would encourage counselors to respond to those submissions by and voting in favor of the amendments that we got up there today anyone else know are you saying i am putting them separately you spoke I 'm kind of in the middle in there year one I don 't agree with but I am an agreement with not selling shares in strategic assets in years two and three and I particularly like leeanne 's amendment about looking at the possibility of timing further out so actual wording there makes it a wee bit tricky to vote for but I think that we can get through and find the money without selling in issues and strategic assets the ones that we have now defined as strategic assets the port the airport and Orion and I think that we can do that by a slightly longer raising of capital so I 'm happy I 'm going to vote against year one because i think there 's actually i 'm happy to vote against selling shares and strategic now defined strategic assets but you haven 't done it so you make it really hard that 's what I 'm saying I 'm cool she was saying that she would agree with it if it was strategic assets but I mean that then year two and three the thing is that it is what it does that yeah and um and that 's no because other people have asked to speak so we can 't do there until we 've got to a point with enough people have spoken so yours you have spoken you 've spoken and now actually saying that we 're not going to sell off our strategic assets unless we do more consultation as an action we have had two rounds of engagement and consultation on the issue of asset sales and overwhelmingly the public have feedback to us that they do not support the asset sales agenda that we have put out as part of our financial strategy and I think it 's entirely reasonable that we can fund what we need to fund through other means and mechanisms and whether that 's capital release rather than sale things like preference shares bombs and raising debt on some of those existing companies I think we can do it the reality is that a number of the Inca projects have been delayed which gives us sufficiently enough Headroom to be able to deal with the things that we need to deal with the moon made the comment before in a previous debate that the taxpayers shouldn 't pick up the under under insurance that we had as a city in ihe agree with that but I do think the taxpayers should pick up the super it 's that financial hole that we 're actually struggling to fund the government super-sized our central city plan from 800 million to two billion leaving a shortfall of 1.2 billion dollars that was an imposed cost on us by government and so I think it 's entirely clear that the huge increase in cost is meant by the government they are the ones that with a nun consulted on blueprint the other ones that imposed a series of costs on us as a city whether it 's the use of designations on public lands so effectively taking away what we owned and having to sell it to them stopping us having the ability of putting back anchor projects or facilities in existing areas that would save us a lot of money for example if we 've been able to just build the convention center back on its existing site maybe with a slight increase or more than a slight increase or keeping the existing library I was so proud that this council decided to fix the town hall for the third time because actually that was an incredibly important to keep unfortunately we couldn 't do the same for Centennial poll what has been the cost of that on our community and to our city huge and we couldn 't do it for the library and I support a new Central Library because we don 't have any other choice we 've lost the old one that 's been demolished but that was a perfectly good sustainable building that could have been like this one we 're standing today Richard Feder refurbished expanded and make good for a fraction of the price of the imposed blueprint on us so I think that s it sales is incredibly short-sighted because I think what it does is it simply gives gets rid of things that raise revenue it gives us at least sovereignty over the important things that we control is a city that I 've been so proud thing on the gift council on a community board and now on the council to have inherited from previous generations and those assets have meant we 've been able to achieve an awesome quality of life in our city before the earthquake with face post-earthquake and I don 't believe getting rid of those assets that are being so incredibly valuable is the wise thing to do particularly because the money is going into assets that are going to have a huge financial impact whether it 's a new stadium whether it 's the new Metro sports facility these facilities will have a huge cost to us ongoing so we 'll things like that precinct 100 million dollar precinct that we have to incur the ongoing maintenance costs and so simply the economic equation to me is why would you sell off things that bring in revenue to invest in things that lose huge amounts of money it doesn 't seem a very sustainable or financially prudent thing to do and I think the public submissions in the public engagement if overwhelmingly said to us that this isn 't something they support and so I urge you to listen to what the people have said and knock sell off the AC to vote for these amendments what else okay i 'll put the i 'll put the motion while it will deal could put the screen up it 's lost and the second one that 's I 'm also lost so thanks very much for that so that that brings us gosh that 's actually not bad for past five and so now we 're in a position to advise the auditor of the changes that we 've made and there will be some detailed advice provided to the auditor now and they should be in a position to analyze that overnight and we should be able to get a draft of the letter that Colleen and I required to sign some time tomorrow afternoon that fingers crossed that that 's all going well then on the on Friday we 'll we 'll come back here I think we 're due to commence set 9 13 9 30 on friday and on and I mean we 've got a meeting tomorrow but that 's an ordinary council meeting it 's just going to seem like such a calm down after after all this excitement and on Friday we 'll have the that the the over arching motion which which must remain the make new amendments to it now we 've dealt with the amendments and we so we are able to advise the auditor that that 's where we 've got to and they 'll be provided providing their audit opinion for Friday and on Friday that 's where I 'm expecting us to have the big debate where everyone I think will contribute to the debate and and and people will be able to come into even on things that they 've already commented on and the amendments process so that we can resolve the LTP and and yeah get things that I 'm get things on track so David did you have a to visit absolute necessary to start at nine thirty I 've got a transverse board meeting output of hours and you had a ten o 'clock start I don 't know is if people got issues around the time hey I 'm happy to yeah the flow but I can tell them know why he 's here I can 't but I just thought if we were you but there 's quite a few motions that we so we 'll do that yani i 'm just very quickly um there 's the notice of motion tomorrow around the Legionnaires I just if anyone 's got concerns can you please just let me know before the meeting it 's only asking for a reports I don 't know a big interest you know I 've talked to staff I think that 's fine yeah it 's cool yeah hey you sooo good an informal tomorrow morning yep all right everyone 's home right very good thank you all very much and I 'll adjourn this meeting until friday and i 'll see you all tomorrow morning _"

involved right so that 's fine so we don 't need to breathe the lotion too so whip but we haven 't_''_76.89 we have just assumed now and we 're very clear wyndham interest when the Metro sports opens whichever decade that is yes now I understand that yes dictation it 's not necessarily exactly what we 've got in the budget at this point of time but it 's not unpacked yeah I just don 't what we told next year that it 's closing or anything so yeah okay I 've recorded what you see things people yeah okay so right now we 've now really that just that the only things that are left now are the the People 's Choice amendments around the financial strategy and strategic assets but there is one other which got missed because it 's under an accessible City and anchor projects and it 's the amendment stadium be deferred to be commenced in 20 26 well I don 't know that we can we can actually do that because it 's a unilateral decision on the on the on the cost sharing agreement we 've already pushed it out beyond well that the auditor-general is accepted that the amount that we 've pushed it out by because of the public statements of the with our decision that has been sufficient but i don 't know that i can accept an amendment to boom yeah i have to shuck that we 're actually going to do it and I otherwise ensure might as well just tear up the contract the client is compensation a million times but no no but I don 't think that we can change that we can 't change unilaterally a the cost sharing agreement yeah and look what we 've got that we 've got the insurance thing look during the course of the next year I mean I don 't want to get to a point where I mean there 's no point putting it up for debate and having a resolution on it we can 't change the cost sharing agreement around this table that has to be done a negotiation with central government we 've already told central government we want to talk to them about the cost sharing agreement we want to talk to them about the blueprint we want to talk to them about our land drainage recovery program we want to talk to 've started that conversation we will not get the minister stating publicly that he agrees to push this out to 20 26 and that means that we don 't get an LTP past if we write that unto our LTP but just they unilaterally change their I don 't buy by here I don 't care that the truth is is that there are some issues that we do need to resolve with central government but I can 't take this amendment in front of the LTP hearing today I can 't take this amendment so I mean that 's the advice that I 've received in terms of legal advice currently in an LTP we still have no written confirmation from government that they 're accepting of where we 've got it which is currently different to what 's in the cost yet yes that 's right that 's right and aims I can probably talk to that the the Audit Office spoke distinctly with Sarah and we wrote letters to Sarah around the timing off the anchor projects around the exceed their expectations around ownership and while they took in the draft long-term plan and we 're comfortable that the discussions carried on from that point so we do have we do have an evidential trail that the crown in ourselves have an agreed-upon for the current timing of the snow that has been accepted by the auditor is and we can 't change that today so I 'm rule that that amendment can 't_''_340.97 be put so that brings us on to the financial strategy and the strategic assets which we can address now there was one of the amendments included in and the range of amendments that doesn 't need to be put as an amendment because I 'm still working with Carlene over how we establish this external group that provides advice but I 've got absolutely no difficulty that they report bimonthly to strategy and finance so it 's perfectly perfectly fine so Colleen and I will just take that on board and how we establish this group whether they 're advising to management whether they 're advising to governance or whether it 's a combination of both as yet to be determined we to clarify the establishment of that group is that established by the mayor or is less established by the council is will it come to counsel for a decision or will it be a decision we haven 't decided whether it 's going to be the chief executive or the council ya say so it 'll be reported on in some ways it 's all be reported on in some way very soon but it 's still not it 's still work in progress and there 's still people that we 're talking to because there are people who would be better providing technical advice and support to the organization and people who 'd be better providing governance and put to the governance so that 's what we 're working on at the moment there 's no the resolution that we were intending putting is very very clearly so as long as we can be confident as going to be taken into account in any considerations then uncertainly comfortable with it thank you great alright so I 'm what I propose is that with the remaining ones that the first of growth expended should be removed from the LTP and then the strategic assets will go through and as has been requested put them individually and then the last two amendments I think we 'll just put them together because they really cover the same issue and that 's not drawing on the sale of companies or shares and companies and you need one of the three years of the first three years of the LTP if I could request that they be put separately because our reason for the thinking in each is quite different so the mitigation for one is different than the mitigation for the other so it 's not wanting to be difficult but if we could have those put separate sit there so that 's two separate debates and we are now at 426 so maybe if we could agree to debate both together but just take each one separately from Edison yellow making viewpoint yep fine okay the consulship base does that include ownership of the town hall obviously I 'm keen to keep the town hall and our strategic assets but I 'm request an answer on it sorry the the Town Hall ownership can you tell me exactly who owns the town hall because I 'm really keen to keep it as a strategic a seat but i 'm not sure what council shareholding envy base where the data includes the town hall so before i wrote on it i just want to understand it I believe I know the answer but all I support my friend I suspect dude do somethi base own does it be based on any of the other ones like does it own Eddington arena it does so no unless the Town Hall was listed as a as coming off the assets list it remains on the strategic assets loss presumably the classic Town Hall was on their suits well I just want to be totally well yeah that 's what I have to be totally clear about its but if addington arena is owned by B base then we wouldn 't be taking it off the a-list okay so can we just put an additional one that the town will remain on the strategic 80s yeah doing thanks no you don 't um yeah that 's what I want to be clear about but we 'll deal with that when we come to it well why don 't why don 't we put the council shareholding on V base limited provided that the Town Hall Christchurch town will remain on the strategic assets list how about there yep yep good okay so the first one 170 million dollars of growth expend it should be removed from the LGP who 's providing advice on that yeah I was hoping to go out on the last effect of it didn 't go anywhere I find it really difficult to respond to this one because it doesn 't tell me why or what or where I mean obviously what we have is a major investment across a whole lot of asset classes basically to support growth of the city so traditionally the council has set the most important things are basically renewals so keeping the engine room of the city running but then basically continue to invest in the key infrastructure that delivers growth and for the city that networks for for obviously for water for wastewater for stormwater but because we 've always had a commitment to building new communities it 's always also been an investment into community assets such as libraries and swimming pools community centers parks and reserves so I suppose you know it just so it just seems to me to be a little incongruous to suddenly say actually we need to actually continue to invest in making sure the season attractive place and we 're ready to invest and when people with to do that and increasingly there are expectations and commitments that come through the Resource Management Act for us to demonstrate we have at least so many years of growth Headroom to suddenly start arbitrarily taking money out of that doesn 't mean we 're going to be able to deliver that it simply means we 're probably going to do eight years worth of investment rather than ten or it means that we 're going to be investing a lot more slowly into growth which if development pressures come on is only going to catch us short so I 'm effect to that outcome but I don 't think given that we 've got a programmer works going on that created sustainable program of investment for growth suddenly trimming 170 million dollars off that over the ten years is a very sustainable or strategic move to make okay that 's fine so could we have a mover and a seconder and we 'll get to the debate move by yanni seconded by Andrew and I 'd like to open up the debate um so it is a huge chance for us because basically what we 're faced with is a rezoning of huge amounts of greenfield land and you know and then a kind of not a not a commitment not a requirement but a decision about whether we chose to fund all the infrastructure that goes to those new growth areas we heard the other day that the value of resigning land and an existing rural area or open space area to commute we had a million dollars and we got a value of 10 million if we resigned it so this is what is happening and through all costs occurred with the process of development but fundamentally it is a huge excludes to provide the infrastructure to these growth areas that we have to weigh up about whether we can afford or not so if we want to do the things in the simple study that many of us have said makes sense and is a good idea and some of us said maybe we need to also spend money fixing some of the broken infrastructure first then I it 's really hard for me to support the 600 million that 's going into growth in our city this is unsustainable economic invest into areas that some are actually not even going to hit in the time frames that we thought they were we quite quickly after the earthquake resigned a number of places so that we could deal try and deal with the housing situation enable people to have choice and to move into some of these growth areas we have not seen the growth that we expected so over the course of this ten-year plan I do not believe that we will be able to spend 's wise to spin this money on infrastructure ahead of the growth and the hope that the growth will go there and I think one of the concerning things of course is through some of the other agencies that we 've heard from like CDC as the worry of the oversupply of housing in the next five years so we get to a tipping point we suddenly we have all these suburbs that have been built we 've got all this expensive infrastructure but we possibly don 't have the demand and what impact does that have on us financially so 170 million isn 't actually a lot out of the over 600 million Productivity Commission is looking at ways of working through one of the recommendations as again looking at developer agreements around the ability for developers to provide the infrastructure given that they tend to benefit from it and how they might be able to fund that in a different way and I would welcome having that conversation I also think you can 't really divorce us from the dc 's issue in terms of dc 's policy huge amounts of money on growth infrastructure for growth that isn 't occurring or doesn 't need to be done as a priority when we 've got broken streets and broken suburbs then I don 't think that 's a good use of that funding all right um anyone else i 'll put that motion so i 'll do you want to put up the those and favor vote yes those opposed vote no it 's lost they 're all currently listed assets remain on the strategic assets list we 'll just have one debate over this and then I 'll put them all under vigil II so who would like to move this Andrew second up Phil is there any debate on it clean thank you I strongly urge the council to keep the currently listed assets on the strategic assets list for this reason I i think the counter I would strongly advise against proceeding down that path you can see on page 55 of your agenda a submission theme that 's being picked up it 's been highlighted it talks about the loss of control over asset proceed down this path to take them off the list so to thereby circumvent a usual part of the process would not only disempower our constituents I think it would diminish our transparency as a council we we know what happens when we don 't consult we 've seen this happen before over social housing rent increases and the pressure wastewater system for instance I think taking the line of least resistance are potentially counsel at risk my view is that it runs against a four-to-one preference to not sell down or off well as we have seen in our submission process and I think we at least owe our constituents the ability to have a say over the future of what belongs to them my view on this to sum up really is that we risk losing the confidence of our city by shortcutting what is a democratic process whether it 's the old LGA or the than you consultations a fundamental part of it and I would strongly advise against taking the path you know going down that path to take them off I 'd like to speak came through the submissions process was that when people were pressed to ask whether there was a difference between city care who was in a competitive market winning and losing contracts available in our city in other cities and Orion that was our infrastructure company they said yes he was a big difference one was strategic for the city to own and the other wasn 't and to me this is simply about not taking away the City Council 's obligation to make decisions about these particular assets which they may or may not make in the future it simply doesn 't require a special consultative procedure that doesn 't mean that we don 't consult at all it just means that we don 't have to go through an amendment to the long term plan process or through a special consultative procedure in order to to to undertake a particular role in terms of the strategic assets that we 're leaving on the list or that I 'm proposing that we leave on the list Orion the pork company and the airport again it was absolutely crystal clear that was strategic and what wasn 't and it 's interesting down and tomorrow where we saw ports of tirana purchase shareholding significant shareholding and the timaru port in that particular case it was still on their strategic assets list they went out and did a public consultation and then they sold the shear so all it did was delay proceedings as it were for four weeks while the consultation process was undertaken and the outcome for timaru has been extraordinary absolutely extraordinary and I don 't think there 'd be anyone in timaru that would be saying for one minute that you wouldn 't want to have that level of investment and to your hometown and actually that has created a few challenges for us I 'd have to say but I 'm not suggesting that we go down that particular trick these are the ones that people said weren 't strategic I understand people 's sense of what they 've lost but I have to say that in terms of what we need to invest in another city I think we actually have to look very seriously at capital and if you actually think about the situation that we 're in we 're not completely in this situation because as some have said that the government is requiring us to pay for what we shouldn 't pay for the city was under insured and every single person around this table knows that so why should the taxpayers of New Zealand pay the price for this councils under insurance and some of the things that actually we should be fronting up to as a city I want our city to be under pendant and able to stand up and speak for itself and not be beholden and I 'm very happy that we make a distinction between what is strategic for our city airport our port in our Lions company and what is not strategic a construction company well it 's become a construction company that bought out the shares of a failed company red bus which would want to apply its wares and other cities as it loses contracts here to eat Ken 's competitive system enable we 're not in a position to sell at this stage but to the future it looks like that the time that we need to address some of the problems that we 're going to face financially are going to be at a time when we can look at an able and that 's why I 'm proposing that there be some amendments in that regard so that we can bring that into the into the picture and of course you know Lancaster park obviously we 're not going to sell it now that was the question that I was asked during the process we haven 't_''_1380.5 settled our insurance claim and that 's holding up a few things as well so these are things that we don 't need to go out and have a separate specific engagement on we 've already engaged with our communities and they 've already said that these are not strategic compared to the others yummy I feel really strongly that these are strategic assets and just just recently councilman vision to ask v base to continue with its community right if you look at the rationale for taking these offers strategic assets there 's almost about judicial review for things like motorways I suggest you look at the lack of rationale behind why they should remove from a strategic asset list simply saying that it may not be necessary for the well-being of the community and that perhaps parking in central city could be provided by promoters of retail and commercial developments doesn 't actually provide any discussion around the benefits or the disadvantages of these things strategic assets and if you go through them study care I think is a hugely important strategic asset you look at the ability for us and I think you know we 've got a resolution or something that work to be done hopefully that we can get the report back on is actually looking at bringing city care into a different arrangement with counsel given the significant skills that it has and given the significant work we have to do if you go to Red Bus I just want to read you an article from the newspaper a few years ago and that was that 28 buses were taken off the road by the place 28 buses and think was expressed through submissions from the person that came in and spoke to us who said that they thought that red bus was a much superior bus operator than any of the others out of the v8 buses that were taken off the road it 's really interesting to look at where they came from red busted none of its buses had been ordered off and only forehead minor problems leopard coat shine said to have in order the road in sex ed minor problems and CBS would not give figures for their buses and what the police said was that they were absolutely alarmed at the way in which the buses were operating because it 's extremely disappointing that they 've had to come out on the road and check and the fact that these buses were operating with flaws they 're the police have identified that are placing passengers at risk so you know that 's the reality of not thinking that public trans will is strategic and leaving it to the private sector to deliver we should be incredibly proud that the red bus company that transport operators in the city and long may that continue so I think we need to look at public transport and we 've got a process to do that but I don 't support removing it from a strategic asset I think this huge risks to doing that where you get low quality public transport as is proved by the evidence that we 've had in the recent history I 'll just touch on two other points which is the eddington arena in Lancaster park and also the the parking Eddington arena and Lancaster park I think Eddington arena as a fantastic community venue V base runner I can 't see any reason why you would remove the shareholding and V base that is a venue management company that we have I think it does a good job this improvements sure we can make around the edges but fundamentally I can 't see why you 'd remove that from a strategic asset and think about all those community groups that have benefited over time and it will benefit going forward by having a discounted community rate that V base is they give to to the to the community and and just to talk on Lancaster park we 're still in our insurance negotiation the insurance saying that when have you ever fix it on site so why why would we send a signal to our ensure that we don 't think its strategic surely the same reason why we can 't change the cost year to defer the stadium should apply to the existing link s to park it is incredibly important facility and if the future isn 't to be a stadium I would expect to go through a full public consultation with our community over what what the future of that site holds and if it 's taken off the strategic asset list I think that it doesn 't give the commitment or the requirement that we will do that and finally the the on-street parking off street parking sir we heard numerous submitters came in in fact it was one of the most you know commented things outside of the other big issues we had an organized group of people that felt incredibly passionate about council I the central city given we 're going to lose a lot of on street car parking I think it 's essential that we have a very strong public off street parking regime in the central city we want people to use alternative means of transport we want cycleways and bus priority lays ways and it takes on street parking off but I think it would be incredibly important to have people being able to afford to come into the city and not having to pay twice as much to partly car as they have to pay to assume at the new mature sports facility for example what being able to come to the theater and not have to pay more than the cost of a ticket of going to a theater a theater or a movie or any other activity they want to do and we can control it if we own these off street parking facilities if we think there 's to teach it and I certainly do so urge you not to support removing this okay I 'll put um I 'll get bored go through them one on the screen yeah okay so we 'll put them up on the screen so meet ya then I 'm sorry the voting system yeah so city care so these are these are a few if you want if you don 't want them removed as ironic if you don 't want them remove vote yes and if you do want them removed say no yes if you want them to remain if you don 't want them remove it yes if you want them to remain and know if you 're happy to have them removed this wrong Fitz lost next one read bust lost next one an able lost Eddington arena most link is to park lost council shareholding md base I don 't think you can vote on this Jamie oh how many four okay back off okay the council shareholding on V base provided bit oh I see okay it is well except that it 's not the dbase yeah and over we just put that put the Town Hall as an age okay put the Town Hall is innate crash each town hall call it strategic SEO such as put the Christchurch Town Hall because it doesn 't have shareholding out who owns it I mean if we were to sell v base which I doubt we would we would take back the ownership of the town hall so I mean that 's just it 's an academic exercise but it 's an important one to reflect here no so so the six the council shareholding and debase yes the four directors abstain what happened to the thing but it 's actually probably better that the four just don 't vote at all can you do that can you just take them off so take them off that Tim scanjet Paul lonsdale Jamie golf and and Carlene I but you don 't get a vote anyway it 's will carry it scary and all off street parking facilities owner and operated by the council hey no look I don 't think anyone 's going to get to the crusher town hall so I 'm just going to take a voice vote on that one so and just say that the three don 't vote on number seven so it 's lost and what I was just going to do voices on it because I I can 't imagine had anyone have a need to 40 with that so all those in favor of the Christchurch Town Hall remaining a strategic asset say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so that one 's carried as well _"

    "text": "I I think I know that there is a right answer to this yes but how long we take to get there might depend on whether we get to some really big issues today and like giving an LTP through so far away um on the legal question so that I mean absolutely no doubt whatsoever as to what risk there might be if we were to remove this from we 've been told that the hearing shouldn 't take into account the funding implications so that actually separates those two issues the hearing outcome and funding two separate issues not linked or they shouldn 't be linked you talked about the risk of a judicial review presumably that risk would only come from a decision being made improperly not on the basis of sound advice and proper consideration and so on or is there something else that would give rise to the risk of judicial review or any greater risk to this decision than any other I think it was here is primarily reputation and pull the funding many years out now while you 're waiting for commissioners to lot of money participator and i think the implication probably do media Christmas costs I suppose if ultimately the decision and becomes epidemic they 'll still be put up on wondering why so the actress does is does anyone want to move an amendment to the LTP based on the advice that we 've received so far what what do you want to move yeah what 's up it move yani does is it as they 're a seconder no but I don 't I can 't I don 't have the right to just put it to a vote we have to have a debate now 02 it 's the cranford Street northern are two of extinction a we would have to ask the mobile and must he conducted I 'm sure that 's a um I was just going to say about the baby yeah that given on what we 've heard like rather than just be removed from the ltp be rican so be removed from the ltp and reconsidered his part of next year 's annual plan so I think that mitigates the judicial review risk we 've got designations all across the city that we have continuously rolled over for years and years and years where we haven 't actually made the writing network improvements that we took the designation for so I don 't believe that 's a fair assessment of the risk at all I do understand that Bruno middle of a process but actually our democratic process to set a long-term plan budget there 's something that I think is really valuable in a modern democracy and I actually think that that this is the proper process to discuss whether we want to fund it or not and the final point I 'll make is just to me this is really about priorities it 's not to say that this shouldn 't happen in some time in the future but actually what we 're trying to achieve is a city is balanced our finances make smart choices and we 've made a commitment to invest in public transport and cycling and alternative methods of transport which I strongly support so I can 't see the sense in building more motorways or accessories vehicle while at the same time trying to encourage people into those other means if you think of what we 're doing in the central city it 's almost the complete opposite to this so i think actually let 's try those alternative methods first and see what behavior change that can lead to we give enough financial constraint i don 't believe we can afford to do it at the moment and finally i think the risk is actually very limited and i think this is just part of our normal long-term plan process and we should feel entirely comfortable making decisions around how we choose to spend money or not and the final final point is if we 're concerned about the impacts on a writing network this stop putting traffic lights and then Martians road and clogging up the system is there anyone who wants to speak on the other side of that debate alley I am I can 't support this afternoon I think that the issue is more related to what is happening from cranford and downstream of cranford and there are other issues that back and basically checking away all the stuff that 's gone on to the so far I don 't see in a budget since why this is or how this makes any difference I 'm concerned that we 're in the middle of a process at the moment with the hearings panel we need to let that do its thing but I think that what our public and one our waters telling us is that they are concerned about issues such as what happens to the traffic when they hit on us where is the traffic going to run to why have we not looked at Barbados and the other one ways into town as a way to feed traffic away from what is an area full of families shops schools kids it 's just those are the issues that we need to focus on and I think that it isn 't clear and it 's not fair to turn this into an argument about funding for this particular part of the scheme we need to let us go through and then address these other issues after this has gone of years and but I appreciate that we 're in the middle of a hearing I 'm not in favor of the the work but i wonder if we couldn 't as a backstop to this one and have something like that funding for the northern area will be reconsidered after the hearing and before any contractual agreements are entered into but no I 'm just suggesting we reconsider it I 'm not predicting the outcome but i would like to reconsider the whole issue this is not the this is not that i mean the truth is is that we get to make a decision on the project when they 're commissioners very well anyway so we will anyway so it 's not necessary so i know to you about the design and how this is going to work we need the money there this does need to be done you know but the money went into public transport anyway so um I will so removed from the LTP and reconsider and as part of next year 's annual plan yeah put the word extension between arterial and for just have the we have the buttons up for people who are in favor to press yep people in favor press yes and people oppose press know so that is carried thank you very much all right all right the next item is the lynnwood woolston pull or actually no we 'll just deal with all of the others as one sort of kind of lump sum so the the if you go to the top of what I provided you with us the following proposals be referred to the chief executive for prioritization action with an existing budgets funding for the coastal pathway increased levels of maintenance for East Bernard and street cleaning include bradshaw terrace record on the streets renewals program prioritization of foot prepare for access to schools and community flooding at templeton bus shelters and then and those to be reported back to council by the end of august about you know those issues and at the chief executive separately report on the ICT budget is part of great for christchurch the requirements of the community house to be seized for future funding allocation analysis of model going forward and that the proposal to inflation adjust community funding per year to be consistent with the approach taken with CDC and CDT funding provisions be referred to the weaving party on community funding and if we if I move that as one major recommendation and do I have a seconder for that Andrew so yani amendment to where it says a community house that the staff advice is that we should probably just call it a community hub within the central city so rather than place with oak space it wasn 't against future just future funding allocation always actually how it could happen so maybe it 's the old d building with Sarah or it might be above us interchange but it wasn 't just a Community House already exists yeah I know but the idea was that we would look at a some sort of central community hub what we heard from submitters and the reason for it was that they 're really concerned about the lack of affordable community space and the central city and that 's why I was trying to address so requirements of community organizations for a commute the requirements of a community have the requirements of a community hub in the cvd how about that so if you change the requirements of community house to be assessed if you just change it the requirements of a community house a community hub and the CBD and the CBD to be assessed for future funding allocation arm and we don 't know what needs to be allocated for that so it 's just getting their report on it I understood from some of the staff comments that the community health shouldn 't necessarily be in the CC no ID so but that 's what yannis moving is for it to be in the CBD so why don 't we just put the requirements of community organizations to be assessed for future funding allocation because or for weird space for affordable space yeah they don 't have enough skype to look at in fact we could it we could even even refer that to the to the community funding we can group yet as I suppose yeah but anyway so but we 've 'll just put that as a group of amendments yeah but it 's not in the CBD anymore so it 's just the requirements of community organizations for a sport of for affordable space to be assessed for future funding just like yeah I do need to point out that these are increased levels of service and as such they will increase costs so it is not possible to write a resolution to do a reprioritization that won 't impact upon okay I don 't know it 's to get her to report to us if we go up to the bandwidth sanitization or action within existing budgets in that case the resolution is either confusing or I 'm confused which is quite problem well I could be you know it 's going to the top of the resolution mean that the following proposals be referred to the chief executive for prioritized asian action would then existing bad Joe that 's the sentence that needs to change because those activities below it and some instances are increases to levels of service yes and in the reprioritization would mean that would the community and accounts yeah and reported back to council by the end of august so it 's not for her to prioritize it 's for her to take action where things can be quickly done and not not bothered about you know but we say to their prioritizing the 38-year 40 report association and report back to council on any prioritization matters by the end of august st thank you but yeah yeah that 's right because it 's with an existing budgets if people want to do it because we 've got that whole prioritization focus ahead of us and and that will free up money and it will mean that we get to look at rates again and it will mean that we get to look at different things again so okay so that 's that 's right and can you take out that that bottom and report back to council by the end of august yep take that one out and the chief executive separately report on this one of a good were changing the wording for the top are the coastal path waivers but yeah the peace around the crosses does road in fact that is that a challenge which is virtually unachievable but if in fact we tied into the estuary edge master plan project in fact there will be a way around the coast to achieve this pathway also I 've got the master plans down as a separate one which is an analysis of existing master plans in order to ensure that we hit the best model going forward so future plans from form but I mean if because I kind of just grouped all of the master plan stuff onto their good so I go I get yourself a rewording of of anomie middle is going to put in it 's an it does not increase the funding at all yeah perhaps we could find there to stir there 's an amine I just won 't really want to make sure this is included in the back that 's all it 's certainly within the existing fun it 's a result that is part of the history age master plan project priors ganda so does that have an impact on um as part of the Easter age master plan project starting july 2015 for 18 months priority is given to identify yep okay you are so let 's just put this one separately so that 's moved for clearwater second David East most beautiful I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then we 'll go back to the full grouping and take that first sentence out funding for the coastal pathway or not the first infants first bullet point and now we will put that entire motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then we 've got the lenwood ballston pole can you Peter tell us what the impactors on rates for moving up forward and to the 1617 year-on-year 1.03 pursuit in here to point one four percent but happen it sorry how does it affect the first year if it 's not till 1617 first year with it I gave the opp that 's the point effective the first year is 103 second year third year point three six it 's a case of negative than years up the recreational facility it does the operational costs text with it and that operational cost is obviously brought forward as a permanent difference rather than just in time we 're all that 's around just over half of the scene over the three years okay right so um Yanni you 're moving there and who 's sick and doing that Paul but can I just check from staff like we put 15 million new money on budget that 's got the lease rate impact than this it 's a lot of a difference I mean when it 's happening as well versus point2 over those four by g anything look forward a few years but i just think it 's really important to get things happening in this area and most projects that we do capital projects are spread over two years just for the nature of the money in terms of doing the design work so i 'm relatively flexible at how much is in that first year but i think that the intent was to actually signal some funding this really came about from that submission from the lynnwood cluster of schools where we heard some pretty alarming statistics around the hardship that those schools were facing they 've had an increase in their decile ranking which is effectively meant cuts to their funding they have lost a lot of facilities and in that area and a number of schools have have closed so you 've got a number of things happening in that wider area and the need for a poll has been well established through previous aquatic facilities plans and reviews so i think given the delays to the Metro sports facility and I was hoping that this would pretty much be cost-neutral because debt facilities going out to 2020 so fine to capture some of that money that we would have spent in those years by bringing forward and actually doing this pool so that we could get in a quality that 's you know I think going to be recreations into that 's going to be well met well used well needed it was worth identified community needs so if you compare this to the thought because we 've already allocated money for it to be on budget I 'm still trying to understand why the dc 's is actually you know 15 million of new money comes at a lower rates impact than bringing forward by a year an existing project that we already have money on budget for I don 't think the operational costs would be that that massive and the final point I make is just you know there is something happening in terms of people 's psychosocial well-being in our city one of the really alarming statistics has been through the health department we 're hearing about the huge increases in the number of children and young people being admitted patients and also into the mental health would say you know there 's a huge issue facing areas of our city and I actually think having these community facilities like swimming pools and libraries as we 're also doing I can critically important to giving some of these communities hope for things to do rather than being left with feeling that things aren 't going as well as they should delayed I think it 's really important that we get this facility I would hope by bringing it forward we can get to do with the other aquatic facilities projects so that we actually utilize doing a number at the same time as a cost-saving oh sorry I thought it was anything brought 40 year 21 and 22 at the moment is part of the capital review that we went through from the draft LTP we pushed it out and now we 're talking about bringing it back and yoni I can probably help with the last council yeah right help with as well as operational your recall that Steven talked about the net impact of the rates and it was that need to take into account okay so all right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie _"

    "text": "I 'm just going to propose that we deal with this short item very quickly because it was something that we all agreed to several months ago and because council Tina was actually far more efficient than everyone else put together that he got his amendments and early and they got lost so if we would somebody like to see in this for Andrew um I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and the next item I thought we should get some advice on the northern arterial if that could be brought forward so Mike I think you were going to give us some quick advice on that hello image thanks Chris so picture the northern arterioles the link in the Queen 's the reading of the amendment bother diving from staff perspective that the cranford Street northern arterial four-laning project oh I 've just called at the northern art area with an arterial link because the northern arterial is the government in CTA coaches which we have no quarrel porous or question about we they 're only funding it on the basis that we 've got a four laning project at the end of it well it 's their decision isn 't it that but it has been their decision all the way along but we 're not disputing the nobility but the reason that they 're proceeded they 're proceeding is because this is on the budget but lately or others tell the story I think so Chris Gregory and Aaron Taylor are here with me take the talk to some of the detail I 'm just going to I suppose contextualize us again so the northern arterial and the cranford street extension as we would call it which is what Pauline 's referring to are they are inextricably linked because when you look at the North material most of the benefits that actually derived in a transport in a network distribu since derived from the link from actually getting the vehicles across to e to drive and on to cranford tree and avoiding some of the problems that you get if you only develop the top half which is the government 's have only committed to the top half on the basis that the link is actually put in place because it 's the link that actually generates the benefits the meant that the big benefits so we just need to put that into the context obviously this is one of the wrongs this is one of the key roads of national significance the others that we have in Christchurch have been the southern motorway which obviously got built a number of years ago and was completed just after the earthquake we 're currently in the process of the Western Corridor and those of you who travel that will know the works on going on that the Western Belfast bypass has just been kicked off and the North material is probably the single largest project and one of the key projects in that and zaki project for council as well because fundamentally it delivers a whole heap of benefits to the entire city so particularly it starts to enable us to actually introduce bus priority and improved Network matters along Main North Road which you 'll see they 're listed as currently a whole lot of extraneous traffic off that part of the network and basically enables the suburbs of redwood and Northlands and and sticks to basically access their local network much more effectively it relieves roads like pepper new road it relieves roads like it helps us to manage traffic coming down marshland road in the future with all the subdivisions coming off there and in fact animal and can inform you that a lot of the works and the intersections designs that we have already committed to and developed along Martians Road done in anticipation of the north terial and the cranford link being delivered because without that we are going to see increasing pressure on Martians Road both from traffic coming from the north and also from the new subdivisions that are coming on in the Preston 's area in particular so effectively what we 've got as the North Nigeria is a key part of both the government 's arterial roading network but also actually enabling us to deliver some of the benefits in terms of improved PT reduced rat running in the city and reduce pressure nu erode and but also qe2 drive so it is a really fundamental part obviously we 've been in this process now for some considerable time it 's been on the books for many years we managed to secure finally managed to secure the purchase of the cranford basin at the end of 2013 I think wasn 't a Jane that we finally managed to secure that that 's enabled us not only to actually advance the link which is a critical link but also to address and use that Basin for stormwater management purposes so from from I suppose from a transport engineering from a long-term planning perspective the northern are to end the cranford link or the cranford extension are critical delivery elements and the city 's Network so that 's a bit of an overview I don 't know whether Chris will I don 't want to talk specifically about the implications of the route itself and okay I can talk a wee bit and I guess in a person should probably think about how the network the road in network in the North operates at the morning peak period or now you 're nice about there are a significant problem start to build on the network we 're not seeing a lot of congestion on main north rather than on marketing road and what 's going to happen in next few years that situation is gonna get an offer for what worse and that 's gonna happen for a couple of reasons in the first instance and as you 'll all know we 're making changes to market and rode the marshal or corridor with signal izing you 're putting traffic signals a lot of intersections along that route and by doing that you 're allowing traffic Haunter Marshall rather miss iris but you are impinging that key north-south axial function honestly Martin brother so what will happen is that the arterial capacity of Martin robe will diminish even if we do nothing with it especially it 'll get worse anyway if we do nothing what will also happen of course is we 'll have a situation that the development traffic will grow there as Preston 's grows maybe as high field grows and other developments increasing pressure network so it we 're looking at a situation here where if we do nothing at all we can have a very very significant problems over and above what we see there on a regular basis today so on that base you see well what do we need to know what do we need to introduce it what do we need to actually build to solve this problem and and historically you know going back 20 30 40 years has been long been discussions about and the need for another motor web connection in from the north by about 2,000 to the notion of the the northern arterial with an extension at the end of it we caught up the northern arterial extension that 's the the pollen our rod net with the gossip of cranford basin that 's the dotted bit of the bottom that 's right yeah joining on to cranford street which would make changes to and that 's formerly known as a Krampus for your bread that was something that was developed in about 2002 through the Cena and through the N Ross package so that 's been around for about 15 years with reconsidering that now and we move into a situation there where we 've gone through the planning process that actually formally ended on the twenty-second of June and hearing dragged on for quite a while and those beauties we have to resolve and that hearing was closed on the 22nd in tune so as we speak the commissioners on that and making their deliberations and will report to us in mid-july on that so it 's better decision on on the formal designation of that corridor as the room now in terms of the impact that has on our network it has some real big benefits for us on it on a region-wide basis it certainly assist accessibility to North Canterbury to the poor and to the airport it helps in that regard it also has a lot of benefits for the north of our network as well so we 've already mentioned a main north road and Colonel but it also has benefits on other parts of the road network on Rusli road I 'm places like gardeners road room this is a route that people were driving a fairly high speed coming in there with very very little interruption if they if at all compared to March and relative may not able to constantly stopping at traffic lights so what we will find is a lot of people will transfer on to that room and that will move traffic off key north-south routes was as well what also happens is it also to the safe if we make the connection through to crank the story provide some benefits with some of our local roads as well it provides not good benefits for us in terms of attracting people offer vinners road and people off the north end of cranford street as well so it provides benefits in that regard as well so it is providing a lot of benefits now one thing that I 'm sure I 'm sure Paulie will mention though there are some dis benefits to it we 're wicked I admit that it effectively focuses traffic onto the the lower end of cranford Street and increases traffic signal thing that they 're there as to take into account in our assessments of that but what we think we 're doing that regard we 've obviously upgrade the infrastructure there by providing four lanes of traffic through that section and we 're also looking at what 's called a downstream package of measures as well to ensure that beyond in his road traffic stays on the arky arterial which is can 't the story and doesn 't spill over into the surrounding residential streets we 're heading for a situation where what we 're doing is we 're concentrating traffic on a route on a single written by doing that that provides us really critical opportunities to improve public transport on main north road to improve development access ability on marginal but it also provides benefits as well in terms of ensuring that the path only with parallel side the way works what effectively happens is because we restrict the turning movements saddens a lot of traffic reduces on mcfaddens road and therefore it assists the operator that happen happening with parallel cycle work for us so what we 're doing by spending this money on other routes of available in from the north and with the melting is very multi-modal approach to transport and that 's the basic science behind what we do yeah I think just hope we look at their map above their two you 'll notice the gray area so they 're all emerging residential development areas so if we if we look at you know highfield has got about i think you know when it happens it 's around 2100 s if no it 's still a really well it 's indefinite irwin but but you know if you work on an average where we work on tin woman 's yeah you basically work on the assumption that you you generated that 10 vehicle movements per day per household unit yeah now if you if you take that if you expand that across the entire North Republic in a situation though you 're heading for about nine thousand new houses some point over the next 30 to 40 years so that 's ninety thousand more vehicle trip people expect on our road network in that time and so that 's something like ricketson world carries now about twenty-five thousand vehicles a day that 's a lot of traffic to add to the network I 'm a little confused because I thought that we were just going to have a quick update on why this amendment couldn 't be moved at this time whereas this sounds like we 're making a decision on something we 're not making a decision on until we get the full report to Council so I think we were simply trying to background that I mean the the issue really is that you 've got the amendment is around removing the cranford Street link i think what we 've tried two demonstrators that the that the cranford street link sits as an integral part of the northern arterial the northern arterial is a key part of our long-term transportation planning for the city so you can 't in our viewers staff start to unstitched one element of it without actually saying to unwind the entire planning and modeling i get there but there 's two different things so i did understand that there was a technical the impact on the whole project but because it was still being considered by we haven 't had the report the final report of the Commissioner that 's hearing it that 's right so I thought that 's why we had to leave it on budget in the meantime but at the end of the day will be making an ultimate decision when that report comes through well your yoga you 'll get a recommendation from the commissioners it 's still council 's decision about whether to accept that recommendation or not that 's right at this at the stage but given given that that decision has to be made then how on earth could be taken off the budget now if we don 't know what that recommendation is going to be Bob I presume you technique could do anything but I think it would be it would send a very wrong signal given that that decision still pending to be making decisions about women and wrongs take the question that I 'm asking and I guess that maybe I 'm looking over this way for a more of the Audit Office they know that we 've got this recommendation that will come one way or the other from the Commissioner if we take it off the budget we haven 't prepared ourselves further for the potential for making a decision to proceed well and just just in response to that and one of the things well that was discussed to a degree of the hearing was the father and legally the hearing shouldn 't really be taken to account funding implications that 's that something there was a legal point that was made to the commissioners now I think Mike 's right to a degree in it as much as if in the middle of this deliberation period the commissioners were to hear that we had withdrawn funding for that it may well influence their decision I think that it might write in that regard I think legally it 's a different position oh not what I understood to be the case you 're going to back out of that process that we were really into you do a challenge so you were saying that we I mean to vote to have it taken off or leave it on and what I thought was that we were going to have a presentation as to why we couldn 't legally address it at this stage but if you 're saying that legally we can address it at this stage then we 'll just have a vote as to whether to take it off or leave it on on amendment what it 's it so it 's certainly if we if we start if we take it off then it does it expose us to judicial review and certainly does it does but I mean hey well no no except that you are in the middle of a process bend down a long process I had of a lot longer than I 've been around ya ali what you and look I think the key here is that there are some real concerns about the project and now is not the time to bring these up and discuss them yeah that 's what I thought yeah but what and so I think perhaps one of the reasons why he was be able to save by removing it but I think that was perhaps a way to park it so that we could look at some of the concerns and get them addressed so I think this is a procedural issue as much as anything i think what i want to ask is i do want to us is there a way of i don 't want this removed from the budget if it opens us up to legal challenges but is there a way of somewhere in the process we are today acknowledging that we do have questions that still need answering or is that outside what this session is today you will i 'm surprised by the advice so I thought that we I thought I had been advised that there was a legal constraint on moving this amendment which I thought that 's what we were going to be briefed on that 's what we 're here and we 're hearing if it is removed from the budget it will open us up to a no into the opening up to judicial review as as a different thing thought that that because of the state or the position that we were in at the moment we are waiting the response of the Commissioner that we would we would have an issue so I don 't know whether it would with a Pauline you 'd be willing to to look at just seeking further clarification on elements of the budget I mean I taking it off the budget I mean if you want to put it to a vote and and we 'll just see what happens then fine but rather on the safe side look at look at the timing of this senator mike peters do staff know when nzta is planning to complete the northern arterial so i can dress a dress that one so the current program for NZTA is to go out to a start they tender process in november this year and that 's to engage a contractor under a competitive alliance with a view to starting construction of the project in September 2016 and having a three year construction period to complete it 29 29 t it would have been financially sensible for once that 's the current basis of the heads of agreement will NZTA which is his only a working agreement to say based on where we 've got to at this stage we are in a joint project with ins ETA and that they would include these two sections in that contract to be tendered they are fully aware of where the funding provision is currently in the draft LTP there 's before council which is not until 20 21 22 and the next stage would be entering into a financial agreement with ins MTA about how that would all work but they 're quite happy to go they will contribute to it as well won 't_''_1178.51 they I will be so far for the City Council 's part of the project they will the funding rate will be somewhere around fifty percent until we do the full calculation don 't get the exact number but it 's around about fifty-fifty if we got bit subsidy in to have a dual their budget without their this is the total was in the budget front you is a total expenditure and in the fun in the funding income to council as public financial strategy right so so you 're moving things doesn 't necessarily give the capture the extent of the benefit that you would think it 's not the whole amount Ali two things here I 'm come on just there are two issues as I see them one is the budget and the funding and this is obviously the money out of there the sick one is the project itself and some of the questions that sit around it is that how you see the issues here as well I think that 's how we understand it from our counselors right so i think this this two things one is the giving the designation in place is obviously an important step for us to demonstrate that we are continuing to do a public work that 's what the purpose of the designation is and in doing so we also commit financial take financial responsibility for that work so that 's that 's the key step in terms of the matters of design detail which may be what you 're 've while the engineers will have got some design work it 's certainly the certainly opportunity for us to go through that in detail again with council to ensure that any matters that are outstanding our addressed so so you have to separate the legal the legal process for establishing the right to use the land for that activity versus the then the detailed designs that you need to do to address all the particular issues that emerged as you work through that so keep the money on budget and the issues with regards to downstream and what happens after a nurse road can be addressed absolutely yeah and and so I just so just some advice just speaking to Jonathan I suppose one of the issues that we do have is that if we do remove the budget because one of the key tests and the in the RMA is that you take financial responsibility for a designation so if we have seen to be removing the money now we 're actually undermining the whole rationale for why we would have a designation and that work so that 's 'm actually getting a little bit nervous about the time it 's nearly 10 24 and we have to have a solution today in terms of some bigger shoes that we have to debate so is there an amendment that anyone one variable if that excuse the 16 2016 no 20 20 21 22 23 to spread over three years there 's a lead until 2020 10 and this might work over here there 's no point moving it out any further there isn 't an amendment in front of us whether i 'll move and answer some question I 'm about to ask really yep I 'm in time all right well it 's important we get this right _"

    "text": "good afternoon everyone since which time is an since since I was last sitting here and we were all happily discussing these matters I 've been informed that we 've got a time constraint that I wasn 't aware of before so the time constraint that we have is that the office of the auditor general needs to have the you know response on the amendments to the LTP by today so by closer play today we have to have completed all the amendments so we still will have the final vote on Friday but we need to go through the process of these amendments so I 'm going to propose a way of focusing on those things that we actually do have to resolve as part of the cell TP and as a general principle and I 'm going to suggest that we deal with the Jamie 's amendments first which are the DC amendments the development contribution amendments and so if we deal with them first then then we will take a short adjournment after that so that we can just resolve amongst ourselves what the order a really does need to be voted on I think I mean we 're getting some advice on the northern arterial but it looks from a legal point of view that we we can 't take it off the budget because it 's in a process at the moment but we will get staff to come and give that advice in terms of the ones that need to be voted on the bringing forward of the lynnwood woolston Paul would have to be voted on separately because it is such a significant change to the impact on rates and possibly the proposal to inflation adjust community funding which my suggestion would be to refer that to the Working Party on community funding but it 's a proposal so I 'm you know completely open about their and and then of course the financial strategy and strategic assets the the growth expenditure being removed from the ltp the as strategic assets which ones are running out of the lusts and then the capital release proposals dealt with as a single question at the conclusion so now the big issues all dealt with can be dealt with by the chief executive through prioritization or just simply action with an existing budgets but then with a short time frame for report back on those some of the bigger issues to go to her for report back over over the course of the next few months so yeah so that that 's the way that I would propose that we deal with it so if we just deal with the development contributions amendment first and then we will pause for a break and sort out exactly how we 're going to handle that I know Andrew you 've got some amendments that somehow got lost and the process but but they probably would would get easily fixed within the yep yep that 's right so and so if we could hand over Jamie you 'd like to move that and there 's that a hand going up to second that motion as there is there any questions on us at all no this one from languages yet ironic since I 've moved I 'm just wondering are we you may have already done this but similar in it it would seem weird but I 'm not the other advice versa yeah so I said it would make from Allah craziest point of the other proxies to save them together yet and this anyone was what the impact on waiting okay Mike slee we 're taking money out of the DC account so we need to credit money back in that comes in as new money how that the system works and mr. mole lead to my assistance the minute I get it wrong but effectively because he 's a capital projects we can take the funding that we set aside for these and effectively add to our capital borrowing for the 10 million and for the five million the impact on the net impact on the of the changes for if we extend the residential rebate so adding another ten million through 2018 is point zero two percent in year one point zero seven percent in year two point zero six percent in year three and point zero four percent in year four and if we add the commercial rebate which is five million at point zero one percent in year one point zero two percent thereafter and in the 50 or point zero one percent yeah I can 't claim to have calculate those but the AL finance gurus have so just in simple terms 15 million dollars being added to the capital boring over over a period of five years by the yeah Tyrone so that has a rates impact as I 've described there so what 's the total rate sometimes well I 've got it I 've got the next year at we 0.03 percent for both of them that would be yeah but point zero three on 7.97 takes it to eight right okay so just I mean I 'm just don 't understand the funding behind it if we really want to be cost-neutral only the way to do it is to change the DC policy to write more for areas that aren 't and the sea that would seem the logical thing to do and it would be a small a very small percentage increase across the rest of the city to pay for it so has that it can 't happen because the law doesn 't provide for up to happen so we 've I mean the the law does not allow us to take monies that are partly to be at the two and by the policies we paid across an area and charged more to another area so that 's why we use a rebate to say actually if you are not going to recover that from the from the communities that are supposed to pay it then effectively the most the most transparent way is actually to put that to be funded over the entire community like what I 'm trying to understand is I thought we could have catchments without DC 's policy so if we had a captain in the central city that says we 're not going to charge DC 's because we 've already got existing infrastructure in place and you know we don 't believe that we need these to deal with the growth there you know we 've had depopulation to procedure why can 't we do that as opposed to having to break pay monies to subsidize because there are no net new capital works planned apart from renewals and repairs the only DC 's were actually recovering for a small number of what we will call citywide DC so all people all development across the city contribute to the city 's regional parks program so it 's though it 's a small handful of those which are being recovered in the central city only so there 's no DC 's at the moment being paid for any significant other infrastructure so you either a saying actually we should if you want to take that that bc away effectively you 're saying either that part of the community shouldn 't be contributing to that DC which is not how that DC is structured or you 're saying actually you remove that that capital works program to take out that of course what we can do in this get it isn 't the point like we do have that we can actually do that through our DC we wouldn 't do through the dc 's policy you were too thick yeah yes you could make a decision that DC but you can 't then go on to recover that from every other catchment you are basically then saying either we are going to reduce what we 're going to be spending in that area but you 'd have to come up with a rationale to say well why is that catchment actually now not going to pay that particular DC particularly when it 's a citywide DC um who was was it dad was at you does it who had their hand up over here was it good okay d 2 dcs what value of buildings is required to achieve that well it 's been quite a typical to predict because in because what we 've based it on is the the incidence of DCs that we 've had in the central city over the last three years okay and because a lot of the central city of course is actually being rebuilt back on existing credits right of course so I think that we 've gained about we probably include around three million dollars of DC income based on the back of something and the order of there isn 't a big DC component in the central city at the moment okay and just the second question I have is that if there is a major residential development likely to happen and it is already timetabled in terms of the contract for that residential development this would not miss this could go into this double one really in that area couldn 't you have to be a bit clearer phone so if for example the entire East frame was about to be announced in a couple of weeks and part of the contract was that they had to deliver according to a certain time frame by giving them DC 's doesn 't alter that time frame it doesn 't change the outcome that 's already agreed it doesn 't change the outcome for bin because we 've got a contractual relationship to deliver it might make it cheaper if they 're eligible for DC remains all right any further questions Tim second last bullet point under was inch of these seas that are required for an urban design assessment be removed from the policy if we removed we judge to it isn 't that view as a safeguard or a guideline for quality or standard rather than its effect so there 's I think there 's two issues there and this is counselor Goths resolution like not my resolution oh yeah but just so and but I think that what what we probably would say is that if we extend the residential well we 'd like to simplify the way that the open design is rather than removing the urban design assessment entirely we 'd like to simplify that a pro at the moment it 's slightly complex and they go to effectively two stages of InDesign so if this was to be extended and we were to be dealing with another ten million would probably come back to the council and seek to simplify how the policies administered so I think that 's the first point I think the second point is that particularly in the residential where this is a that 's where we 're trying to encourage a new yeah this is all about encouraging a different form of development as previously we think worthwhile particularly because what we 're seeing in these are largely coming in there 's townhouse or small apartment block developments I think basically you if you are going to be explicit you would say that catlett staff report back on simplifying the DC assessment the urban design assessment for this rebate more than happy to if that 's workable for staff whatever works all right so so so you 're happy to take that out so if we just fell course if we just put I mean that one to read that staff report back on on modifications to the policy to simplify the urban design assessment all right so and even another question or just clarification of the wording of the amendment um this is the Rope revote will be cost-neutral to deceive budgets and prodded for existing sources I think then the resolution we good to make clear the financial impact on the Rights so is that possible to be at it so that people are really clearable or we can I mean do you wish to split those out or do them for a tea of actually got that net change for both of them so perhaps it would be the prudent way would be at the bottom of both of them as pets have a noting resolution that notice that the rating impact of introducing these reminders I think just the second point under the first one acad mother leading right to misunderstood you it 's Robert so why don 't we just take it out does have to be said that way that 's the other thing I mean it 's not it doesn 't add anything other than other than the view that its cost neutral so it 's not cross future no no it 's not cost neutral to right cost neutral to the delete DC I mean it 's um it 's technically correct but it 's misleading we know about these statements sounds like a political state it does so you say look that can come out because it 's simply a statement rather than a direction of action it 's up to the moon Ellie sent me one of those yelling I I work I work with stuff on found most workable and that was what I was provided so the comfortable with that and I 'm happy there 's no point me wanting to put our wording that has it that isn 't workable well I 'm I 'm just working with staff on what they what they need I mean we 're happy with that but I mean equally it it 's not needed to actually make the resolution blue website if the only will supported our great earth perhaps changing the wording I don 't support that no but it was something change the word but I just think should be clear like and the other one was there 's no mention of the five million so that 's what 's being edited I just think they should be the first one mentions the team but the big one okay so perhaps on that under that commercial non-residential DC rebate Chris to either to dead out if we go to the top line band Council no no yeah the council agreed to provide development contributions rebate for non-resident to it to the value of five million the both of them yeah be a great some pics yeah so yeah that the race impact for both these rebates will be 0.01 percent in 2016 it oh i thought you said three that the overall change in rates is yeah yeah but so there 's also anything out because there was some actual we 're taking there was in that the way that the numbers were constructed there was some rebates or what I haven 't told you is that by putting these in we 've actually reduced some costs that are already built into the LTP so the net change it changed for both of them is is 0.01 percent in 2016 0.04 percent in 2017 sorry do you mean 15 16 yes sorry 17 yeah yeah yeah yeah 16 17 a 0.04 percent 17 18 is 0.08 18 19 is 0.05 percent and 19 20 is 0.01 percent by the last four numbers so so 18 19 is 0.05 percent in 1920 is 0.01 percent 16 17 no I 0000 yes yes that 's correct so 0 0 1 0 0 400 800 500 1 all resolution and Jamie you want to kick off yeah yes yonni wants to go first no no cool you 'll get a bright reply in Calgary wouldn 't work okay um I guess a lot of you are familiar with the word that 's been going on with us this was implemented originally about three years ago for for residential in the CBD and those of you that are on the development forum which I chair there and I think we hit about think about eight evicted members that are on that with with organizational heads of oceans and organizations that are involved in the rebuild of Christchurch so didn 't bring in a whole host of other people involved in development in the city it would hit room at from the New Brighton Business Association there through to some of the the bigger we big property developers through to the mum and dad type people that the first time ones through to actually someone that 's made of submission at the LTP that has just exclusively done residential development they 've done and parts of some there and now to speak to both the commercial non-residential DC rebate and the residential one together because they 're much the same that they go they go hand in glove very briefly to touch specifically on a residential one I firmly believe in as people are as Paul said its people people people and with the central city why we were failing in my opinion in the past as we didn 't have the population that you look at every city that works you have people living there it 's not a five-day-a-week city it 's a seven-day-a-week city say that we had that previous quote we didn 't now said he was broken before the earthquake it really was and I think as a result of the earthquake we have a unique opportunity to fix not only that but also the metaphorical ones of what wasn 't quite right in the asked and we don 't have people living there so residential DC rebate worked and while I was embraced by the lights to the property council as I 've seen a signal to say despite all the uncertainty that we than us today to add value to what you had before instead of building that that that three story office building the head you can actually add we want you to put a rooftop garden there in four apartments but instead of you paying 40 thousand dollars per per apartment there and you actually having to reach back pocket and pay development contributions to add value to your rebuild we 're going to remove the barriers you 've got enough of them and we will say that you can do that and there 'll be no DC 's from us we have very few levers that we can pull I would love to pull a lever which says that our property developer X or potential investor X 's bank manager says yep invest in Christchurch unfortunately we don 't have that lever to pull I 'd love to pull a lever that says cost of construction is going to remain level for the next five years and it 's not going to be prohibitive I can 't_''_1316.15 do that you can 't_''_1317.14 do that which we could one of the contributions and the end got a letter from the property count council and it was copied through to me and it was reiterated and those of you on the development forum will be aware of this that those had one of the single best things of this council has done believe that they 've pulled to incentivize development in the city and getting it back on its feet was this original initiative it seemed a good signal and intangible terms that mean real things and we had a guy that I 'd never met before until I meet him because we invited us and as a guest to the development forum because he had a whole host of residential projects in the central city he 'd done them in the past and it 's exclusively what had done and he said we wouldn 't have invested and built in the central city again with all the uncertainty had this through head the development contributions rebate on residential developments there not been passed there were two lien decent we wouldn 't have actually acted we did we did act as a apartments that we have going up we 're selling them and they start with he said if that wasn 't there they 'd start with five but he said but the reality was we probably wouldn 't have done them anyway means with every single one of those that brings another person that brings on another family and then because you 've got another family there then it 's an attractive place to live you start building a community it means that coffee shop down the road has people going in there for the morning coffee and reading the paper and getting the bagel every day means that they start doing well it means this flow on effects that affect the place next door and you start then building up an ecosystem inside this city which has actually got a future and you 've got a seven-day-a-week sitting in not a five-day week City a heart that works it 's that it benefits every single suburb in the city it benefits the air and noise search of the agarose the push-up Dale sort of brightens because the simple city is to Sydney I 've said this before you don 't jump on what if and so I want to stay in Sydney suburbs there 's great walls and everything there but you want out of it you might go and check out those other things but you want to base yourself in a metropolitan cord and I want to have one that works and I want to have one that people really back so it 's worked with with the rebate policy and we 've seen that the commercial one it 's be more ingenious and no other council that I 'm aware in Christ doing this and I really have to come in staff on the work that that 's been done on it because it 's it 's an innovative customer focused way to cert to say let 's do something a little bit differently that sends a signal to say we are the most business-friendly local authority in New Zealand we have potential to say that if you are going to be up for DC 's for your development in the central city you are now now free zone and that is because it comes from an existing pool you have existing DC credits which are currently there and that kind of incentivizes land banking which we really don 't want it means that you 've if you don 't have a whole lot of motivation your accountant or a bank manager as saying you know what put you kept it was somewhere else but go to Sydney go to Auckland go offshore or you just put a great big duty old car park there and just wait and see and see what happened wait for everything else to level off I don 't want that to happen you don 't want that fair to happen I want to see in a signal and I hope you do too to say now is the time to act do you want be bold back our city because if you don 't no one else is going to either so the idea of actually it 's not so much just saying that everyone else funds dcs what it says that reallocate some it means of that pool of DC 're pulled together just for the central city and it says if you 're going to act now and you 're going to decide that you 're not going to have a duty car park there for the next ten years and you 're going to build a fantastic development there which is going to employ people and have cool shops and things to actually come to christ church for then it will never be cheaper than today because you to those DC credits the guy that 's sitting there is going to have a car park for 20 years because he doesn 't want to do anything he misses out he misses the boat he 's the one that actually funds those people that are putting their money where their mouth is and backing our city and that 's great because we got a bid because we love our city and we come to work because we want to make it a better place but we 're giving the incentives there and the carrots there for other people to feel like we do too and I think that that able to pull that lever the numbers that we 're talking about where we 're saying 0.0 something you know it 's an investment in the future and everyone that sits around that table has heard all the people that are involved in this they 're not multi-million ears just trying to do things to keep themselves busy they 're backing the sitting they 're passionate about it but they 're running out of reasons to Tibet Christchurch and I don 't want to be taking any of them away there and it 's a it 's a very cost effective way of doing it it 's a it 's an innovative way of reorganizing how the credits are used and how those DC 's are spent and it also means like grant mckinnon that presented at the at the long-term plan and this is what I 'm going to close them because i think it just sums it up really well and it 's not covered in any of these numbers because they 're very black and white but all of a sudden that person was looking at inside I cannot do anything real life story you had a patch of land that was paying five thousand dollars a year Luke counsel and rates pre-development post-development the council 's rotate was ninety thousand dollars on that site plus their people living there working and all they 're bringing in people there so I think that it speaks for itself I think I would be surprised if any one that said around that development forum table for the months we 've been working with staff and the people in this industry wouldn 't back it too but a fundamentally if we don 't have a central city that works we don 't have a city that works so I hope I can count on your support with us and I think it 's a real game changer and I can see again cutting red tape around the city and saint it 's the most business-friendly investment-friendly city and territorial authority and in the country and and we want your investment welcome to Christchurch how can we help Yanni I first and the intent of what this is trying to do easier for people who developed in the central city and more affordable this is the unsustainable cost of development on the periphery and the green fields areas so I think I said I can support the intent of what we 're trying to achieve here but I think you think this is the wrong way to do it because I don 't think 15 million is small change I think it 's actually quite a huge amount of money going in at a time when we 've got greater priorities and you know we just agreed to spend a fortune on the central city through the accessible transports projects and when you read through some of the stuff coming out of the Productivity Commission one of the really interesting things which ties into one of the conversations I would like us to have is actually writing based on land value as opposed to capital value and what their recommendations are saying is that actually that looks at a much more sensible way of encouraging development and rather than land banking in a much better system of encouraging land flowing to you know I think that 's a really important conversation to have the other point that they make is that there should be an ability for increased use of targeted rates in these areas that are getting to benefit of that infrastructure so you know I can 't support the mechanism that sits behind this I understand the intent of it and I think there 's other ways in which we could do this that truly would be cost-neutral to rates that would enable the same thing to happen that 's been desired because you know we we really need to start thinking about a DC 's policy and the fact there 's we 've got catchments that go across the entire city so the central city paying for the growth and winery for example i think is inherently unfair and I 'd rather focus on changing those policy settings to encourage development in the areas that have existing infrastructure were only need a slight additional spin to get the required infrastructure versus the unsustainable and the economically expensive development of infrastructure on our green fields and areas that are is so I appreciate the work has gone into this I can 't support this in terms of the 15 million dollars extra being asked to put on budget there 's other ways in which we can achieve the same thing and I certainly took that from the submission that was about changing a DC 's policy not simply offering more subsidies and more handouts to get this to happen I put it was a point of order I I didn 't want to interrupt yarny there because I want to be rude but I just do want to make a point of order for the record he was on _"

    "text": "I was fascinated by the staff advice because this was a course this is impacted by a rezoning decision so would you like to just explain the the situation of the massacre waterway drain so that there 's just sort of a general overview of it because I mean it just seems to me that we 're a lift in ER and don 't mention the title barrows it 's not or it 's you know it 's just focus on that issue of the matter Coudray what happened my understanding there is that partly built through a subdivision and stage to the subdivision was going to happen stage two of the subdivision became red zone so this stage two didn 't happen and the development contributions from that stage 2 we 're going to pay for the finish of that obviously it is a piece of unfinished drain it works and what I 'd be suggesting is that it will come through as a priority or not as a priority in the prioritized list of physical works that need to be done as we get through and do the towards the most deserving project so from our point of view is we recognize it 's there and we will make sure that we get the right assessment back to you at some stage but basically to is not the work being done to show that it 's actually deserves a priority above a number of other things in the landowners program so given given the conversation that we just had before I 'm we 're upper and white y et it 's it 's it 's not not included and it 's not not included in the assessment process so we could we could simply indicate to you today that we 'd like it to be a system that prioritization work next year and the next financial year never you know it 's a slightly different to the rest of the program because obviously it hasn 't had any earthquake damage it 's just a partly complete a project so but it 's it and looking at whole drainage infrastructure will get a consideration of air effects using you know entirely appropriate language given its a direct flow on is there a conversation that we should be having with central government about this project for that reason because a direct flow on effect we 've got we 've got to partially compete a pro completed project that we fully anticipated being funded by development contributions that leaves you no no I was going to use the remaining people with high and dry but that 's expression to you is under the circumstances if you see what I mean so I mean that might be possible to do that at all so it is a project while it hasn 't been damaged by the earthquake has been impacted by the earthquake and so certainly I think it appropriate to have that conversation with the crown as well um Jonny G so the land drainage program as i needeth quake related principally earthquake were related and trying to bring back some of the appropriate levels of service but we will be looking at prioritization right across the whole of the Ketchikan it 's the name drainage recovery program yani it 's your recovery program so so I just want to understand are feeding into the prioritization or the projects have identified through that which this one was heading into the hole the recommendations from the flooding task force were divided into two groups one one group that went across into the land drainage recovery program for further investigation works and perhaps capital works and then the other group that went across into our land drainage operations program and I think this one went across into the operations program how can we get visibility of the operations program and how can we get an understanding of what 's actually being done or some of the same way we to report that Jane through to 80 committee at some point Pauline 's not here working parties working group so we get visibility of things like that through there in fact we were you feel welcome to come to that I 'm sure we can put it on just simply do a briefing so this is the operations program as opposed to the recovery program that 's right yep so is that does that go through that group yeah ignites the current budget for back to okay it doesn 't have any capacity to do any projects that have been identified through the flooding task force the big question is that as the matta KU waterway drain and the in the project is it in the operations program at any point in the next 10 years all that out of time well it 's not because it says it 's not in the RIP in the staff response so there 's no funding available for it um understood no no no no that doesn 't say that Jonnie what it seizes is that it 's not the land drainage recovery programs role to fund operations program that 's what they mean by BAU right what I 'm trying to understand what so we had we had people to get flooded in the event it 's been a lot of time and money looking at the responses to those the in drainage is going to look at some and the operational is going to look at something the lead drainage we 've got a prioritization project going on around what those projects are and what and what was identified in the flooding task force absolutely it so operate great are picking up the remaining work that we don 't have we don 't have we need to get that information back I just want to signal and I I think this is really important work to do people were flooded and yeah dr. Yanni the trouble was is that we can 't see what it 's as against so I 'm perfectly happy for this to be referred to the operations program for consideration for priority repair as against others but I want to know what what else you know agrees to be done I think that needs to come back to council so it goes to the weekend party them to council is that the person I don 't know oh yes of course although Sam the committee and council yes I really want to start so I 'm not sure so can we get it maybe in two months a report back from the landowners collision I know it 's not the land drainage recovery pro it 's not the most operations or the chair wants a report to go back we generally have a cheers report that comes out of all of the decisions we have written this was on the air control we 'll just put that one on the agenda of the needs maintained so of your committees Pauline you 've got an item foot of agenda is now simply unavailable friday can we just get an understanding of how much demand is on that program this is you know what what we currently have on budget it 's it easy enough so the demand on the budget is compared to how much is on budget that would be useful information but could we have depth this afternoon I do I don 't think that would take very long term to sort out right so and so we don 't need to deal with there any further so we will adjourn until two o 'clock and we 'll see you at two o 'clock _"

    "text": "yeah tell um I don 't think there 's too much difference in me in many ways I think the specific difference is the position of salisbury street in gilman street understand us in that that we 've seen that emblem I 've got no doubt that we the objective of that of the of the resolution that council tuna has put is certainly to ensure that we do achieve the vision that Paul on cell was talking about there 's no doubt that you know the accessible and accessible City is it 's the link point around the whole regeneration of the city but what what this what this recommendation does it actually achieves a very clear prioritization of the process of the of the projects and that 's what is happening today otherwise in fact you know the whole project and the staff told us will take 20 years to deliver anyway so we 'd be really clear and what very good advice on the staff about what should what should come first and there 's no doubt that this in effect should make it more affordable and it being connected and safety and a place for cycle lanes that this is it 's a form of a compromise but it 's also very affordable so that is why im sue be supporting the young the emotion does someone want to speak against it Yanni I heard from my colleague that this is what the people have asked for actually I still recall the submission from the Northwest Richmond residents association and what did they say to us a current status we have footpaths that are unsafe and can only recently be walked on during daylight hours with the same foot paths that are unsafe at all times for young children walking and not able to be used for tricycles bicycle skates and scooters and they represent typical is for the elderly our curbs are broken Ridley growing reads to 200 to 300 meters high the streets are very rough badly patched and in need of nificant appears and ironically they say the streets of Abel 30k but we have been told that this is not enforceable and the size of just being left behind just like us like they 're living in a ghetto mental strain of living and poor quality surroundings while many other areas have been fixed and deep gold plated they make the point there 's no point in having major cycleways if children can 't right outside their front gate and Moon and to write and do things that normal kids do the physical impact on their vehicles is huge because they can 't avoid these streets there 's an ironic we 're talking about spending extra money on areas that having earthquake repaired to make them 30k to provide a luxury level of immunity in our central city when we 've also to hold people through our consultation document that we 're going to take and prioritize 30 over 30 years the fixing of their broken streets and curbs and channels and culverts and footpaths and lighting and landscaping in their broken suburbs I can 't support this I don 't accept that this is an urgent priority in fact ironically we 've gone to NZTA and said we want more money to fix the central city streets that are going to are still to occur and we want money for double ceiling but we 're going to go and spend money on this high level of a minute I now makes no sense to me it 's not to say that this work isn 't important in time I agree that it 's things that we need to look at let 's address the urgent safety aspects but let 's not provide this high standard of amenity for an area that has got private investment that is functioning in fact just last year there was a huge celebration from the Victoria Street businesses and residents that s Kerouac 's had finished and they could get back to normal and having things happen that they wanted so I urge you not to support putting this money on budget I was happy to move the amendment that we took two and three off I usually think it raises a more fundamental question is that if we want to go and talk to government which came through again the submissions that people have seen prioritize them fix the most broken infrastructure first before you back to government and renegotiate and discuss the funding for infrastructure it through the cost share arrangements that you have if you want leverage with central government putting money to do the things that they 've said we have to do doesn 't_``_285.04 give us much leverage given that they haven 't even agreed to fund these things themselves their own projects that they put on the table and said that has to be done in the central city they haven 't got money to fund so they can be in surplus and we 're being asked to consider selling assets to fund these unaffordable projects while spending 30 years fixing our infrastructure and our suburbs I just think our priorities are wrong in terms of us I think we need to go back and talk to government there 's no as I said no reason why these projects shouldn 't happen in time but I would say there are lower priority than fixing those more urgent repairs that are needed doing in those local neighborhoods and local communities who have been told that they have to wait for 30 I 'll put the no it 's not Portland it 's andrews amendment could we have them it 's the andrews amendment there 's been a foreshadowed amendment that 's coming after thus well i would like to request some aspects of this put separately please all of them well i guess a bright sun circle okay well some reason well let 's say okay so um it 's uh I 'm happen so how am I going to do this you could move 1.1 1.2 at one point you but then what do i do at the end people will vote for against depending on Herod 's I mean oh ok ok so what I 'm really like I just do it by hands because it will be easier that way so you so so those but the trouble is is that without dealing with one I mean that 's the point that these are all interrelated in terms of the total package and so and I that 's what and if councillors want to insist on them being voted individually okay that 's your call but it seems right so look I 'll just I 'll put that motion so we 'll have the the thing out for the put the motion all those in favor of the this is yeah this is the whole counselor tuna Clearwater motion to amend the long-term plan to remove accessible so they end but to put these on the budget it goes to counsel on blondes Dale 's next right so that is lost and I will now put the amendment sorry the foreshadowed motion if you 're in favor took yes noise oh well I wasn 't gonna okay all right oh yeah lo and I ok I think it 's important that we do these things I think we get actually in this occasion a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to affect forever the central city and I love the fact that we are actually prioritizing and our central city walking biking and public transport and you so seldom get the chance to do that and eat central city revamp I love the fact that we are making the central city in 30 k is an hour I think that 's fantastic it 's a collision of where people live and sharp and play sport and mostly what do we want from our central city we want people to feel great about not only living there but being part of it you will have seen the Charles Hamilton Hamilton chose Hamilton yup the happy city and how good experiences actually flow through to the economic development of a city and heaven impact way beyond what you would reasonably expect and I think we have the opportunity here to do something that is fantastic in the central city we 're spending in the rest of the budget 158 million hundred and sixty million ansa is all of which are going to come through or by the central city and then unless we do this work they 're going to arrive in the central city feel confused annoyed and frustrated because they 're cycleways are not continuing I think we have a situation here that every city in the world faces and that is how do you make the central city absolutely feel wonderful for the people who live there because part of your feel in the central city you don 't necessarily derive that from a visit to the palms or to record and more you do derive some of it always from how you feel about the central city and while we 're trying to encourage businesses and people to come back and live in the central city we need to provide certainty and adds an absolute certainty actually about what we 're doing so delaying for example the one weighing of cool more on Salisbury would be a disastrous decision you don 't wait til ten years after the event and then provide the one way changes do it as fast as practically possible because version of transport in the central city at the moment is difficult and unusual and that 's the time actually when you to make changes to one-way streets we 've criticized and we will continue to criticize government for delays and the things that they 've promised in our central city we cannot fall into that trap ourselves we have to actually do the things that we said that we would do we have this money and some of it needs to be brought forward the long-term impact of that is very minor in terms of the total 10-year plan but ultimately when you think about one of the things that you came here to do it is about creating a really dynamic and different very distinct central city and and the feeling that you can get in that central city that and then what you can get and any other of the suburbs of the of the city all of which are really really important and I don 't dispute their arguments for really good footpath repairs totally support that and I totally support strong but I 'm not willing to do those at the expense of the central city the central city is absolutely vital to the way in which as people feels about itself and we have to give our community at the moment the opportunity to feel great about what they actually achieve endless recovery and rebuilding phase if we don 't go with this the uncertainty that we create for every developer who now knows that we are one way and apartments around that area I speak to one of them this morning it 's really huge we can 't_''_758.61 undo that degree of certainty that has been provided so I am totally in favor of this motion that Paul has moved I 'm Glenn thank you I do not disagree necessarily with councillors lonsdale and back I share those aspirations those in our own city plan which we were asked to provide by the minister about a clean green city and so I don 't disagree with that my questions and this is over priorities hips if the way I look at it is moving to some of these projects Victoria Street stands out as especially akin to putting a house on a section without having the right foundation treatment underneath and we can hear vision but actually you need steps along the way if you want connectivity you actually have to provide those connections so if we weren 't tied up with the NZTA over difficulties associated with three bridges of just pages road but the twin fits I 'd be looking to find a mechanism in this process million dollars now it 's too simplistic as I said it 's tied up with the NZTA but although I can see two pages Road bridges in there that 's a lifeline so the two Fitzgerald the twin Fitz bridges so we 've got to think we can have the the connectivity with the CBD people have to be able to get in there and get out we rank those as priorities and our those bridges and our submission to the nzta and they didn 't make it but this stuff has and you really have to question the priorities if i look at victoria street it 's gone ahead with heard from staff it 's going to hit anyway and and that putting seven million dollars isn 't into it hasn 't been crucial to investment what I hear through the developers forum is not transport but DC rebates that 's what they want Victoria streets slow anyway when was the last time you traveled at 50 case down there so it 's kind of self engineers does it really need 7 million bucks look at the program look footpaths come out to New Brighton look at the bridge get on a kayak like me pedal under our bridges half of them are still reef we 've got to sort out our priorities it 's a pretty fresh stuff in there I want the cvd to work of course I do but what we 're hearing an air LT document LTP document which I 'm sure you 've all read is our written residence what their roads and their footpaths in their bridges fixed they want the CBD to work as well but there 's actually a sequence and a priority and it 's I can 't support this right we 'll put the motion so those in favor will have the buttons up thanks press yes those opposed say no so that it 's carried so now we will proceed to and I just wonder whether we should just check off the the various projects and things or I wonder whether we should do the land drainage recovery program should we do that now because we 've got some staff here to provide some support around proposed amendment program and also the completing nematic matta KU waterway drain now thank staff we 're going to give us a bit of a presentation of the impact of taking out an element of a of a program of work i think that there 's some assumptions that the proposal the proposed amendment has been based on that it might be useful to have some context before we make a decision on first of all I I suppose the language recovery program wigs that put in the strategy of old blood n tified in there is related to the task force but also the task force has come back with some of the operations those two documents sitting within the land drainage activity management plan and that sits inside your 30-year infrastructure strategy and basically if you have a look right overarching that whole lot there 's a 30 is the surface water strategy which is soon to be updated into the three water strategy so I want to actually just make sure that your where the land drainage recovery program doesn 't sit in isolation sits in a whole pile is doing a whole pile of thing itself own it well it 's it 's a little piece of a jigsaw that connects up a whole pile of initiatives it is however a cornerstone document it 's referred to and a number of documents by ye can buy EQC so it is a cornerstone document and a cornerstone program that integrates into a whole pile of not only internal but external it contributes towards improvements by emanating things like sewage overflows it obviously delivers a whole pile of social outcomes in the way of protecting houses from flooding both at floor level which is our highest priority but also under floor levels which gets very difficult to do obviously provides peace of mind for a whole pile of all the idea is producing a program that does produce peace of mind for a number of residence but obviously I 've already said we 've got some real issues with our wastewater some of the benefits of doing the land drainage program flows into your wastewater because not only have we got a whole pile of ground water flowing into our we also have some a lot more peak flows into the wastewater treatment plant which obviously it 's not capable of treating in the latest cost share agreement independent Assessor there is a eligibility criteria in there and she sighed n tified that part of the land drainage program particularly the first three years is eligible obviously that is subject to discussions between the crown and ourselves and we 're hoping to get into it but she has identified and it 's been agreed at a staff level that some of this program is eligible for Kashia there 's also one of the things we 've got is we have put up a tentative program but the program work sorry we put up a tentative couple of projects as part of that program but if you have a look at the latest report that went to the infrastructure committee there is a lot of investigation going on at the moment to look at the priorities of those programs we have a lot of houses in small pockets throughout we all know about the Dudley Creek which got all the Dudley whole pile of other prop programs or end properties that do get flooded and so if you have a look at the latest report that went up we are talking about a phenomenal amount of them investigation in the short term to bring you back a priority list there 's no doubt because of the numbers and because of the work that we 've done through the task force of Dudley Creek in that area is going to be the top list but the priorities on the rest of the program may change and it 's further complicated by things like the red zone the impact that we 're trying to assess about the earthquake settling the idea of what 's going to happen over the next fifty to a hundred years and we 've got a number of reports regarding changes that are going to happen over there period and obviously climate change is going to influence it we 've also got to get some sort of guarantees out of well some some way forward around the red zone and that 's probably not going to be nine of a delay in that so what we 're saying here is we aren 't putting up to you in the LTP they set a project we are putting up a land run into program we are putting up a very truncated program because we do believe as the investigations we may have other priorities what can be done through planning and policy what can be done through engineering and the solution to land drainage for for Christchurch is a combination of a number of initiatives and this is only a small part of it so what we 're saying really is the program we need that program money to actually give some security back to some of the people that have been affected by those land by the land drainage issues that we 've had as you will have seen a number of reports have shown that rainfall doesn 't fall evenly across the city and so who were impacted today or in yesterday 's flood may be a different subset and so we want to do some work and we are doing some work on the vulnerability and so best bang for our buck so well I think we will talk about sorry sorry Vicki yeah take a time have had best bang for buck the smell is it thank you I think there 's a secret thing going on between my tea and then never keep back so every time it comes up and sir there 's a little signal the end of it I don 't want to go so basically what we 're saying is we believe what we 've put in the LTP to be an absolute minimum program to actually try and start working through some of those issues and we 're asking you not to get worried about specific programs because they will come back for you to tick them off as sorry specific projects because they will come back to you as our investigation work goes forward but obviously the Dudley creek basin is right up there and it 's probably not like that are you saying I 'm going to then get me and I know that you 've provided some some original advice of that that 's obviously been helpful the wire upper and whitey streams project from the proposed work stream all we would be doing is actually reducing the land drainage recovery program budget by 33 million dollars we wouldn 't actually be taking that that piece of work out and secondly they may in fact be exposed because rainfall may fall in a different place as we experienced last year when we actually got that weather city got no actually was earlier this year where the city got sidelined and the rain fell on kaiapoi i think it was rather than in the city so actually if the rain fell within the city in a different place then why repa stream is very exposed I would have thought it was it and certainly the plans you can see the light our data shows that that is a basin that has been earthquake affected here but there are other priorities and we are looking at the balance of those so we put up or the program that showed that was a draft program that I will went up to the infrastructure committee and basically it was absolutely a we would come back showing you the vulnerability and we 're the best value for the community would be generated it certainly has got to be somewhere in the program and you can appreciate the land drainage program actually has I think identified something like 70 projects and it now those have got to be prioritized I 've got to be looked in the context of policy of planning of a wide range red zone all those sorts of things and so what we 've got an hour ltp is a very minimum a good thing that you bet you 've seen today which is important to highlight is that this may in fact be one of the projects that subject to government funding certainly well we would be encouraging and I think the independent Assessors encouraging council to have that conversation with the crown really we 've definitely signal data central government that we want to talk to them about earthquake-related damaged too leaned resulting and work on our land drainage recovery program yeah so somebody else had their hand at first but I thought it was someone else the earlier information to the staff have provided around the lender image recovery program I guess this highlights in fact this the exploration stage very much at a high level what I 'm like an example is that with their particular catchment with the wire represe that I understand there 's no or very little if any history of flying and I accept changes since the earthquakes and the work that 's being done but what I guess what I 'm what I 'm concerned about is how can we ensure from the LTP that in fact the other projects for example on the heath cut where which with a you know clearly they were there known as vulnerable properties and a different form of measurement how can we be sure that in fact all those projects a little being delivered within the time frames certainly if you have a look at the program we 've got people working on the moment it 's a level of consultation that needs to go through at the moment I think one stage we were talking about a land drainage program going over programs you want to I think if you look at the independent Assessor what we 've done it is put into the LTP physical worked for only the first three years because we actually aren 't able to identify that and that 's one of the reasons the independent Assessors said for us to go and talk to the crown when we 've done that investigator ii work we are certainly getting in train and we 're getting teams and trained so that we can deliver those capital programs obviously it 's as you 'll be aware we 're out consultation on the three options around there we are trying to truncate that as quickly as possible get a report up to you in August so that we can get out in this construction season and start delivering so all I can say is that we are recognizing that program with the LTP being certified or will be once it 's been signed off we will then be able to put in train those appropriate I think perhaps all the tea in that is to actually is perhaps not to et it 'sit to basically the program that that Dame and Keith and the team are looking at is saying what are the most vulnerable and objective since parts of our network and that network is the hethe kid is the sticks it 's the a and it 's the whole lot and I think really what we 're needing to do is say actually while we know that Dudley is by far the most obvious and and strong contender through this program clearly we 're going to identify in Council or need to decide the priorities that have wants to spend in different parts of the network but I think the key messages the program of funding and the capital works required is very much an absolute that needs to be committed to exactly which priorities come out of that program if this beyond Dudley is still something that 's being worked through but the other point is as the government fund and and it 's not a you know it 's not a cast-iron guarantee but the steer that we got from the independent reviewer of the horizontal central government about the land drainage recovery program in the context of earthquake related damage now yrf a stream may not have caused floor levels to be breached and and our memories but it certainly has dropped you know and because of the level of settlement one can expect that there will be risks going forward so you know those are the issues that we need to take into account I guess my other question really too though is and I appreciate the need for a broad approach to the whole you know future climate change in what we do it range and changes in the earthquakes but it just is there not some risk attached to such a broad approach that in fact the areas that you know where there is a an unfortunate history of frequent flooding that in fact those projects are going to be addressed within a bit of time frame well I think that if you have a look at the program that we 've got out there Dudley Creek is up there and actually the money that we 've got available was principally to look at the latest report that went up to the infrastructure we 've got investigation we 've got dates that they 'll come back to you as counselors priorities and so we believe if you look through them by January next year basically you will have a reasonable indication of those high priority areas but as you say I think we know the areas that have historically flooded and we 've got some very good data about those ones that have sunk further so while there are help me here Keith there 's probably 70 different catchments across Christchurch there are some from an earthquake perspective that have got a lot worse in the period so we are fast-tracking now we 've got people working on those investigative reworks now so that work is proceeding with money that we 've gotten this year 's annual plan and they 'll continue to proceed under this program in conjunction with them once we find them what is the best approach because we do believe there may be some properties that will be to you engineering is not the only solution if that at the whole picture okay so look I think I think that 's a great I don 't think that we need to have any sort of detailed discussion I think that 's quite clear you 're saying that if we remove this we 're just simply taking 33 million dollars out of the budget that 's that 's all we 're doing and so would somebody like to move this amendment that the two streams projects come out of the long-term plan now we need to have a resolution on the table to debate so well I think it 's either people want to reduce the budget or don 't so it 's quite simple yep so yani move to second up and Andrew second okay so is it so do you want to ask more questions of of them about reducing the budget or or should we just debate it one um okay so what 's the weighty that there was no record of above or below floor flooding is it creating the last few floods that we should that 's sort of white river and away to you know no but a question is really very direct as was the above full flooding and was evil offal flooding in the last floods were here right my understanding is that there wasn 't now we don 't necessarily have full reporting to the insurance companies because not everybody did report we realize that because it important to have information going on limbs what we 're trying to do is we 're trying to determine levels of future flood risk bear in mind that last year storm events were very and weren 't uniform across the city so they 're not necessarily a great predictor of future flood risk so we feel is really important that we we update our models and validate our models because whilst we have information on ground level that 's one thing and we 're having to put that back into the models to understand it it 's a very flat city and it 's very sensitive and floor levels are something which you can 't tell from lidar information often you have to go in and validated by doing surveys themselves and we other areas my starting to build up a picture that will give us a sense of future prediction in terms of flood risk for those properties in that area at the moment we think that they are at risk but once we have more information we 'll be able to have a more informed recommendation to you in terms of how that sits and how it sits relative to other priorities in the program could I just suggest that wire wrapper and y et streamed project and not in the LTP we 've got the LTP that 's got the land drainage programming and so should we reword that so that there 's 33 million is removed from the overall land drainage because you will not find those two projects in there ya know that this is but this is the amendment that was proposed so the mover and seconder well I don 't know why these tour together so we 're just dealing with the first one or the second one at this stage I mean leave that one to the next and can you change people happy to drainage recovery plan budget by 33 million dollars but they 're not on it 's not on the program it 's not in the LTP the Amendment says removed from the workstream and removed the corresponding funding from the LTP so we 're not on the rig story because we haven 't_''_2217.39 we haven 't_''_2218.44 we haven 't prioritized it you say I we feel a number of things that want things on the envelope on the LTP okay so what 's the prices to have projects either on or off that ledge owners program as part of that I 'll feed pager is one of those solutions I think the it comes back to whether we 're discussing it at a project level and whether that 's the driver or whether you 're discussing it at a program level the program basically tries to in the work that Keith and his team are doing are endeavouring to objectively say which have the highest level of rust not which got with the last time which got within the last ten years but there 's an objective risk based on what in and out but if you if that 's the driver you make she be not putting your best dollar into the area where you actually die the most vulnerable so I think that 's where I come back to my point that wairarapa ye t is a little bit of a distraction until we finally know what the actual most best value spend of that whole program is what we do know is that program is very large and we can look at individual Dave and esteem and look at individual suggestions coming through but I think councils going to have to address that from the most objective view about we 're we 're the best spend of its money can be and and that 's we know that there 's first and foremost and Dudley but actually we 're still working through where those next steps need to be though but in terms of like the whole optimization than they had response but I was really interested in the response I got back around is that the tidal barrage is that there was egg initiated and cost-shared funded know that a little in Oregon was something that was going to be discussed with government what we 're hearing is they 're already making funding moments to certain elements of it like a total barrage that none of us is there was the preliminary work and I was news to me that it was signed off by the horizontal infrastructure governance group when I didn 't even know about it so don 't worry there was and I think we heard that over and over again when submitters came here that none of us knew that the investigation work have been done and I think that it 's an interesting point but it doesn 't really move us forward in the response I 've had by aromatica is that if the ldr p was to fund us BAU project so we had the flooding task force the number of claims identified earlier and this was one of them but you 're saying it 's BAU and that it 's not part of the LD RP so I 'm really struggling to know what the process is to get those year I just suggest that the out that ltp is not the the best place to have this level of debate and I think that I mean even if we voted to remove the wire and Whitey 's streams which I would be a shocked appalled that we would reduce 33 million dollars from the overall land drainage recovery plan budget before we 'd even assess what the priorities are and that 's that 's what strikes me as bizarre isn 't the choice we have is whether we want to wait until we 've done that prioritization with before we put the money on budget so we know what we 're funding this is funding a whole bunch of work that we don 't know do you want to have an LTP by the end of the week because if you don 't then take the money for the land drainage recovery program off the budget all together because if you did that if you took all of the land drainage recovery program budget off the budget then the auditor would know that we were not being sensible because done to repair our damaged land rent land drainage system we 've heard about it on the avin we 've heard about on the heath cut we 've heard about it on the sticks theorists we 've got areas of risks throughout house that had been exacerbated by the earthquakes the only difference between BAU is that they wasn 't impacted by the earthquakes the other areas have been seriously impacted by the earthquakes and we 've got climate change to deal with as well so I mean I just personally think that this is a simple question of whether the council wants to take 33 million dollars off the budget or not and I propose that we put the resolution you 'd like to speak to her in fact I think there 's been a real advantage in heaven to the long-term planning discussion I think most counselors would have known where on earth I dhund where the way he stream was until we actually asked some Christians and well some might but well that 's clips and the phenyl from why Meyer well it 's not just that talking about spending a large amount of money it 's 315 million dollars of our of our total total budget and end in the first three years 153 million so I think it 's really it 's been really important to achieve had this discussion so that we 're actually clear about some of the issues which might have appeared to stand out and have some explanation so it 's all put in context and there 's been really good information has come from the staff to to the infrastructure transport Environment Committee but I think that now that 's been a lot of clarification about with the whole thing suits although this has been moved and seconded in fact I would vote against it and I just think that have been really important that we be able to sign off large amounts of in funding with some clear understanding of what we 're doing for my government 's perspective so I think the staff for your help thank you thank you to someone like to speak in favor of the amendment I 'll speak in favor of it I not be high priority which need consideration and which are proposed to be funded extremely high levels and this isn 't the only budget where that 's the case there are budgets right across the long term plan which have got projects within them that may in fact not be high priority now had there been the opportunity to fully reprioritize all of these budgets prior to the time we got to 30th June we wouldn 't have been having these conversations here as part of a ldp discussion but there is a desire and it 's reflected in a number of the amendments we 're discussing at the moment to reduce some of these massive budgets which have been funded through the long-term plan which have got items in them that are either unspecified or where we don 't know what the priority is so this is driven not from a point of view of wanting to take money away from any program where there 's a need to deliver work not to see anybody 's house flooded not to see any work done that needs doing but to for projects which are uncertain unspecified or may in fact not be necessary always possible to put funds back on if we find out there 's insufficient funds for any particular program but to to leave a project in a work program where there 's no history of flooding where they were quite possibly far higher priorities elsewhere in the city it makes logical sense to me when we 've got a piece of work which may not need to be done and we 've got a significant amount of funds on budget for that piece of work and that 's setting aside the mechanics of you know whether it 's a project or whether it 's specified in it 's a piece of work we 're intending doing and it 's there in a work program which is funded in the LTP why would we vote to leave in the LTP a piece of work which wait which may not be necessary which may be unspecified which is going to be subject to prioritization and is likely to be deprioritized against other areas like Dudley and flop turn and that 's the reason I haven 't been willing to take out the reference to this particular project within that work programme because that actually is what this amendment is about it 's not about reducing 33 million off the work programme because there may well be work that needs to be done but if that 's an imp occasion of putting up a amendment to remove a piece of work from any work stream and it just so happens is this one which is unspecified uncertain or may not be of a high priority then so be it we 've got an annual plan coming up next year we 're told already that a lot of priority work has got to happen after the first of July some decisions need to be made before the 30th of June and in my view this is one of them and that 's the reason that this amendment ISM is still up there all right oh can you put up the thing of those in favor and press yes and those opposed preach no so that is lost look I 've said 'm very mindful of people 's position but if we could just do the Maku waterway drain as well because that 's a recommendation better that a project come forward it 's a _"

    "text": "patient that the original amendment to remove all of accessible City phases two and three they removed is not going to be moved as an amendment so the Andrew wants to move an alternative and amendment which is talking about removing the elements of the phases two and three other than the ones that will be listed on your screen in front of you so once that 's typed up then we can we can address it so if I could just move to another item which is a proposed way forward now I sent you all out a list of what was remaining on the on the schedule of amendments that had been received and there were a number of items that were requests for reports there was a request for a report that was included in the general amendments but so there 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 reports that have been requested and some of them are you know sort of actually components of work that 's already going on some of them we started to address yesterday and then felt that we so what I 'm going to recommend is that because the the long-term plan process isn 't really for us to as a council to be seeking reports because it 's a long-term plan for the next ten years so what I 'm going to propose is that we ask our chief executive to report back and the next eight weeks to counsel with a recommended course of action on each of the requests for reports and that way and and and you know by the end of august we will have in front of us a series of proposals and we can say yes we want to proceed with that no we don 't want to proceed with that that should be reported back to the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee it could be expanded with a bit of a consideration of a different issue that could be linked to the transition plan that could be linked to the work that carlene 's already doing on great for Christchurch some of the administrative stuff that 's recommended there and then another one you know might be no legally we we were required to set it up as a CCO by law so that would be a waste of time getting a report on something that we couldn 't legally do so but if she came back with a series of recommendations about it because as I understand that people asked for reports through this process because they wanted to have it on the record that the report had been requested and confirmed by the council so if people are generally acceptable for that I don 't think we need a resolution to address it because technically they 're not amendments to the LTP that request for reports so if people are generally happy with that that deals with those fish because this is similar to the discussion we had yesterday so we 've already had a kind of big debate about adding the 25k for the work to be done so I guess my concern through this process because this is the budget in the levels of service and community outcomes is that we have sufficient capacity to get those reports that we want within the organization through we have those reports thought so we 're not going to decide that now so I mean there there is there is no point going down a track without advice on whether the report is actually required and what it would require for example investigating extending the light rail tram tracks to New Brighton via worcester street when we haven 't you know considered the advice and what the request to have them extended internally within the central city so I mean I there are things that we as a council I 'm not going to want to have as a as a report but we need to deal with that in a different place this is not with your face we could take the same approach for those resolutions we passed yesterday we took the 25,000 hour we took the 25,000 out that came directly that came directly from the submissions process so that was perfectly acceptable but that one essence so I think that I mean unless you want to vote them up and down we can go through them one by one and we 'll just vote up I just want to make sure that what we don 't happen is a process that ambushes the requests that have been made so until you do that work you don 't know what it 's like a putative LOL stuff for example and in the public transport for the widest central city area but I don 't want to stuff mimic it 's all the reasons why we can 't do is I want to know how much it would cost we 've already got how much it costs to run the shuttle when the town was a vibrant busy place that people were jumping on and off buses all the time and there is a choice what I want to know is I want to know how much it costs for for the proposal that came up in the and the submissions process I want to know how much it would cost to subsidize free public transport within the for revenues I 'd like to know that but I don 't want to make a decision here and now about the staff doing a full report back on afford to put on budget right now and we wouldn 't want to given that the place isn 't a vibrant busy place as it was you 're entitled to you I magic library and we will have a vote on it if you want to have a vote on it now and we voted out then that 's fine but if we don 't want all I 'm proposing is a sensible way forward there everyone else around the table has accepted as sensible I 'm canal so as fond as I understand it i 'm not being asked to develop all these reports of them three months no but actually the process and the prioritization against everything else as well and in terms of what what what we might what process we would follow to actually provide you with the information to make those decisions for later day right because a number of this semester tape though it 's Bernard wanted us to do these things but obviously we don 't have that information so you 're saying another two months to get the information then we make or whether we want to pursue reports until there 's activity report to get a feasibility study on some of these things will take a lot longer so there is a question a broad question that the knee is asking around is this what sort of costs would require what 's the process would you need to go through what all that entail and how do we prioritize this work these reports against some of the other things that you 've asked for as well so i 'm on the on that particular issue it may be that regular updating to the ite might be the appropriate response to their i guess there 's some big ones in this sense more lines like it yes mall alone and unfortunately that assessment wasn 't done before and I 'm just I 'm I 'm suggesting that and you know for some of the ones that are a minor and not difficult carlene or report back next month all we 'll just do one or the other so I 'd I 'm recommending a way forward that nobody else is objected to going to autumn we 're here to discuss the LTP normal process anyway so um if you want to have a vote on the process that I 'm happy to do that no I just wanted to fig the one that I think is important that card way is the social and environmental impact assessment so that 's the one that I would like us to make a call about the other ones I 'm happy to leave to that there is a whole lot of work that 's going on behind the scenes at the moment in relation to components of that that will absolutely focus on on the session and the we are not going to have a debate about that right now so but Carly needs to update us because there 's a lot of work that 's already been going on in this area so the next so we 've got all look the bits and pieces up so we 've got that move by council of Turner seconded by Phil Clearwater no I 'm sorry we had all of the questions before sorry I closed answered yet I thought that 's about the 7 million for Victoria Street and what it can pop composed of its comparable its regards to the public realm content of it counts that through you madam chair and the the there are basically seven levels of intervention across the streets in the central city victoria street as i said earlier because the high pedestrian footfall and so on is a higher level of intervention as far as the the below ground work the renewal works concerned it would be a hundred percent replacement of the carriageway and the curb lines there and so on what influences the cost however is the projected higher standard of streetscape treatment there so that would be a higher standard of lighting similar to that which is going in at the moment on Colombo Street high standard of street lighting footpath paving and street furniture and street trees of landscaping so that pushes the cost per unit meter up to about three thousand five hundred dollars per linear meter as opposed to a lesser standard a streetscape treatment which would be in the order about us what is the cost of that then this even million tho those are enhanced public realm features rather than my question was i support the the pedestrian safety and the traffic modifications but I may not support the enhancement so I want to know what those those two costs are in Cedar million I 'm afraid I don 't have the breakdown between those renewal costs and the enhancement costs but on that basis and the length of the street there I would imagine that the the enhancement cost would be a significant proportion of that seven seven and a half million 7 million of it did I understand you before and saying that the enhancements were actually part of the calming measures and the so I mean it 's hard to differentiate between enhancements that look good but it actually designed to slow the traffic down to the 30k in terms of the core and to prioritize safety around cyclists and pedestrians that they are absolutely integral do the justification for the works on Victorious because you remember everything around it is 50k I mean that 's the or exiting from it as as going into 50k but except where you going straight ahead yeah all right thank you do it do we have to okay right so um so so i presume picture you 'd like to lead off the debate as the movie yet happy to do this our original amendment as it was put up on the board before the break was to remove this whole program of work from the budget altogether and there have been some conversations with staff over the last couple of days and there was written information provided overnight knob viously some good discussion and information provided this morning and I I thank staff for the detail in the information that 's been provided and the readiness to answer questions as well that 's all been very very helpful in getting to the point that we 've gotten and the so the position that we put up in the original amendment was to remove the whole gram of work so that we could then over the following period look at where there were parts of the program that did have plans now that we 've heard the information that we 've heard this morning we believe that there are certain parts of the program which do have value and I 'm particularly interested in those parts of the program where there 's value for bus priority for pedestrians and so on and just to keep traffic moving through the city and to get the right outcomes council 's position in the proposal is that all of the accessible City program were to be pushed out to year 5 so this is a further amendment to that change that had already been signaled in the proposal clearly there are some projects that do have value and that do need to be delivered to five meanwhile there 's a large part of the program where there isn 't the required level of certainty around value and that 's the reason that we 're proposing to take the rest of the program off except for those projects that staff of told us this morning are the higher value project where there are clear benefits and our view now certainly would be that there than later so that we can realize those benefits for the central city and for the whole sitting so this essentially reflects the priorities that have been put out by staff this morning the thinking around the second part of the amendment which is the salisbury street and kill more Street conversions is that there 's little point in doing that work until after the town hall refurbishment the town hall repairs finished so that 's the reason that we leave those in year five and that avoids any further impact on rates of moving those forward from year five if we just leave those where they are that then leaves them where they are in the proposal over the five years that adds up to a approximately 20 29 million dollar total which is significantly less than the total of the whole balance of the accessible work accessible Cities program of work so i put this forward as a compromise of looking at where they were nice to have projects looking at where their a project that can be deferred or don 't need to be delivered but also network value in delivering those projects sooner rather than later and this amendment and certainly reflects that at Paul try and be as articulate as I can sometimes I get a little bit nervous and forget what I 'm trying to say but is is five things I want to talk about vision people people people in connections that 's what I want to talk about because this is what this is all about we are a very large organization that actually interacts with everybody in Christchurch at some point or another we interface with them we connect with them as a council we have to give visibility over a years ahead so at the current time we 're looking at a 30 year horizon we have an obligation to plan ahead for that 30 year horizon with heard from our planners that we are going to face congestion and parts of the city and we need to plan for that congestion we hit a share an idea campaign run by the council and won awards and then that zero an idea campaign people told us our people told us core central city they wanted a walkable central city they wanted us a city they could cycle around safely planners do all the nuts and bolts of the planning but asses governance we have a job to give some vision to those nuts and bolts because quite honestly nuts and bolts it does nuts and bolts with a bit of vision and imagination those bolts can become spacecrafts they can become submarines so we 've got to put some vision into what we 're doing here and I think it 's incredibly short-sighted to remove this program out of the long-term plan that 's what that is what our people told us they wanted it actually will help connect all the air specs with her that we 're spending 20 9.5 million in the short term to give effect to the mobile change which is what our people want to give effect to the 160 million dollars of cycleways and the many many millions of dollars we 're spending and vast priority pre-earthquake we had we enjoyed as a region 2.4 billion dollars worth of tourists economic activity the central that spend now post earth but reported lost a billion of that of that money that comes into our region and we 've been accused as a city of benin would looking so i know under a new chief executive she is working very hard to change it and become an outward-looking council so we actually do connect because it is all about connections we do connect to our partners and our regional partners which actually has a benefit for our city and has a benefit for our Island which is a South Island and ultimately a benefit for New Zealand now the only way we 're going to get that 2.4 billion back and don 't think that this is only just for Central City this will affect every Ward it will affect every one of you councillors wards and I 'm telling you that now because we had some great visionary stuff that happened yesterday where we signed off the promenade walk the s3 EdgeWalk the spine of the lizard walk and these are all parts that connect one thing to another and they enhance us as a connection from the central city to our natural assets which are our coastline our bays our mountains and you 've got to have good connections to those so having a good central city that is well connected to those suburban areas will actually in fact assist those areas to how regenerate them I think it 's short to it 's going to short change our future and I think that 's a real concern so I want us to have a bit of imagination I want to turn nuts and bolts into a space craft it into a submarine I want to make sure that we connect with our neighbors as a central city we want our people back we want that activity back and we want to make sure that it actually works for the future of the city and I 'll only do that if we actually spend the money to connect what we 're doing outside the city we already heard that we were concerned we 're going to be putting all these cycle lanes and rasp writing lines in the center see that we 're going reverse by approving this I think this would be a real shame so please I implore you to really really consider that we want to see a modal shift from people driving around in their cars and two buses and bikes but what you also have to make way that if people want to choose the user car they can get an excess the city Beckham there and 2007 the council made a decision to cite 1999 Alta made a decision to allow be for land to be converted into commercial and retail space from that decision eighty percent of all investment happened outside the central city now what did that do I can tell you what it did it meant that investment inside the city fell away rentals fell away maintenance on buildings became poor building stock became dilapidated and when our earthquake hit we lost eighty percent of our buildings so I want us to see that we make sure that we don 't carry on down there track a decentralized city which is what we got at the moment has an impact of 40 sorry 48 million stuff that was done by our own counsel in 2007 they knew and centralizing city has a mess of impact in the long term so we 're going to make sure that we put back our central city in a way that we do not lose that 44 million and it 's not just out of central city excited Christchurch and ultimately out of New Zealand so we 're going to make sure we pop back a city that actually is functioning connects to the to our our neighborhoods and allow us people to come in here in excess the city and actually enjoy it it is the place of the heart why we really really hard post-earthquake putting restart together because i knew that if we didn 't put a heart back sooner rather later we were probably never get and we lose that investment opportunity we 've been very lucky very very lucky that we 've had investment by Christ roots people going back into a central city because they have a passion for it and I want to support that passion and I want them to continue people to invest and we 'll only do that by doing this plan so please have imagination let 's make a spacecraft let 's launch ourselves into the future and make crisis one of the best cities in the world so is it are you moving an amendment of us that that the words remove the inaccessible city programme of work from the LTP come out of it so that that remains on the budget at the at the end of the five year I want to see the 29 million dollars spent right brought forward yeah and I want to make sure that the rest of the program is done at some point yes so you want to leave the program on but you want to support this work being done absolutely right okay so that 's that so what will accept that as an amendment to it so that the words remove and accessible sorry is it not effectively what the draft suggests from the first instance no no because what what what the what the amendment I mean there is a different divisions of you that you forward bring these ones forward although it doesn 't actually say that but 75 million from years 5 to 10 I think Paul is trying to achieve is there of that 75 million 29 million is moved in two years 125 yeah but the remainder days and years 5 to 10 yeah that 's right so okay did it maybe if you put amend it so that the I 'm trying to amend the the resolution which doesn 't make it clear that it is bringing forward with the exception of the projects and their associated budgets which come forward and two years 1 2 and 3 is that right except for salisbury street and kill more which is year five year three one two and three yes yes I know that but that the amendment that 's been moved as specifically putting Salisbury and kill mode two of the most expensive budgets out unter year five so and that 's perfectly acceptable but just ask a process question because maybe I wasn 't listening but I didn 't hear Paul saying he was foreshadowing in a minute no I him yeah and if anyone was listening to him he wasn 't speaking against this okay he was speaking against a part of it right and so I was trying to be helpful and articulating it as an amendment so that we could vote on better shoe because I have to say I 've got some sympathy with their point of view so um ok it 's just yet actually say he was moving in a min beside no they 're not be how all that in relation to the ltp budget on accessible City 29 million of the proposed 75 million be brought forward as per the staff presentation this morning in two years 125 yes yeah except they didn 't recommend years 125 they recommended years 13 under four so yes one difference in 125 124 that 's within the realms of yeah God is Mira okay they don 't look that in relation to the accessible City ltp budget for the accessible City 29 million of the proposed 29 million dollars of the proposed 73 million be brought forward and two years 125 is as per the there and cancel a long silence if you would like to move it okay pulls moving it on bikies seconding it so that 's that 's the foreshadowed motion if the first motion I mean I wanted to deal with this as an amendment but it doesn 't have to be that 's fine so that 's a full shadowed motion so we 'll carry on with the original motion ok so does somebody want to speak in favor of the original motion _"

    "text": "Shin sequencing is big but look we 're doing that at the moment we 're doing work outside the bus interchange it 's not easy but we 're doing it and we had to so the buses could access it we 're looking at doing around the hospital as well so it is really a matter of construction sequencing it takes a lot of work but you can do it yep I guess all the work on the Town Hall getting that Victoria Street Montreal Street stuff right it 's really important it 's actually going to be your way of avoiding that part of town yep yeah yeah absolutely the only thing we 've got to also understand as which we don 't either fully understand you there 's how went the Town Hall redeveloped how that 's going to impact on Victoria Street and particular its nightlife as well and connections between the two yep can I just check on your injured TF as when we met with nzta it was my clear understanding that many of these projects will not qualify and the consultation document you 've what that means in terms of it 's my understanding that these are gross because we 've already been told that so they don 't include the assumptions try yeah so the rates impacts I 've assumed summons ETA funding to come to the rate impact at a net level but the figures we 're talking about here at the gross level and the way we 've done that we do have to be assumptive based is based on the projects and their degree to we expect them to be eligible the NZTA coming so that 's eh we 've taken consistent with every other part of the long-term plan that 's eligible for UTI funding as well I 'm just trying to understand out of these projects what is the quantum that you 've budgeted for the NZ tech on that none of this none of these we have got the budget and then but Peter can you tell us what the assumption is this one no we 're not operating off that now yani we 've got the same course so if you take Victoria straight which is a debate with you I just wanted Kendall on it I 'm just asking for you Peter are you able to tell us how much you have assumed for contribution really matter chair the all of these projects are extracted from what were the transport schemes in a phase two program it was the patterning realm but it didn 't yell sadly I assume there is some of the discussions with New Zealand Transport Agency over the draft program business case for all five phases of accessible City started from the point of view of them being interested in the projects that had transport let outcomes and other projects that they would not be eligible for their funding that were broadly around public realm and so these projects that you see here have been extracted from the transport program using and Transport Agency have seen all of the iterations of the draft program business case and our understanding is that they they are broadly comfortable in the normal funding arrangements of a seeking support funding from them that these are eligible projects for us to seek funding obviously we can and the plan is forty-eight percent and twenty sixteen forty nine and twenty seventeen fifty percent and 2018 don 't don 't forget I mean that will does agree to which that funding comes through will be very four different elements of any given so I mean it 's a it 's a broad tape based on normal funding criteria yeah the the overall program business case rests upon the premise of it being a total program and therefore all the projects effectively feed off one another in terms of their benefits all of them as a program in toto deliver high rate high bc our ratings benefit cost ratios in NZ tas to and so our understanding is that they 've accepted that principle that this is a benefit-cost analysis for the entire program that 's what they accepted in the streamline business case for the first phase programs that have already been approved so our presumption would be as we open Russians with them over subsidy for individual schemes is that we would be starting the conversation from that viewpoint that they accept there is a good program then seeking funding for individual games in we would expect that we would fund about half of that roughly but I I think almost Street salisbury street and victoria street a little bit more about public realm than they are about pure transport so maybe less than half so I think you could possibly assume lease and now the big ticket items in that 29 9 so if we looked at maybe what thirty five forty percent of it coming from is made out of two pieces made it a generic assumption at the lower limb end and but it still have a point three percent impact on rates over four years which we have to find somewhere in this budget or add on to our rights for which I 'm not going to do I we 've produced your Capulets preachy where a spreadsheet we can hand out now to show what the profiling of that 29-point fibers and also what it means for the rest of the programs that were deferred and I 'm just going to do this one just to but if you wouldn 't mind for five years and with this discussion with highlighted the ones that would come back into the first three to four years of the plan I 'll sit around now that you can look at home over the break it 's extremely helpful thank you please note you avoid confusion that these are on uninflated dollars as opposed to the capital program which has an inflated dollars when we when we get to that thanks alright so I think that we will move to have a break now and it is 11 14 so are you happy to come back at eleven-thirty they 're fine okay right none of the kill more and Salisbury ocular upgrade in particular by that time so around what the cost of just the one way would be versus the other enhancements that you may not not proceed with the separate cycleway so victim is ill more and Salisbury if we were to look at just the traffic management aspect only so including the cycleway and whatever provision there is four bosses and so on but without any other enhancements or are they the enhancements from tim was actually a lot of what you might call the enhancements are around actually delivering on segregated cycle way so really see the do it or not do it there aren 't bits of those projects I think that taking Joe sealed half pregnant sort of debate isn 't it don 't know what that is so I think that you might save in actually not delivering it but the cost of re-engineering a physically separated cycleway and after you 've done a full road kimber alignment there 's actually quite expensive I what I thought so I would suggest you do it all you don 't do it thank you very much and thank you i think it 's been a really helpful presentation and you 've obviously done a lot of background work into it so that 's much appreciated and we 'll see you all back here at eleven-thirty thank you Oh _"

    "text": "right okay madam cheer we can provide you with a spreadsheet which shows projects that we 've got up there within the next five years and all the other projects which were in the draft ltp pushed out beyond that point and and that lists all the projects by line item as well so you can see which ones would no longer be included within the LTP yep clean your next thank you I suspect my question may have been ours now because it was around the effect of delays and anchor projects given that as you 've said you know the interrelationship opportunity exists between this in the projects we 've got delays dear so is that part of the changes for pushing out or it 's not what effect are those delays and again I think the issue I mean a lot of the first phase projects were around doing works at support of the anchor projects a lot of these works you know are around actually putting in place to the accessible City sup that brings and enables people to get into the center and the center particularly if we think about Victoria Street in the slope core is actually about supporting private investment going and not about supporting anchor projects now so and again it said hole what are we doing as a community or what are we actually either leading or responding to that encourages that investment and makes this a pleasant place to invest in because we know there 's still some resistance in the marketplace to coming back in the center part of that is the experience that staff have when they get out onto the street and want to walk down to grab a coffee or do some shopping so part of it particularly in that slow core there 's a lot of traffic but there 's a lot of amenity a lot of other value add that comes in from actually upgrading their I 'm dad Phil thank you and I just really want to ask you petrol irate over more on how in fact that the key projects you have in front of us how in fact they 're integrated like TV the wayfinding is and yeah that 's just that to me seems to be part of the key to whether the way findings very interconnected with the development of car parking facilities and making sure that people can get to those new facilities efficiently easily we reduce the amount of unnecessary traffic hunting around four spaces in the heart of the central city it would also give us those critical linkages through the central city for the cycleways how people will connect through the central city across those the slow core as we 've just said I think it really is integral to the development of the cycleway program I think if we weren 't to treat a cluster of streets in the heart of the central city and achieve a self-enforcing low speed zone there and most of this would deliver those threshold treatments people getting it but they understand these are slow speed streets then that network is fractured through the art of the central city and that would have an impact on the the order and the delivery of the major cycle waste program i would suggest the synapses tree upgrade similarly is about actually we 're currently delivering on choo and street and providing that very important connection apart cross the southern part of the central city avoiding cyclists needing to be on what has happen you for instance the the two streets of Victoria and kill more really are all about supporting the revitalization of the residential in that area and so those were always seen to be an appropriate transport response to people coming back into that part of the central city and finding it an attractive place to be and I think we 've just discussed the sort of the thinking behind victoria street and do vikatan Avenue Pinkston I 've got one other quick follow-up question you 've really alluded to quite a number of safety features around these projects so within within the the second phase I 'm assuming that these projects also will cover any necessary safety issues absolutely for people to have confidence that the slow core is intended to be then we need to do sufficient engineering treatments on those roads the drivers coming in there who can still access those streets but they do understand goes beyond relying on simply 30k signs coming in there it actually begins to implement some of the engineering measures at the thresholds to achieve that vision that we are now in the slow core further measures which were in the original phase two program would then go on and introduce further engineering treatments and measures on those streets within the core and other streetlights additional for instance which do fall out of this compressed phase two program so that 's why there 's a big difference in funding terms between this and the original program is we would have done that level of treatment that you see on Victoria Street there on a far greater number of streets across the central city and that would have been delivered earlier we believe if the livers a lot of the core transport benefits early and that but that 's why there is that big cash difference between this program and the original thank you David thank you look you 've discussed kilmer and Salisbury just a short moment ago and line possible advantages for residential development are there any other sort the accessible City plan yes the the salisbury street upgrade would deliver quite an important east-west protected cycle way across their towards hagley park so so that that was that was a very strong element of the rizal spruce tree upgrade the skin wall street to weighing enables environment country 's new bus network to to get into some of the roots in the central city their interim route arrangements in place there at the moment so there are bus there are bus routing benefits that come from this and they 're recycled routing elements that come from it as well it on the back of this to weighing of those two streets so answer them so it 's a further to that then christchurch has probably got used to us here pitting and a half million and turning these two back to two-way streets to two questions really is visit absolutely essential and secondly as it 's part of the government blueprint that we would have to negotiate with government on aspect of it or or can we review the actual decision that some stage to whether or not go to to return these two streets back I it 's been council 's position as we understand it that council desired us to look closely at the potential to convert all of those one-way pairs back to two-way operation this was before we were elected a fellow of just just saying its aquatic huge it has a huge college to everyone 's now made assumptions based on it so yeah so I think there 's a there 's a couple of levels to that your question counsel is one is obviously this part of a recovery plan so it does would have to be renegotiated if it has been a long same desire by previous councils going back as long as I 've been in the city to actually I take out the the one ways because there 's been this understanding that the one ways well they 're very efficient from a transport point of view don 't actually work very well for a land-use activity on the side of it or they certainly create barriers and I think one of the key things why sort of Lee strengthen the connection into the residential area north of that actually to pull that residential area down onto the central city so whether it 's the right level of investment that 's a question for council to make given its current funding but i think the philosophy and the rationale were actually going to to way and actually brit slowing those streets down and bringing that residential area and the north much closer to the center is still a sound direction we want to travel and it 's it 's a barrier i mean one way streets are a barrier to residential neighborhoods that 's right yep the other they they what they do they create I would have got rid of German well I think of as well again if we go back to the early very early modeling that the council did we actually got rid of them all because that was we canceled wanted to go to so I suppose we 're in a situation where we 're trying to reflect what has been an aspiration of counsel for some time and we think there are some decision for what you wish to invest in the timing on that well it still is an option now that if we wanted to say 13 million we could delay this part of the back to where it 's been so what would be his the question is what would be the impact on the plane if we did delay the two-way conversion on those histories in pure transport terms perhaps not as critical as some of the other projects in that program there there madam chair because you 're in your instructions to us may last year when we revised the program was that those two streets should remain a priority in future phases of an accessible City and so that 's why we have done our best to retain them in this scope that program I think the other the other issue is the issue that you raised netters people are making investment decisions now so if we 're pushing these out for another five years the investment decisions about what those streets will be fronted with will have all been made yeah I mean I wasn 't just think it 's important to put the the reasons on the table Andrew thank you I 've got a number of questions and they 're they 're all in the spirit of the conversation we need to have to get to an amendment that term is sensible in the works I 'll come back to Victoria Street first of all the 30 kilometres own in victoria street does that stack up from a traffic management and traffic engineering viewpoint because clearly victoria street is outside of what we would think of as the central city core and therefore the central city slow zone if we want to do the 30 kilometres own in victoria street what effects would there be from a traffic engineering traffic management point of view and what would be effect on costs being of not doing that 30k in Victoria Street alright so I 'll blip them out to the technical detail but I think right from day one Victoria Street is actually probably the most complex piece of the traffic network in the central city because it actually is the point at which if from riccarton and Dean 's Avenue it 's that the natural point that people want to turn down so in fact actually dealing with that one section of the road it 's given that those are there 's a significant amount of competing demand for that street both of the retail street now I suppose more as an entertainment street but also as a major in entrance road and exit route it 's actually quite complex which is why all the modeling has always said yes there 's the very central core and then there 's Victoria Street as that gateway so yeah but it won 't be a gateway if it 's 30k and it 's pedestrianised you know either so so I mean it 's not going to be the entrance to the to the city anymore really because I mean people will have to look for another way into the city way but actually what it does is actually if you think about a lot of extends it actually becomes quite a major point for those communities that are going to be actually emerging around it so the city different from say Colombo and casual but still and very important interface area between residential traffic and business activity it really better balances its traffic functions which you 've already alluded to with the fact that we do have this desire to improve the streetscape there to give pedestrians better safety when they 're crossing that street there and a 30k we believe in in in traffic terms is the right speed limit for a road with that sort of mixed activity and so Victoria Street is in is in that that group of streets just outside the central city the other Street we 're looking at in similar context although it 's not in this program here is colombo street south between san asif street and down to morehouse you know those are the two key streets where we believe there is sufficient frontage activity and transverse pedestrian crossing activity and so on that warrants those being gateway streets into the heart of the central city when people come in from the avenues they begin to appreciate that there are streets here where they can access them activities pedestrians crossing and so on yeah okay um Paul oh I 'd also have other questions if I can yes and they 're all recent ND erectile try and keep them brief the kill more and salisbury the weed bears in terms of priorities on the list that you 've given us here would they be towards the bottom end the priorities on that list than at the top end of those priorities yes yes yeah and a part of your thinking of putting them on was that council had previously signals so both this council and previous councils had signaled that those projects were important in those previous discussions yes 33 but they 'd so just to reiterate they do also serve a function so oh and so what we 're trying to do is to recognize what i think richard outlined it very early we 're trying to you know get a balanced approach that continues to seek improvements to the traffic environment that raises the quality of the the urban space which supports PT and cycling 's are supports modal shift and yes while these are do actually speak to supporting the residential environment and the connection between that northern part of the central city with the core of the central city yeah I mean I really do so I just one very sure they 're not just something discounted as traffic engineering outcomes in themselves ya know and I mean I appreciate all of these things are trade-offs between the the money and the outcomes so no that 's that 's useful to know now just in terms of how we might frame an amendment if we were going to make any changes take into advice to receive the advice that we have received over night and in the briefing this morning to achieve what you 've got up there and only that up there if an amendment were to be moved that put that amount on budget and specified that those projects Billy only wants to be delivered that would be workable from staffs point of view in terms of giving you directions to to what was to be done and putting enough funds on budget to be able to deliver that yes I it 's like having a bad shadows the funny and I also I also in the context of that same question I appreciate p to the comments you made earlier about timing yes and that 's obviously a big part of this as well because clearly all about timing that yet already on the on the plan but they 're on the plan for five years on what 's so the brought forward in the recommendation or the resolution is actually about bringing these forward into the first three four years yeah but so how much gets put forward into each of the years I mean what-what can actually be done because we 're not interested in putting stuff on the on the budget for a year where it 's not going to be delivered so you 're obviously not going to do cool more Street while the town halls being redone no that 's right that 's right yeah so we so the total amount on budget for ways to correct me on phases as around 73 million over the 10 years mm-hmm but they don 't start till that you don 't start anything to live by 22 that 's right what the recommendation in front of you here is to bring these projects forward and two years one two three four yep and take the rest off no no no it would be a separate if you wanted to take the rest of those off that would be different but it 's but I 'm sorry we 're dealing with an amendment that hasn 't been moved yet that phases 2 and 3 be removed from the LTP so it does actually suggest that the risk come off the LTP we only proceed with these I think well we would probably recommend if from a delivery point of view is is bring this program for into the first three years at this stage allow the balance to remain beyond there because effectively what we will need to do is counsel probably is through the next LTP rounders say exactly what do we want to deliver because I suppose what we 're still saying as we still believe that actually delivering phases to through 25 of the AAC the ones we want to bring forward you 've got a balance of that program still starting and if y 22 but you 're going to have at least one more LTP round to go and say well how would we want to continue to explore look at that within this the next few years to say what of that remaining program do we want to continue with or actually abandoned for good but i think that to abandon it for good now would not be the right thing to be saying i think that there was a view that you could take the alternative which is to take it off and then decide in the next hour TP round what you put back on well I mean yes you could do that that 's probably I mean I think that if we again speaking from our delivery point of view we still believe that probably within that next 10-year cycle there should be other projects coming on I think it would be fair to say that we 're still remain committed to our program and review the program rather program in the future we might bring it back um yeah that 's but do you that does raise another question which is obviously if Gilmor Street can 't_''_1219.34 be done while the town halls being done and obviously can 't do salisbury street because you pretty much have to do that at the same time so you 'd want them out unto yeah so so they would they would be at the end of what I 'm trying to get a handle on on what needs to be done and do what do what do we need to put on budget for next year the following year in the year you don 't need to answer that question right now but we almost we sort of got a bit of a straw person yeah we could we can reject that and bring it back we only found out about kill my street being reduced to one lane this morning so we 'll just have to rejigger and anguish Gilmore and Salisbury out probably for a five years time I think all three or four five yeah so and the got a spreadsheet here which shows the projects and we can just do a little bit of tweaking and the break and bring it to you if you 'd like yep that 's great and Paul 's next am looking at the twenty nine point five million dollar spin would it be fair to say that by doing this we 're going to Harwich the modal shift we 're going to give a thick to a hundred and sixty million dollar cycle way and we 're also going to give effect to the many many millions of dollars were putting into both priorities yep it 's obviously going to deliver on the investment that 's being made I mean it 's interesting that a couple it wasn 't too long ago that we actually were worried that we were going to deliver the central city cycle way and we wouldn 't connect it to anything beyond the four avenues we do a risk that we do all the forever news we won 't have anywhere to deliver it to so it is all about connecting up as well the second going to be a delay be because of the town hall but if we to achieve a an increase in population in the city of people there 's two way conversion is going to be critical to creating amenity for those streets and encourage that increase in population the beef it 's a yeah I that key part of that that 's for sure it 's a good question FMO yeah Lee yeah well but just picking on that kill more sales were straight actually the logical thing to me that it 's seduced is that you actually to where sales retreat now even if it 's on a temporary capacity because if you 've got kill more than one lane why wouldn 't you want that additional capacity and I mean I you know I think the issue with to weighing is separate than the cost of the public immunity so you know I I 'd be really interested in what is the cost just to to weigh it but not provide the sort of gold plating until after all the developments being done and then we go and because I because I also understand it you can correct I mean I 'd like your opinion on it the minus thing is with us in GTA four extra funding to fix the right there are going to be damaged from all the construction and demolition activities that are occurring so so I just like to understand can we get the information around what we could do in terms of solitary strike just to laying at but not gold-plating it until after point of order a shoe you i think the rude gold plating is actually uncle all anyway higher level of increased power community greater than other streets and the eastern suburbs that are going to be 6 in 30 years if you well hang on is there an answer around should we proceed with salisbury street to a conversion given the one way one lane aspect of kilmore I think we 've always been concerned about converting streets from one way operation to to weigh in isolation yeah i agree seen them yet pair salisbury street a large element of the work going on there would be creating it delivers the expenditure and so the issue would then be did you convert it to any way but without the cycleway which any means you 're coming back to retrofit a slightly cycleway issue which is that was one of the other questions as the major cycle way is going to our mastery we 've got the avon river precinct anjali in dollars for the cycleway on the north side of it I really can 't understand the solar street having a major cycle way down it when actually we want to get people into a safe space where we 've actually got and if you look at hagley park and that connection actually are my street so the logical thing for the cycleway is the rubber and i can 't quite understand why you would be doing I salisbury street as well it through you madam chair I mean the salisbury street is a key cycle route across the northern part of the central city it 's the only one that provides a good east-west connection there between victoria street hagley park and a further east and the is a key cycle route is that it wasn 't in a draft accessible City in the first instance from ceará and council asked for an additional cycle Road east west across that northern part of the central city 's be quite a good idea if we actually did delivered what we asked for but just as you know just an idea it was council 's view that they want to be a good cycle where Pauline hang on from yonni and ritas well and how much of that but if we enhance public community because to me Victoria Street works people poorly they flock in there what the submitters told us is that that they have pedestrian safety issues in traffic congestion issues so is it possible to get at information breakdown on how much of that figure is actually enhanced energy we can provide that they 'll be broad order breakdowns of the renewals versus the announcements but yes I think we can get an order of of what 's intended there it will be quite interesting because I keep going back to that because literally until I I didn 't understand that the engineered bruton or thurs to carry on down to be lee avenue and when i did drive down there again i did notice that there is a sign that says north traffic should carry carry on but your instinct is to turn leave but your instinct won 't be to turn left when it is obviously a slow pedestrianised more amenity focused area so but I don 't know that that 's going to deliver the business people that came here what exactly what they wanted either but because i don 't know we I mean where is the car parking for those that do use the cars that don 't shift their mode where is the car parking for businesses in their area there 's some fairly substantial parking south of Knox church between Victoria and Montreal and so the traffic plan for those streets is for most of the north-south traffic to be directed to Montreal and Darren streets yeah that 's the route in and out and so the avenues would be the suit there would be to encourage drivers to will be businesses wanting access on Victorious treats those mike says that 's why it 's such a challenge because we 're really trying to to achieve a balance between traffic access to premises there that rely on it into local parking plus pedestrians out of all theories in various business yes where the people are likely to drive but they need a pack for you know an hour or whatever you know some of that parking is off Montreal hmm some of that parkings off Montreal as you should come up there they were access to those so end the hot tap Done behind the bell rings yet yes and there 's also business as some large car parking and off the back of peterborough street here at the moment which we 're operating yeah yeah I mean it 's just the long term that that 's going to be an issue for their area yes yep yeah the parking plan does signal there 's going to be a demand north of the square and that 's one of the things that we 're looking at yeah postal appealed a lot of modes down there and that 's the reason why it 's so tricky it 's for public transport it 's for cycling it 's for walking and its private vehicles it 's a lot stuck on your 20.1 meters of road space so hints the reason why you get an elevated budget as well because it 's quite complex for short specific short piece of attenuation of the bus priority which will come down Main North Road Papa new Victoria I mean salisbury is it across the register down to the yep yes down kilmore down to a more Manchester kill or steal ya up get paddle to you both how to set impact on delaying kill more the Town Hall took yeah I think that 's one of the things we 'd have to look at certainly kill more is one of the key PT routes as well so connexin as does a small portion of salisbury street but but but i think that no point i spending money i 'll kill more street whilst the town hall has been there 's been done no I big projects and eroding around them yep that 's it 's it 's a timing isn 't _"

    "text": "happy birthday of Jimmy chin so we 've got the staff here to address the accessible cities chapter we felt that going through the amendments that we have remaining on the table that we thought we 'd start the day with something interesting and challenging and something that there is I think a considerable amount of you know concern about on the sense that it 's it is part of the central city recovery plan that was developed in a way that was quite secret from that particular that the rest of the plan and in fact I think it was one of the very early briefings that we had from the minister just as we came into office and I think I went out and joined him at a press conference that I was part of that I hasn 't I hadn 't quite been expecting but there you go so so if you would like to because we have an amendment in front of us that proposes to take out phases two and three all together we would like to have a briefing from staff just giving us 2 and 3 mean because there are different components to the phases some of which will attract funding from NZTA others of which that won 't and but also there are connections with our cycle ways and you know trying to get some modal change within the central city if we don 't within the city as a whole if we don 't look at the central city as tying into that that will raise other issues as well so it 's a it 's a challenging issue so let 's have a little bit of an educator part of the session and then we 'll look at the amendment and see whether that 's the amendment that people want to proceed with or whether they want to make some adjustments to it so if I hand over to you Mike and the team thanks man so you 'll just give it a tag team exercise between self Richard in and 10 on this so and we 're happy to explore down different things with a few I suppose a few graphics but if I just sit there context and the details of where we 've got to and in the light of some of the discussions it 's been happening with counsel how we think we can offer back a program which keeps us going without perhaps committing us to the sort of the full dollars that were initially associated with phases two and three because it would be easy to go back to from staff point of view back to the full noise but we recognize that that 's probably not going to be something that we can financially afford so the as the anus said okay and I can well remember the yes it was the week thursday afternoon where I think you 've just been in office the minister suddenly turned up want to make an announcement Ewing outside and stood next to them and I think you came back saying what have I just announced but I think the key thing is an accessible City is a critical part of actually delivering the recovery of the central city I think we need to think about in that context it 's not simply it well it 's a hell of a lot more than roading in the first order and that it actually also covers things such as the concept of the slow streets pedestrianisation improving the look and feel of the the public realm and i think i heard that might have been the N or perhaps Vicky yesterday talking about the fact that you know we often maintained the most important thing that actually brings life back into the into the city is actually creating a strong public realm that actually is conducive to people investing back into property and actually joining up the dots between some of the bigger projects so I ACC is about joining all those dots together so it starts at a traffic level in terms of slowing the center down it starts to well in its very early iterations when the council is looking at it looked at very much removing the one way system but that didn 't emerge through the government model in its entirety but it 's also about creating an integrated network that basically supports life in the central city focuses on connecting some of connections back into the central city and basically is about lifting that whole public realm space back to I suppose back to em beyond where we were to create a high quality public realm so in terms of we 're sitting thinking about regeneration of the central city it 's a key integral part of that so that 's probably a bit of context so i suppose what we will just quickly do is basically get Richard to explain what 's been happening with the first phase and what we see are the important phases or the important elements of the next phases to move into I think madam chair so yet the met the graphic graphic that you have in front of you now simply shows the first phase program of works which council approved and May last year and there 's a 72 million dollars which was part-funded by council 27 million 27 by ciara or crown and a further 18 million from NZTA so from our perspective we certainly got her a reasonable amount of bang for our back for that 72 million dollars and what that and prioritize projects that sort to support the first phase anchor projects so the bus interchange as you remember this time last year we discussed about reprioritizing projects so that we could get that traffic going a long term street so that buses could actually access the interchange the upgrade to and around Litchfield street and colombo supports the retail precinct as well and we 've just finished consultation on what we call that the hospital corner works durham street cambridge terrace and Manchester Street and the proposal was to bring the results of that consultation back to you and seeking to obtain approval for those works and a couple of months time and that 's really the first phase set of projects so as Mike mentioned an accessible City is really a program of works and one of the key things that it seeks to do was support quite a significant increase in the number of people using them public and active modes of transport so effectively a three-fold increase in people walking cycling and taking public transport and I guess the risk of not doing the further phases shift which underpin de which underpins it will not be achieved so that 's probably the first risk of not doing the further phases or of delaying them into the future the second risk is the state and intention of the recovery plan is obviously this vibrant and successful central city and that inaccessible city is designed so that the it supports the early benefits of crown investment and the anchor projects as well as that that the public investment or private investment unto you know developments that we see going too long durham and cambridge terrace and other parts of the central city as well so it 's quite fundamental to those that if we 're encouraging the private sector to throw tens or hundreds of millions of dollars into redeveloping the central city that the public realm particularly the streetscape outside those developments doesn 't look like it does now which in some cases is pretty poor as mike also alluded to the major cycleway program there 's very limited funding for that past the four heirs so there 's a couple of we things that it does does decide to continue with the motorcycle ways through the LTP but not an accessible City then we 'll have the problem of not having linkages between the major soccerway program outside the central city and what we 're proposing within the central city the other one is PT or public transport obviously councillors a major piece of work along Brooke and road which is about both bus priority and a bus interchange and again that 's fundamental that that at the moment would stop at the record and Dean Zev under Section now if we don 't continue some form of bus priority beyond that and undirected an air again you lose the benefits of those projects which sit outside the central city so in a bit of a nutshell that 's that 's that the key risks that we see from not funding phases two three and four of an accessible city and the other thing is that you know independent of that the blueprint obviously development has occurred in some areas and Victoria streets are a good example of that where large portions of the tourists tree the streetscape environment is quite poor still so it 's our recommendation that certainly that street is subject to a renewal and that would support that private sector investment so pets just moving on from the first schematic there and that speaks that speaks to the further phase of links of an accessible City and what we 're seeking to achieve from that and the anticipated funding from other stakeholders so phase two is all about no choice transport efficiency and wayfinding it 's about the public realm and it 's really about supporting that pedestrian slow core which is set at 30 kilometers an hour and again this you know the the integration of that with the cycleways is quite fundamental because when the cycleways can get in to the central city through the separator cycleways once they get to the sloak or they can mix it with pedestrians and private vehicles because everything is slowed down but cut to the chase this is probably the key slide here and what we have done is based on the feedback we 've received from councillors and consultation with the public would be the best projects to support what council wants to achieve and indeed what I set out than accessible City and put those to you now which as you can see you know we 'll just take a moment to go through those adds up to about 29 million dollars worth of funding so not the original amount that was in the draft LTP here compared to what it was about 75 million was originally in the LTP I believe in the LT maybe phase two of them yeah yeah yeah phase two or all of them an accessible City which is if you took the whole program works which we have anticipated would probably take about 20 years to do that the total cost is around I think 263 million now obviously 70 million 72 million dollars of that has already been allocated and some of that 's been spent phase two what we did was basically break that up to what we call the phase 2 T which is the transport projects um to p which is public realm there was about 90 million dollars with works 44 and phase 5 was about 20 million but we never anticipated that all that work will be done within the next ten years it seems really a program of work that would take 20 years to do so but what we 've done is pluck out the key projects which we think would support the sloak or ensure that we have efficient way finding with them to the central city and connect to the PT and major cycle route projects that council has outside of the central city so what I might do now is just hand out Tim to do a very brief summary if that 's okay of these projects here and just the benefits of the night so very briefly those those are the key projects that we see in transport terms would deliver a lot of the key principles of accessible city in a in a cut-down phase to the wayfinding project is is just as much about direction travelers into car park buildings to and from those car park buildings will get a lot of network efficiencies out of people hunting round streets looking deliver well but it would link into the major new car parking buildings so that 's why we 're recommending that stays in the program the low-speed core is Richards just summarized is much more than just delivering public realm enhancements in the heart of the central city the business case for the major cycleways program across the city expected that accessible city would deliver the bulk of those enhancements within the core in the central city it is the hub that connects all those roots together and and so it is about the last 500 meters of that journey for a cyclist to their places of employment and so as Richard said earlier this tripling of the number of people catching the bus cycling walking in the center of the town is not a nice to have it 's hardwired into our transport projections for the central city that if we don 't achieve that mode shift we will be looking at congestion with the increased level of development that were expecting in the central city so there is a direct relationship between the slow core and the business similar issue applies with the San acid Street upgrade is that councillors heard from us last year about the delivery of the children street separated cycle we 're going east from the hospital towards cpit soon Asif Street delivers the reverse direction and and so that 's being built now the tomb Street cycleways going in now our recommendation would through this would be that as early as possible we deliver the matching facility for cyclists heading safely westbound towards the hospital across the southern part of the central city kilmore street and salisbury street two-way conversions well they they were the remain remainder of where council wanted us to look at how could we convert all of the one way is back to two way it 's always been an important issue for council in our understanding and that 's why when we revise that program recommended revising that program to council last May council asked us to make sure that the conversion of Salisbury and kill more streets remained a priority in the phase two program so that 's why we 're recommending they still sit there within think Richards already explained that that really is as opposed to underpin the third party investment that 's going into important new premises along there and the Riccarton road bus priority that 's probably all about the evening Pig journey and about buses coming out of town where we 'll have wisdom along so Nassif Street only through the super stop there they 'll hit riccarton ave and we don 't want them held up before they get to the deans riccarton set of signals and so that would deliver a bus priority laying westbound it is that evening connection at riccarton that is important you 've got frequent buses coming out of town but they will typically be meeting in less frequent services at riccarton so that few minutes of missing a connection at riccarton will be all important to the attractiveness of that evening service out of the city so again that 's why we 're recommending that that be done reason could we wait until the presentation Spanish okay that 's it madam thank you and so I just also know just without wanting to get into 've estimated so some of these will achieve potentially nzdt a subsidy right we don 't know exactly the level of subsidy we don 't know exactly which bits of them but there will be I can see mr. guzzles just woken up and then I suggested there was some money coming out of here whenever you use that word subsidy from somewhere else bring them along yeah yeah the autumn on kicks in so I 'll just dampen them down by saying we shouldn 't that we you know that 's going to obviously beacon that 's going to be here to be contestable it 's going to have you proven in every case but so but we think it 's probably safer to work with the gross dollars at this point for council okay so I 'm in order to have an amendment on the table as someone wanting to move the amendment that we remove phases two and three from the LTP and does anyone want to pour shadow the motion of that fails that this proposal revised priority phase 2 comes into the LTP okay so motion to remove phases 2 and 3 going to suggest if we can yeah now that we 've heard from staff and now that we 've had commentary on the report that was put over night yeah I 'd quite like mean this is our amendment this is perhaps choice amendment I 'd quite like to have some time to have some discussion team yeah so that we can discuss what approach we 'd like to take I think that would be the most sensible way so we 'll just have questions at the moment and we won 't debate it will heaven it will have the adjournment before we debate it okay no I 'm happy to be helpful you know that I always in yarny Vicki and gleam so I 'm just I 'm just looking at the program that we have that we weren 't consult at all and I take the example of kill moisture we consulted on 13 million you 've now got to figure 7.4 million so i can 't i can 't quite understand why we keep getting different figures and this program the funding and i just want to understand why we 've got different figures i also look at things like ricca de and we 're proposing to spend five million that you 've come back with point five what that 's so it 's kind of hard to make decisions when you don 't when you can 't quite understand why the numbers keep changing and what the numbers are actually based because it 's probably only a component of it perhaps you could run through there yes certainly we haven 't consulted in detail yet over the deep the details of the kill more in salisbury street conversions certainly the outline cost we had in fillmore street was significantly higher than that when we were looking at that matter for council last year in terms of refacing that at first phase program we did believe at that time that it may be possible to achieve some savings with that scheme so we achieved the basic two-way conversion but actually we you know we we feel now that this is probably a better reflection of the likely cost of achieving continue to recommend to counsel that those two streets be treated together did you take out some of the doesn 't have that round stuff you know I mean like was it what I just wondered whether it 's what we 're seeing now is a more precise estimate of the 2-way conversion rather than the whole project which was more than just the two-way conversion right yes and I think it probably takes account more of some of the repair work that 's taken place on some of the streets in the area than some of our early rest and that 's perhaps did ok so what confidence can we have in these photos given that for example victoria street is that almost no zero change it is still showing at seven million like so some you 've completely changed cut in half and others you 've kept entirely the same and i just i don 't quite understand why they don 't just one more thing i 'll kill my street it 's our understanding that the town hall repair will mean that that will probably go down couple years so i don 't think that 's something council should progress probably until pep 17-18 a few are of a mind to approve this that 's just a point note I think what we 've tried to do counselor is given the funding pressures that the council is on as shave part of this off and and bring back something to you which is more palatable as a whole so some of the figures have changed a bit we 've reprioritized them but also looked at the project 's themselves and go on physio some savings that you could make and that 's why you see some of the Victoria Street which is three blocks seven million dollars I think that 's hugely expensive it 's already had its repairs done it 's it 's got private investments I 'm not quite sure what the kettle says it 's a huge investment from the private sector in fact you know it 's it 's been a matter for debate or is it a question I situation why haven 't you taken any of the Victoria Street upgrade and to cut it at least in half if not further given its not extensively damaged it 's got private investment which has been one of the reasons people it 's a completely useless piece of road actually at the moment well but that 's the engineering solution which tells people that they should go down to Bailey Avenue but naturally your instinct is to turn left into victoria street and people get stuck at the light interchange because the lights have been reconfigured for right hand tunes and I 've kind of got my head around finally why we 've got this bottleneck but it will remain a bottleneck until we address what is an instinctive leaf tune from Montreal street but why haven 't you reduced that budget so why is this still amazing 7 million on a ride that has had a third quite appear but Ted the private sector investment and actually we 've got you know it just seems weird that you value engineers tell Victoria Street creeping demanding changes to the air like whole streetscape the improvement I understand there so I 'm talking about work for other priorities for the benefits that you 're going to get which half don 't exist what do we get for stealing millions on you madam chair the the upgrade of victoria street it is part of the 30 k zone whereas the other streets are and so the level of pedestrian footpath enhancement and streetscaping arms little snot people hire there as a consequence of that because we 're expecting higher pedestrian footfall where as is already the case now and so that costs for victoria street there is it all the way down to be leave yeah we can so I feel more daily unit costs there at Montreal 30k its Montreal 30k yes i 'm up to kill more comments like you 're within the within the core but victoria street was an exciting the extension of victoria street is it south 30k limit as if to montreal is but mr. asa centers weird out of the parallel part so we knew instinctively 20 in victoria that will be 30 k 's mantra will be 50 so yes no no not so they know that instinctively to and leave cuz you don 't want to go slower all of a sudden you start saying well i can just stay exactly where I am go up to Billy air below 50 KS and not go through around a nice wasn 't still right because even if you follow the engineered solution you 'd go lift into Billy have you got to get into the next Lane and two stocks to say that you can turn right into pop up and over I mean the whole that the whole concern is that you know that only the games an evaluative do sorry we 're getting to debate you know I don 't worry ask him questions okay fine so what do we get 27 million dollars a similar level of streetscape enhancement to that going in on Colombo street litchfield street at the moment higher grade improvements of being prioritized through the streets and spaces design guide which council is considered a few weeks ago yeah they 're being prioritized around enhanced treatments on streets that are likely to get higher levels of commercial activity of pedestrian Colombo street or higher grade than the footpath improvements on Manchester Street for instance because they 're based upon where the businesses are and where people would expect a higher grade of pedestrian it 's great it 's vicky 's tenure i 'm flaking children and my other questions answer like it an air how 's it going from five million to half a million it 's the only one element of the bus priority it it 's it 's just the bit on higley Avenue not Alan Breck is an Avenue not record and road nothing to do with reckon I 'm road no the accessible ACC program that we consulted on see it was just that rekelen right through the AFA see only goes through that part anyway reckon leave Rick it an edge oh and see it 's five million so it 's for that part this this this probably would be achieved through primarily traffic management changes most of the measures there could be incorporated within existing carriageway into it it 's mainly a case of us consulting traffic changes to achieve a westbound out of then link through to the deans Avenue signals I think we 're part of the river I think what 's missing conveyors i preciate you 've got a lot of this program but we still don 't have the product descriptions as to what the difference says in terms of the sky from what we consulted on which was going to be funded so it 's very hard to give feedback because I don 't know what the impact I mean with heard a little bit you but this is the debate because what we what we what we ask staff to do was to analyze the proposal to remove all of phase 2 3 which is what they 've done they 've come back and they 've said if you want to maintain certain elements then these are the priority areas for doing that so lucky I 'd really like to understand is that that 's missing like but that 's not now there and the impact of that right so the bits that we are you doing yeah what will we notice so the full phase two program another 16 17 million dollars worth of public realm led which would have been unlikely to attract NZTA subsidy the wayfinding figure for instance originally in there was circa seven million what this program contains is what we as Richards just described it we believe with being the nucleus of the transport measures that would need to form part of it like that but he 's asking is what do we miss out on if we go for this model what what is lost I mean think we know that we reduce the funding but what do we lose in terms of the central setting you simply don 't get the full benefit of the program works and that 's the the increase in mode shift that that we 're predicting so you know what accessible city is based on was a three-fold increase in public and active in sport and these works all underpin that if you reduce the program to this you 're unlikely to get there increase and Moe chiefed but we think this is still a good do minimum option that will achieve some of the 're taking 16 or 17 million with public realm what are you not doing what are we not doing well there 's a whole raft of projects that we have to do a comparison for you but what was in the LT draft LTP was a whole raft of projects which we 're just saying well our understanding was that we had to really minimize what those look like so we 'll just pulled a whole lot out we haven 't got those we could get something to you on those there 's going to be a break at morning tea time where various people were going to think about how they might want to construct the debate for this particular subject so if he actually could do a line by line comparison about what was there and what 's gone that would be useful if that could be circulated and if I could provide some overall come to yes well so what we 're talking about here is within the draft long-term plan we had all the phases in in the draft that was in the capital program through discussions we had with councillor they got pushed out within the repro file capital program so they 're from 22 onwards what this debate is talking about today is pulling some of them back to allow for the the bare-bones benefits of that accessible City to give you an idea of what those costs and activities were that up to at a rates percentage term it 's about a third of a percent over four years and the profiling of how that Thurid would would turn out depends on aspects such as whether kill more would be delayed for a couple of years and what it necessarily start next year but you 're talking about those projects at a mid-level once you 've taken an nzta of adding about a third of a percent to rates over four years so that 's just some broad context from your consideration so at the moment if the amendment that phases two and three be removed from the LTP altogether that wouldn 't have an immediate impact on the LTP because it 's been moved out at no time I want to bring delayed until if y22 and beyond three so you probably want the amendment to be considering and pulling some of that work back and such as as in front of the powerpoint prison sentence it 's pulling this this proposal before but then hit from that has a point three percent impact on rates over the four years or what each year adds up to a round about a third of a percent over those four years _"

    "text": "there 's a couple of there 's a couple of there 's a couple of amendments that that I want us to to deal with and and then then I think we should just basically you know sort of bring it into today and come back in the morning what having reviewed staff advice and and thought about some of the amendments that have been proposed and light of some of the discussion that we 've had today for example the the changes that I 've made to the phase program of capital release that might mean that people would like to have a look at the wording of the particular amendments and light of the change that I proposed and the other thing is that because some of the proposals drill into individual projects on the land drainage recovery program i 'm asking i 've asked Carlene if she could have range for staff to do a quick you know five minute presentation at the beginning of that one so that we can actually drill unto the issues around individual projects because i know that we 're going to new financial year on the whole of the land drainage recovery program in it and that will help us i think make some good decisions on that particular matter so the two issues that seem to sort of spring to attention because i discussed them with a couple of people were the question on energy efficiency the money that wasn 't spent in this year 's in this financial year the 35,000 should be carried forward and to the next year of the budget and the other ones in relation to the banks peninsula walking tracks which is at the bottom will sicken to the bottom of the same page as the submissions on energy efficiency which is page three and and the bank 's financial walking tricks one doesn 't have any financial implications that 's the support for the spine a blizzard network so if we could the gun what a energy efficiency one nothing 30 you 'd like to move that with someone like to second that carry Ford and Pauline Kotter Vicki this was money that was approved in the activity management plan time in relation the conversion to electric vehicles unfortunately the work hasn 't been done this year but it is scheduled to start very shortly in their new year it 's really important to carry it forward obviously from christchurch 's point of view sixty percent of our fossil fuels are used in trends and transport and we 've had a lot of submissions on energy efficiency clean energy and on all sorts of things that we haven 't actually reacted to apart from doing during some of this book oh it 's just a carry food from the last year to this that says does anyone want to speak against that Oh a question yeah no questions fine sorry how many cars have we got all in a fleet of vehicles 350 it was just there was an interesting suggestion ash on the weekend about the whole of government and I wanted actually would you know in local government how many vehicles there are across the local government flick yes 5,000 10,000 I 'll just give you the standard answer we used to give the side there and it 's hate oh it 's on the social yeah yeah hokey eco so facilitating their discussion around a sort of a high street a whole-of-government fleet of which electrics are a key part of it we 're giving your volume in discussions with given crutches but it 's cool if you bought 20,000 cars nationally that would be a huge bit what they would be me sir France and the other way in which we could do it rip is through our join companies as well yeah and of course the other aspect of that is working with a number of providers around the delivery of charging points it 's been papered and quite a bit of interest from the marketplace makes you delivering Sonny and actually an offer to have them come in to Christchurch at very little or no cost so those are the things that it becomes really important to get this sorted and actually starting so we are playing the liquid phone we aren 't trained but yes very good um Yanni chick I think it was a calf a meeting this morning so we 've got the carbon because the other thing that came up with or is a need for this money as their energy efficiency measures that they eat character to our social I 'm sorry merely any reaction are doing to social housing units and it was just kind of we 're carrying forward money we 've got a program that needs money it 's all ready to go and it 's helping deal with a immediate problem in winter oh yeah well I don 't know it 's cafe money or this money but can woods those social housing community energy action improvements what is this going to be take for something specific and for taking some leadership on electric vehicles largely that 's what we tagged it for for the social housing the insulation which is what we 're community injection have been very active is absolutely imperative when we reprioritize the insulation of our existing units yeah just has to happen yep from the housing fund wherever okay so that 's a different thing so I 'm dealing is in the response that I got back around the parking we looking erase of government approach it 's not just a case of us buying more cars or is it kind of a case of car sharing so that you 've got these expensive assets but we don 't need as many of them so that we can you buy ization from overall principle arrangement lives the overall feet across a number of providers just don 't sell them internally no sorry or make them disappear off the books will billion oppose a little reduction of fleet size across a range of department and then using technology to pay for you to increase the efficiency and rated use of them you know I 'm asking something slightly different which is you have the Justice emergency prison for example but has no car parking but they 've probably got their own cars apart are we looking at it all or governor approach in terms of having you know 300 cars sitting in the central city they realized you know twenty five percent of the time versus say 150 cars being used 50 or 75 percent the time that doesn 't matter it 's counsel than I love to share a police car it is how all these governments are coming back into town and then right okay that 's great okay but also to think about delivering cards differently so travel so using sort of like not texts but so the Texas is that people actually join vehicles rather than eat give individuals taking vehicles in a whole range of options being looked at so some of speed skaters through the style is user-friendly but it 's all about reducing overall cleat demand and X amaizing technology to make some I 've utilization yeah it 's a great great concept I think it 's excellent good all right so i will put that motion in all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's Carrie and another one a joyful one here I 'm sure that Andrew would like to move this and who would like to sicken the spine of the lover lizard Paul Andrey great thank you very much indeed and this is one of my favorite projects and I 'm really pleased to put this amendment you may submissions period but the broad vision of the spine of the lizard project is to develop the network of trails linking the banks peninsula lee banks peninsula Valley communities and the summit walkway from Gabi 's past a hilltop into a cohesive and well-managed recreational asset and there are aspects here of recreation environmental education and an easy opportunity for urban people to be introduced tramping in what is essentially a part of our local environment the upgrade of the summit walkway from Gabi 's best pastor hilltop essentially links the two craters of banks peninsula so links lyttelton harbour with a corolla harbor and has involved a partnership between the Department of Conservation drod Donald trust and private landowners positive outcomes so far have been a major clearing of gorse from the tracks development of the new rod Donald hot at waipuna saddle above little river and dock working on this sign of the packhorse so there are now two Hut 's up there along the track that allow for a multi-day tramping experience within very easy drive of christchurch so essentially this is a track not only linking of conservation reserves as I say in partnership between the rod Donald banks peninsula trust the Department of Conservation and private landowners there are no financial implications to this amendment all we 're doing is simply asking for council support of this project so that it can for example be added to the network network of traps tracks that are on the council 's website so the city council logo logo can be used on collateral and so that council resources can be used in its development so no financial implications and I hope all councillors would agree a good outcome that 's essentially a metropolitan project that allows for increased recreational opportunities on insulin sorry all those in favor say aye there 's a person no that 's carried now I 've just noticed that there 's a couple of little ones that we could just probably deal with quickly on the first page and store additional rubbish recycling bins by the Summoner lifeboat buildings I know that the is not really the you know like ltp stuff but it 's probably rats and mice but sometimes these irritants a minor increase in operational cost of services so I 'm happy to accept that as an amendment Jana you want to move that and second dad Paul just ask because in this whole um you know this great decision about the town hall and sustainability we had all these recycling waste stations that were put in for the Rugby World Cup and the central city there 's like three on every street corner and I just wondered whether we 've looked at re-circulating those or maybe the ones from the red zone into these areas so it 's kind of a sustainable use so I don 't know where the staff can give a response but you know it 's a pretty small thing yeah I don 't know what capacity we have to provide new guns I know philosophically there was of you previously that we should remove rubbish bones and people totally rubbish with them but that hasn 't really been very successful in some of these areas and we 've now got a rat problem and Sumner as well so yeah well I mean I think 're quite often there as a there is an appropriate response which is not to provide rubbish plans but to have signs there that simply say don 't bring your rubbish with you take it with you when you go or don 't yeah but the point is is that in some areas that is extremely effective because people actually you know provide I mean if the if an area is well cared for then you 're not going to be the first person to leave rubbish there you know if you 're there for a family pack no so there are different views on it but the thing is is that it 's a small increase in operational costs it 's perfectly acceptable within the budget that we 've got and we should just get on and we look at recirculating or repurposing I 'm sure that they will look at repurposing yep and Paul you you 're a seconder on that i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and if we tune over the page in Abel all heard that passionate plea the recommendation from counselors to review the curbside collection services for businesses and high-density residential developments within four Avenue suburban malls and high-density developments we 're curbside collection is not practicable with a view to recommending a system which aligns with the services provided across the city and provides a workable solution for all parties I think that 's a fair enough recommendation condition is actually doing the opposite of what what what we 're asking for side there 's two issues in the central city there 's the new intensive housing developments that don 't want to pay the delivery because they 've got an alternative system and they can 't see why they should have to contribute and then there 's the residential the new residential that 's been built there is an residential zones that has probably insurance on welcome commercial periphery so this one has killed more cambridge terrace so because i think the entrance is out in one direction they 're not on the map of the contractor for collection so what we want is and i mean we can that we have a residential zone properties within that should should have access to these services so reviewing it to where it 's not practical and recommending a system which are lines i mean i don 't know it just it 's a lot of complication i think for a pretty simple things so i don 't know whether you just want to fix us one specific property now I mean d but I 'm accepting the accepting the proposal which is that we enable curbside Byrne collection with on central city residential zones so that 's an enabling thing and so staff will come back to us what the with the actual proposal but we 're enabling it we want that to happen is it but how how long is it going to take we 've said workable sort of artists and that means that are different they 're so the intent is to solve the problem that you 've raised but if there 's a an individual one you wanted to talk to me but there was more than one problem it wasn 't just residential it was more than one issue but we want to a new enable curbside collection within central city residential zones which you 'll highlighted the staff recommendation sits alongside that and I think that 's good enough yeah so do you want to move that and pull I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried very good so I 'm yeah we 're going to have to it 's not yeah I just can we deal with that tomorrow because I 'm we 're going to need some you know sort of a calculator run on some of these extra money that 's been put on budget huge you stood it 's extra going on the budget this is not a reallocation within the budget so it 's slightly different some becomes a line item so it could actually come out of the existing grants funding it 's just that it 's got its own line so it doesn 't go through this annual contest model today we 've talked to prior to the sweet talk about why knowing the environment and etc and the best way to sorted out as to teach young and get those really good habits starting young the enviros schools system i 've been involved with both my children 's with preschools and primary skills and the habits that are formed in the black male those children put on the appearance and grandparents and impose to raise the awareness of what you can do and what you should do is absolutely priceless and i think that is probably one of the best programs getting that and those habits spread around our communities and into later life so I think for thirty thousand dollars this is one of the police investments in the future and our children and our families that we can make so on I would really like to recommend that this has made a line item and not a contestable item where as well that um so you seek and hang up yeah why move to Dallas okay but all the way around but but basically what we did a few years ago is we put aside the environmental groups that made a difference to there 's some work that people these groups do and think of the bank 's when it 's a Conservation Trust although i think there 's autumn Bradley so we recognized the value of that environmental contribution and we thought it was silly every year we spent all this time going through when actually there 's groups that we probably wouldn 't reduce the funding and and there was accountabilities in place and we just thought get rid of the red tape just just get on and do it so you know if it was just like a three-year funding commitment it gives certainty to the people that are delivering the program I think we heard quite compelling from from ek and around you know a number of schools are participating in this read he came apart partial funders but I just endorsed the comment that term made is that when you think about everything we 're doing in terms of encouraging community involvement and engagement and action and on a number of issues and virus skills is a really stunningly successful program and its complementary to a lot of those Kashmir students that came in I think Ketchum has been involved in various schools for almost the duration since it 's been in Christchurch and just look at what the impact that 's having on some of those young people that are coming and talking to us so it 's a small cost it 's a huge benefit and Australia endorse making it non contestable and I 'm happy to take the money out of the grants program so that it 's just it 's not an increase in funding it 's just three years certainty that they can get on and do it well I mean depth that I mean the thing is is that I do and I do support him virus cause I a lot of my schools and my former electorate we 're members of on virus calls and as excellent it 's a fantastic program but we 're doing a review of our whole grant system and I 'm perfectly happy that we override the contestability of this funding for next financial year but I 'd much rather that we actually looked at a contestable and what is so I 'm much rather that we looked at you know whether X amount was going to be allocated to environmental projects or whatever I don 't mind having allocations with within particular budgets is non contestable inside a contestable fun but I just I worry about making this non contestable now before we 've actually finally made the decision I 'd be perfectly happy if we were reinstating the funding provision for enviros schools of thirty thousand dollars from the contestable fund this year you know for the 2015-2016 year and the question of contestability to be decided when we look at the whole of the grants structure that would be my preference yeah all right who took your security for the next season would be great and I 'll support there but i think it just does such good work and it starts at the butter we the kids are the very small asian by the time they start getting into a secondary schooling and we 've started seeing debt and with the families i just think it does it 's one of those cut yeah i guess i personally the energy that people spend flying down making submissions applying for grants actually probably costs you know every time they do it so happy for it to be part of that review around those environmental groups if that 's something that 's happening i just wonder if there 's a compromise that we just give certainty of funding for two years and exit so that they can just get on and do it that we do have an engaged process yeah so that the council reinstate funding for enviros goals of 30,000 per year 2015 16 16 17 and that the issue of contestability be dealt with in the terms of the review hmm yep granted yeah from grant is this is there any government funding for this program well it 's what i want to ask because actually being used they 're actually used to be replicating this job for them yes i look up i mean and i kind of didn 't really want to enter into that part of the debate well well it 's getting late okay it will be meat truce I don 't disagree either take it out of that much when Otis the difference yeah in review obviously looking at what government curriculum through schools I mean we have this problem with swimming education at a community board level and a number of other things as well that we do so I think I don 't think it 's an issue of the contestability of the funding review I think it 's actually a lot wider than that like it 's really a key question of how should counsel fund okay so the council reinstate the funds for environment yeah yeah from the grants phone on me so just leave it at that and but you 're right that 's the wider issue that we 're going to be looking at there because uh yeah yeah I think I might have been part of a government that did fund in various schools which is why I wanted to do a little bit more research on what happened to their because that was changed yep all right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say so i think that will now adjourn it 's four o 'clock and that the last hour of our working day you can all spend going back through the individual amendments that you put forward looking at some of the wording of them and if you 've got any sort of questions that you 'd like to have answered in the morning just if you could flip them through the nickel _"

    "text": "in front of explore can we put develop a and what was the words this I like 360 sorry a cooperative community child cooperative community charter and yeah so it 's both because I think that you still have regulatory arrangements that need to be addressed and I really like the idea of a brokerage so that they don 't have to deal with all of the different departments themselves Jimmy we got into the first paragraph I raced the two precious first one whether the star will feed back to the council second if yes what is the time frame first appeared one well you know because subject to the three per hour times oh yeah well we 've already heard from mine Mike 's already said that if we want to reprioritize that we will reprioritize it we will see pectoral but in terms of time or rainy program so we would take for all the stuff that comes out of the next three days it was in for this yep add that in and show the trade-offs and you can make a final decision at that point well I think I 'll just put that motion okay hey no no we 're doing the amendments as we go yeah yeah so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie excellent good work how are we going 10 23 should we stop for afternoon tea yep I would like to flag the one around the coastal perimeter pathway yeah i think that when Colin murky and his group and other groups to and came to us look there it 's a great idea minimal cost and that the challenge for it though is the area around the the ponds are in dying can you just highlight which one it is so H yo put it forward and I don 't know if it 's in this big list known until it is really it 's got a number 33 beside it somewhere it is cuz I 'm sure to under the yellow I haven 't gotten a yellow on the second-to-last paid but I 'll sorry in plays third page Oh yep so this is you know the one of come to christ church and its really to make sure that in fact we don 't hold back the launching of the perimeter walkway like there are clearly some obstacles with the plan in terms of traffic safety and those things and I know that staff for addressing those but probably the biggest challenge is this area around with the ponds are along dyess pass road the beauty of actually developing the walkway around the coast is that in fact it will link up the the coastal pathway from from sumner right round through to burwood Pegasus area along to the sand dunes na because the whole coast the whole coast so it just seems to me that this will that the staff are clear to on you know what can go in it is going to need a wildlife fence to to protect that the bid good life Thea and to have a site it 'll need the track would need some construction another strength of this program is that row sory for example are already involved in the perimeter pathway and there are groups who are very keen track so I just think that a hundred thousand dollars would be a really good investment there I know it would have to come from another environmental area but I just put that forward to run counts for councillors consideration I 'm going to take her I 'm not going to stop people at the end of the word dies road because I 'm not going to accept without a separate debate allocations from the land drainage recovery program so but we can deal with that yeah when we deal with that so that the staff advice on this is that the sth project is due to have its detailed design completed over the next 18 months so the allocation wouldn 't need to be in this financial year coming is that right I think to get it really going we should look at getting it you know at least well I think before the next and your plan really but but bad know the reason I 'm saying the Easter each project is due to have its detailed design completed over the next 18 months while funding of any to be tested and be part of a larger amount of capital funding required to implement the project but they are fundraising for that project so it 's not something that they 're asking the council to fully fund and the allocation of a hundred thousand dollars i 'm not sure how that compares to what was actually sword well but my real question is this is that if their detailed design has not been completed for another 18 months why can 't we deal with this in the annual plane but indicate that we want this considered as is a priority because it I mean I think it 's really important to I mean I think all of us were impressed with the quality of the work that 's been done we do want to make an allocation but I don 't know that we 're in a position to do there it right the second it may be that we want to contribute more with all of the work actually done well I think the main thing is to get the best out of the project in as design Park could be brought forward from from the 18 months I know staff have got heaps to do and that some of that works challenging but you know this to me is a I guess a priority for the area and I 'd rather we didn 't have to wait okay well can we get an update is there whose whose whose area does this fit with them but who 's actually doing the detailed design Jane being done by the city parks reserves people so say Eric banks is the unit project has been approved in under way for some time so yeah they are moving into detailed design so i think the comment that Eric made when I was responding to this was that the figure that the hundred-thousand-dollar fig was very much a top-of-mind figure for the fencing and there 's no budget for this project here at all right so we 're actually going to have to look at this as part of the whole capital program because it 's actually going to require some money to be some serious money to be put on were around the ponds fill them we did a warfare Rex the bus tour last year in it see that the walkway around the ponds was quite spectacular we 're not I think actually that there I 'm not a safety or traffic expedition as you know Paul but I think the issues are road safety across it that the track would need to cross the diet 's pass road and a safety issues and it 's also a matter of really where the council can kind of like him be responsible for signage for example and apparent even walking along the currently the ponds are fenced and that 's for safety reasons for the public to so while it looks a good idea in fact there were those issues have arisen in actual fact some of the some of the sewage pond area isn 't so a concern about security with the ponds also a notion that there 's a lot of birdlife nest and move in and out of the pond areas and was some concern about sort of the separation between the pathway there are one or separation of the park the circuitry yeah it 's ironic really because it 's I mean the surge treatment ponds and their beautiful you know but it just and I mean the number of tourists you see stopping there and taking photographs that plugs like that you know just they said that food is best looking oxidation ponds in the world but this I need some observation points I think along the way that may may be built in a man sort of like a high oh I do yeah so there are a few considerations there with with the just the operation of the sewage treatment ponds Wow yeah yeah so the history each part is the preferred area and there is a costly there is a possibility that way the woolston walk as well which is very very close today sorry people have got sidetracked on to a conversation Thank You Ellie so I 'm gonna get a chopper guard flag I was just gonna and I 'm not being facetious or trying to be clear about how many footpaths 100,000 go towards helping hearing about the issues want a soapbox on it but it does speak the question is this a nice to have or is this a need and how would people who are injuring themselves on footpaths every a feel about a hundred thousand dollars going to what I think is a nice hair you know I think I 'm answer yeah I mean these things are challenging I don 't oh yeah I don 't know that we want to I mean I just have a feeling that this is going to cost a heck of a lot more than we 're preparing to allocate and we haven 't really got the analysis around it I mean I totally supported that the Syria is very sensible to have a have a pathway through it it just makes absolute sense it actually makes transport sense to for a you know cycling it absolutely does yeah I know I know I know but that 's a bit but that 's a bit of a slip-up that 's a big picture stuff that we 're going to do next year so we 're going right through the today are not they 're not the not set in stone and also they are that they 're in there a statement of intent rather than a statement of what we are actually going to do yes I know I understand that and no but I the thing is as a hundred thousand dollars is not going to build that pathway so I 'm just thinking that we need a lot more work to be done before we actually make this decision yeah but Yanni and then Pauline I have to think this is really important because if you think about what we 're trying to do as a city which is that active recreation to get a sense of connection around a natural environment in our urban environment friend this is actually a really important link have been not numerous issues around this area in the past just to give you one example there 's a whole new rest home that women on Flores road there 's no foot part there 's no footpaths for a brand new wrist home so connecting these walkways is actually really important and get on and get to swoop down and I would support doing it earlier as its coo tubing through humpies drive fixing it and had no provision for any pathway though every month or every 12 months or every year that goes past we lose more opportunity to have a synergy of not spending as much to get the same outcome that we want so I think it 's critical that we get the planning for this area done if there 's a chance to spend a little bit of capital because I know that there are those issues that were raised through that debt walk that we did around security wildlife and access but you know this is an error if you think of Charles worth wetlands as well what a fantastic community asset I think they just last late last year we planted the hundred thousand tree that had been planted by the community and that reserve that just shows you the power of communities being involved and taking what was a pretty desolate area into a real attraction but there are issues with the wildlife in this need to just wait it up but yeah I strongly support doing this this is a this is a small amount of money for I think a huge gain into the vet connectivity tragically it 's not enough um Pauline I don 't know if this is the right time but I 'm just looking at on the shitty part of the community boards submission and you know they 've 10,000 and 117 theft I playground renewal and the borders suggested to fearing this if the playground is still safe um so I 'm wondering if we could just get some more information on that in that thief or perhaps some of the fast maybe not even all of them but some of the funds could come from there if if the staff can give us some more information on that playground because to me that playground seems fine do you know I think what I 'm signaling though is that if anyone and brown this table thanks that 100,000 is enough to put on budget for this project then you 're dreaming absolutely dreaming no what I mean is the path way around the sister each in this part of the whole perimeter walkway where sit which circumvents the whole city so that it 's to make sure we get this beautiful part done as soon as possible rather than delay with the no promise of fencing I know it would mean that the money the main money really is around the fencing I already alluded clearly to some very keen community groups and they put their money where their mouth as they 've done a lot already including the row 0 3 okay and in fact make developing the pathway is something where you get community leveraging but like the the time being scheme and end the community are very keen to actually see this there 's lots of walking groups and I think I 'd be up there myself with the Spade forming the part that it 's a pathway for people to walk on that part should be straightforward it 's a fencing that will take the money just around this perimeter we get more informational yeah before we because I I think we will so would put a hundred thousand dollars on for the pathway if the community was able to fund the fence you know like I mean am i hearing a bit of a neighborhood matching kind of approach to this because I mean there 's no point putting money on the budget for the pathway if you can 't use the pathway without a fence is that a might have I got that wrong well it 's it 's sort of chicken egg for that area but I mean the community the community 's funding or in its nature what comes through the 3d of voluntary work there 's a contribution they would make its yeah I love doll you know that we need to actually approve this now no we don 't we will get some further information Leggett for something that we want to advance and we 'll deal with it tomorrow so it 'll give time to gather all of the information that we need for it so how are we going where after three o 'clock so we 'll stop for afternoon tea and we 'll come back at three thirty thank you you _"

    "text": "for the end of the year before the end of before well we 'll make it by December one by the beginning of december or by the end of november there go my last offer so the initial report back to be completed by the end of november so go that the council requests an under pendant report by the end of november yep alright so that 's i 'm happy to include all of that and my recommendation so we don 't need to move an amendment is it all right all good okay right next one how are we going four times up Senate we know we don 't need to because it 's going into into my amendment oh right okay right we 've got to find another one to do now right yes the community carrots yeah it 's easy did you nominate that yeah it 's in there yeah we 're about what page I think Mike buried it somewhere on the backpack good is it the back page yeah are maybe the secret map yeah so the council approved the allocation of i would on a new community currency oh yes yep right oh i didn 't_''_100.2 i didn 't see that didn 't let that one by me okay that the staff advices that there 's currently no funding for such an investigation funding could be prioritized from the long-term city and community planning budget but this is already fully committed well we 're just at it I mean it probably would come another biscuit budget I reckon but Sir we have to take something off okay we 'll find something to any I mean it 's less than a thousand possibly we 'll find time to take off it 's it 's the right answer it 's me that the reason I mean I 've put a lot of the work has been done and there 's a lot of expertise around in the city and around in New Zealand on this subject and we also have easy access to some of the best people in the world around this issue so I don 't think it 's going to cost a lot of money but you know you 've got to why I believe this is so it may not cost a lot of money at all but I think we need a formal process because this you know does need a little bit of design consideration yep I mean just in general I stitt before and obviously people have come and presented but you know there 's hundreds of community currencies all around the world we 've got the bristol and Brixton pound in the UK we 've got the BerkShares and Ithaca dollars in the States this Bitcoin of course which is a cryptocurrency which is another community style currency which some places like the Isle of Man are now taking paying taxes and what makes them you basically anyone can create a currency the only issue is whether somebody will take it in payment frugal and of course when you take it a pair of taxes with a local government or central government that gives it credibility and sound packing so I think for us it 's an issue around monetary sovereignty from a bigger perspective which i think is important it 's a resilient story and certainly and it boosts local economic activities I think it 's a win-win and I think it 's something that we should look at that puzzle anyone opposed to us um I 'm not proposed I 've just got some questions around the process like it especially because there 's a lot of information available a bit like the new brighton my name anyways what why wouldn 't we actually asked for a staff report first before in fact we then proceeded to spend the twenty five to twenty five thousand dollars on a feasibility study i guess it would come into the council processes there would be a staff report on this anyway but I I sublime support of the concept but I think it should be prefaced by seeking a staff report yeah I think that 's an unnecessary expense I mean it 's pretty well established as an idea our I 'll sure and no offense to staff whether there 's any actually there is somebody on staff who has more experience in this area but it doesn 't work in the planning department yeah there is actually need but I don 't think we need a staff report to say oh this is a good idea to get a report done we might as well just get on with it now the people we have questions because it 's obviously people have got a few questions um right Yanni and then Paul then Andrew so as part of our activities management plan we raised the need to have capacity within our strategic thinking and planning units to respond to things that came up so I 'm really concerned to hear that we have no capacity to do this there 's a number of outstanding things on the existing work program that aren 't being done that I would also like done so can I just check you know given what we expressed through the activity management plan what 's peer level of resource we have to respond to these things as they come up through the year or through this process because my understanding is we 'd asked specifically for a budget to address these sorts of things and we food from staff now that we don and community planning budget that was specific they mentioned on the staff advice on this so I don 't know whether any pools of beer money there 's a whole program but its counsel of choice if it prioritizes us over another piece of work we all come back my thinking was out of this process because there were a number of suggestions new investigations we would load that in come back and have a debate of counsel and say this is what you want with the lgp this is what should drop out here is that decision you want to make and I mean it 's been the normal process most years and that 's how we do it this time and that 's why the two budgets have not run in parallel was that right because you 've always you sort of don 't seem to they 're not connected because you 've got to wait till we 've made all the lgp decisions about priorities and then you come back to us with a reject yeah because they 're essentially a body of money to spend in a prioritization exercise of the council this is probably your key prioritization meeting yeah for the year and we 'll come back to you and say well on the basis of that this is what needs to give might be having another key prioritization meeting after the first of July 's well we couldn 't and it may take you to the point where in fact we just can 't do everything and which I think it will be the reality with us money or resort Hills come into the process so if I want to work done on stuff you 're saying I should put 25 grand or some money on budget to get that work done no no no what he 's saying is that is that people have moved amendments around a variety of different things that they want studies done on and I think that what what Mike saying is that we have to meet after the event after we 've set these priorities and we have to go through what we previously agreed with priorities and take things off but what we 're doing here of other ones and I just want to just make sure I 've got the process right because I get to the end of it and then realize that we 've done up the wrong way we should be because we 've got no capacity we should be adding funding on to do this village so if you take the new brighton you know the tree of extensions in your brighton for example we just need to be aware that if we 're going to agree to that there 's a course it might not be 25 grand but should that 's what I 'm trying to understand it should we be putting a cost associated at each of those or do and from what I 'm hearing bounces yes but I just want to check because I 'll rework some of those amendments overnight to cater for that well i don 't i don 't know that the it 's the question of allocating funding for it in some respects that the cost miss instant is a bit of a red hearing because either either you 're going to i 'm not hearing me by saying at which point if you 're going to add new money then the cost is fine if you 're going to say we want this as a priority come back and tell us how your program can be adjusted to meet this priority then we 're still trying to do other than the existing frame with the cost that we 've got well I 've been wondering that myself quite some time yani know that the outcome that we had reflected through there has been incorporated into this document yeah the problem is is that the activity management plan proceeds I mean you know it may be you know something that you 're used to having saved three tunes on the council but I mean it was a mystery to me how we ended up with things that got through that process that simply you know escaped the attention of different counselors because the truth was was that it wasn 't a very good process but this area didn 't go through as I remember it doesn 't go through the activity management went through the priorities yeah second round I 'm just assuming that this is 25 curves finding um as it would it not be that CDC should be in a better position to do this work and that we fund them to provide kind of Economic Development Community Development tight advice nice as that might be so I don 't think that if we suddenly turned around and said to see you see we 'd like you to do this they 'd probably come back to us and say yes but we 'd like X number of thousand dollars to do that and as I 've been fall out of that we can follow up on that Paul once the question more around the introduction of a new currency and I 'm just wanting to know is the ability to capture some of the large spin the council it does spend each year through this new currency and capturing the large spin that we 're happening through the earthquake venture of forty billion dollars as they 're able captured are we able to use that you can see all that 's a there 's a potential to capture quite a large amount of money I think that 's the whole point of a studies I mean we 're well aware of how local currencies operate added like a little turn level Brighton or some door whatever whether we can scale it up into citywide currencies is work that we need to do so that is the project littleton technically as an alternative currency you know it 's complementary currency is that where the currency those time and it 's matched your not paid a different rate depending on how qualified you are you match time for time and so it I mean so in that sense it 's a complementary currency we 've been invited to join there and I think as part of this process we could look at whether we could join that and and then the quick next question is can you Scout up to cross the whole city well that 's a question that needs a little bit more work done for us and I think that 's what rests refs raising Andrew yeah that brings was wanting to make which is this quite possibly does tie in beautifully with the suggestion from migrant Jefferies that the council should become a member of the builtin time bank clearly there 's a synergy between time banking complimentary complementary currency and Tim Taylor who was the submitter that came along and put this issue on the table for us through his submission is in fact board member a project littleton so there there is some some synergy there and i mean i 'm quite familiar with conversations that have happened around again particularly in littleton a community currency for on on a suburban level i guess or in lyttelton harbour level and one of the questions I had for ref was around the the scope of this that the UF had as part of your vision and clearly you 're thinking citywide and I 'm thinking that citywide would then be including the peninsula and some of those small communities as well which is great but my other question was you know and obviously if we were to do this studding there would be some outcomes that we terms of you know catalyzing parts of our and local economy what sort of social outcomes would you expect to to get from this that 's a good question I mean one is about actually boosting interactions within a community so I 'll go about you know doing rates offsets for people doing work in the community I mean I had a lot of a lot of feedback generally from you know more elderly men who were thinking like get the lawnmower out and get stuck you know I 'm doing I 'm looking after this piece of grass or whatever because no one comes to mow so it actually enables you know that section of the community to get out and be a little bit more connected because there 's actually a two-way relationship there so it actually brings them out of that hmm social interaction and you know just yeah gets people you know interacting a lot more with each other and with actually their local community and their local economy as well hmm so actually that ties in beautifully with the submission that we had about littleton agreement ref whether we should tie the two together in this amendment so that we can be working with the Littleton time bank become a member learn more about time banking learn more about trading time and trading alternative currency within and I mean I 'm guessing the scope of this piece of work would determine whether it was certain local communities or whether it was citywide that was the the best way for this to work and where the opportunities were and it may be that there 's already work been done or work going on where there would be a good starting point for expansion yeah we 're the oral agreement if we can put something in here about the membership the Littleton time bank I think to pull the two together would be great can 't_''_950.769 even extend it when you 're looking at the whole kind of jetty stuff again it 's you know how can people get involved to do stuff in the community and link it in with kind of a you know local economy and local rating system and the rest of it reminded me of something that that I think really did come through the submissions process as well and that is that when you when you partner with the council as opposed to have the council doing things for you then you end up in a regulatory environment which can be a bit of a nightmare and one of the things one of the great things that came out of the earthquake was all of the stuff that 's happening in vacant spaces you know so the get fuller and the feasts are and all all of the different things you know greening the rubble that it 's happening there and so the council helped establish an organization that really has become a broker life and vacant spaces and I actually encourage people to have a look on their website because the mechanism for being the broker between the landowner and the regulatory authority has been a superb model and I ask myself whether in fact if with a bit of creative thinking and a bit of a conversation with life and vacant spaces whether it 's remit could move to if the organization could become the broker for things like health and safety and employment act issues for transport management plans I mean how many people have we had you know sort of put off by running a community event because of the cost of a transport plane that they have to do the health and safety transport there 's one other two as well there 's but there 's so there 's all these different things that can arise in the context of the regulatory arrangement with the organization that would provide it itself otherwise and so having a broker to actually work through all of those issues and ensure that not that not that people were you know I mean the irony that I keep pointing out is that the these are people offering to do things that they 're perfectly legally allowed to do on their own property but then not allowed to do it because it 's on public property with public use and actually disclosure isn 't sufficient to protect the public use it is it is sufficient to protect you know people volunteering to but it 's not sufficient for protecting the public who might use the GT afterwards and the only way that we can protect against that is by making sure that there are proper checks and balance in place to make sure that the work has done properly so that we can stand by I mean the legislative response to cave creek was the health and safety unemployment requirements in this regard and you know in that particular case and we should remember that there were you know people who died as a result of workmanship that wasn 't properly supervised the bolts weren 't put under it and people thought they could rely on a public platform and it wasn 't reliable so as long as we had the checks and balances in place there 'd be no reason why the community couldn 't join and the rebuild of the GT not just the the car park as just using that as an example but to have a broker that would be able to step in that place so there was a very long way of me saying that there as well Paul and then fell it 's a bit like the briefing we hit on philanthropic funding often people don 't want to actually partner with the regulatory body I 'd rather do it through other funders who actually yeah you know what to be a part of us so having that broker that actually works with the community as an interface to us as the urgency body is probably a very good one and but I think also with the community funding and will the new currency model there is an opportunity to perhaps have some sort of like but like a bank levy that can actually then be gathered as an extra source of income to actually fund more stuff so it 's there 's an opportunity to create two other other streams out of this time banking or alternative currencies you can see a lot of lot of benefits around it yeah I 'm Phil and I just what I know that little time being sort of found at the time banking thing and Christchurch and full maximum Eddington I 'm timing was soon out of of volunteers so I 'd like via systems included and how we do this so if that could be added um any time being and um using look time because I haven 't invited us to join so we have to think I 'm already a card-carrying but yeah anyway but my other point really too is I just want to make sure we actually do get this process right like it is just twenty five thousand dollars but we we have to watch I guess every dollar and I know ref will be an agree with that so I just wondered in fact too because there isn 't any other kind of like product area which we are subjects and effects substituting for if we add into this decision there it would be subject to a reprioritization of that long term city in any budget just a parity ya know we can we can do that so but I just wonder whether just picking up on your point that because I I mean I don 't actually know what the implications are becoming a member of the Littleton time people i don 't know i don 't know how it would work so you tell me like Simon remembers I assure you yes oh no why don 't why don 't we that the council well why don 't we just explore ways of using the TimeBank movement to deliver so I mean acknowledging the invitation from littleton time being explore ways of using the TimeBank movement to deliver social and community outcomes in the relationship between time banking and a complementary community currency so that that way you know but we 're just acknowledging that it was the offer came from littleton and we will now explore ways but i wonder if I may be so bold to add exploring the with life and vacant spaces the concept of life and public realm as a mechanism for developing a brokerage to support communities developing their own public realm spaces so yeah but so but we 're happy to put that the allocation comes from a reprioritization within the budget okay so is there a way of getting around a report because we don 't need a report we budget yeah I guess my view on this is good financial management and reports go together and I say that is one of the second line for sealing councillors I mean I still think we need it 's not saying that we 're all the third most loved the rest of us that immediate sorts of implications and different angle even if you are reprioritizing I still think it needs some substance behind I think we 've now expanded it to deliver on a whole lot of other things that i think would would would justify i mean is that this is the direction that we really got from the submissions if this is what I came here for not the other stuff I just want to I just want to but the stuff that I know I won 't go there anyway it 's it 's not a reprioritization within the plan it 's a reprioritization within that budget it 's a planning budgeting yeah can I can I just make a point to be out there please just as long as we as a counselors are clear that clear on in fact would have to we 'll have to drop off yeah so we don 't even know what that is yet though but when its decision and I guess in terms of Glenn 's point I thoroughly support it however I 'm not too sure about the process in making a decision which you know clearly is a good idea and has got a lot going for the specially in terms of council processes but we 're not clear at all in terms of what we 're taking away from in fact what we 'd also probably like to be what does it have to have a dollar figure on it ref to read if we 're making it subject to reprioritization from within the community planning budget we make the decision about what as being reprioritized yep so just take the dollars out approve I don 't mind putting extra money on this cleaning budget to do the things that we 're asking staff to do what I 'm really worried about is what happened with the Levi 's skate park which seventy thousand dollars from taken off and put into a public consultation for one small local facility 70,000 today let 's work that 's not happening stop at that decision we didn 't know about it it 's happened but it seems to me that it creates an issue around things we expect to happen suddenly being reprioritized to meet new demands that come into the system so I 'd much rather but no problem I think this is a great idea great initiative leads put some money on budget and do it properly rather than try and cut something that we don 't even know that could you know who knows whose area that will come out of but it just seems to me that um I thought we had to speak capacity we 've been told we don 't seems to me the big issue here is that we need money so we can do that interesting creative thought provoking stuff that we all want to get on and get done rather than have to pedal about every time getting you know more reports and all this other stuff I would really budget I look I know a lot more about what 's in that budget then I did 12 months ago when we when we looked at at the first time so it 's a you know I 'd much rather do that first there 's nothing to stop us from putting more money on the budget if we need to as a result of that reprioritization exercise so I mean I kind of want to keep repeating that this is the base case budget we don 't need to see this as the end of the line this is the beginning of a process that will expand right the way through next year but the annual plan process will enable us to do that and we can put more money on the budget during the course of the the year can we add this food League to the treble which is that the council explore with life and vacant spaces thats all kept at all yeah the concept of community brokerage for public realm and I 'll just leave it at that yep David sort of i 'll use an pack down to quell stadium area 1,000 handful of playground equipment but it couldn 't be done because an expert in the location last trance that you 're promoting looking at sort of setting up a division within council where we can assist the community to do these things providing the health and safety for the technical bits and pieces that they can these we 're trying to what I 'm getting out we 're trying to empower the community to do things in many respects they 're going to come up against health and safety nein regulations what I thought you might be alluding to here maybe you 're not but that 's something that needs addressed anyway as hell around the how do we differ in these big tape type of things that it can be doing some of us work yeah the answer the answer to your original question is yes except not a department with them counsel it 's actually using an existing community organization to explore the concept of taking up that community brokerage role and it 's look it 's very easy to talk people died when that platform was not built properly and so you do need to have proper regulations and place but there are different ways that you can achieve that level of safety and security when the public has to be able to rely on it being safe so that was the point that I was making is that sometimes we regulate and government and response to something bad that 's happened and you know I studied law and the first principle that we got taught us hard cases make bad law and it 's almost like you need to have a breathing space after something bad happens in order to make sure that what you do is not an overreaction to what 's occurred but actually as a sensible reaction to ensure that the best steps are taken to reduce risk recognizing that we cannot remove risk and sometimes we transfer a risk to ourselves and thereby I believe undermine the concept of community responsibility so yes the answer to your question is I think we should be setting up a mechanism whereby the community can deal with an and it 's not unlike partnership approvals which has been set up on our building consents area where by they don 't just look at what the council provides they actually look at what is required from fire for our he can from heritage licensing and liquor licensing you know so they actually look across the the whole realm of regulatory interventions regardless of who 's responsible and brings them all together and if life and vacant spaces were able to actually pick up that idea of of public realm and how the community could find that much more accessible without facing all of the regulatory barriers themselves I think that would be a good thing so the example I just gave then that if you could pick up the playground and just engage with a brokerage to get someone down to make sure that it 's is Greg Fischer no no I the brokerage that so it was life and vacant spaces what they would do is they would work out what all the regulatory requirements were and that they would make sure that they were resolved so that the whole range of regulatory interfaces they would then end up with a recommendation as to how to proceed and it 's all done by agreement and life and vacant spaces it 's a very good model anyway yani and then Jimmy I suggest that we also i 'm set up a new ccc the community cooperative charter so that we actually have a framework because we 've got we 've got I mean everyone every Ward will have this same want to go and get involved but we do let a kind of charter of how that process will work and I think it 's good to have you know a bit of a guidance around that so that people can be really clear because it has been some of the NGO sector has asked for privacy and I think it was work done many years ago around it just how we work collaboratively with our community is actually a really important thing that 's come through and some of the solutions were actually some good stuff is already happening but there 's some opportunities as well particularly around a frame to say that _"

    "text": "up to whatever 200,000 or whatever is appropriate I 'm not going to fill in that gap and that this be actioned after a report in eight weeks did you see you 're okay with it really I 'd rather that I mean we can make an amendment after the fact in terms of the LTP at any time so I just think that I think it would be wrong to try and settle an amount because it 's busy when you 're going out to ask how much it would cost it was I don 't know but the particular school that I went to said that putting an amount on a budget actually just sets the minimum that you 're going to get charged and so I would rather that we ask for that report back but within eight weeks so that the council 's on a position to make a decision and and that way we can get all of the detail that we need Paul this want some clarification are we going to be clean the stone as well no no that that they are taken that right yeah yeah so so if council Iskander and goth are okay that the council urgently provide advice on the costs of removal clearance and storage of the pseudonym church remains and and the is that what the future use the proposed future use of the site yeah I didn 't knows that yeah that the council work with the pseudonym trust what is it said I 'm Church trust who should hear such trust the cinema church heritage trust to urgently provide a bus and the cost of the removal clearance and storage of the cinema church remains and end and also provide advice on the proposed future use of the site because that was something that they were supposed to be looking at before but I think they 've got stuck because they 've they 've got stuck with that weirdest bestest and nothing 's mode ever since so feel it can 't do one without the other and report back to us in report report back to the council and eight weeks so what 's it by the end of July so right no by the a month yes by the end of august and i just don 't put eight weeks by the end of august so and can you change the first council to the woods staff that start I 'll take out that yep put staff that staff wit with the symptom church heritage trust to urgently provide advice on the cost of the removal clearance and storage of the cinema church remains and also provide advice on the proposed future use of the site and report back to the council by the end of august 2015 alright so we 're all good with that I 'll put the motion or may I confirm you know we 've already had the one contributor and they said only someone 's going to speak against that motion oh it falls in between real oh is it yeah i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and thank you in for coming down at such short notice and for providing such good good support thank you there was a great insurance yeah take a report on current maintenance legal service for earthquake damaged areas that you 're gonna run out of but it seems pretty general and not very specific so perhaps if you could just indicate to us what you 're trying to get to and and we 'll see if we can we can develop a resolution that would be a useful contribution to that or don 't you think we can measure is quite damaged areas in terms of the damages measured by skirt they always used to provide reports by Ward and the previous council tomb this is for some reason no longer provided so monthly we would receive award breakdown of projects specific projects and associated budgets it 's pretty obviously most of the damages in the city the wards and that sequence are billed Pegasus followed by a Kaffir ameed followed by shooting papanui that has always been the measured the measured areas of damage by skirt look at and in many of those cases the levels of service are attached to them I 'm going to actually talk about you brighten because there is a my viewers that we need to be seen to there is quite damage there there are three contracts that surround that mall precinct them all itself Marine Parade and then the beach which is actually administered by us although it 's actually crown domain there is dissatisfaction we need to have it and span I noticed a staff comment that it might have budget implications it doesn 't have to it 's actually about performance of these contracts and his pool Council poor lonsdale said before sometimes squeezing these to actually get better performance so it doesn 't necessarily have to cost or we just want a good quality job done so i would like the city who doesn 't necessarily have to have budget implications but it i think it 's about performance of the contracts there 's a lot of dissatisfaction over the state of the mall but all the council 's doing but we have to do well what is our domain and that 's why I 'm support pushing this forward yeah I 'm I kind of get weird coming from but I don 't know could just deal with it a ordinary council meeting yum and it doesn 't need to go through the long term plan to happen what you are actually asking for is regular reporting on on maintenance levels levels of service that have you know in areas where where there has been a particular impact in relation to the earthquake because actually I mean all of Christ Church has been damaged by the earthquake but there are parts that are more damage than others and and actually if you lived in little turn to be left off that loss would have been a bit you know sort of you know concerning because I mean there are different parts of each ward there are particularly impacted some more than others depending on whether for example there have been other MPs but anyway the thing that you 're trying to achieve here is a regular reporting so that you can monitor but the monitoring really has to be done by the appropriate committee rather than by the council as a whole and that 's something that and this particular instance maintenance levels would wondering I 'm just trying to catch the eye of councillor Clearwater as to whether this is an appropriate reporting headline for your committee yeah so so I 'm just wondering because I mean I mean you mentioned the new brighton one but I just you know back in the day and it wasn 't_''_507.32 that long ago the Business Association used to pace money to to to clean up the mall every Monday morning and you know that was that was just standard practice and I 'm and when he retired he wasn 't replaced so there are you know and something that I want to have happen but it 's not something to move through this plan but it is something that I want to propose as a in new york city there called Business Improvement Districts and basically they sell freight for everything that they want to do that 's on top of what the council provides us the minimum they provide on top of and whether it 's to beautify or whether it 's to provide security or whether it 's to put in a cycle is a business community and the local neighborhood they decide for themselves and they rate themselves the council distributes the money back to them they collect it for them and distribute it back to them Birds they 're called Business Improvement Districts and that 's the sort of approach they 're coming back to that whole concept of working and partnership with our communities that 's something I want to explore and maintenance levels of service you know a part of how you get the whole community involved in monitoring performance in feeding back in a meaningful way because honestly if the council does it for the community they will never see this as something that they can actually aid so much more value to you know you know I just remember one photograph of a burn that was overflowing which was our fault that it was over flying because it hadn 't been empty no one blamed the person that kept putting rubbish and after it was already full yes I great the buck stops with the council so yes Mellie toilets overflowing rubbish bins we 've got to is our stuff in HD you could get a bot is it is or is it a joint responsibility I 'm and it 's that 's what I want us to promote but if part of that is better washing on maintenance and a better looting system were than the public you know so that they 're able to report which is certainly something that carlene 's working on then then you know we 'll get a lot further so but I just don 't think that this amendment kind of captures the sense of what you 're trying to achieve that the council seek a report on current maintenance levels of service for earthquake damaged areas right yep you know can I just suggest on this one that we look at reporting through your committee fill in terms of how the contracts are being met and if there is any areas that need improvement on a more practical note because we heard so often from people particularly in the East right through the East that they were about maintenance level Helene and Jane and Andrew have been working on help bring those up a bit so that in conjunction with a range of organizations in the community so that will be it is planned for this but just in terms of the general the general stuff I think a regular report through those committee that not just deals with brightening that deals with any maintenance issues can I put this one on hold there 's a number of amendments that are basically reporting amendments that are better that are not the good kind of issues of substance that we need to be debating as such because that there are kind of like you know sort of like everyone agrees that they should be there but it 's let 's try and structure all of those and I 'll I 'll do some work on that overnight and we 'll see if we can block all of those together and pass a single resolution about the nature of the reporting that we want going forward so yeah I don 't think it will be problematic I mean we also need to mindful of the service contracts changes on the first the new service contract and the initial stages of it but they 've also in terms of real power but in terms of parks and stuff like that that 's going that 's going to be a lot more focus on the community board so the community board is going to be meeting with the contractor on a regular basis as I understand it from the report that we received so but anyway I just don 't think that we 're going to move on this one at this stage if we 're going to come back to this can we please not only make it earthquake damaged areas I agree we agree I agree yani this is one that I actually put forward because I 've heard this for at least three years now and the problem is that people are told that we haven 't changed the levels of service but people know on the ground the levels of service have been changed dramatically so what now pain and being rated for is not a liberal service they 're getting in these communities and that 's what 's is that there were decisions made that we would not do maintenance in areas like some Lightning Brighton where there was earthquake damage until that earthquake damage was first given that those areas are going to take a lot longer fix now because of the other stuff that 's going on it seems prudent to me to actually understand what is the current maintenance level because this is a budget issue there 's no money on budget to do our maintenance at the best of times post-earthquake and in areas we 've got damaged the increased costs we just we haven 't been meeting we haven 't had the money on budget to do this stuff and you know I just keep thinking of the summer people that come in two years in a row now showing us photos of people falling over injuring themselves on broken foot paths that are still broken and I can 't tolerate it eating what we need to get action what I was going to suggest though as looking at a way of going forward we 've got the performance oestrogen Finance Committee 's two weeks and that has all these sorts of levels of service because I actually understand why you wouldn 't actually change your levels of service in some of these areas because obviously the summer you don 't need to do the same same levels that you were doing before the earthquake for whatever reason there 's also other areas there that are damaged that do need to maintenance and we heard a number of someone has come to us like the guy from Richmond McCleary who talked about you know just what hit what it mean in terms of psychologically on those people so I think we do need to move on this and we need to find a process to actually either make budget decisions or make levels of serious decisions within the next month well I think that there are a number of issues that you 've raised there you know the footpaths issue is one that that 's just you know really struck home I think for a lot of people when you look not just a summoner but you look at most of the streets are you know there was a view expressed at the time and I 've no idea i wasn 't i 've been here for three years so there was a view expressed at the time though that one side of each Street would be would be footpath available so you know people could push a pram down it people could ride on it on motor scooters that you know that they could actually get themselves about but there hasn 't happened there are streets and parklands that are completely impenetrable there are streets and and the new brighton area where banks right on to the red zone I don 't know when we 're going to be able to fix all of those footpaths when we don 't know what 's happening to the red zone you know so there are many decisions that have got layer upon layer upon layer and it 's not as good as it could be but it is something that we actually have to have to work with and and resolve so can we put this one to one side and we 'll come reporting roll through the committee structure but also has a focus on on levels of service and these earthquake damaged areas as well cuz I think we 've got to do both so if you leave that with us overnight we can look as long as it doesn 't get lost I brought up you know the fact of skirt and enable working together before over one dick and it 's not a go at you feel but that 's never come back over a joined-up process so as long as this doesn 't get lost I you know it 'll come back tomorrow it 's just I 'm going to have a word wordsmithing overnight so what 's what 's the next amendment that we 've got now people have ignored my my amendment and putting up this promenade speech walk so the amendment that I 've got on the table as my recommendation 5.2 and I wrote that the council request a staff report on to the feasibility of a promenade so their speech walk at North Beach as proposed by Community Connection nanalo trust submission whatever and and consultation with the trust Environment Canterbury n-no Tahoe and that 's for a very good reason and that 's because of the June system that the promenade Beach Walk is proposed to be on so I have an amendment that proposes that the phrase request a staff report be replaced with the word words request an under pendant report and to a design based feasibility so that 's yep so so that only words that change are those but the recommendation is that the bottom part of it fall off or that environment canterbury removed is that is that yours look can I can I just make a comment that may set of alleviate the problem all together really 1 to 5.1 and your recommendations you talk of the New Brighton ring and I was always my understanding that that 's 5.1 I 'm talking about 5.2 yes I know but I 'm just saying under 5.1 you talk at the development christchurch taking on the hot salt water pool project and the stage development of the new brighton suburban master plan there was always my notion that the proposal as well so if you blew two point one point three and just put the pod surely would then be up to the altman christchurch lead feasibility studies investor could have work on all of those three projects probably negates the need to have your phone well I 've got no particular objection to that other then it would still be required to be undertaken in consultation with the trust Environment Canterbury and no time I don 't have any objection with that either that given an fact look I 've been talking with both cumin myrica rocker and in the last few hours they advised me that they want to add their funding expense producers designed for the promenade and I just had a text a few moments ago to say that they are currently working on on the proposal anyway so I think we 're just being a little alarmist here and this project will require consultation with the wide range of agencies before it becomes a go I so I would simply suggest the best we can the regeneration and 5.1 wanted to add and there ah who would be part of their consultation on more than that um though but quite happy with that I think it 's really important though that 's and especially since the group are already working with he can that in fact we 'd be really clear about the coastal science as part of the way that in fact we work with he can all together so that in right at the top in the first slide that david has moved that the independent report feasibility after North Beach that the words including advice from weekend so in fact we are really clear and if it 's good that the trust of already working with again and I just want to be clear and making a decision around something really important like the side and I do understand me Dave 's coming from very important for the people of New Brighton and fit make sure that that is included a beginning rather than the subsequent study area well you 'd have to include night ah Who and the trust and that as well I mean that the thing is is is the idea that any studies arising out of the reporter to be undertaken in consultation with the trust Environment Canterbury and no Tahu so you can 't leave either of the statutory partners out of the picture and that process that 's that that was my thinking of why it was written that way and David 's suggestion ours is that we put it under the new brighton regeneration project through development christchurch what I 've got no objection to but i 'm just wondering does that that doesn 't change anything that 's it probably makes sure because we don 't know if it 's going to fly this was from the trust and because it can is the body that hits the knowledge and the scientific basis of knowledge too important to the very first stage so let 's say for argument 's sake that they had compelling evidence to say look this is oh yeah it 's not it 's not ruling out the fact that it could go to development christchurch once it passes feasibility stage well it may well be but the feasibility study to be taken into account and our june systems are precious and they do need to be worked through in terms of the proposal so and there may be adjustments to the proposal and line with the nature of the impact on the June system so I mean I don 't think that it 's unreasonable to keep them separate hey I 've got no objection and the future you know if the if the feasibility study shows that this is something that can can proceed so that 's not the decision to proceed but can proceed then there 's been no reason why we couldn 't put it under development christchurch which will be established by then yep what I 'm just I 'm just checking on the wording now so I thought your your recommendation kept at it actually I don 't see them well well except that the that the differences is that a staff report on to the feasibility as opposed to a nun dependent report into a design based feasibility and I think you 've got an amendment to change it to a pre-feasibility somewhere their very first line that is to be in bacillus night ah who note will the scientific the cultural values and scientific values are both important so get why don 't we didn 't include them all in the first line as well as ice plant in fact that the and the B and to a design based feasibility of a promenade Beach work at North Beach and then why don 't we just put them brekkers sort of something like inclusive of scientific and cultural values which is why you engage a cannon and night aho and the process is it and then in any subsequent studies arising out beyond taking consultation with that yep all right yep so that 's the feasibility study and yeah and the subsequent thanks so second yep funding with it the level of funding intended to be part of the generation project that development Christchurch were leading so i would like to also see under 5.1 that we add a two point one point three the promenade beach right the funding for it yeah where 's the funding coming for the feasibility no from that three million so break it against to put 1.3 should this be feasible to something from the regeneration now this is the feasibility study request and under pendant report all right i have to why don 't we add to 2.5 point 1 a 2 point 1 point 3 the feasibility study is referenced in 5.20 well if everyone 's generally happy with it I 'm happy to include that in the and my recommendation should just for clarity clarification regarding on trouble in the amendment sorry up to no no but I 'm saying if everyone 's happy with us I 'm happy to include it on my and my recommendation so it doesn 't need to be moved as an amendment with no 5.1 gets a two point one point three so people generally happy with that approach suggest that we put a date on because one of the things when you guys have been here as long as I have you 'll you 'll know that sometimes we pass these resolutions and we wait another year and a year so Blaine an e asn 't really stunning proposal in terms of there 's a lot of benefits to it but there 's also a lot of things that do need to be considered it and I wouldn 't like to lose the momentum so I just wither even if it 's a date for a report bit on where things are at that we tabled it in okay so um I don 't know does anyone have a I mean I know how long is a piece of string but how long would be reasonable for an initial report back on a feasibility study for for the promenade it 's a very long promenade yeah but is this for the entire thing or is it just for that section that they 'd asked to kind of look at to him as it kind of pile up well it 's both it 's just like because I mean date they wanted to staff it because that 's where their community bases and north beach but there are those who said well actually if you started at the pier and went back does that actually provide a to get it happening efforts feasible yeah rather than having money being spent on lots of reports and yes audience and wedding another year if there 's a section that we could look at you know and go right this is where we 'll focus in terms of feasibility pre-feasibility whatever you want to call it and here 's the stuff that we need to do to make it happen and here 's why if there 's any risks or any reasons what it 's not a good idea here 's what but trados extensive study that takes on a life of the time that ends up going around in circles here m.phil so I 'm just as making an assumption from the recommendation from the decision i 'm going to make could around the the costs that because mike is referred to say an approximate cost estimate or guesstimate problem sixty to seventy thousand so that kind of thing if the report showed that was warranted would in effect be like a pre-feasibility study to figuratively but the thing is that it 's putting it under the the new funding for that for that report and and it does then give us some options about how we might want to follow up on there because i can see that linking and very nicely with other projects that have been proposed for that area yes okay just well I quite like the idea of getting a report back earrings sort of sick I don 't_''_2007.48 so shall we sort of talk somewhere vaguely towards the end of the end of 2015 for ya before Christmas _"

    "text": "it 's everyone we 're missing a couple of people but hopefully oh good good excellent all right so now we 'll move to the amendments and we 've got a number of amendments or do you don 't need that do you need that long term plan the resolution to the ok but just um we 'll just put it up on the main board if we could that in moving for me as recommendations we measured to move all of the other elements of the long-term plan which could have been challenging and many respects so so that there is now formally moved by myself and end the deputy mayor moved and seconded so that 's on the table so the next no it does it oh yeah i 'll put it now all those opposed it as a good try it 's a good try when no one 's looking okay so and now we 're going to move to the amendments now of course the amendments have been coming on you know came on through to the 12th of june and and we 've put them some confusion around some of the aspects of it and will not confusion but through the questions that people have around certain particular ones so we 're going to try and structure the amendments so that we can really debate some of these issues that have relevance across the across the long-term plan and even though they pick up specific recommendations that have been highlighted by councillors and often picking up on what was said during the LTP submissions process which yeah this gives us an opportunity to actually line up with different line up these different issues for debate as part of this process so the first resolution the first amendment that we will deal with as this one and it 's moved by Andrew tunic and sickened urged by it was going to see connect fund Phil Clearwater so I will I will opeth open this up for for debate thank you great so this is an amendment that I 'm very happy to be moving this represents the culmination of some conversations that have been going on in Robinson 's Bay for some time between the reserves and it relates to two key assets in Robinson 's Bay one of which is the Robinsons Bay Reserve and the other of which is the Robinsons bay wharf and the community the wider community in fact almost to a resident of the community a keen to have both of these assets cared for in the best possible way so we have funds on budget for the Robinsons Bay reserves management committee to create a car parking area for the reserve which is essential in terms of the role of that reserve as an educational teaching reserve and we don 't have funds on budget for the robinsons bay wharf now I attended a meeting in Robinson 's Bay of a number of concerned community members where there was a very open conversation about how the funding which is on budget for Robinson 's Bay could be used almost as as match funding for volunteer labor that the community would be willing to give to both of these projects there 's significant capability within that community engineering capability hands on physical labor abilities there as well so what the community put a certain amount of funds on budget for Robertson 's bait happens to be tacked to the reserve we have engineering and other capabilities within the community that we want to bring to the party we want to stretch that funding and share it in fact across the reserve and the wharf so this relates very neatly to comments that the mayor made in her opening dress this morning around partnering with communities to deliver best outcomes what you actually end up with or what we actually end up with in fact what the community ends up with is two assets within that community that the the community members feel a very strong sense of ownership of in as much as they 've been involved with the repair and maintenance of those facilities so all that we 're asking to do by way of this amendment all I 'm asking to do is to essentially spread the funds that are on budget for the reserve across the reserve and the wharf so that the two community groups can work together using resources in the community bringing their volunteer labor now we have a staff response and the staff response is yes to repairs which is great yes to volunteers working on the car park which is fantastic no two volunteers working on the jetty and that disappoints me this is something that we 've been talking about in the context of a number of community facilities probably since about the day after the earthquakes is something I 've been banging on about in a number of contexts for probably the best part of four or five years and we really need to find a way through this when we 've got capability in a community when we 've got willingness in a community we 've got a community to willing to step up and make these things happen council need to find a way to work through yes the health and safety aspects and the the other compliance aspects but to say volunteers may not do this work because of these constraints we need to look at this from the other end and we need to say here we 've got community volunteers wanting to do the work how needs to do this because in point of fact we haven 't done it in terms of the wharf we haven 't got budget to do it there 's no budget on the on the plan to do it we 've got a community that have come to us with a solution we need to find a way of embracing that solution and allowing these community assets to be back to the standard they need to be at and we need to respect the fact that the community are willing and able to do that no I 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much the next amendment that we have to look at sorry my computer 's not showing up here so I 'm going to go off another computer which so I 'm just always going to check to see if it 's up there and I understand there 30 backers wanting to move this and Pauline cutter to second it so if I can invite our council about it to speak to the amendment of the things that came through and credibly strongly was the demand and desire for community facilities to be repaired and particularly for the need for facilities where people felt great about being there and the need for some temporary facilities because of the delay on the metro sports in town so we have at fernery an indoor sports facility which is currently closed but which can be repaired at a maximum cost of 2.4 million but may be substantially below that we also heard from a group of parents from Avery about a pre-tax paddling pool how important for that community we 've done up the house reopened in September 2013 beautiful house there and and what we heard from both the community there and the cdhb in terms of the health benefits actually of penacles so the suggestion is that in tranche two of the community repairs money that 's already approved we substitute out the repair of the Milton Street Depot upon which we had no submissions and all none that I 'm aware and I think I 've read every single one and substitute the two allow for the repair and reopening of foreign or recreation center and the repair or rebuild of a three-part paddling pool obviously there 's a bit of work to be done on both of those but we know roughly the cost and we can fit both of those facilities into the current allocated cost some heavy very good as anyone opposed to that it wants to speak I 'll put speak you know I mean but I made it clear that the amendments would be hell was you know if there was people would speak in favor of it I would look for somebody to speak against it and if that wasn 't forthcoming i put the motion so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried the next amendment is in relation to the sudden cinema church remains and I think Tim scandrett is going to move that do I have a seconder for that motion Jamie Tim thank you this has been going on ever since the church was demolished under emergency powers there have been a number totally inconclusive so that the trust is Anna quandary of actually how much this will actually cost the clear council a long time ago agreed and arranged in here still has us and place to store the heritage assets whether they be the rock or whatever is found because apparently it was demolished if the tumors actually can be used I 'm sensitively and they are hoping that a lot of their items such as peers etc will still be intact which bits hope they are but it 's been five or four years and weather etc so a relevant of the cost irrelevant of what who 's working with who nothing has happened yet this is a crucial gateway to the central city it was a tourist a tourist roadway prior to the earthquake there 's no question that will be dead again and for this community has been a huge amount of development and here they 've been paying a lot into that community and in the south end we 've got the Signum site which is going to be developed we 've hit this site which has and viral waste at the other end we 're week prior to that we hit scalese so this is a community that 's put up with a lot to bec this and say we will underwrite and get this done will be a huge boost and supporting the Sidna master plan and this community so I urge you to support it thank you easy before I called you I should have asked if we were able to get some advice on the cost well it 's what I 've said that there 's no if there is no evidence does then it could be 150 or so and that could be covered by the trust earth Francis business it could be a million we don 't know but I 'm presuming it won 't be there but Ellen suppose our strength we hit two tests which and I can 't understand why they 've been acting conclusive why do I test at all I 'm sorry um Jane but because so we could relieve that one up there and we can give you the answer I 'm actually so this working on it 's going on and on and on and on this community yeah he 's in now so you know this is super one time again so um and there 's been you know considerable frustration expressed about the the lack of clearance set signum church side and the remains of the church that have remained there for some time and I think that you 've got a really good history of the site it was demolished under earth and under the Sarah regime that was in place at the time wasn 't it and it was it was demolished under the civil defense emergency leaders right so it was before Sarah absolutely I was demolished about the 24th or 25th of febuary in doubt there 's in the days afterwards did it have to go through a process because I 'm just wondering how the demolition occurred without the removal from the side no it was them was demolished to make safe so that it was the undertaking there was an investigation done at the time around who go through with the recession and everything and I but I know one of that guys to do that in the right people made the right decision although I will shouldn 't_''_848.369 say the right decision the right people who had the authority to make the decision did do it so right yeah but but safe and unsightly are two different things and it 's right yeah yeah so okay yeah the peps if you give us an overview and then I 'll take some questions okay so we had a look at it from an environmental health perspective in from a regulatory perspective so there 's actually no mechanism for us to actually require them to remove it under the regulatory rules and regulations there was an issue in relation to managing asbestos on the site so the the church was working or the trust was working with Sarah and Sarah did some testing for them in the testing came back showing that there was asbestos contamination with in the rubble site itself and that we spoke with their trust about it and we organized the trust organized to have the site actually covered an a clear coating from an environmental health perspective and making it safe so that 's as far as we went from a environmental health perspective there 's another site of essence to do with the arrangements around insurance into the fact that counts a lot as i understand it previously provided a grant to the trust to undertake a hole over the renovation work so there 's a an outstanding sum of money that i mean some insurance documents that have gone to the trust to sign that would actually enable them to carry on and remove the rubble themselves that 's all about for the money yes so that 's where that 's it the with that 's why we haven 't_''_947.83 moved with regulatory with regulatory powers to actually require it to be released there is ongoing contention with the trust about there is no estas and the site and they can 't understand where it 's come from we did an investigation it she does some allegations that came from a nearby roof you can 't establish weird that asbestos has come from is quite clearly photos showing pieces of the source of that is very difficult the factors that actually end there now in this the rubble will need to be managed as if it 's SB stas contaminated so there adds a lot of costs tota that site the to the trust X you want to remove the stone and everything and take it somewhere else clean it take it somewhere else so that they can actually utilize it potentially in the future to rebuild there 's also some important items and within the river rubble that they 'd like to recover eyes the amount of their prices right so have you got an idea of the cost it hasn 't been discussed specifically i can tell you though on previous experience with way ahead and to deal with their wine only road house of horrors that state house that was dropped that cost sixty thousand dollars to remove and get rid of because of the SB stas contamination this is may be slightly different because the we 're not actually removing the material without would have to be cleaned and dealt with in an appropriate way particularly guys around an email received in march on this it 's pretty much as all the same outstanding in March was that we were waiting for a two things we 're waiting for a business case for the development community facility and also that was going to be clear and spleen but those things of I 'm not sure about the business case I don 't know with it business code that 's privately owned land it belongs to the trust and it 's an energy is to do with what they want so i 'm not sure where the business case was going in terms of the kid that the clearance of the rubble the church was going to once they 've made a decision to clear it we 're going to provide us with an action plan on how they were going to manage the site from a and bs bestest contaminated do the appropriate thing in terms of removing that rabble to wherever they needed to take it so there 's no requirement from us to have a clearance plan other than to show that when they appropriately from an environment of how fast people as i understand we 're waiting for that those church heritage trustees come up with the asbestos removal plan or debris move will plan this it incorporates so we 've got an idea how much that will cost and we don 't have any time frames ever had any recent contact with them over where there I haven 't_''_1128.13 I 'm not sure we 're there the property team here and just the second Christian for me as have we talked to the people that actually demolished it to find out what materials they demolished given that my understanding as an operator that that week you know we use and we do have dealings with this operator in the past talk to the demolition contractor to see on my mind a thing was it was a southern demolition I think that demolished and there was all this confusion and and I think they were also involved no I wake up hurt but it may be worth just talking to them to say we need abolished her you know how does it was asbestos work I don 't know it 's going to be helpful yani the building was dropped on the site as it was in I don 't anything else has been introduced so potentially from the demolition contractor that is not to say that somebody hasn 't dumped pieces of polite later which we see in his head and across the red zone anywhere where there 's an opportunity people who do that so the fact of the matter is that there is clear asbestos contamination on this site and it needs to be managed accordingly and that does increase the cost but it 's really the cost of he who pays for that that 's the issue following things up the asbestos contamination yeah what actually it would fall back to that and the owner the land owner in the person responsible for their and clearance at the site is it useful for us to specify up to a certain amount or I I think that 's a very good idea and I 'm sitting up here not just to keep n company but now to understand the way level because the way that this this looks to me as it would have to be ratepayer funding and so that the level to which you underwrite it and we 'll have to build into the budgets yep sorry there was a second he 's done an exact same spot where the first test was done and it was unkink lucifer the guards to the asbestos was on the surface so when the trust came to our community board we said well that 's we 've got to TS one sign there is a specialist on the surface the other one is saying that is that hasn 't found asbestos to the rim to the site the fet matters we need an absolutely tip who tell us exactly what 's there so go forward and work out what what it 's going to cost or there abouts well if the lake of knowledge is holding a sapper may know i 'm just trust never get on with the trust is undertaking that they 're also undertaking at a stage the arm action plan to clear the site but it comes don 't they will not be able to cover the cost if there is a sweet sauce if there is no asbestos the price it was killed and probably won 't be there anymore but southern demolition quite a reasonable price yeah I 've got questions Jamie and then Pauline we 're done Peter and yanni allude to that just because you 're the first thing I was thinking is we do want action and outcome but I also think that when you make a resolution you need to be cognizant not or at least making sure that you 'll find in ways to make it mitigate any potential risks and the fact that doesn 't specify a figure or an up to finger I think there 's a risk from council 's perspective so the two suggestions i had was one do we put a lot of a limit of say up to a hundred thousand dollars or I 'll take tape expert advice on that and I think there 's a second part 2 which is to be to provide whether the trust provides their own financial contribution we don 't want to see us just solely picking out a tab if they come to the party in we 're there to help if there 's a shortfall we can underwrite it so long it 's up to it acceptable level but limiting their level and also saying that we want what would it spit them to put on a financial contribution at least as much as ours just ask 112 with the group four hundred twelve thousand I think the grounders for the insurance around 350 so if the trust efforts whatever it is to fix the site they 're still in to the council for a they put that all the insurance to pay off as much at the ground as possible they 'll still be in the read then we 're left with a trust that 's and it to the council and nothing has happened to the side he 's like we 're going around a circle no this at portos Pauline and then Glenn my question was the supporting clarification on that grant then I think you mentioned it in so it was think it was yes to do some is quite strengthening work on the building and it wasn 't stint on there that was no your money was spent by it was big thank you that 's wrong yep Lynne Vicki my inclination at this point really is to seek a report I couldn 't support that because this is her weight we actually need to know the insurance and asbestos implications and any facts or figures you know that 's really a debating points or we 'll definitely have a debate on this one sense is obviously going to be someone opposed to it but I 'm just yeah I mean yannis updated us what this information and you 've got that that the the council still providing advice to them about best practice but this practice would be for the site to be cleared in a way that managers the presence of asbestos because of the conflicting tests absolutely in you 'll need got a test fear so the tests that were done was zero would buy am a reputable test tester who established at under a set of understand that the second test might not have fired such good best practice methodology the factors and we 've spoken to work safe about this because a contractor would be in to do it so it 's a workplace yep the fact that there is s business in the air doesn 't mean you could have another several tests later that show it 's inconclusive there is there are tests that clearly show there is presence of asbestos therefore it must be managed and that way yeah and it doesn t matter that the asbestos arrived pre or post night the building come down here and that I mean the photos of the asbestos polite sitting India and I mean there 's big chunks of it so it 's not like it 's we 're just looking at little fibers it has to be managed as if there is this business and there that 's the right way to do it it 's in a public place it needs to be managed in any way so so what is the work I mean because there is no question that everyone very high up and the and the government as well I 've had conversations with various people and very keen to see this guy we are of one mind so what can we as a council beast do that would would facilitate I mean as under I the best option or is it really too I mean because there 's nobody that lives in that area that wants to leave it there i mean terms absolutely right it 's holding back the the whole concept of the the master plan and the the you know the vision for sudden I 'm and you know I mean I go did a shot now I never used to go to send them to shock the fantastic development at the Colombo is brilliant you know some of my favorite shops are there you know it 's just it 's such a fantastic place and I just hate to see something like this holding beg really the whole development of the area yani us because the other the other obvious thing for me right is that the building wasn 't demolished with the owners an official level and it got the bowlers so it 's part of the kind of response emergency costs surely the disposal of the material should be captured and some sort of civil defense emergency budget given that I mean the other argument that these people may have is that well we didn 't consent to it being demolished we didn 't know about it and now you 're making us pay cleaning up the mess there as not wasn 't a decision and B has got stuff that we don 't think was in here so i would have thought if we 're trying to find funding for it the logical thing that would come out of one of those emergency response by but I presume we 've paid for a whole bunch of stuff I think Yanni that might apply if they 're building was dropped and disposed of but it wasn 't it was dropped for safety reasons it was left Deering retained their it hasn 't been disposed of it remains on site aside therefore it still belongs to the property of the trust so I can 't recover costs that we haven 't actually spent under that legislation that wasn 't disposed of it was just too dropped for public reasons so the costs for southern devotion and to take networks probably being paid for as part of the civil defense emergency but there will be no costs associated with disposal because it stayed there on site hmm Phil and I just wanted to prepare for the possibility of that ely asbestos being only surface based on that the I understand that the building since it was the old church was built in the late 1800s asbestos then wasn 't used and therefore is it more like as a more likely in fact it would just be an your species would be just on the surface layer I think we have to step away from the constructor we actually have to look at it the SB snores presence I can I cannot tell you how it got the year I don 't know there was sizable pieces of polite Thea it was visually obvious which you know if you thought it was just windblown off the victors its present and we have to deal with it anyway the right thing to do is deal with it is asbestos contamination they won only Road situation hideous beast doors contamination and the atode and it was because it was all in the subjects so that 's we hit to deal with it we didn 't know that until after their fire had occurred and the building had been demolished or dropped by the fire service so sometimes you just have to deal with it dear yep quick question just a double confirm mean so the status of it it 's friable asbestos that we would be most likely dealing with yes so a particle board that 's been you know polite that 's been some broken shows friable asbestos that 's why we got them to put the covering over there to predict protect the public safety fright more health in relation to any private vessels that came off those broken parts all right so I 'd like yet bring it back to the extent to which you like ratepayers to underwrite this and also the precedent I think that you want to take him to mind as you 're considering it well that they are huge issues and I you know that there is no question that everyone wants it cleared but it 's owned by a trust that as the only points out didn 't ask for it to be demolished the people who made the decision to demolish it were authorized to make that decision and it was the decision they made the rubble remains on the on the property but it doesn 't re rubble it 's affected by contamination with asbestos regardless of how it got there it 's there and and therefore the whole site has to be treated in a particular way for the protection of those workers that will be invited to do their work so so it is what it is and we 're dealing with a trust that doesn 't have a lot of resources in fact owes us more money than they will spend an insurance you know so that the setting a precedent hmm the fact that this was ensured by the City Council I starts and ends yes I only applies when we insure for you another you notice just by the way I believe there 's quite a few properties that we 've ensured on behalf of and other any that are sitting there I don 't know that level of detail yeah yeah but it may well be that we 've gotta appreciate the need to put boundaries around it and I appreciate the need to put a dollar figure on it I support I support clearing up this site I think we have to but I just wonder whether we actually don 't list around the wrong way what we should do getting is getting a report back on how much it will cost what the plan is and what the future facility is going to be and we try and get there and I 'm happy to put money into it given the unique situation as has been said that I don 't think there 'd be many other buildings that were demolished without the owner 's knowledge and then left for five years rotten deteriorate and have all this do think we should actually get into process get a really clear understanding of what 's been proposed to be done and how much it 's going to cost well given that that was kind of the position earlier this year and actually before we were elected in September 2013 what sort of time frame would we put on that sort of report of we really wanted to get action and to understand the costs in what could happen and okay I gave eight weeks would probably but all depends on when you want it back here but it would take it we need to talk to the trust for need to get some contractors in there need to understand where it needs to go it 's not just disposing of it as usually where does it go I hope that leaves I storage how does it get cleaned all of those sorts of things so it is quite a unique situation because we wanted to retain some of the material there _"

    "text": "which is the one we 've all been waiting for the 2012 watch 2015 there is misnamed the twenty fifteen to twenty twenty-five long-term plan and I have some recommendations so I would like to move what 's happened yeah I would like to move my recommendation and do I have a seconder for that Becky thank you and and I would like to say a few words at the at the beginning and and then I want us to move to the suspension of standing order so that we can deal with all of the elements of the resolution of the long-term plan I think that the one thing that I want to commence worth is to remind people that we have said from the outset that this is merely a base case what merely is probably not the quite the right word because we have gone through quite a significant process we went to our communities last year and we prepared them for a discussion about what was going to be an incredibly challenging long-term plan process and we talked to them about the findings of both the of those documents had highlighted significant shortfalls in our financial position so what we ended up with was going out for a consultation with a base case recognizing that we didn 't have all of the information that a council would normally have in order to make the set of decisions for a 10 year plan and looking out ten years is incredibly challenging when at the time we didn 't know the results of the independent review and to the horizontal infrastructure which I 'm bled now that we didn 't rely on in terms of an expectation around through the government contribution for that purpose the second thing that we didn 't have was an understanding of our insurance and also what they 're meant in relation to a decision that somebody else made to sign up to contributions to anchor projects without any guarantee about what we were going to get back from our insurance so no guarantee around insurance recoveries the this has put this council on a particularly challenging decision but the thing is is that we have to have our financial house in order future of the city 's development and in the immediate sense in terms of the next stage of the city 's recovery from a position of financial independence which this long-term plan gives us we actually become politically self-determining we are in a position as a council to ensure that we can meet our obligations to our city it 's going to be hugely challenging but we have the opportunity now to really sort of stand on our own two feet we 're not beholden to anyone in that regard we have the capacity within our own resources to sort this out but this is a base case we 're going to know more information in the next year we 're going to know about what our insurance recoveries are we 're going to know about what we are able to address with central government and we have said we will talk to central government we are going to be talking to central government about the cost sharing agreement we are going to be talking to central government about the blueprint we are going to be talking to central government are clearly earthquake-related so there are many many issues that we will be discussing with central government but we can 't write in any outcome or or assumed outcome from those discussions which have already commenced between officials we can 't write on those assumptions and to our long-term plan and we don 't need to we have the financial capacity to do this as a city and all of the negotiations will be focused now on what benefits central government can see from collaboration with a council that has got its financial house in order and I have to say that by the end of this next financial year and i have to remind people that an annual plan is an amendment to a long-term plan and we have made a crystal clear right from the outset that we will amend this long-term plan and our annual planning process next year there are two elements in particular that I just want to focus on and they are the capital program so we 're going to go through our capital program we 're going to have external assistance to assist a proper duty year infrastructure program in place where people can see what is going to be done when it 's going to be done and in what manner we might want to address in terms of the way that it 's done the scoop program has provided us with an opportunity to look at a different way of working the amount of information that is now known about our horizontal infrastructure there 's probably greater than any other council and the entire country and that puts us in an incredibly strong position to think about our capital program going forward that 's going to have an impact a downward impact on rates and it 's going to have a downward impact on capital release and that 's the second element capital release we can see now with the reprofiling that we 've already done that we don 't need to release as much capital and years two and three me and that 's highly likely that we can shift those but at the end of the day we have to leave it there for for the for the period forward and to the annual planning process and we 're making it crystal clear and the amendment and and maybe if we could just have a little scroll up to the to the relevant phrase which is here noting that the reprofiling of capital expenditure has already had an impact on our debt profile we may not need to release tranche as two and three and years 20 16 to 17 20 17 to 18 which also means that we can consider enable once it becomes a mature business the capital release program and those years will therefore be fully reviewed both as to quantum and timing as an amendment to the long-term plan in the 2015-16 annual plan so these are work program for next year already set in concrete that is something that we will be doing and it is something that we are now in a legal position to do once we get this LTP through I should also just remind people that under the changes that were made to the legislation that took effect essentially from the day that we were all elected it is the the role under the local government act to lead and carry responsibility and accountability for all of the planning processes so the long-term plan has to be and my name it has to be something that I own and it has to be something that I 'm able to promote in the way that we are doing here today the local government act section 93 and I remind people that they should read it and commit it to memory the local government act makes it clear that a plan as a statement of intent that is not a binding contract and no one can rely on any element of it to require the council to perform it individual papers will come to council to confirm or reject any particular item that 's in the long-term plan that can be amended any time so i just want to remind people again the importance of seeing us as the base case that we have told our constituents that it is it is a base case and it is something we can build on it is not something that is cast in stone 'd really want to emphasize how important it is to understand the city becoming self determining and I think that there has been considerable concern expressed about the extent of uncertainty that we might face as a city and I guess we 've all been through this together as a city and there there are uncertainties but what this tells the people of Christchurch is that we can we can do it as a city we can contribute what we need to contribute to the cost of repairing our damaged infrastructure and giving our city back on track the interesting thing about where we go to from here though is not so much and the in the delivery of that it 's it 's it 's the next step and you know I 've described this long to employers from recovery to resilience and it 's about ensuring that we can regenerate our city so it 's not just about putting things back it 's actually about regenerating and taking this opportunity to build back something that 's even better then what was there before and I always think of city plan but it 's what happens in between those spaces that 's equally important because they will generate the private sector investment there our city absolutely needs to see to build momentum inside our central city the same time the cell TP cognize that we can 't look at our central city an isolation from the people who live in the suburbs and we actually do need to find ways of ensuring that we can regenerate and our suburbs as well and people have heard me talk about the master planning processes before that require resources to support them and ensure that they can literally take off I think that despite the the challenges that we 've had to confront this year and the fact that this LTP contains no assumptions as to further crown contributions to the cost of repairing our city 's damaged infrastructure I guess that when we reflect on how we got to this point we had an implied expectation and an unaudited three-year plan and twenty thirteen to sixteen that this would be forthcoming and we 've had to face up to the reality was twenty twelve to twenty fifteen i guess was the was that particular three-year plan now there doesn 't mean we won 't be seeking additional support for particular earthquake-related damage to our city and i want to re-emphasize that fact but it does mean we can 't budget for it and we haven 't budgeted for it and this particular plan there are obviously things that people would like to see done now but we aren 't in a position necessarily to afford those until we 've had time to actually review our capital program so in some respects i sort of say to council as if we can over the next we were while we consider the amendments to my proposal if people could think very carefully about whether this does need to be moved as an amendment day or whether it is something that could be raised as a as a proposal to go forward unto the review of our capital expenditure and you know and to think very carefully about that this was one of the reasons why i asked for the four amendments to be has enabled us to do is to get some staff advice which will assist us in the process around around amendments one of the one of the highlights for me of this process and I suppose people might be surprised that i would say that has actually being on being on this end of the of the table for a submission i 've only ever been a submitter on a council plan before I 've never set at this end of the table for a long term plan so as the MP for Christchurch East always used to come to the council table in fact I think the first time I appeared in front of the council of was as as the mp4 crushes central so I actually went back and reflected on on the submissions that I made at the time I also made a submission on the draft central city recovery plan and it was unta resting being allocated my five minutes by the previous mere sitting at the end of the table and feeling disappointed that I only had five minutes but I thought if only have say and the two things I talked about with the east and the need for having an investment strategy to redevelop the city the only way you could do that was to have an investment strategy that would and of course that wasn 't something that was addressed at that time and it is something that I think that we 're paying quite a significant price forward today but my heart 's always been in the East I guess so I wasn 't disappointed to see that I had been a strong advocate for it and I 'm glad that this long-term plan can address some of the shortfall that needs to be addressed and that and in that respect I 've I do want to say this and I said this at a press conference that i had on friday but there were there were a lot of people who made submissions with an writing or orally here in the council chamber or through the different mechanisms we kind of trialed this time round but there were a lot of people who didn 't come and I 'm concerned we might expect to this whole process and I think we need to seriously review the way that we consulted the way that we receive submissions and the future I 've certainly expressed frustration along the way particularly the separation of activity management plans from the capital program decisions the inclusion of matters without community board oversight and I 'm looking at the two counselors from the eastern that regard because they 're certainly added to the view that they had been sort of overlooked in the whole process the difficulty are planning when there are many unknowns including insurance recoveries as I 've mentioned the hearings process but I believe that the chief executive and the staff of this organization have gone beyond the call of duty to really support us through what is an incredibly difficult time so I just want to acknowledge that carrying to you and the entire team to Kate me as office support has been utterly extraordinary and I know that we have that support from outside the organization as well feeding on but it is extraordinarily difficult to meet obligations under a framework we 're on and that is the hardest element of the situation that we 've done.we it it it was made more complex than I think Parliament ever intended it to be by introducing a brand new form of consultation called a consultation document which was actually supposed to make the process easier but which actually created additional challenges that an organization such as ours found incredibly difficult especially when we weren 't out consulting on you know that the six or ten big projects that we needed to you know get feedback on when we were consulting on a base case was about how we finance the organization and that to me is not the transformative inspiring work that I came here to do for three years so I think that in a post disaster environment governments and the future need to think very carefully about collaborating on a form of working through frameworks that provide the protections that obviously those frameworks are designed to give but in a way that actually facilitates community engagement if there is one message I took from the submissions that came through is be consulted they want to be consulted about things that weren 't even our responsibility but over and over again the message came we want to be heard and I think that it is absolutely vital that we have absolute transparency and all aspects of planning processes and in a post disaster environment a government has to think very seriously about how they are going to engage with the wider community and how the council that represents that community is locked into that process in a way that is flexible but also meaningful because the last thing that we want to do is to have people encouraged to make submissions about ideas that are never going to fly so how do you have that conversation and learning to deal with complex issues as something that that our study I think can contribute to others who may experience what we 've been through some time in the future and that 's that 's something that came through the submissions process I know that everyone hood at the same that I that I heard it which was building resilience demands collaboration it there is a collaborative environment and the submissions that we got over and over and over again and actually I thought was quite heartwarming to hear from our communities who said don 't do stuff for us do stuff with us give us the resources and we will do things for ourselves you know time and time again building gt 's you don 't need to come out and build that GG for us they said we will build the GT just give us the resources and the support to do so we heard from non-government organizations that individuals within our city you know creative communities is a network offering incredible resource to our council and I think over and over again I 've been using that phrase which I can now say without looking at the words on the page that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts you know that with everyone working together we get so much more we had communities across the city wanting to contribute to the well-being of the city both the people and the environment they want to look at problems require people from a whole lot of different disciplines to work together that 's what we 've been offered from homelessness through to the future impacts of climate change you know all of these issues there are people with the expertise with the knowledge and the patient who want to contribute to decision-making here at the council the concept of a neighborhood matching fund as developed in our sister city of seattle received strong endorsement and that 's something that we want to review through our model of community grants later this year the littleton time being invited the council to become a member of the time being but not just for the purpose of being a contributor but but as a mechanism for expanding time across the city and when you think about whether we were prepared for the long term recovery after a disaster I always look at what was already going on so you take a place like little turn where there was a record of what people were prepared to contribute to their community their skill sets their addresses and their phone numbers and how time banking system so no wonder a little ton was such a strong environment to both respond and to recover from and the enduring nature of that recovery is to be seen from the kind of submission that they made on the long-term plan so over and over again we had communities saying they wanted to be part of the contribution to the future development of the city te Runanga o Ngai Tahu the first time ever a submission to a long-term plan of the council and this that the stick towards the partnership that we can make absolutely real their desire to work with the councillors kaitiaki on a variety of issues notably cleaning up our rivers and harbors I mean that it 's something we share across the city it 's not something that 's unique to tell Runa but what they bring to the table is unique and it is something that we value and something that we will build on so I think that the the whole process for me has been one that it 's probably not ideal in the sense that it wasn 't run but it has led us to a position where we can pass a long-term plan this week and we can put that we can put that plan to the test every year in subsequent years and we have set ourselves an agenda to do so immediately afterwards so I 'm sorry no no time off next week it 's 1 July we start again and I think that that 's a really powerful message to send through to people on Christchurch that we are absolutely committed to getting the rate of rates increase down we are committed to getting the the release of capital down and again one of the things that 's been probably missed from the debaters evidence by the headline this morning as that capital release does not mean that you sell shares it doesn 't mean that it can mean all sorts of different options we can put debt onto companies we can we can release capital from our cch our companies in a whole lot of different ways of course selling shares as as one of those but it isn 't the only one were to be an option then there has to be for the strategic benefit of the city or the region as a whole so that end by changing the the recommendation to one that makes it crystal clear that the three core infrastructure assets remain on the strategic assets list means that any decision in relation to any equity release from any one or all three of those companies would have to go through a special consultant procedure so and that was certainly a message that came through the submissions process it was made pretty clear that people wanted to have a say if that we 're going to be the case i think that the debate has been useful for that or you know the submissions process has been useful for that to look at what is truly strategic and what isn 't strategic in terms of ownership and it 's not whether the organization itself as strategic it 's whether the ownership by the city as strategic in terms of what is able to be delivered for the city the the last thing that I want to talk want to mention it because it I guess that there was a bit of a misunderstanding I think in the way that it was announced so the infrastructure levy proposal is included and the rates that we are proposing and the rates that we originally had in the draft long-term plan started at eight point seven five percent we 've reduced the the rates by twenty percent the rates increase by twenty percent over the four years that are highlighted and the recommendation but and included within that and years from years to 20 16 to 17 there is a horizontal infrastructure levy now that is an amount that we have assessed as required to make up for the shortfall of what we would expect to have covered under the cost sharing agreement and you know from from certainly from my perspective I think that there was there was a belief and I think this is reinforced by the fact that the three-year plan highlighted 398 million dollars of savings to be found when they weren 't ever intended to be savings to be found it was the difference between an early stage of that process so but the the wording of the cost sharing agreement does raise questions about what was covered and and and what was eligible in the use of the word eligible and references to the civil defense and emergency management funding arrangements I think may have left a mismatch of view so the council thought that it was signing up to one thing but actually the government thought it was signing up to something else and you know it is in that space that I think we need way more transparency and if that 's something we can offer a future city that might face a disaster and you know then we would want to offer that by way of some advice we we know that there will be untrue and increased operational costs as well because sweating the SH might be a phrase that I wasn 't familiar with before but what it means is that pipes and roads might require additional operational expenditure to be spent on them during the course of their life until they come into a renewals program we can months and and I 'm confident that we will be able to bring that infrastructure lily down as well but it 's got to be established at a level that 's realistic and it 's got to be able to be justified and and you know I 'm confident that that is sufficient there but I 'm also confident that with a proper analysis of the work that 's remaining that we 'll be able to bring that down and that should be our aim is to bring that down as soon as we possibly can so those are the that the the key elements of the the long-term plan proposal that I 've put forward we have obviously an interest and the transition recovery process that will be announced by central government soon obviously we want to be in a position to submit on the transition recovery plan the same way that everyone else will but in a from a position of strength and I think this does put us in a position of strength we are in a position to say that we are able to self-sustain as in we will have better knowledge next year and that will enable us to progress we will enable us to progress things in a much more strategic way and I believe do one thing and that 's the last thing that I want to say is when people make a decision to run for Council next year then this council will have left them absolutely with the platform that will enable them to know exactly what the financial position is what is possible and what is not and nobody will be blindsided by the kind of shocked that I think all of us were blindsided with after the last election and I think that 's a gift to the next council that we can all take some pride in so I would like to leave my introductory comments there we 're going to debate the proposal on Friday once we have the audit of audit opinion and but I would like someone now well I would like to move that we now temporarily suspend standing orders and the particular send Phil will second it and that there are basically three eight and three point nine point nine and that 's to ensure that we 've actually got people who are able to move because we 'll run out of people if you 're not allowed to move an amendment after you 've moved in them infant so yeah so this that 's all I need to do it yet so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and what is the time it 's twelve o 'clock so we will move on to the amendments but I think we 'll break for lunch and sorry sorry did oh sorry yeah so we 'll break for lunch and we 'll come back at one o 'clock yep _"

    "text": "you will resume the meeting thank you so I understand that there may have been some discussions over the break to try and reach some sort of wording that might work as so people generally quite happy to proceed with the wording as it is all right just want to be really clear about financially what the sex ya know so Peter will report back on that yeah okay what we 've looked at is the 8.0 25 million and today 's dollars and inflated spent for that across the 2018-19 and nineteen twenty years would be a what that means in terms of a rates impact is point one five percent over those three over the three years around that period and what it 's doing is it 's bringing forward from 20 to 23 adding on about a million dollars so the reduction from those out of years is a minus point one four percent so over the tombs of what you have in the 10-year plan is feeling even at what it 's doing is time shifting it from 20 to 23 bringing it forward to eighteen one what the cost differences so I 'm talking about the numbers the options are somewhat different and if we 're looking at a cost contribution from the community that 's not being taken into account so the cost that we have given you those figures are based around the 8.02 five million or option that is your name might be able to talk to that yeah okay I mean I understand their kind of impact with with the differing it for three years what I don 't understand is if we 're swinging an extra three million dollars because we put it off for three years and not on worth that akash your option is is the way to go so my you know a person 's analysis of it we can spend six million dollars this year we could spend nine million dollars and year 2018 you 're saying 8.05 now or eight point seven four and three years hey I 'm saying 8.0 25 and today 's dollars as nichols 8.7 million in three years time all right so could we have the boating schedule ups so to a press note so that 's carried okay thank you all right so now we move on to you next item on the agenda _"

    "text": "if we reviewed on page 62 point we hear you know they give us the strong signal after the consultation as 66 of the 88 response the pre folder options three until two of 88 is about a 25 percentage prefer the option to non-response favoring option one implementation the kind of expect you be called option 1 i 'm concerned whether they 'll raise the bigger the other kind of dispute between a council in the community because none of them would like to have the option one about regarding to the option to if we review you know if last a year we go ahead we got into this the state to burn a Louisville probably we can save a million dollars but you with deferred to another two years probably assume Park another 20 percentage of inflation etc whether there is a benefit to the council we need to think about it well regarding to the option three a percentage no code is one not only the consultation but absolutely infrastructure is basically the waste water system populates a basic and fundamental you know the council need allergy so I you know we need to face the fact otherwise we don 't need to have any kind of the consultation so i prefer the easter option three Thank You Pauline thank you and neither does a difficult decision Alice has been just in my short time here we 've fished this out several times that environment committee level into various other times that consultation has been very robust with p when the feedback has been they they have had an expectation and that 's no reason for us to make a decision at the same time it is a historical project that 's been hovering around for many many years probably since the amalgamation i believe it 's about the harbor as well to me I mean the harbor there it 's the regime in it provides making a chi it 's tourism-based and recreation not just for those locals but for everybody so the cultural and environmental decision we have to make it 's not just about toilets it 's about gray water as we 've heard and we did here also through the Environment Committee absorbing water so it is a real problem here I actually would probably be earring on supporting I will support option three people have talked about option one but the thing is that option one actually requests payment for very small section it 's only the connection to your property and part of that is only only at the cost of that is only a tiny part of the total cost the bulk of the cost is for the treatment plant I believe and that was the answer to a question i asked recently and there 's also no compulsion to join that there 's no compulsion so there 's a risk that people who don 't take up that offer to pay for what they get will will continue to use an inferior system which continues to pollute we won 't be achieving our aim if a few people don 't join up I 'm also concerned that if there were sewage smells around why was this not reported to II can and if it was did they act on it I 'm concerned about animal waste entering the and put the system in how the income we also stop this other pollution going and so that area efforts and our money is not wasted so I think that 's something that we will look at on the Environment Committee and see if we can work on it um to put it out three years is also a risk because and us also will be perceived quite quite harshly by the community because it 's being de food the entries so many times so I 'm a bit reluctant to support that I will of course if option 3 fails but I 'm at the moment I think I 'll have to go for the immediate what I would like to consider is full suggestion of a targeted rate because I think that 's fear and it would be all properties I think we 've had this before word churches they I believe hit to pay for their systems by target of great and I think that is really worth considering and I think you know we 've pointed out the fact that everybody in Christ your chest to number of houses notwithstanding the actual benefit to the total harbour so anyway I will be supporting in this instance option 3 thank you alright I 'll but I 'll just comment myself that 's these issues as Jamie said and not easy issues they 're always very challenging but what Christ Church has ended up with over the amalgamation with banks peninsula is that we have inherited set of issues that a city doesn 't normally deal with and there have been commitments made in the past but they are not commitments that the city made their commitments that banks financial district council made and they were absorbed into the into the city for its own decision-making processes and and we 're confirmed despite the fact as others have mentioned it they weren 't reconsidered after the earthquakes had occurred and and that may be because things have gone down a particular path but this particular element of it wasn 't reviewed a number of councils that face people moving or retiring in two particular areas and I 'm not suggesting why no is one of these but other well resourced retirees who have you know wonderful coastal views for example and have taken on their own counsel who have sought to address important issues like coastal erosion and coastal inundation and some of these challenges occur simply because they are resourced to do so as against the small rating base of a small council why no it doesn 't have that issue because it 's now part of a large catchment and more people contributing to the total costs can reduce the cost per household but not the cost per household affected I personally am of the view that this should have been one that was moved towards a cost sharing arrangement right from right from the outset of the amalgamation with Christchurch City because it is such a large sum of money for such a small catchment recognizing that there is a public benefit is Pauline has identified the public benefit as the harbor but again we 're faced with a situation where the regulator is not the person that has to pay for fixing it up and that 's why I keep saying that we have many occasions about our obligations in terms of the our brains to stop working again no our groundwater you know but but but ensuring that that we protect our aquifers the obligation to protect from a regulatory point of view sits with a keen but who pays the price of firoz if it is affected by some sort of inclusion so in it is the city that pays the price so you 've got a separate function between the regulator and and who actually ultimately pays the price and I think that a much more joined up approach would be would be sensible in that regard we did put out the proposal that people consider paying a contribution towards joining the scheme that was what we went and consulted on and I don 't know why anyone in this room was surprised that everyone 's had no you know because the option was we pay a con abune towards us or the city pays it for us completely nobody 's had a conversation about the increased value that that has had and to or the potential increased value to their Yanni that you looked for the value of the properties i had no idea they were valued at that level because that must be a substantial increase from where they were at the time that they were you know originally allowed to build their so we 've ended up with an entire separation of land use planning infrastructure costs and then subsequently an earthquake and I mean I don 't_''_573.209 I don 't know why people don 't see this that it 's that the for the problem that it is that you cannot separate those three things you can 't_''_582.06 and in terms of in terms of this particular issue that we 're confronted with today in a way it 's it 's you know unfortunate that that the timing of this occurred and the way that it did and as I say it should have really been reviewed at the time but i 'm i 'm not going to support the resolution i 'm going to support the amendment to defer it for the three years but in the meantime I would really like us to be talking sharing option some some sort of element of contribution that could bring it forward so if there 's a mechanism for bringing it forward then I think that we could do that in the context of that sort of level of conversation so that 's the way I 'm going to vote on it so if we could have the screen up and those in favor of option 3 has moved and seconded if you could press yes and those pose press know one more everyone so there is some lost and so Vicki you 've you and ya tum now but do you want to add some words to it yep the way how it 's all water the council proceed with the winery waste water scheme and yeah yeah it 's got we 've just changed it to 2018 and again or in the meantime the possibility of a targeted rate yeah bag of the rate will cost sheer or other cost sharing arrangement yeah hey no no well it 's it 's it 's a to proceed with wastewater what this stage two okay that proceed with yeah and then put financial year beginning 1 July 2018 and explore in the meantime the mean times one word is not the possibility of a targeted rate or other cost sharing arrangement arrangements yep and do you think that in terms of that we should indicate that that could that could bring it forward yeah yep that 's me yeah 44 earlier and explore in the meantime the possibility of otago raid or other cost sharing arrangements for earlier implementation so that that way that 's clear that it 's to bring it forward yep okay do you want to speak to that Yanni yeah it seems to me what we 're doing is adding 2 million dollars on budget so can I just get the financial implications of this we 've just got we got them beforehand what what they was to push it forward the three years so the figures that Peter guts all read out before get push forward three years if we did it if we did option one there would be six million today if we do option this one that will be nine extra essentially we 're adding in terms of compared to option one compared to this option I just want to be no no because there 's a um because there 's a cost-share the runner talk you but we had in our budget for 4 20 23 so well okay well then we won 't take the vote on this until we 've got the so we 'll take our adjournment narrow more come back to this after the after the adjournment amor answer that question all right so we 'll adjourn for morning tea and _"

    "text": "though with the with the current knowledge that we have it does to growth etc and needs how what would be the life span of this treatment part do you think prior to spending any more major money on it probably 25 years thank you I remember my question excuse me no my question is in relation to the natural hazards chapter of the district plan so obviously we looked at some maps earlier on and council in relation to you know potential risks around coastal inundation are we putting infrastructure into an area where we don 't necessarily want to encourage a lot more development I think generally the development is in those areas already and the future development is higher up higher up in the catchment so but are we putting the infrastructure in an area of risk yes well we are along the foreshore but the choice of going to pressure sewer make that a much simpler process and a much more robust process given potential sea level rise so what does that mean you can move the pipes or doesn 't matter the types the shallow that they go underwater no it doesn 't matter that underwater oh just stop following on from Tom 's question you talked about the treatment plant being suitable to cater for the existing amount of households and that it can go up by modules so if we put in the centre structure and the population double so another to yet another x-man sections what 's the cost to do that to add these extra modules to cater for a double sigh sighs population yeah I think it 's important to note that the the design the flows that the this treatment plan is designed for were based on our growth projections or councils growth projections and throop until 2041 I cannot tell you what the actual flows will be or what the peak flows will be in summertime but I would suggest that if we do have to add more modules than definitely a very small cost compared with the 8 million dollars we 're talking about at the moment because all the all the foundations of their it is meant literally put in two more times simple question how Allison all right is that enough questions and vianney so I 'm interested in the lack of enforcement from a cane so have we have we raised concerns given our environmental systems with he can about the impact on the environment and if so what 's been Eakins response they 'll go out and look at a septic tank or the drainage field see how its operating if someone complains about it I don 't know where there 's any issues because people don 't tell us but if someone does complain to Environment Canada week they will go out and assess and make the require the property owner to put it right it 's just that but I mean I just wonder because you know we 've heard that it 's in terms of environmental priorities this is pretty quiet because of the environmental impacts and yet we 're also hearing it as being no monitoring at no enforcement of those environmental things because it 's left to an individual property person to complain who you know people probably aren 't going to do if it 's their neighbors gap somewhere because it is really hard to understand how it 's been left to get so bad and it also has hard to understand why he can 't haven 't done anything proactive in that space given all the publicity with that over the last two years on it but have we not formally approached again and said look we 're concerned about the environmental pets and what are you doing about it or are we just leaving it on the individual properties we 've talked to them about the issues out there and they are aware of them but they don 't they won 't_''_264.73 they can 't go to a property unless there 's an issue a particular property unless is an issue raised with it and we don 't have any information on particular property strong and then just the second thing is um so I was just looking at the recent you know property transfers so houses here are selling for you know six hundred and fifty thousand eight hundred and fifty thousand quite a high you know quite a high value area the idea II yeah yeah yeah so you know that 's if you get any imagine that 's before they get connected to the sauce so imagine once that comes in just wondering is there any way and worksheet but they might be the new ones that are already attached these are existing dwellings yeah yeah but there are already ones that are attached earlier they could baby five these look pretty old historic you know farm villagers villas and stuff but I was just wondering in the idea of the concept that you could put a transaction when the property was purchased to acquire some of the funding towards the system so if people are making huge profits from you know they bought the place or a few hundred thousand and they 're now selling up for four times what they paid for it as any mechanism we have to to you know get the cost of that infrastructure particularly with these new ones that it and they know that is existing ones not that I 'm aware of we would have named some legal advice you could do a targeted that I can think about yeah but I was thinking if there could be tied into the sale of the property which would address the financial concern that people have of that being able to afford it because I because I have sympathy with a attitude break is over a period of time you know I mean that is the other option you know in terms of contribution but I mean I 'm blown away I had no idea I never even thought to go and look at how actually properties are worth can 't_''_386.43 be because also yeah you know no karara 's but y know he 's kind of tucked away sort of kind of yeah yeah well um it 's a hugely challenging decision so you know they 're there are there are pluses and minuses but anyway I think it 's probably we 've had the questions and I think it 's time to debate it Andrew so I 'd like to move option three if I can please because you 've gone from URI of anything year one is there an option anywhere in the amendment to Andrews resolution and once he made it just the impact of putting this not a new one that may be in yet three yeah if you could if you could work that out and the meantime yeah move it so not year but said what 's that 2017 to 18 guys just tried to avoid 2020 actually hey 18 19 is it that they would just shut down okay okay so-so andrew is going to move and fill a second down option 3 and Bucky do you want to move an amendment which is to push it out to yeah yeah that 's right do you want it to start this kind of me or are you happy that it could start two or three years out I won 't_''_490.47 except that the amendment might be better to put I mean bethere it is a very difficult thing because there are some people who would support the keys position but not not the alternative so so there 'll be some people who have posed across the board but others would accept that as a compromise we 've gone would myself necessary but foreshadow an amendment around the target rate for properties that have yet to obtain can see in fact we also explore that option as a further amendment to to option three I yeah I I wouldn 't be able to we wouldn 't be able to vote on that without advice so we 'd have to exploring yeah exploring what concept of a targeted rate for Tiger break for for new properties joining the scheme for new properties so that ones that haven 't been built yet is it hmm Mike are you able to give us some quick commentary on there with we talked I mean we 're not making a decision but but there is a idea that we might foreshadow a motion that says to explore a targeted rate for new properties that aren 't yet build joining the scheme or haven 't obtain consent understand the legalities of that the issues of selectively charging a targeted rate to some people there 's also quite a high compliance costs if you 're doing for a very small group of people but yeah the be looked at but perhaps I wouldn 't you wouldn 't want to risk your whole decision on eye on it on the outcome of that I think that that 's this a good point that this there 's really no point sort of voting on exploring something of theorists if there 's a degree of uncertainty of that 's up that level except that 's something we could still ask yeah yeah nobody can we can do that separately from from this process so we 've got Andrew and Phil moving options tree and Vicky an amendment to bring I 'm happy just happy to signal a different motion if this one doesn 't go through and that is an amendment to to this one basically to do to go ahead with it but to start it in year three or four can I do that yep so so you 're foreshadowing that if this fails yes move then you 'll move a another resolution which is that it proceed but in years the financial year beginning 1 July 2018 yep yep okay and we 'll look for a stage is the one that 's in front of us so would you like to start off the debate thank you yeah I believe there are a number of compelling reasons why we should continue with this as planned as we can see from the report it 's been talked about for 30 years it 's been in various LT piece since 2006 and whilst I realized that just because it 's now in an LTP doesn 't mean that that means that it must happen what previous councils and ourselves have done over that period is to raise and to raise expectations on the part of the community that 's we will do this work so it 's not an unreasonable expectation on the part of the community that we would go ahead as planned and it doesn 't come as any surprise to me that that is the result of the consultation that we 've just been through I mean really the community are resoundingly saying to us just go ahead and do this go ahead and do what you said you were going to do so for 's on top of the reputational considerations around the point that I just made there are residents who quite rightly expect that we will go ahead and do this because we 've said on a number of occasions we 've signal on a number of occasions that that 's exactly what we 're going to do now from a financial perspective we 've heard that not doing the work at all is not an option this is a project which will proceed at some point and we 've also read in the report that they 'll never be a cheaper time to complete the scheme than now so in my world that 's a very good reason for signaling we 'll just go ahead and do it we 've got to do it at some point then no better time to do it than now from a financial perspective environmental considerations we 've heard that in terms of environmental values this is a high value project high priority project we 've heard of high bacterial numbers and shell shellfish we 've heard of norovirus in the harbor and we know words like unsee muttering pits tanks and traps overflowing long drops pretty disgusting new zealand 's of first world country christchurch is a first world city and this is a part of christchurch and this is 2015 and i believe that we need to be aspiring to more than some of the ways that the status quo is described in this report is not acceptable for us to continue in this way and there are many compelling reasons for us to go ahead and do this from a cultural viewpoint we heard a very strong and compelling submission from MKT referring to mahak i referring to environmental pollution and other cultural values and it 's unfortunate in many ways that there 's been quite a gap in between that very compelling verbal submission that we heard and the decision that we are making today but cultural values should be in my view a big part of the consideration of this issue for us night our who values associated with a corral harbor are strongly focused on the hanger KY and the discharge of waste to water is inconsistent with these total respect in terms of the way that we deal with those issues so from a cultural viewpoint in my world again it 's essential that we support just getting on with this I just wanted to make a comment around some of the points that have been made about the numbers of properties and holiday homes and holiday homes pay rates to in terms of rating units there 's no difference between a unit which is lived in by a person permanently or a unit which is used as a holiday house and we 've also heard about the huge amount of pressure that the current systems or lack of systems are put under at peak times particularly Christmas holidays and that 's where a lot of my concerns around their environmental values would would come from an uplift in the value of a property as a result of connecting to this scheme and this scheme been available will result in an uplift in the RV of that property and will therefore results in an increase in the rate payable Enki Quilly further growth and development in the area will result in increased rates revenue to counsel so back to some of the issues that we 've traversed in reading the report and answering questions and and the wheel traverse through the debate today raw sewage norovirus bacteria inedible seafood environmental pollution cultural insensitivity all things that we should be avoiding as a council and I 'd like to see this work done for those reasons as planned and undertaken as soon as possible where we 've raised expectations on the part of the community that we were going to do this the community have said that they want it done as soon as possible and as I say that comes as no surprise to me whatsoever and I believe that we 've got financial environmental and cultural responsibilities to to do this and to get on with it as soon as possible and I encourage others to make what I see is the only tenable decision on this today and that 's to proceed as planned and get this work underway ray yeah I mean I support this this plan happening but I don 't support option 3i that will be an uplift in property value from adding this piece of infrastructure and I think you know a lot of these property owners have been in these houses have been there for a long time I think they should be paying something towards this I actually prefer they be paying the lot but you know some kind of cost sharing i think is absolutely appropriate one thing I just want to correct their the Andrew said more houses does not mean more rates it is the rates of spread over more houses so just to sort of clarify that so I don 't know if we can put option one up or or how we 're going to deal with that button so I support us going ahead and doing it actually right now but I 'd like householders to contribute to that our fill well I want to support option three strongly but I 'm not an economist but I really after question I would thought and in fact if we had more houses that would mean more rates that is more money more money coming in in payment and payment for these look I 'm I was open to before the consultation I was certainly open to know having a longer period of time to for the scheme to actually be developed having listened to the people and I went over to why knew he were and counselor tuna and Pam Richardson community board chair I was thoroughly convinced from the honest comments of the resonance to and the holiday batch owners that in fact you know we should not delay on the scheme and that was because of the unsanitary conditions that Mike Burke explained that Andrew tuna referred to and like I think Mike vehicles so made a comment which I guess i think is to focus all of our minds and that is that is it septic tanks I 'm never going to work in these conditions and I think if we if we delay the scheme it is going to cost more and so I just think that the Senate and sanitary nature of this area has been highlighted it 's totally unacceptable that in fact this sort of pollution continues to norovirus really concerns me and I no concern all councillors you 'll be aware that the cdhb pays millions of dollars every year to clean up after norovirus and we are I think we need to make a decision today to prevent it and so I 'm strongly supporting option three Paul I don 't think anybody disagrees that we need to do something about this it is comes down to the level of what we do about it and it is very disappointing that actually play smooth like this this decision was an extra viewed in light of the massive task we have ahead of us at the moment I mean we talked about you know the environmental issues but environmental issues everywhere due to the earthquake everywhere and it 's we do we start first and so prioritizing it to me as a concern you have issues in our heads cut river with with pollution and cultural issues yes I understand knows what we got cultural is around the issues around heathkit river as well the cost who 's paying for the cost i agree with ref I I think it 's really unfair look for a small amount of people the burdens placed on all ratepayers I think that 's actually unfair we also take into account when you 're talking about the environmental issues the issues around the animal waste that runoff from the from the farms in the area so it 's not just the human waste so I won 't be supporting the event the resolution of that year at the moment I were you supporting a cost sharing arrangement as proposed and option one and Tim thank you when this first came to us I think the price that we were given was about fifteen hundred dollars and then that moved on and on with more information so it 's around forty five thousand dollars a household I believe now with then I will I will not be supporting Andrews and fills that I will be supporting Vicki 's for the simple fact that this community has been let down for as Andrew said about 30 years or so and something does have to be done about this but I am incredibly disappointed only organization that has actually taken steps and are now good for 20 years or so I think Josie Schroeder told us and her submission when we talk when we hear a talk of rum overflows and puts overflowing etc that 's personal responsibility and we people do have to take an element of that themselves and it just seems to be lacking here as said I will support and Vicki 's shadow an amendment or however you want to put it the norovirus can also be picked up from fees it anywhere so it may not have been picked up and y know it could have been brought on or whatever there was no proof that it was picked up there so that argument could be someone could have picked it up anywhere so I am disappointed however do em take into account that 6.2 which is really what Vicki is promoting will actually add about 20 sent to the cost of each household but in the situation that we are and now I don 't think we have any choice clean thank you people have been saying all and this is a good indicator I think of that I can see some clear competing interests around stewardship stewardship of land stewardship of money and I suspect what keeps me hanging on to this is MKT but I suspect they would agree over there as well it 's about the whole city the whole place not just this power I 'm fighting this a very difficult position and I 've arrived at the point of wanting to support Vicki 's proposal when I look at the cost-benefit analysis of this as well it 's a pretty tough decision to make but it 's the MKT view that keeps me there but I just can 't quite get myself to to the what Andrew and Philip putting forward so I 'll support that option all right so um okay jaani and I 'll sorry I 'm sorry David is go you go yeah sorry and then yani thank you look this situation is probably back to fronting to normal situations where we get a development sewer system goes in and the cost of the sewer and all the infrastructure is of the section etc I 'm concerned that we 're retrofitting something here and I recall many years ago my parents had a had a holiday home at karate rich and it was on the night cart system there and eventually it got hooked up to sewer and I 'm sure they had a they had to contribute to to actually hooking up to the sewer system so i 'm not particularly in favor of option three or two I like option one where I think there should be some contribution I don 't we haven 't actually determined anything from the dairy to actually contribute to the establishment of the sewer system I think we 're proposing somewhere about around about eight million dollars here to implement this sewer system and why nuit and in my calculation that that comes out to about sixty three thousand dollars per property so it 's a huge cost for us and I think I agree with Paul and other speakers that we we need to prioritize their their expenditure and I agree also that there is at some stage or other and the opinion that yes we need to do something I 'm also of the opinion that I think the residents and batch owners of the settlement need to contribute in some fashion or other to the installation so I 'm not prepared to accept this one and I probably would have some difficulty with a amendment to push it out three years and I would certainly want to explore an option that the residents of this settlement contribute something towards the installation of this project I think it needs to be pushed out a little i would certainly think that three years is probably as far as it should go but in doing that I would certainly want to see a proposal that and showed some contribution from the people of the settlement towards the installation yani around the whole issue of ladies learning this I think and you can 't separate that from financial planning which is really the conversation we 're having today but clearly what comes out through the literature that they 've looked at is the cost of urban sprawl and peripheral development is much greater areas so you know this is the reality of the cost of having a land zoning program that doesn 't match our financial strategy at all so I 'm really worried about the the message that rezoning this land does and the cost to the benefit analysis that you would do I firmly believe that the environmental values are really really important and that you 'll recall when we first consider the scheme I was one of the most vigorous supporters to get on and get it done because we had the contracts and we 've got that good price certainty we 're now hearing that we may be able to continue with that but I I do so there 's a basic principle is that you know we just heard the other day at the strategy and Finance Committee that if we resign the land that 's over by the MP showgrounds it goes from being with a million dollars to having a value of 10 million so I can 't understand when there 's such a huge uplift and value for people that benefit from owning decisions why cost of the infrastructure that enables them to realize those profits and those increased values so I support us doing something at wainui I do think this has been going on for a long time and there are very important environmental issues and it is I think pretty depressing to know that the regulatory body for whatever reason hasn 't really taken the actions that you would expect and we 're hearing some of the environmental issues that are going on maybe that 's for meeting with the e key and commissioners next time we meet we could ask and just try and understand how we got to this point but you know I do think we should be providing the infrastructure and it was again my my original suggestion which I still support as we put a party infrastructure but the cost to connect to it should be include by those who are going to have a significant increase in value to their properties or author those new developers that are coming in who are going to realize getting proper so i would i would support option 3 i is the cost year i think that 's really reasonable and you know you just look at the way in which these properties are being sold so i think some work around that whether it 's a targeted rate recognizing that there will be existing people here that you know affordability will be a key issue but when people sell their houses and make huge profits on them i do think there should be some mechanism that we can look at recovering some of the costs so i think probably a little bit more we 're needs to be done around option one but philosophically I think that is the right approach we 're still shown commitment as a council to dealing with the environmental issues and we were giving an opportunity for those people they 're going to benefit 22 from their improvement Jamie I don 't think anyone expected that when we come to LTP or any decision-making council that we 're confronted with a whole plethora of easy decisions that they 're mostly hard ones and all the options that you have people make really valid points head because everything they say is completely valid I hear feel saying about the environmental issues and the the potential adverse consequences are around health and in disease and that 's what stuff and it 's all really valid I personally feel the easy decision is to proceed as planned but I don 't think that would be doing justice to the role as a city councilor I would emphasize that it 's it 's city councillor and that when I go in here I I can 't look at phenyl from omari as as much as I know that ward like the back of my hand I have to feel that every single suburb every single person that study is equally as and I know that we 're going through such challenging time and I see that we have 66 permanent residents in the area that really have had promises made and I think that a bit of integrity you do we say you 're going to do but unfortunately things change you know and I think the one certainty that we have whether it 's any business or something that you can be sure if you don 't know what it will be like how much will be but that 's why we do an annual plan if the if the unexpected turn to rise we wouldn 't do an annual plan we 'd do a 10-year budget and just roll on through but the unexpected arises and you need to make deviations from that as circumstances change Michigan Science mitigate against risks and in ikea supply financial stewardship and way up those hard decisions to make good financially sustainable decisions and the best interests of the wider territorial territorial authority and through every citizens in this city my personal option i think the most prudent way forward would be to actually defer this out beyond the financial hump of the you know the early 2020s when we get very close to our to our financial limits and i would be looking at pushing that beyond their so deferring it to the 18 28 ltp somewhere in the region of 24 25 that 's incredibly disappointing for the people of wine knowing and I accept their I 'm light of the wider picture because I need to take every single person the city into account and it 's always a trade-off I am prepared to make compromise though that I that I feel that well whilst my preferred decision would be to push it out beyond the financial financially tight time frames of the 2020s I think that as a council we do need a commitment to partnership and working with people because every single person the city is important we want to work with them and if there are creative ways of coming up with solutions then we really need to fully explore them so well option two would probably be my preferred option I will will support option one of a cost sharing arrangement where we can partner with the people there I wish I could support option three but personally I don 't feel it 's the most prudent way to go so I 'm option two is my preferred one but I would look at a compromise with option one which Vicky alluded to Jimmy _"

    "text": "the next item on the agenda is the winery wastewater stage two consultation outcome and the report by the chairperson of the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee so could the relevant staff come to the end of the table and I will invite the chair of the infrastructure transport an environment committee to present the paper well just briefly councils will be aware that the there is funding in the long-term plan I think it 's year the year 23 so the monthly the funding is there there has been extensive consultation with the resonance of wine oohing and that the the Bech holders and councils have been involved in consultation to it was a very strong support for the project to to be proceeded with in with that in mind particularly because of the environmental issues around pollution of the winery harbour the infrastructure transport and environmental committee supported the staff supported recommit the option of option one room which is that in fact the that the scheme be proceeded with but staff can explain their particular environmental features that particularly that the committee addressed I 'm could I timing because as I understand it if that is the decision then it comes forward an hour long term plan and if it comes forward an hour long term plan it has an impact on raids so I think we need to understand what that looks like and whether there is an option of also leaving it at 2023 you know because that wouldn 't have an impact on rate so it peps of if there could be run through and i 'm not i 'm not saying that the environment or shoes aren 't important we 've got huge environmental challenge and all of our rivers and waterways so I mean this is this is one component of a city that has suffered considerable environmental stress as a result of the earthquake and I 'll leave it for the officials to talk to the aspect itself because it 's currently in our list of changes between 223 bringing it back into this this next year 1 July and then through for a year and a half would have the impact on next year 's rates of point zero think after that so that 's just the impact of what we have now is a submission or a recommendation as 23 pulling it back and has those rates and pet but thank you right so who would like to lead off on the environmental west beach I 'll get an introduction from staff fees well it became apparent during the consultation with the residency out there particularly those who are permanent residents that there are a number of issues with the septic tanks that are there and the other systems that are in place long drops and storage tanks that don 't always operate as one would intend and some of the properties aren 't particularly suitable for the use of septic tanks just they don 't have the space and this and the soil conditions aren 't conducive to soak into the ground it 's it 's fair to say i think that the residents weren 't keen to to pot each other in terms of who had the worst in a septic tank that was fairly evident that some of the conditions there are somewhat unsanitary particularly in systems get overloaded to a higher degree so there 's a probably that the key environmental issues whose responsibility is it to maintain septic tanks property owners responsibility to maintain a septic tank so if that 's what they have yeah and we asked questions during the course of the hearings about composting toilets how did that have a base stack up financially that 's that 's that 's a possibility in some situations generally you need to have some elevation to have a composting toilet sort of a couple of meters off the ground kuantan I think that 's where the term throne came from in regular use to i 'm told ya so it doesn t suitable for a holiday hi it probably not know that they do that just caters for the the toilet waste is also the gray water from the rest of the household that needs to be dealt with as well ok all my questions more a comparison for environmental issues and obviously about the environmental issues these guys have them with the damaged infrastructure we have in Christchurch and the leaching into the the sewer and the wastewater systems are quite critically damaged would you say in your opinion that the problem is worse on the side of the hill that is on why no II do it you try to compare two different things really it 's really about though damaged infrastructure we have in here is a way they 're getting lynched into by the sewer at the waist a little ways do suffer overflows in wet weather the rest of the time most of the infiltration is into the sewer system not out of it at similar winter well any time when the ground water levels free up yeah and the summer the limits dry and the table goes down it goes out there 's not much driving here to drive waste water out of the pipes there 's the depth and the pipe and there 's lots of lumps on the inside to help block cracks but when you 're in the other way around when the groundwater is high and the levels low in the pipe the water pulls them so that the net effect is greatly towards for a comparison that 's probably hard for stuff I 'm Phil and then Andrew just four hours no question is want to clarify the council 's I see adoption one in fact it does option through three which actually is the immediate the approach it will proceed immediately Christian really is around the pollution air spects and it preps my understanding is in fact it 's hard to measure that the quantity say that comes from agriculture while we 're farming in animals into the ends up in the winery hover is against the the human part of batches and in septic tanks but could you just spritz explain a little bit about those different streams if you like a pollution but also could you comment on 11 SP which certainly was a concern was that there had been an incident of norovirus in the community which was traced to the Y new area but could you just comment on those aspects of pollution things the general runoff from agricultural land does contribute to bugs in the harbor and pollution in the harbor and it 's very difficult to to measure the difference between the source of bugs and you need lots of high numbers to be able to measure that that difference so it comes from from both sources the the results of the consultation people talked about smelling surge and the roadside drains and summertime smelling sewage on the beach so that I think it 's indicative of leaching from systems into the environment when it 's when it 's dry and whether you usually don 't notice it because it runs off quite quickly and into the water the monitoring that 's done is very relatively intermittent it 's one day a week in the summer for 15 weeks and that 's when sometimes you pick up lots of bugs usually usually in winter but the norovirus issue that 's very difficult to pinpoint the source of but the source of noroviruses is human waste and it can be passed through water or it can be passed by hand to mouth contact so can 't tell where it came from but the source of noroviruses is human Andrew thank you just to follow on from councillor slightly different way in terms of value for money in environment environmental income outcomes and in terms of prioritizing various projects that we could do where would this winery wastewater scheme fit on that list of priorities would it be a high priority or a lower priority project in terms of those environmental outcomes I think it 's a reasonably high priority project relatively great thank you there 's been a lot of talk about the continued use of septic tanks and in particular people 's ability to replace septic tanks or to install septic tanks in place of long blond rocks and so on having been out to winery and had a look and having spoken to a number of the residents out there you know the ground conditions obviously vary from property to property and it 's my understanding that there are some properties in fact probably quite a large number of properties where a septic tank is is not a possibility are you able to make some comment on the the reasons for that and what would prevent a septic tank been used in those cases if from the septic tank and if the property doesn 't have a lot of space it doesn 't have space to put a field drainage system in and there 's some properties over there that are on very steep sections partially on rock that you don 't get any drainage from anyway so those sorts of properties either have a hold on the ground or some sort of storage tank they get pumped out from time to time thank you and final question we 're talking obviously about certain considerations about when this work gets done whether it gets done now as planned or whether it 's deferred and my question really relates to the the financial value of deferring it I guess the first question is it fair to say this work needs to be done at some point anyway and the follow-on question from that would be is it fair to say that it would be more expensive to do it later than it would to do it sooner so we 're actually better just to get on with it well certainly there will be will be more to be done at some point so not doing the work at all isn 't an option I don 't think that 's an option at all Tim I queue that our suspicions before with the individuals maintaining the weather there long drops or whether they are septic tanks could the environment have improved that was undertaken because some of the questions and some of the feedback was that this has not been done in fact one guys seen each you see away when they came and suggested they were going to fix the sewer pipes it said others no point because the caps is going to do that although successive councils over the last 20 years haven 't done anything so I mean both the standard of maintenance by those arm submitters had been better with this problem beliefs but don 't for a lot of it I don 't think it 's an issue around maintenance for a lot of the septic tanks they don 't either going to work on those conditions and and like it or not previous councils have permitted development committed buildings to go source of waste disposal so that 's the situation we 're in whose job is it to inspect 1363 tanks it 's a regional council function and they will do that but usually only on the basis of some complaining that you know if someone septic tank is overflowing onto the neighbors the neighbors might complain about that but generally people don 't seem to wanna pop their neighbors but ever you know you have an environment that is sensitive they won 't react to that is ecru they don 't go looking routinely inspecting septic tanks now and we have no information to assist our residents Dewey with regards to I know that I 'm Auckland and both gisburn and other councils have good information on maintaining and managing the septic tanks we have nothing do we generally not considered a an urban issue it 's a generally a rural issue and the Regional Council permit consent provide consent for septic tank installations but a consent is different to maintenance advices and is so we know we knew we 've got a problem in a sensitive environment but technically it 's great thank you just a question on the quiz I asked um pouco take Jamie because sorry my brain had two questions but first our 2 point 0 to 200 readers regarding to the consultation and you have any information regarding tolosa 6 others including MKT the Heritage New Zealand and the community public health their response they support the option one option 2 or absolute 3 I know nkt certainly supported getting it done now yes I think the community and public health also supported getting it done now of some of the other non-resident submissions were from odd organizations that didn 't really have much to do with the issue I felt here at each new zealand for example i 'm more concerned about what happened to a young dig holes and second questions are Rica the coast compared to last a year you know it 's kind of increased from the original seven million to the eighth a minion so around the one minute by minute almost a 14 percentage except the nature inflation who else those allows the project manager to answer that in to look at the costs again because it 's been quite some time since these estimates came in and that 's this is the revised cost and it you write it as an extra million quarter is from the original that atender is original one yeah this is an avid updated estimate the original okay tinder price was less but that gone no okay thank you yeah I 'm brief just uh yeah a couple of questions so it 's since it there 's only 60 permanent residence is that correct so what 's the cost per property of doing this per property developable property this is a permanent residence it worked out didn 't we work it out there was sixty-six thousand dollars into companies to acknowledge it as original as peer property of permanent residents when we take out the holiday homes there 's a very expensive you a lot of these hasn 't been here for some time you see I 'm is it not responsibility of the householder to make sure we 're not polluting the National Armed use and other rules or lines and place action against the property for for polluting the environment on the medical officer of health could also take action if one property leads to another Council is having to bear the costs of doing this I mean you know clearly I 'm it 's a lovely skin and all that but why we having to pay for it I think it 's just historical that councils have allowed development in areas that that weren 't serviced with the sewer system and over the years Christchurch is done the same has extended the sewer system out and out and out and picked up those outlying areas and makes potential is no different so in terms of option one which is as basic I hate use the word cost-sharing but a cosh Technic rape and with the council you can just explain how that would work out the intent of that option was to ask the property owners really what what would they feel about sharing a part of the cost that 's not been done for these precious sewer systems installations in the city in existing areas existing Saudi Aries the of the total cost that the property owners would then have to beer but then they may choose not to join not to join up at least initially but let me obviously in town you expect to be on no sewer system obviously these house has been here for a long time and have been coming to you taking care of their own surge facilities and in terms of the console tell me clearly nobody wants to pay for it but I just struggled see why council should be varying the full cost of us and in terms of these options there 's no options here for putting new modern septic tanks on these properties is that something that was consist it 's not a realistic option to do that the properties just don 't have the space or the ground conditions to be able to take a septic tank in a field time some do and some work okay about half the properties there have a septic tank of all the properties there and about half of those operate okay so there 's there 's 75 percent of the very well or a long drop or what even has an electric toilet a cooker so largely largely an unsatisfactory situation okay all right thanks yani um thank you I 'll just understanding that we 're almost doubling the growth and population by if that skin goes our hear that now freeze up that development so have we looked at an option where through the dc 's policy that we could expect those new properties to pay for the cost of the the scheme which is effectively a subsidy to that private developer to be able to you know make lots of money from the rezoning so you know could we do something like put in the scheme but then have the 20,000 per property four new connections aren 't based on that growth that the scheme will enable that 's effectively what DC 's do but it 's not the figure globally across the city is not 20,000 for wastewater it 's around ten maybe eight to ten so that 's what new properties would pay when they join up to the system so there 's been a hundred terms of development as well right and there may be other people that are rezoning land waiting for this decision that that will you know by Apple in their will in totally there are any disease as well so what I 'm asking though is if we were concerned about the cost of the scheme and we wanted a a more over cost year type option to expect new development to pay an even greater percentage is there something we can do I 'm sure the council could decide to have a targeted development contribution if I wish for that area okay I don 't know whether financial staff one I don 't know whether that 's correct so what might would you like to comment on that I mean because I mean it is a development contribution question I don 't know that we can under the law target in that way or what we could do a targeted braid we can have it I Mustafa taste we can have a catchment for DC 's and I think we can have it as big or as small as we proceeds yeah thank you you 'd be very beautiful about time too narrow catchments down to individual small groups it may be possible in real life why new I mean one of the things you 've got to we have to check out legally as we can recover DC 's for backlog we can 't recover DC 's for a level of service lower than we would be required to provide so Annie could only happen where there is new and we all growth and that 's the only portion we can recover through DC so and I 'm not entirely familiar with the way nui situation but it may not be as straightforward as that we 're saying we can add niche the VC charge to those properties and did you have another question I just in terms of the resource conceived was there any requirement on the developer to pay a contribution towards the upgrade of the infrastructure I mean one of the submissions we heard was really critical of the fact we want people living in the central city and we want to have more efficient use continuously spend huge amounts of money for this kind of growth on the periphery so I just wondered in terms of the question of who 's paying for it with a through that zoning resigning or that can see there was any condition on the developer to pay a certain amount if they want to bet development to happen to consider the consent for the wastewater theorists for discharge to land it doesn 't take into account who 's contributing to that discharge it 's real it 's merely around the conditions and to which we can discharge to the lamp I 'm Claire so basically that consent says you could if you can discharge tool and you can build as much as you want no no but you know I 100 properties or however many you 've applied for well in the design of the system so far for the application tool and it takes into account future growth the capacity of the system for the land application that 's already there takes into account the future growth all right but but I 'm just trying to think like 's a lot of resource concede no simply because there 's no sewer system for them to connect you so they don 't get it can see right so there 's enough so there 's nothing in terms of 100 100 proposed properties that 's just they 're not consented youth night but I 've got the zoning appalled that yes David look we heard it just earlier that there are 60 permanent residence we had 88 submissions but I 'm a little unclear as to how many what 's the total number of properties in the area in here just how many of them cific long drop or any other is it is about a hundred and sixty existing properties 35 out of those 34 35 are on an existing gravity network through the developer built treatment plant some years ago that is now directed up to a forest block for land application it used to be a harbour discharge it 's now going to land so that leaves about 125 26 existing properties and of the total properties about 60 a permanent residence so there 's about 66 the ratio of septic tanks too long drops to I understand about half the properties have that are not on this existing reticulation system after properties had septic tanks and the other half have some other sort of system a long drop storage tank electric toilet whatever and here you know how what the regularity of a clean of a septic tank would be over there it depends on the use some would be annual sum would be five yearly so if someone cleaned their septic tank annually it 's it 's not the cleaning of the tank it 's the disposal field and the ability of the disposal field to take the water from the septic tank the septic tank is not a storage vessel as such it 's a treatment process partial treatment process will treat an annual cleaner but will surely improve the efficiency of the septic tank not necessarily know it depends how the solids are building up in it and at what point it starts to get full wondering whether in the short term it would be cheaper clean the septic tanks regularly rather than frequency of cleaning septic tanks up to a point would improve that improves the operation of them le page 42 looks at some of the breakdown of costs in the estimate there are a number of unknowns I 'm highlighted and match and I so I 'm asking whether that is over concern to you and potentially what that could mean as far as costco but also i see the treatment plant is sourced from overseas and it 's quite a large the overall cost are you confident that that is the only plant that 's available and there 's nothing available closer or cheaper than they asked Peter Brocklehurst answer that piece of project this council is why the specialized right all the available treatment plants package treatment plans we call the black box okay they do come from overseas this particular one comes from France and it is subject for it and we know all those happened in the last month on our exchange rate there are that is that is one of the biggest unknowns the cost of purchase and installation of that was 1.7 million in was only an estimate which we asked them to do for back in November it was an estimate based on their previous tendered price plus some allowance for escalation but nothing for for an exchange there are indeed we have learned lesson a lesson from the word we didn 't charges Bayon similar scheme that it is impossible to know on 126 properties to go and survey them geo technically prior to tendrán it is also the jet location of the grinder pumps on any given section is to a large extent up to the property owner exactly where they want us and we don 't know the route until we know the final location and what they could add some costs do you have any idea in Chartres Bay we know what it costs and that 's that sort of percentage we did allow in our contingency which is the million dollars effective price I 'm term again um what is the robustness of this you know we 've got you 've given us the numbers with regards to dwellings permanent this holiday I 'm just wondering we 're robust how future-proofed is this waste treatment plant I mean we 're already looking at is Ellie mentioned you know if you 're looking at the summary or 3.3 on page was at 34 with regards to could be another million dollars so I 'm just wondering how robust that says is it sit up to cater for what number and because we have no idea what may happen in the future with development we 've got this development that the harbor sections is almost going to double the population on the the design for the treatment plant is is modular so that you can add units to it to increase its capacity over time if you need to will provide for the basic existing number of properties and a part of the development but development occurs over time we can any modules to it we haven 't specified a particular type of treatment plant we 've made a suggestion as to 21 that would be okay and I think and attend around we got several different options for treatment plants and the tender process _"

agenda right just just because of the the sensitivities of you know the that you know the fact that two of our counselors are on the Burwood Pegasus community board I would I haven 't even discussed it with them but I was going to suggest that myself and Bucky move and second the staff recommendation and the subsequent resolutions which I 've moved as which I 've included in the report as well it just pro forma I mean can you have you got the other resolutions as well Lexie photo I wanted for you to be the second it for the previous report just hey no way that we can change it sorry I just the previous report I just thinking about I wanted Vicky to be the second they 're just given that no I just thought it made a big hey no no she just wanted she just wanted to get fun all 1 to 32 33 can you go down to the subsequent resolutions yeah the mayor 's proposal and just can you will deal with them as one paper and can you put those three resolutions as 37.3 yep and there 's a couple of words that need to be changed on the on the last one hang on Phillip so I 'll just sort this 37.4 no 37.3 that 's right isn 't it or is it for the first one yeah and and 37.5 could you take out the first sentence of that no agree that accounts will be willing seller to the minister of the qe2 site and go that take that out up to the word site delete that and then start the sentence once once the final parameters of the school 's requirements for the qe2 site are settled author I take out the word there by and authorized staff to negotiate and then it doesn 't talk about lease or sale or anything like that it just talks about negotiating with the Ministry on a unilateral basis all right Phil I 've got a further speak to that now just flagged I 've got an amendment just to add it sorry to add to the staff recommendations 5.1 5.2 so I 'm not sure it fits with yours hang on can we go back up and it 's to see if they 're if they kept their compatible whether we can throw them in yep so my amendment is in relation to what 's on page 419 and at the end of three point one point three with as reference there two conditions really for option three that the be consultation with the community and also the condition of the role and function as a second point my point is about the third one where the references to not increasing capital in operational costs over the lot of the life of the facility but it 's also what I just like those that are matters especially in the capital building costs to be reported back to council problem by way of achieve committee well hang on um sorry so it was particularly sorry after three any cost overrun thank you David and that 's excellent happen but that is the current practice and this i 'm just really asking speed four episodes absolute clarity pressure that 's what we don 't want an amendment that says in the event of any cost overrun there is no ability to have a cost overrun there is no ability for anyone to spend more money than then as budgeted for the prospect that the phrase that you want is that any changes to facility scope design components or otherwise cannot cannot result in an increase to any of these budgets without an expressed decision of the council which is what 's stated in the paper I don 't mind if do you want the the costs and everything to come back via the via your your committee rather than the booooored Pegasus community board the cheat committee would pertain no but why well it 's it 's sort of like he 's instruct officers take a reason to be able to report back to council through the Burwood Pegasus community board why would it come through a committee and not through the community board well it could and counts will be across any of any additional expense ideas okay we do not it 's quite clear that will not be a cost overrun yeah I guess just to ensure that that in fact that does happen that that information comes back to me too committee and as david has said that 's regular reporting anyway look can we just write an a3 3.73 it 's 3.73 year it is and just take the second sentence of the financial implications of the paper is that all right any changes to facility scope design components or otherwise cannot result in increase to any of these budgets without an express decision of the council that 's making it crystal clear that 's clear that 's yep and I think stuff or agreement that they can happen thank you and and maybe it should actually that should be 37.2 and sorry I think I think counselor clearwater 's saying that he would like to have it explicit and hear what I 'm included in the paper although i am and i can with the updated design procurement options of culture okay you think they just don 't want to change the numbers so put a semicolon after sooner and put noting yeah so take out the 3.3 37.3 take it back up so it 's all in one noting that any changes to the and kit take it so that 's at the end of the sentence so it 's part of this part of the paragraph so just do it delete after the semicolon will probably bring it up no no that was a good idea I don 't know do people want to leave the data at November can we are we able to change the date are you able to bring it forward to October yeah but October or sooner if possible I mean is that possible well I think you 're getting the clear message from Council that we 'd like to see it sooner all right um but so are there any questions that people have of staff around the whole the whole lot because I wouldn 't mind commenting on my my paper because it does raise a number of issues that that have been sort would people like me to just comment quickly on on the issues that i braid there are two things that I think have who have wondered what was a process that was intended to be and incredibly positive and in my view an incredibly powerful process I actually went back to the fourth of September recording of the aircar meeting that with the resolution that was passed which has become the subject of of so much angst that particular meeting it was amazing to watch to go back and watch and to see the excitement on everyone 's face when the resolution was carried and I know we were all out there in North New Brighton and that there was there was a real sense of of achievement and so it was really disappointing to find that members of the community advisory group had become disenfranchised and it was interesting because this morning and this is why I wanted this report done at the same time as Robert yoga verte who spoke for the community advisory group to have him here for this part of the debate because when he at the prospect of heaven to schools coming into the board Pegasus area and for it to be co-located with the eastern sport and Rec Center that that may not have happened and that incredible sense of excitement and opportunity as what we want to see and it 's what every single piece and I speak to out there tells me as the as the feeling and then it somehow gets translated into the sense of disenfranchisement but you know when Robert was speaking this morning and he talked about the sense of loss and the sense of you know even navigating your way around the streets out there I know what it 's like I live out there I don 't live as far east as I used to and but but what you do yeah and it does have an impact and it 's a psychological impact that you cannot you cannot explain and I was saying this at a at a meeting we were we were having the other day when I think it was Charles Montgomery was was over here and I said you know that airport after having been in Wellington and in going down Anzac Drive you know seeing the poppies and driving down anzac drive and then going across the ends at bridge with those fantastic Franz you know just that whole sense and I used to sit back and I used to think this is this is wonderful I love it and I was going home and to tell you the truth about a year after the earthquakes I actually my heart used to sink when I got to the poppies and I actually used to feel like oh no I 'm going home you know like and nobody should have to feel like that but that 's what people feel like out there and I think sometimes you know those those those of us that don 't love the air should should go out there sometime and just think what it 's like day after day after day it is a grind so I kind of want to do what I can to clear the air because it 's apparent that my amendment caused some of the the misunderstanding so that it were on the fourth of September which stated instruct staff to re-engage with the community advisory group to inform the scope of the facility and that should and that should any further significant information come to the light which the Community Board considers may impact on the location then the community advisory group should be reconvened to consider the further information now there are several things about that resolution one is that we were waiting to see whether we had we 're waiting for the findings of the feasibility study in relation to the geotech reports for the site so was the site good enough to build on and instructing staff to re-engage with the community advisory group to inform the scope of the facility that was the statement that SAT there on its own I added the rest of the words and struggling staff to re-engage with the community advisory group to inform the scope the facility was not was not something that occurred staff already had the advice from the community advisory group as to what the they believe the scope of the facility should be and present to the community board on matters of sky in relation to that so there wasn 't a separate reengagement on the scope when it came to that meeting that was to inform them that the ministry had chosen that site for the two schools and and to inform them of what the scope would be and that I think led to a significant degree of misunderstanding the second point was that the reason that I moved the the second part of it was that if the land wasn 't suitable then you wouldn 't necessarily want to go to option to you want to go back and talk to the community advisory group as to whether option to still really was you 'd want to test it again and the absence of their preferred site and the second reason that I moved it was there if if the Ministry of Education had chosen bill would park and we were agreeable to their occurring then would you want to revisit the site and I thought well that 's not something that the council should predict that 's something triggered by that there was further significant information that would trigger further involvement so the intention of it and I know that people have said that I moved the motion an order that the community board would be reconvened if the decision was made if the two schools were to convene on the on the qe2 site there 's a complete opposite or was if the decision wasn 't that one because that was the decision that really we all wanted and it 's fantastic news for the community I don 't think that the community advisory group will be or members of the community advisory group will be disenfranchised by the process that we now propose which is to to make sure that we get a very good partnership agreement in place between the council the bill would Pegasus community board the local office of the ministry surely boys high score now inside girls to facilitate a shared engagement with the wider community over the collocation of the eastern Rick and sports center and the two schools and to maximize all of the opportunities that this will bring to the community it has to be because this is and I keep saying this the hole is bigger than the sum of its parts it 's something that we really do need to think about what can we bring you know as the school really going to other two schools going to need student health facilities when there 's a medical center there is this an opportunity for the Medical Center to expand what it offers you know so there are so many different things you know early childhood education and the area as well you know that there are so many issues there and you can start to think I mean when you think of the how many thousand kids will be coming into the area on a daily basis yeah so what it wasn 't_''_1110.58 the answer I was looking for that but if you know what I mean can you think of think of those kids at the SS bringing all of their energy and talent into the area so I just think that the opportunities are magnificent I expect to see the Traverse wetlands replanted you know it and you know from their neighboring schools and I just think the opportunities are absolutely fantastic so so that 's why I did want to clarify this choosing the staff option for the community board to be engaged in each aspect of the scope and concept design of the eastern reckon sport and and getting that report back to hear but in the meantime entering into a partnership agreement that broadens the conversation beyond the community advisory group to a shared engagement with the wider community over the colocation potential I just I don 't think that that 's disrespectful to the role that they 've played up until now and and it as a role that I think would be useful for ring-fenced components of decisions and the future but I think that there is a little bit of still a little element of of repairing relationships that I 'm very happy to assist with them in whatever way that I can but I 'm sure that each and every one of those community advisory group members will continue to be the passionate energetic and committed advocates for their a way of engaging and this process and the way that they have in the past so is there anyone who would like to comment on that or we can debate it if you like yep David it 's been the issue of this facility sort of dragged on for quite some time now and I really fun on his team for this autumn 's before us today 1.1 summarizing this is a report presenting options on decision making process around the facility the scope and it 's a result of the workshop that we had with cheap highlighting some other points here 3.1 wewe state in this report goal of the stakeholders is building a very best facility than me feed funding allocation it 's quick possible I couldn 't stress that one anymore and really you know there 's been a lot of concern expressed about the role of various in the community all the options that have been presented rely on community engagement and consultation so no one 's going to miss out on Google we 're just broadening the sphere of involvement and getting a greater three because it really does and I 'll just quote from the report again it 's conditional on the board consulting with the community in line with the council 's best practice it 's also conditional on any alterations to the scope and design not changing the intended role function as a facility and not increasing the capital operational costs over the life of the specific quite clear what the role is and I think there 's some very good outcomes that can can come out of it looking at 3.5 just the advantages and disadvantages of option 3 and most appropriate for the list of reasons up there and I really think the last three are quite good quite good to emphasize again provides for a wide-ranging community consultation led by the elected community board it will limit potential delays to the project wreath from Rio or not impact on the overall affordability and high-level role and the function of this facility I think the mayor has as well elucidated the role of the keg process to date and the fact not going to be disenfranchised they 're part I get the greatest outcome and I think that 's been well it 's a day that we had defense istic opportunity surely boards hire Laban side gills like relocating in the eastern suburbs we are rebuilding a community sport and recreation facility and I think the combination of the facilities that the school will offer that are available for the community as well as well as the publicly owned community recreation facilities will be one of the greatest it 'll probably end up being sort of the second hub behind nap anyway in the city so I am very keen to support this proposal I had said to meeting with John a couple of days ago that I really am keen to see this facility constructed constructed and located in such a manner that should we ever need to expand on the facility in ideas time and there 's a need for another Paul or driving facilities or heaven forbid another 50 meter pool that we can build it but let 's get on and do this but he now I think the capacity that 's in this facility couple of days ago i believe that we could create a facility there that as a bare minimum will have ten lanes and available for swimming if we adopt a small variation we could increase it they 're very cunning with their leisure Paul the way we configure that we could probably get another four or five lanes of swimming in this potential is there to actually create a huge amount of public usage the conceptions that the school may take over or some other group may take over I believe we 've got the potential to make a great facility and I will edge fellow councillors to support option three let 's get on with this project as we can as we know we need some aquatic facilities I 'm very supportive from urge you all to support this and let 's get on with it as quickly as possible thank you glean you look just to say I think yep its crack on this report gives me confidence that they will still be community involvement we could have a share an idea along the lines of pool an coming into wellington you know on a plane you hit turbulence but you eventually get there and I I 'm not surprised that we 've had a rocky road to be honest just with what 's the community 's gone through the seismic events and a whole lot of things rendered them powerless so it 's like that they have a very significant part to play in determining how the how this works together well up like yes and this was the original intention of eastern vision was to have that overarching strategy because we look at this in terms of an arc you 've got huge investment going in booooored hospital 2 k 's way you come to qe2 huge investment going in there and move 2 k 's further on if we can either invest in your bright and that you know too that kind of Central Local Government Partnership in terms of the investment in the area and this is what I 'm hearing so I think if we can join it all up and make it work that would be good but elet 's keep pushing i 'll just the only comment that i 'll just make at the end is that you know when we go out there to tender i 'm sure that there are going to be interested parties because I hear this message everywhere I go that if you put the dollars and cents out there rather than the scope and say what could you build for this then we 're going to get a much better deal in a much bigger scope so we 're in it 's pretty clear that there are people sitting there waiting for contracts like this to come unto the market as we were whoo-hoo say to us we have been able to deliver an other cities in New Zealand so this is not even you know a pie in the sky non comparable environment we 're talking pretty straightforward companies who know what they 're doing who can do better than what we think we can get for the scope and the cost that we put on it I was just winding up the debate yeah so but I 'm certain no no no and think your amendments fine so in its that 's here it 's only briefly that 's not it 's not to expect in this particularly the counselors and the community board is not there 's no expectation that in any way that the community will the delegation the community board is as minimized it 's really just for clarity for us as a decision ya know and that 's absolutely fine but I think the point that I was making is that there are companies out there who are looking at contracts like this and who are going to deliver us the heck of a lot more no I 'm sorry I just wanted to end that debate there I only spoke because that was the last wind up so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and i will move and forkie ball stickam that we take the PX motion as the item 24 on the agenda for all the reasons set out in the attachment and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried _"

    "text": "le let 's keep it snappy I don 't have to queue larly emotional attachment to the town hall I had to say apart from seeing my first concert there shakin Stevens in the 1970s unlike david which is probably much earlier it would make her something i mentioned but i hadn 't made my mind up about the town hall I 'm feeling really the last couple of days and I felt that the information that we 've been given has obviously in fact i have previously said with the information that i have had that i didn 't support retaining restoring than the or appearing sorry the town hall this I believe it 's not a heritage New Zealand classified building it is on our city plan I think as one of my colleagues has mentioned but I 'm hoping that that doesn 't actually restrict in any way some of the changes that need to be made I think it would be a different kettle of fish if it was actually a part of the Heritage New Zealand classification system so the information that staff have provided options that I was in favor of previously just don 't seem to stack up don 't stack up as I thought that they did and that 's why I will be supporting the staff recommendation today thank you there anyone else I 'll just close off the debate then I want to begin by rejecting the argument that this is an emotional decision attached to the connection with the building and I like everyone else has got experiences I went there on opening day that whether there was a big public open day and I was 12 years old and I remember looking at those designs on the you know the sort of kind of but would he call them the the mural we called the murals in those days and an N reflection of hilda ogden on Coronation Street but but the thing was was that it was it was an amazing place it really was you know and as a 12 year old looking around it just really was quite outstanding and I 've seen great concerts there I 've performed on both stages the James hey the lowborn burn then but on both occasions people won 't be surprised it was debating not performing it any other way and but but it was just it was a fantastic place and will be again and it it is a heritage building it 's listed on our city planners a category one building and I think that if anyone 's going to reflect on lessons learned it should have been listed nationally you know it is a terrible oversight that this building wasn 't listed nationally because I think that we would have had another Champion at our side if it had been and I think that that would have been incredibly helpful it meets every criteria to to have been listed so that is something that we need to take on board and I know that Jonnie has raised it before that we 've got to keep a constant vigilance for what is our next layer of heritage the second point that I want to make is that it is repairable I just want that moment to sink in for everyone this is a building that can I have remained committed to delivering on as part of an agreement that was entered into the cost sharing agreement said it was the council 's decision about what would happen with respect to the town hall but the most telling and why I want this in the public arena and I do apologize to the people at the end of the table and why I wanted a read into the record as people don 't go back to the original deal that was done and in the central city recovery plan exceed the precinct designation will be sufficient to provide for a range of facilities in the event that the town hall cannot be repaired so at the time that the central city covery plan was written nobody had an expectation that you 'd knock down a building that could be repaired but it 's not just any building it 's a category one here at ad building on our city plan and I think that there is something terribly terribly wrong in our city and I 've never really been able to put my finger on it my time he says I know they 've struck oil off the coast and they just haven 't told anyone they 've got money to burn there is something wrong in a city when people say it 's okay to knock down repairable buildings because they 're in the wrong place there 's something fundamentally wrong with that why isn 't anyone saying that not allowed to applaud so and there 's also something even more wrong when people say it 's okay to knock down a heritage building when it is repairable as well and even if it 's not economic to repair the standard for for knocking it down is very very high and that 's why we have resource consent protections around our heritage buildings in terms of demolition and use it only applies to the demolition part of it or where there is a fundamental change to the character or it alters the the heritage fabric of the building itself but so so even knocking down part of the building you know that still requires us to meet a very very high test and that is the council and make a decision like this that is the obligation that we have to consider before we make decisions but I think that in a way you know being carried away by the sort of almost the the audacity and the magnificence of the of the blueprint and its announcement and the way that it was I think people did get carried away with the sense of you know you know we can have it all we can have everything we can knock down what we don 't want we can replace it with something brand new and and we are going to be able to afford to do that as a city and as a country with the central government support and I think something got lost something got swept away and the momentum of that occasion and in a way it 's ended up holding us back and the momentum that was supposed to be generated by that sense of excitement I don 't feel that sense of momentum right now I actually want to recapture that sense of momentum I don 't regret for a minute i 'm debating it for the first time as the mayor of the city and the reason that i wanted to have in front of us a report and i like Glenn Livingston didn 't make comments about it until I 'd read it and I think that it is important to have in front of us an accurate detailed assessment of what the options truly are and I 've going to say this because the one thing that i have found actually quite inexcusable by the public discourse and this regard was the description of this as a lost opportunity saying that this decision was the alternative to building a brand new Performing Arts Center precinct can I just say that that statement is an accurate n misleading utterly and accurate and utterly misleading because we now have the numbers in front of us we can see that it 's not accurate to say that we could even replace what we have now with the cost of repair if we were to build from scratch somewhere else so it isn 't correct that this is the alternative to having exercising its legal nations to protect its city 's heritage that is why we are elected to represent those that aren 't in the position to make those decisions for us I think that the cost share agreement number was plucked out of the air anyone can quote me on that and I think that it is important that we have now in front of us the facts of the matter so that we can consider the decision that we need to make today and you see on it is for once in for all so on that note I would like to separate off 22.1 I know that there were two elements that in the course of the debate that I do think that would be worthy of some consideration but I just kind of I don 't think that we need to add them to it but in the context of have you ever got some words there that might be helpful which would be a comma after repair delete the word end and then after restoration add the words and improvement of functionality well that I mean I mean that 's within the heritage yep right it 's just in Kachin yep that 's good and the second thing that that and it was something yani said to which was you know imagine capturing all their energy to to fundraising for components of the restoration so i think that we might be looking at whether we can establish a fund that might actually enable people to contribute directly to the restoration project as well all right so i 'll put that first recommendation all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that 's carried and just much Jamie golf opposed and then I 'll put the remaining recommendations that 's right I 'll put the remaining recommendations all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried unanimously well not you doing very good right we 've got one other item on these changes its people that ever _"

    "text": "no you are not going to finish it but Vicki and away okay so so I am totally persuaded by the report I think that there are a number of issues let 's go through six financially the stacks up as the best option and you 've outlined those incredibly clearly in terms of arts performance culture people coming together which is actually what a city is about and this provides the venue quickest let 's look at the time lines we go with us we get it by June 2018 we don 't go with us and we have another debate about the Christian and I 'm sufficiently aware of the history of Christchurch so that that 's a debate that can go on for an incredibly long time first time around 100 years so I am really not keen to enter that debate I think actually also the fourth one is our sense of identity and for all of us I think the Town Hall create is has got a fragment of us and there there 's an event or something that we associate with the Town Hall I think that 's kind of what we see it is and like many people in Christ you to sort of having their house repaired it would be so lovely to have the city 's living room actually functioning in the way that a living room does bring people together brings life energy events fun back into the central city and I think the fifth point is the fact that the central city needs that like fun energy and a place where we come together and I think the other point is that for us this is for Christchurch people this actually has a sense of our place and that the Town Hall is kind of associated with Christ Church and it is an incredibly important part of the history of Christchurch I have a green light that Dave 's given me that I think we just need to press on a whole pile of issues I don 't think we can criticize delays and Metro sports or convention centers unless we 're actually on the projects that we 're in charge of I think if we can do this that really matter to us as a city at least partly back into the central city where people come together and feel good actually about living in this community and I think that 's a major part of what the Town Hall does and I am really keen to vote for this restoration and this full repair and restoration to crash into town hall and get the start of next week so thank you for the report I think it was excellent it made the decision incredibly easy because everything aligned so thank you Andrew great thank you yeah we 've we 've heard some really strong and well articulated arguments for why we should do this why we should restore and save the town hall and I 'd like to thank the people that came along and made those submissions today and yesterday but I 've heard some really good and well put arguments outside of this chamber in the last couple of days as well as to why we should restore the town hall why we should save the town hall and I think it 's fair to to make this afternoon is is well anticipated by a large number of people in the city I think this will turn out to be a pivotal moment in the recovery of the city and I was even more pleased when we were briefed a little while ago and I realized that the staff recommendation was going to be to fully conserve and repair the town hall and I was even more pleased when I went through the financial information in the report line by line and that also supported the full repair and restoration because this is a decision that we knew was coming up and I 'm pleased that certainly in my world it 's become a far easier decision then I 'd perhaps anticipated it would be so we 've heard many positive things about town hall in the last couple of days many of which I wasn 't previously aware of I mean truly this is a landmark building we 've heard how the building was the first of its kind we 've heard about the amazing acoustics we 've heard about the way that the into an amazing experience not only for performers but for audiences as well and my first visit to the town hall to see a performance was in fact on my first visit to Christchurch back in 1993 and I 've been back there many times since and obviously hoped to be able to have that experience again in the future but this isn 't just about repairing and restoring a building which is loved and Helen regard by the community it 's not just about saving a concert hall that clearly was well ahead of its time when it was built and that 's a unique and special example of concert hall design what this is about is providing certainty it 's about providing certainty to the performers that want to use the space and hopefully will used space and to audiences who 'll be able to once again enjoy performances there it 's about providing certain see for this key site in the city centre certainty for heritage interests certainty for the performing arts sector and in fact certainty for neighboring land owners and developers in that part of and it 's actually in fact about some providing certainty for the people of the city and this important and well-loved facility that we 're talking about today so confirmation today of the full restoration conservation and repair of the Town Hall will send a signal of real confidence confidence in the recovery of the performing arts sector confidence in the recovery of the city overall and there 's a hope that it will be a catalyst for other positive outcomes for the the Civic economic cultural and social recovery of the whole city I actually believe that what we 're dealing with this afternoon is an historic moment in the recovery and I 'm privileged and pleased to be a part of it and as I say I 'm sure there 'll be wide interest in the decision that we 're going to make this afternoon I agree with Vicki I just want to get on and repair the Town Hall so I 'll be supporting this very strongly this afternoon as a second term counselor I remember their overwhelming support from the public to restore the thumbhole in two thousand twelve and in august 2013 there have been two times the purest council your animals vote in support of the distillation of the town hall and also yesterday in today this morning a strongly advocate by all who sanity i urge the mail in my fellow councillors in those this decision today and also we reveal the Dino 's report based on deano 's reporter says restauration of the tongue hope stakes are financially so give us the signal in 03 the restauration a tongue who is not only the desirable but actually is the responsible and also based on the title few submission either the written submission always a mission with a strong feeling you may have kind of crucial point the international party for the building and its analogy acoustic may be similar passport for new zealand architect to capture the world attention that we were not for cotton country in a pattern of the world is so touched me and also the building can live again as the heart of the quite church community and as a vital link to a fascinating and the new maternity and the civic are generated velocity i remember you know my family enemy received the citizenship ceremony from the former mayor gary moore in 1999 in town hall and room even up to today i still remember this picture will be clearly and also the culture tango is one of the country 's finest the beauties the combination the kind of architect recognized nationally as righteous school it is also an increasingly rare survivor of this important collection of distinct distinctive develop buildings so i have a stronger the feeling that this beauty had ability to make everyone who works to install feel special and important and also it was the building for the people of this city built by the citizens as a statement of silica pipe my first daughter is she the musician passer amateur musician i still remember when she attended national consumer the competition and the join of Hydra used the orchestra all always in was held in a tongue hole I was very impressed and also I check the new Xena open web site yesterday for full information about the city 's that pipe and ninety-six percent atif funded by the repair it is a very visible integral part of the auditorium structure and all tosstick so couldn 't be simply transferred to a small hole etc and also considering the insurance the issue as the start replied to me in order the fellow councillors only we would for distillation the whole campus can counsel claim the for insurance pay out which means that more than half of the hungry and 27 million dollars cause nature in children payoff will be the 69 million dollars so council only paid a draft is a 58 in the half million dollars so it 's the way we were posted effective so overall restoring the tongue who is surely a no brainer both culturally and economically and it 's clearly supported by the arts community we heard you know quite a few from them before and the majority of pubs appalled by the majority of published so I urge mayor in the my fellow councillors your animus to endorse the purest council decision to take thank you thank you I suspect at the end of this the to jinx it and I do suspect that because I think we can all see that this makes sense to proceed down this path for full restoration and repair in my mind this makes financial sense economic sense social sense cultural sense heritage sense we lobbied regularly particularly over major issues I haven 't_''_701.62 received any emails in opposition to this the only opposition I 've seen is from those who haven 't read the report what I would like to say and I haven 't named anyone either what I would like to say is that today we 've touched on the intangibles such as the carbon footprint there 's actually another intangible which I think Neil Dawson touched on last night at the launch of Ben fear thank you very nova load he talked about why he has drawn to the sphere and he said he doesn 't quite know why this fear basically as the mandala which sits beneath you know all societies it 's about unity and a restoration for me and going down this path of repair restoration I do you think we will help heritage you need your new you so anyone who says tear down the old diamonds I think has a pretty short-sighted view on an appreciation in this city you need both in order to make sense of the other and from a deep kind of symbolic understanding that that 's known as well so I think this is tremendous let 's go for it it makes sense Janie but firstly the work around this and the caliber of people of work diet has been exceptional I have the utmost faith in their abilities and professional integrity my reluctance and skepticism around the full restoration of this facility was due to a number of issues which I will speak to first and foremost I see the undisputed gem of the Town Hall crown being the auditorium the other elements aside from the auditorium which the full restoration option backs were elements that in my opinion a number of others just didn 't function imes and cambridge rooms voters in the James a theater they all had the drawbacks which handedly functionality and if you were doing knowledge that we have now the full restoration despite the intention at this point to remodel them to be fit for modern day purpose that the Heritage classifications will handle for the debt as we go forward and nap and if there were to occur I think that there would be a disaster I 'm also acutely aware that the net present value figures in the report make an assumption the elements for gone or not repaired and not built elsewhere and consequently don 't generate a return and that wouldn 't be the case because we do need those facilities it 's just that it wouldn 't happen to be in this particular venue if you progressed option six for example which only repairs the auditorium in foyer then you immediately have tens of millions of dollars that you disposable within our own budget to put towards batch of 500 to 600 seated space with the court theatre and the like and a purpose-built world-class and fully integrated performing arts precinct effectively every dollar which does not go into a 1 120 7.5 million dollar full town hall restoration is a dollar that can been in property my life has been spent growing up around working and knowing nothing but construction asset management property investment property development it 's been very very seldom that I 've seen or meet anyone who has been left beaming to the financial viability of a significant restoration project as in this report look robust and I really can 't argue with them but I have real genuine questions and my gut based on experience first and around cost escalation with a harridan structure the potential asbestos and ground conditions given its proximity to the rubber focusing purely on the gym and the crown just an auditorium repair would mitigate against a whole host those financial risks if costs were to snowball as a result of restoring the entire facility minimizing that wide arrest feeling to me and a purpose-built new build on the of the other required facilities further from the river would mean that we would have the ability to hold all the cards in our own hands and be in control of our purpose-built destiny finally the report figures stack up because they 're based around that the least you repair the less you get from your insurer if we as a counselor gunning for a global settlement which we are then the insurance proceeds are irrelevant as far as using them to support any option a global settlement means that you get a figure of X and that 's paid out to the council and a figure of Y is then allocated to this project the amount that 's allocated as decided by us and that and the more that goes into one project from that total sum means that there 's less of allocation and any other project look fundamentally I can 't support at this point putting rate payer money into something that I know in my own heart of hearts I wouldn 't be prepared to put my own money into it I do believe the work on this has been robust and I would love nothing but then for my cost escalation fears to never eventuate I actually think it is a fantastic facility I hear everything that everyone has said around it and and I desperately want it to work feelings I have regretted it and I 've got to a point that although I can 't argue with the figures that I see in front of me I just can 't get my gut to agree with me on that and I don 't believe that I 'd ever be comfortable to to ignore that again so the worst possible thing that you could ever do in a decision-making role is to not make a decision so in the event that the full restoration option is passed then I back the collective decision I 'm part of a governance group and when we make a decision whatever the outcome of that is I own you know how I feel about it I 've been upfront and honest with you about my concerns with it but I won 't pick holes in it and it 's my job to ensure that we make the best go over that we can I 'll do my bit to mitigate against any risks along the way and take the opportunities as they arise but if you could put those items separately I can rest that 's fine think I 'll do that um Phil um I actually think I 'm strongly support the full repair option I actually think it 's a great reinvestment the insurance figures that we have show that in fact by by adopting this option we gained the most money from insurance and I I think this is really it 's more than just the economic part as counselors have said this is actually really about the social and the cultural part or well as far as how we achieve our communities outcomes that we were asked to its such an important building I think to restore it actually has to become again like the civic heart of our city it is it 's been great to have the lady Isaac Theatre restored but a city the size of christ church needs a town hall as as i say is our civic hard and it 's when i saw the first powerpoint the picture there which we were used to be familiar with it reminded me of the wonderful ambience that the building head and can be n can building has been suggested we heard very clearly from submitters yesterday that any new building is most unlikely to actually ever achieve the the acoustic level that the current building has the other thing too is that the whole setting on this South site on the looking towards the south side it is a has got great potential for the future and I think the full repair help will help rejuvenate this whole surrounding area and we heard really clearly yesterday from that from the heritage groups that the statement and it 's an air report the Town Hall is the most significant internationally recognized civic building in New Zealand that 's pretty high praise it 's not it 's lit and so it 's listed as a heritage one building n air city plan and we were asked yesterday to take responsibility to protect the building and I think counselors will do that today and I think to the option that 's been put up in the staff have explained it is that the full repair repair in effect will help us deliver three facilities and with the new if we pass us today counselors this will be a major milestone towards us achieving though our councils community outcomes so I urge you all to strongly support the recommendation sorry Pauline thank you yes a lot yesterday was we had some incredibly interesting deputations and very powerful deputations now we heard from Jessica Halliday and she spoke about a sense of place and at the Town Hall is one of the remaining anchors to our sense of place how much and then it 's pivotal to our decision today not only that but the unique quality of that building for the time we know that the auditorium was acoustically a world leader was here it will sound and there was the result of the right people being in a right place at the right time the people of Christchurch did so here it is it 's our history we need to be so proud of that happening here in Christchurch let 's put us on the worlds and even if we did build a new one we could not guarantee replicate those acoustics and thus we heard yesterday from 't always get exactly what you think you 're getting so it 's not necessarily possible to actually replicate that we also heard that tweet intervet original building was fund raised by the people of Christchurch twenty percent and then we heard about the history of the organ once again that was fund raised for that was installed 25 years after the town hall opened it 's still sitting in there and we heard from Martin seat sure how that when that winton it actually completed the shape of the auditorium it sits up there really proudly at the at the end there in it it actually enhanced the acoustics even further it would cost at least a million dollars to move that and it should not be moved it 's probably valued over five million dollars every one of those pipes was fund raised for they 've got the names of family members who on those pipes that 's part of our heritage that 's part of our history and of course we 've heard from phil dia that this is in the world class top five of the and with them will come overseas audiences particularly from australia and we do need our australians back here right or not folks we want them big building did function as a whole and we did here yesterday that there were parts of it that could have been operated better but it did function as a whole it was designed as a whole and we 've been recommended that it stays as a whole and I support that I believe that building was successful and I believe it will be successful again and I cannot wait to see it up and running in 2018 so I will be supporting the staff recommendation thank you David and thank you look fishy I 'd like to compliment the stuff on the quality of the report we 've had before us today councillor Johansson often reminds this is the longest counselor and I never want to lay claim to being the oldest because Phil Clearwater and Jimmy beat me to that but I can Kane can lay claim to hits perhaps being the longest serving christchurch resident around the table and as such i concert and its opening it was a magnificent feeling to be there look I I have some mixed feelings about the presentation we 've had before us today and I do empathize with Jamie when it comes to the likes of the functionality of the James a theater the Lions room voters and a few of those adjunct facilities to the the auditorium I do wonder if times whether our resolution 22.1 actually gives credence to if we have a mind to go with the staff recommendation to the need to improve the functionality of particularly the James hey theatre it 's not particularly elucidated in that that remit at the moment so we may want to consider just highlighting that particular point Vicki made a point that the Town Hall getting one in christchurch was a process of some years we did have other town halls but over a period of 100 years before we actually got a fully functional audit and the facilities we have here i am going to support the the staff recommendation but i would just urge the perhaps we give consideration to just highlighting improving the functionality particularly of james a theatre sure we can deal with that when we get to the resolution I 'm Chum thank you um what we 've been through as a city in his individuals personally etc I guess I see things in time that special things happen and there 's nothing special about a counselor of town hall or a city or town building in town hall but with the Christchurch Town Hall something was very special when it was built with the genius of Sir Harold marshal sir miles Warren and Morris Molly coming together with the brilliance of Charles Lonnie to bring beer design to life was very special for Christ 's Church in many many ways and wherever you go the Christchurch Town Hall is definitely an iconic building for Christ church 's recognized anything 's it 's not just an auditorium or James hey or limes room or a Cambridge room of the boaters it is actually mystic iconic building for the city and we don 't have too many left it is and I arts complex which our city is sadly lacking this one hundred percent I I have raised my concerns and that 's the joy of getting if you like an old item and being able to revamp it and I will be keeping my eye on you guys but I think it 's an absolutely wonderful time and history for us to be able to get back an iconic build in which we don 't have many lives so thank you Yanni thank you I recall fondly of submission from the Chamber of Commerce Peter Townsend who came to us a year after we 'd agreed to fix the town hall and said that we needed certainty and clarity in our rebuild it to stop relitigate inks we need to get on and get things done and show clear leadership and then asked if we could go and revisit the decision that we 've made a year ago to look at the town hall this is the third debate I 've had around this council table around the town hall and it 's probably fingers cross going to come up with the same option that we had same resolution to support this today I think the evidence is overwhelming in support of retaining it and repairing it and we 've touched on things like the environmental impact and I think that is such a critical element this is one of the few central city anchor projects that has been fully publicly consulted on I want to make that point really clear because you 've all spent a lot of time as a I and other councillors who have been here for two terms of hearing the public come and say to us what they think about the central city projects and the spending and actually most of them we have no control over but this one we do so let 's show leadership on it we have a choice about retaining this building the significant building and I want to also stress it 's the most important circular built landmark in Christchurch there is a pretty strong reason to keep it it 's also important to note that the Heritage assessment has said very clearly that with the loss of any major design element that will result in a whole complex the curettage advise that we have had because council asked could you just take away elements of it and just have the auditorium it was bombing Lee against doing that and the time of doing that and ending up an expensive legal battles no one benefits I want to come back to the fact that you know this submission really touched me yesterday think of all the energy we talked about the embedded energy and the environmental impact that this building had if it was demolished and not repaired think about all the social energy that has gone into making these submissions an imagined of those same people were spinning the energy in helping us fundraise pull this building to be repaired rather than spending huge amounts of time coming in here trying to convince us time and time again around the need to repair this building so I think those people I take my hats off to those champions of Christchurch who have stood beside us as a city and helped us come to some of the conclude we 've come to and I acknowledge the huge a younger person around this council table want to acknowledge that as a yes as a younger counselor how grateful I am for the way in which the city that I inherited when I come around this council table for the state the city was in with our assets that hold in public ownership in our town hall I think is one of our most precious civic and social assets that we hold dearly on the trust of the people of the city who helped build it I just want to touch on two other points now one is that the great thing as we see in the world with inequality is that this city has a proud tradition of having as Lisa impact around that inequality in fact the thing I love about the city when I came back from America to live here and make this city my home was the equality of life of well being that it offered to all of its citizens and I believe it does that by retaining its public and civic assets the debate about the Performing Arts precinct in my personal hall into a private performing arts development and that 's why I was so keen and and have consistently said we should retain our civic space it 's much more than a performance space that is about a civic space in the second point I just want to talk about is that the town hall is an inclusive place for people in our city from all walks of life from all Ainge rages and that point was made through the deputations so I want to see an inclusive space not an exclusive space and many of the events are being touched on but my first memory of the town hall is a telethon with Leeza Gibbons how many people went there and saw that on TV think about those fun times that we 've all enjoyed an experienced in that fantastic venue and let 's retainer let 's keep it I urge you to support it in conclusion I just want to say that i took the pleasure of going to san francisco paid for by myself as I was going through I took I took some vogel 's bread come and talk to us very quickly after the earthquakes that we 'd face the international speaker series really stuck in my mind on several points and one was that involves environmental sustainability and the importance of keeping a heritage but also the former mayor of San Francisco he came ignores and talk to us about the importance of them rebuilding their town hall and what it did for that city and I took the chance to go and see their rebuilt town hall in San Francisco and what a magnificent building that is and I look forward to the day that we can see the same without own Town Hall that our own Town Hall rises up and we see people going in there having fun enjoying life may be getting married if that 's what people wish to do as has happened in the San Francisco thing a real tourist attraction and those points have been covered so in conclusion I urge counselors to support this this is a really important thing that we need to do it 's a special place both nationally and internationally it 's it tells the story of our city 's past of our prison and I really hope our future so don 't don 't put a bulldozer through the most important social modern history we have as a city into this asset please vote to retain it I think in future generations will appreciate the decision that we make if we go down the path _"

    "text": "seating in flat floor mode so providing a very versatile venue that I 'm sure that you know New Zealand ballet la companies would would be able to work with now I acknowledge it 's not a full flight our setup and prior to the earthquakes we didn 't have the Isaac theatre royal in that ace now we do we 're really lucky to have that and and we can now look at identifying the gaps in the market and providing a good all-round venue for for the city and I think if you were looking at at a younger audience the likes of a performance by dou pro or some of the more up-and-coming young bands in town the space Thank of to them right yeah and there are a lot of groups that are you know five or six hundred that would tour and what did we use us but I guess one of my concerns I think the questions asked and answered I mean it 's at ya bum I 'm David thank you your options analysis chart and the RMA risk correct me if i demolition have we any risk associated with repair and restructure well as I said wheel we already have our resource consents to repair of the boredom that was granted day before yesterday for the full repeal of the building and that 's been reviewed by heritage advisors so we 'll be going through getting our building consent in terms of risk of rebuilt that has been canvassed extensively during the design documentation in process with the contractors clean thank you my question is around risk and contingency relating to ground conditions so we all know that Christ futures very challenging this respect so my question is how much confidence do you have that you 've built sufficient contingency into this project around any geotech surprises and foundational requirements okay John here from Holmes consulting group is present John so he 's actually just now getting a hat also it 's here today gone tomorrow so in terms in terms of geotechnical investigation that site has been done to death in terms of what exists underneath the building and the ground improvement solution that as part of the repair involves jet 's a common approach that 's it 's been taken on all the commercial buildings around town and that has been fully documented fully priced and included in the tender that we 've received we 're actually negotiating with the successful kindra to take on the risk John 's just come back don 't sneak in that we 're asking geotechnical questions so it 's we 're actually negotiating with thee with the tenderer to take on the risk of ground conditions with Taylor the tinder period for this project was 15 weeks and we gave all the tendrils ample opportunity to visit the site make their own inquiries and I think the result of the tender process confirms that everybody fully understands what what they 're getting involved with and the price to the quarterly but I think that I mean there 's always a risk sort of saying that we want to we 're prepared to build more unto it that essentially people have had their due diligence and submitted submitting prices based on that on that knowledge but you don 't think john that there 's i might you know sort of flummox they have a precedence and yeah in the contingency yes look I 'd go so far as to say I think this is probably now one of the most studied pieces of ground one of the most study pieces of ground in the world and so while there 's no such thing as certainty under those circumstances I think they 've got the risk has been pretty well quantified and managed very effectively so you know if we could never say is nothing to be found but I think we 've certainly got a very well contained than the budget we had things I would add is that solution that they 've come up with and gone through has been also peer-reviewed very robustly so it 's not only one set of engineers opinions it 's um gone through another so you know it is one of the risks that with as John said taken very seriously and done a little work on I just I 'm just going to use the advantage of John being here because I sort of sort of used mean and I was just there Fiat well you know making up stuff as I went but it was kind of like that this phrase of poor man 's base isolation that the land underneath the town hall actually in a funny way protected the town hall from the severity of the shaking damage that that might have occurred if it had been on a stiffer foundation yeah there 's certainly an aspect of that and so ironically perhaps in the process of fixing the ground we 're going to expose the buildings are more shaping in the future but that 's been addressed through the other structural work which is being done and so ultimately will have a building which is much better performed all things taken into account great it 's great thank you I 'm Ellie well yeah I mean I heard you down nice I didn 't_''_374.6 I didn 't get you mixed are no thank you I did want to ask actually if you don 't mind about the insurance because I I just there the indemnity money that 's we are jus if you the moment 28 millions been paid so far group the indemnity 32 why the difference why have we not been paid the full indemnity it probably needs to fair that to the insurance team we come back we got the answer the answer yesterday and and diane i did email it out yesterday it Diane do you want to just make that statement from there that would be fine in dispute no no some of the reinsurers haven 't paid okay and I wanted to know to whether the money that has to be paid I know that we have fun this has been answered but I think it 's important button actually have it on the table to the money that has been paid and we expect to be paid on the insurance that will go into the town hall that is ring-fenced for the town hall I 'm asking not not incising perhaps I could pick that up and then down could join a pickup down if I can answer we have a schedule of monies that that we have received so yes it will go into the separate bank account waiting for it to happen so the answer is sort of yes a sort of knowledge yeah well no it 's it 's actually a really good question and that 's actually a very good answer because the the truth of it is is that we are still attempting to get a global settlement with our insurers and whatever is paid into that the crisis city council on the part of the town hall will come off the global settlement so that there 's no guarantee that any amount I mean it will contribute an amount to the total but it may not reflect on a greater amount if you see what I 'm ain 't no yeah so it 's a yes and a no the money 's not ring fence for the town hall but it will only be spent on the town all when it arrives just one other very quickly one of the three points of feedback or some of the feedback that we 've had particularly from the performing arts sector is that there are elements of both the town hall in to be improved that in fact I 've heard the word betterment used in those sorts of phrases what I want to know is has that been included in the plans and are there any issues around the heritage and I know it 's not a status because it 's not with here to Jersey land it 's only in our own city plan that it has a heritage status if you like but is there anything in there that would preclude some of these redevelopments or developments for betterment from happening okay so we are working very closely with the likes of the CSO particular around around the auditorium and how that works for them various other users around the facilities and addressing all the well-documented shortcomings of of the various spaces so forth as we go through the process those shortcomings are be are being addressed and will continue to be addressed with the users and stakeholders and where it 's where impacts on the heritage fabric will work through with the Heritage team yes it has yeah yeah yeahs pulling is my questioners and it may be be adopted which is the total will be a hundred percent what is the time frame for that completion so freedom if we accept conflict next week we expect to have in town or up and running in June 2018 so three year built for you thank you um Yanni thank you I had several questions one is you enter a chart with the different options with the different colors if we don 't proceed to repair it as we 've previously resolved what is the timing difference between getting on and getting it done by repairing it to one hundred percent versus those a lot of sins that you have okay so quite clearly where we we find ourselves in a medium or high resource management risk scenario we have to go we have to launch new resource consent that will be fully notified and their processes anywhere between four and six month process for notified resource consent and then we would be open to appeal to the Environment Court which could add a considerable length of time to the process so are we talking months or years yeah it 's years rather than months okay the other aspect to remember is we have a tender on the table now and that tinder has a duration validity period which will expire and so we would then be faced with going back to the market and that that again has reputational risk for the council okay obviously other things like if we were brought in a new facility somewhere else we 've been have to go into land purchase would have to buy that we 'd have to so there 's a there 's a brand new facility on another site I would say you again any years not only the years of you talking about resource consent by the time you purchased at and then design-build so but just from a sequencing point of view you 'd obviously need to get the consent to demolish it work Levi record for Supreme Court high court appeals commit before you started building the new one so you could be talking another ten years if you can you tell me is but I think that yes you would be well we would new one while you haven 't_''_744.89 resolved the issues with the old one and they were certainly risks a few over left knows but that would be something we 'd have to come back to you I guess I 'm just comparing it 's like what 's currently happening with the am looking Cathedral which you know is tied up and cool but not actually a lot happening so and that 's always getting on for five years so yeah right I don 't think that 's a fair comparison this is very well protected us or not from the elements the Town Hall is yeah thank you I interest in terms of the core processes I 'll just magma pointless yeah breath thanks guys have you had any discussions with other organizations in terms of repurposing internally like the CSO resultant and maybe getting them back in them we have we 're working with CSO on some options that would see them using parts of the town hall for their rehearsal spaces and accommodation okay any other questions ya ali it just like four years well can it be a long time if it 's approved if it 's a full repair and restoration it seems i 'm not it 's a big job that 's really well competing tentative I mean it 's the other question no no I agree how long would the alternative tell ya so the usual response to that so the question and I don 't mean to be flippant is you can have it cheap and have it fast we can even good you can even three so so we really it 's it 's a tricky job we 've got a good price but that is dependent on taking taking the time to do it properly do it well without damaging what all you really exists so the contractors all had a look at it and they they are not offering any time savers so I 'm guided by their experience and abilities is to how quickly you can be done can I go back to the blueprint on the cost sharing agreement because there are there is an element of this that is a mystery to me so in the end back to the blueprint where any of you involved in the blueprint no no but but the council had people represented on the blueprint you know in the in the 100-day you know sort of hothouse environment of writing the new image for our central city have we got any of them here my understand was number of organizations RCP whom in the project managers warden Imani who were one of the architects air also buffa mystical and I believe in the architectural firm just escapes from the Romans but they must have been counseled staff involved Jane do you know we 're there any to council stuff actually involved in the blueprint you know when the blueprint was being developed system for Mike Dillon and that would have been some of his tomb I think I think certainly the the council went through a consultative process and that information went into the blueprint in terms of what the city required it 's okay I can 't take if you would talk to one of the staff members that would be fine but I just can 't take comments from but yeah I can 't_''_959.51 yeah so sorry say that again I was going to say that from having come into council recently and talking to staff council 's involvement was really more around the definition of what was required rather than how much it would cost and I think no no I 'm talking about the blueprints yes that was the decision to allocate parts of land for what was called a performing arts precinct and and also allowing then into the cost share the Christchurch Town Hall because the original blueprint hadn 't had had the had no town hall and had space there the green space a part of the frame as I understand it and that when the decision was made around the town hall the green the frame was shrunk back to the Ruhr is that right so I think if you read the year the recovery plan which the blueprint contains is it says that should the Town Hall not be repairable then the block north of armor will be used for a new Performing Arts precinct in terms of the auditorium 's so halls and be saved on up so the ship so the actual wording us should the town hall not be repairable I mean I 'm gonna look like an exact phrase on this because it does sound as if the assumption was was that it would only be demolished if it wasn 't repairable was that the understanding that 's what I 'm trying to do is to get an understanding of what was going on at a time when I had no you know sort of direct involvement in anything so I 'm comment on the cop on the blueprint and I certainly look I can go down and download a copy of it but in the cost here no I 've got one on my wall I know what it looks like but but but it 's not it 's not there what I 'm looking for is what was the expectation at the time within the council organization when the blueprint was being developed I mean did we did we argue that the blue that the town hall should remain within the blueprint until such time as I 'm kind of trying to get in a picture of what was going on at the time because I have no idea it 's a mystery to me it was kind of a hind closed doors madam chair we should adjourn will go and get Mike because I 'm sorry none of us staff here with the year at the time and so okay well we were donating to it we don 't need to adjourn I 'm going to go on to the cost sharing agreement so we 'll go on to that and and then we 'll come back to will come back to the blue front and I 'm sorry I father 's think that do you not want I just want to get to them okay well I do too but I 'm sort of a little frustrated at the the link of quality information and the public arena around the decision that we 're going to be making today so I want it to be crystal clear was there any obligation under the cost sharing agreement to only repair elements of the town hall made by the Christchurch City Council so the cost sharing agreements edgell 10 for Performing Arts Council or make final decision on the town hall repair by the 31st of august 2013 council did resolve on 29th of august to meet that criteria and that 's why that date was you know prior to the election it was because it had to meet the deadline set by the cost sharing agreement yeah that 's greatly and then within the cost share and schedule which talks about project funding the governance or not the government 's actually but the ownership and operating costs and estimate the project completion date they 're all to be confirmed the one thing it does say is the project live responsibility is with CCC and that the crowd to be provided with a reasonable opportunity to sign off on the scope and design and that 's what the resolution on the twenty-ninth provided which goes back to the schedule 10 in your premises yeah that talks around the three options the council can make options for the precinct could include the existent town hall auditorium James 2 was the existing town hall auditorium with pre-function space and also a 500-seat auditorium small theater and the Music Center on a designated site land between south of our MA and east of Colombo streets and option 3 was the existent town hall auditorium James a theater and thus new southern entrance to the facility and also a small theater music center on designated lands between the south of Omar and east of Colombo streets so did that preclude the repair of the complete town hall councils option was optioned 30 so that was a giant a theater the auditorium and the south entrance and building the sets around the Performing Arts precinct desert is designated at this point in time so that was what that means so any suggestion that we hadn 't complied with the provisions of the cost sharing agreement just simply weren 't great I can read the resolution the council made in terms of that if you wish yep ok so in on the 2958 2013 item 58 confirmed that the option for performing arts precinct will be the town hall restoration as above of christchurch and for the CSO and to continue with the feasibility study for the precinct fire stakeholder engagements to achieve a brief and project definition that means the required crowd stroke ccc kashi an agreement budget so that that 's essentially a complete obligation in relation to what we were asked to do with respect to the decision making and the trigger on stomach and the only thing that doesn 't still make sense to me is why the costings was so wrong but it doesn 't sound as if we had any input into that we need to go back and look at how those cotton scheme yeah I am breath- dad 's I mean let 's face it most of the costings around the blueprint have been wrong but I think we should also know that the land is no longer available yes for that option that was taken away last yeah it was uplifted last year so yeah there is no alternative no no I understand and which is why the advisors is that if we were to go down the other option that we would might just a quick question it 's a really quick question in terms of the blueprint was it was was it the council 's grab a seat what was it an expectation and the development of the blueprint that the decision on the Town Hall was really based on whether it was repairable or not and if it was repairable then that would flow on to what was going to be made available for the development of the balance of the Performing Arts precinct and if it wasn 't repairable well then there were two elements the north and the south side of sorry that yeah the north and the south side of armor would be made available for the Performing Arts precinct it 's all based on the repair ability of the town hall wasn 't it well the is in the broadest context the blueprint as far as I can recall it seems to be he ions ago it was so the town hall at one in and the sort of the Isaac Theatre Royal the other anchored the Performing Arts so you basically had the Performing Arts arts hub and it certainly was from recollections thus that 's our government of the blueprint oh okay the the extent of that and the size of what was being invested was always contingent I think on what was happening with the anchor points so the Town Hall certainly influenced I was going to influence any decisions around the sides and scalability of what was going into the Performing Arts precinct and specifically that northern block was the one that was the at-risk block it but it was about repairability so once you could repair the town hall then it would that was perfectly in order for the for the council to make the call on repairability repairability it was our decision yeah that 's right i was always of council but but once it was going to be repaired there was no expectation originally that that would mean that we would demolish it and go with the performing arts precinct model no no expectation but performing arts in from recollection the Performing Arts precinct existed whether or not the town hall was repair or not it was at then have in that and the other part of the precinct depending on what happens with the balance of the town hall so it was never about the dollars and cents it was about what other facilities would be required yes because the Performing Arts precinct concept was ensuring that we had in whatever however it was distributed we had in the city a strong area where all those performing arts could be concentrated celebrated and that could I mean I suppose between the Isaac Theatre Royal and the and the town hall there was a quite a bit of opportunity to squeeze whatever needed to go in there to make that happen yeah it 's been incredibly helpful thank you very much thank you right right her to lose those last question Yanni I just wanted to check because the difference between the blueprint and the costume it 's finders doing that actually performing arts present was always a sara lee project and the blueprint and it was only in the cost year that it actually that got transferred back to the council correct so you know some of the that the designation was there in the event that the tunnel couldn 't be repaired but it 's also correct to say that originally syrah we 're going to lead the charge on the performing arts precinct in as part of the cost sheared discuss oh it 's got nothing to do with this it 's got nothing to do with the decision on the town hall so no no I 'm sorry yonni it 's got nothing to do with the decision on the town hall the leading who leads on and on the project has got nothing to do with it sorry I 'm I 'm not going to you know what we can you can say what you like in the debate so here I 've nobody employee when I was requested if you wish me to to read it out so it says the precinct designate would be sufficient to provide for a range of facilities in the event that the Town Hall cannot be repaired yep and the event that townhall cannot be repaired in the event that the Town Hall cannot be repaired thank Vicki 's desperate to start off the debate _"

    "text": "welcome back fantastic opening out at your test I presume the fantastic opening in town at the organization precinct Texican tune to item 22 prescient Christchurch Town Hall conservation project strategic business case and I would like to move these staff recommendation and do I have a seconder God Lynn Livingston has seconded the motion so have we got any questions that councillors would like to ask the staff or with staff like to begin with a presentation you would like to start the presentation my hips of five over if I if I had sort of bothered to look down the end of the table first then perhaps I would have noted that so please thank you madam mayor thank you counselors on the 29th of August 2013 council resolved to commence the design developments of the Town Hall restoration project with the intention to achieve fair vikas certainty through a tender process they also resolved to separate the budget allocating 120 7.5 million for the Town Hall restoration I 'm very pleased and relieved to advise counsel that the tenders have been received and it provides the desired be delivered within the allocation for you favor more we 've also undertaken a business case which shows the need for a mix of facilities and identifies a number of options and Peter will lead us through that strategic and economic business table right Thank You Liam so what I want to do this and this is just supports an investment decision in civic cultural and performing arts venues for Christchurch it 's primarily a business case to guide investment in venues that the city needs if it 's serious about becoming a world-class livable city but I think it 's worth just looking at the strategic context that so the silica cultural and performing arts sectors are currently operating in prior to the earthquakes Christchurch was a vibrant dynamic prosperous and activated City Cantabria n-- 's had and still have a distinctive character the city was had a unique identity youth earthquakes changed all that russia ran idea the central city recovery plan the long-term plan in the long term plan kat Cantabrian have clearly articulated they want a return to a world-class livable city Cantabria pne 's want that reflects the distant of a new character of Cantabria pnes in a city that delivers a new and unique identity and this is reflected in councils community outcomes for christchurch it 's an exciting time in christchurch in particularly the process of rebuilding Christchurch as a livable world-class City but it 's now time to acknowledge the roles of the cultural and Performing Arts sectors have played and continue to play in getting the city back on its feet in a mere ability to catalyze the recovery through contributing to community and cultural well-being drawing people back into the central city and supporting local tourism in hospitality but the Performing Arts sector can only do this if the right responding to concerns expressed by the local community the ministry of culture and heritage commissioned an independent study of existing and planned venues in christchurch you can see up there the key output of this study was the optimum facilities matrix which describes the agreed list of well-appointed venues that a city the size of christchurch would ideally have to successfully deliver the needs of civic cultural and performing arts the blueprint in starting point for the strategic and economic business case you can see on the matrix highlighted in yellow there are four blank spaces the top one is a large auditorium suitable for civic events festivals large-scale performances round about 2,000 plus sees the next one is a mid-sized theater around that 600 seats auditorium acoustically suitable for traditional symphonic and chamber music third item is a 500 to 600 seated or a thousand person standing fixable mid-sized venue for contemporary music jazz folk rock and performance the fourth one is a dance space a theater a black box and that has been earmarked in terms of either the YMCA the Metro sports or potentially in the Performing Arts precinct going forward so what I want to do is focus on the two thousand seat auditorium the mid-sized auditorium for classic music and the mid-size flat floor contemporary music venue we engaged Deloitte to carry out a strategic assessment of the options for delivering these facilities and from an initial long list a short list of options were identified and carried forward for more detailed evaluation first option Town Hall we walk away and we leave the performing arts sector to continue on and the temporary venues of the currently operating them we do that it 'll cost us twelve million dollars in seven million dollars to date stripping out preparing protecting the existing building add another five million dollars to demolish it and we don 't achieve any of the objectives of a little livable city that 's vibrant activated and has a unique identity the second option was to build a new 1,500 seat auditorium a 600 seats Theatre on a new site referred to this as the blueprint option this is what was originally included in the blueprint that was produced for Canterbury the ystem a the cost of that is one hundred ninety three point five million dollars plus site costs in the paper that councillors have in front of them on catchment 3 page 180 cm there 's a range of benchmark costs from recent auditoria competed in in conference halls and confident concert halls completed in the United Kingdom in Europe average cost per seat of those benchmark facilities 142,000 a seat Copenhagen Opera House which are both spectacular venues in a water and very expensive we get a more meaningful comparison if we look at the Bridgewater Concert Hall and Manchester the sage and Gateshead and the house of user can Denmark those are all roundabouts three thousand dollars a seat and a consistent worthy acoustically sophisticated auditoria that were described in the blueprint and that is what underpins the estimated cost of one hundred ninety three point five million dollars option was to repair the Town Hall Auditorium in the foyer only it needs to make the cost of 91 million dollars that would see us demolishing the James a theater the Lions and boaters in the kitchen facilities and providing a landscaped area in the placement of those facilities the next option was to repair the Town Hall Auditorium where n James hey it needs to make a cost of 109 million dollars that provides the facilities that that the venue 's matrix achieves but lenses learning facilities that currently exist and as Laura smiley pointed out yesterday we also lose some of those valuable spaces around the perimeter like a bit soon the final option was full repair and restoration of the Town Hall and James hey ed needs to major cost of one hundred and twenty seven point six million just ensure examinations I 'm sorry but and I know that I shouldn 't interrupt but can you just go back to that previous slide sure and just tell me how much did the cost-sharing agreement allocate for the blueprint option okay the blueprint the cost-sharing agreement for the Performing Arts precinct was a hundred and fifty million dollars that was to cover both the 1500 seat auditorium the 600 seat small auditorium plus the court theatre plus the CSO and any other venues in the performing arts precinct but you 're saying on a benchmark basis a hundred and ninety three point five million is would have been required to build the 1500 seat auditorium a 600 seat theater alone that 's correct so we did the hundred and fifty million dollars come from in the cost-sharing agreement I 'm not the right person to ask for that if I may just mention the the Performing to be confirmed against number numbers I think when you go to the actual schedule there was some discussions in schedule 10 which we fare to that which talks around options for the precinct there was three options around the Town Hall and that was what the council last council made this is not yet but there 's no numbers attached to us so I thought it was a hundred and fifty seven million was but I can 't fire I believe it 's 158 158 million and the cost-sharing agreement but but what I 'm trying to get a connection between the cost-sharing agreement numbers and what we 're told that it costs a hundred and ninety three point five million to deliver only part of what was promised in the cost-sharing agreement that the cost-sharing agreement seems awfully under budget was that a figure plucked from than a year so the cost share agreement was based on the recovery plan so the recovery plan in 2012 and the cost sharing agreements in 2013 the recovery plan had that fit the recovery plan is the blueprint the blueprints with precinct in the block south of ARMA which had one building which contains the music center of Christchurch and the core theatre and then the block north of our ma had a 500 1500 seat auditorium and the CSO so that was what the bases numbers of those blueprint we 're in terms of where those numbers came from that was done by sale rather than by Council but but seriously were than a were than what less than a year the I mean it doesn 't sound right to me that the number would have been presented at a hundred and fifty eight million when just to build two of these components of the blueprint was a hundred ninety three point five so during your TP submissions creative museum representative articulated a figure of round I think it as initial comment was five thousand five hundred procedure I think he actually made fifty five thousand per seat and that probably translates to a figure that would fit in the hundred and fifty a hundred and fifty seven million dollar envelope but it 's only for the two components of five thousand dollars a seat times 2,000 it 's a fraction of one hundred and twenty million dollars for what was proposed in the blueprint now my my position is that the benchmarking studies that we 've done with key auditory designer around the world suggest that a fifty five thousand dollars a seat isn 't going to cut it and realistically for what the city needs it 's the 93,000 a seat expenditure so you could say that the figures included in the blueprint we 're like I mean yeah so I mean we are going to explore this as we as we go through it but I guess I wanted to stop on this picture because I think there 's been an assumption and the media and certainly in the public arena that the cost of repairing the Town Hall is significantly greater than what you would get from developing the blueprint option and we 're hearing the complete opposite now that 's correct right thank you carry on okay so the implications of there are implications of the options on the insurance payout that the council receive insurance of 32 million dollars and is the insurance contribution to repair of 33 37 million dollars giving a total figure of approximately 69 million dollars so if we do nothing council receives 32 million dollars end of story we get we get the indemnity payout nothing further if we build you we get 32 million dollars we don 't get we get the indemnity payout nothing I think you should repeat that because again that 's another area of misconception and misunderstanding but if we build brand new the council receives the indemnity we don 't receive the full insured cost that 's correct thank you if we repair the auditorium in foyer only we receive 53 million dollars comprising thirty two million dollars of indemnity and 21 million dollars of contribution to the insurer we don 't receive the full insurance payout but on top of that we would have to pay for the demolition of the rest similarly if we repair the auditorium floor in James hey we get sixty two million dollars there 's a rebate on the repair insurance for the Lions room and boaters demolishing those mm-hmm and if we repeal the whole facility we we 've received sixty nine million dollars from insurance for the full payout will we under insured it would appear so thank you so the key measure in everybody has been very focused on headline numbers particularly the hundred and twenty seven million but what 's more important probably is to actually understand what the cost to counsel is of each option because that then takes into account the the rebaiting of face yes so if we do nothing Council will receive 19 million dollars because had to pay twelve million dollars to maintain the building up to an hour and then demotion similarly if we build new the cost to council would be a hundred and sixty six million dollars that 's essentially the headline cost of a hundred and ninety three million dollars less thirty two million dollars of insurance and it 's not countering other obligations under the cost share it 's just straight out replacing the Town Hall that 's correct if we repair the auditorium in FOIA the cost of councils thirty-nine dollars the we repair the or draw in foreign and James hey the cost to councils forty seven million dollars and if we do a full repair of the Town Hall the cost to counsel and therefore ratepayers is fifty eight points in wars on the screen behind you is really an analysis of all of the options looking at some key metrics the lift most colored column is the cost to council and this is just what we 've mixed column to the right entitled NPV changes in revenue over 20 years recognizes the loss of revenue to the council or V basis its facilities operator as venues are taken away so option one the top one is is the baseline that 's full repair of the Town Hall and V basis revenue discounted over 20 years there 's about thirty five million dollars over that period if we go with option four o if you want the detail and you want to read the detail that 's on page 107 of your agenda option four which is repealing the Town Hall and a new single-story lime 's complex the results is repair of the auditorium foyer and James hay and the demolition of the Lions boaters in Cambridge room results in a revenue loss over 20 years of thirteen point six million and option six is the auditory employer and demolishes the James hey limes and boaters and Cambridge results in a loss in revenue of twenty nine point two million over three years a new build on new site results in a loss of one point four million dollars over the twenty year period that so it 's the impact of the options on the revenue side of the equation we 've also looked at in terms of the and colored columns the impact on resource management risk and clearly retention of the building as as it stands 100% repair is a low RMA risk effect we have now have the resource consent for the project demolition of various parts of the building start to increase the RMA risk because we 're dealing with a Heritage listed building here where we get to the point where the options we were demolishing James hey limes boaters on we 're getting the Environment Court so put that in there just to give you some context around RMA risk in relation to the project so really there 's a couple of questions that council needs to ask itself and the first really is a very strategic question it 's does the city need fit for purpose civic cultural and Performing Arts facilities clearly everybody in this room would answer yes the evidence suggests that there 's strong support for a list of well-appointed venues that a city the size of Christchurch would ideally have therefore the do-nothing approach is not an option second question that council needs to ask itself is should the fit for purposes facilities be provided in a new facility the simple answer is no we can 't afford it it 's too expensive a third question really asked can the proposed repair and restoration of the Town Hall provide the fit for purpose facilities the city needs and simple turns yes as we heard yesterday the Lilburn auditorium is world-class and secondly we 've done some work around the reconfiguration of the James hay that can deliver on auditorium for classical music and a mid-sized flat floor contemporary music for 500 to 600 seated people or a thousand standing what that 's doing is it 's actually taking the James hay out of the theater space which is quite rightly now occupied by the magnificent Isaac Theatre Royal and it 's filling a long long identified gap for the contemporary and chamber chamber venue and the work we 've had done with the design team has come up with a very elegant solution for that option so really in terms of the business case gone through logically assists the strategic needs of the city assists the options in has concluded that the preferred options for providing the venues to Christchurch is to a full repair of the town hall as budgeted one hundred and twenty seven point six million dollars and that includes the reworking of the James hay to deliver those facilities so I think if we do that we will deliver on the vision that Cantabrian have of a vibrant city prosperous City a city with a very activated performing arts sector a city that restores its unique identities any questions numbers and they 're probably because they 're not numbers per se but there is a cost of knocking down a building that is perfectly repairable that doesn 't sort of seem to be taken into account in our city at the moment and I would really like to explore with you what that cost us you know and in terms of objectives with sustainability the repair of building as we had a presentation yesterday the greenest building is the one that 's already standing perhaps you 'd like to reflect on what what the kostas is knocking down a building that is perfectly repairable what that is in terms of our commitments to building a sustainable you know sort of clean green city that was very much what came through sheer an idea let 's don 't was well articulated by Jessica Halliday yesterday that the costs of disposal of concrete of encapsulated carbon into landfill at Kate Valley is significant now that is built into the costs of partial demolition yeah that 's the dollars and cents I 'm not I 'm not really well yeah I want to talk about the sustainability measures against which we would want to be a gold standard here in the city but we 're knocking down buildings that we can save and we 're knocking down buildings that are financially repairable and though we 're knocking down buildings that would cost more to replace than the ones we would knock down to repair quite correct and so yes there is a reputational issue for the city wrapped around doing what you 've just described there there is a specific cost in terms of sustainability in terms of reuse in terms of delivery on its strategic juke does now I can 't_''_1559.929 put a dollar figure on any of those but well they do try to and I thought that maybe some work had been done on it because sometimes you actually need to have some dollars and cents attached to it to make people see since and the different spelling of the word gianni and councillors run an email because this was exactly the question I asked nearly two years ago and I 've got the in the carbon so I can tell you what they are we haven 't put a dollar price on those but we do have the numbers and it would just be the next step would be to quantify the cost but it is significant yeah so seventeen point five million of modules of energy and 2.5 million of kilograms of carbon of co2 in two thousand tons of waste yep so they 're massive numbers yeah okay well I 've hope the alley Thank You Jimmy I just wanted to expand or tease out the comments that you made around removing the James hay from that that Theatre makes if you like as far as size goes and as it 's now been taken up by the ITR you 're obviously looking at that from a facility perspective from the seating and the amenity and what it provides what about from a community use perspective I mean you 're saying that that you know the Theatre Royal will have that gate for theatres does that necessarily translate to availability for the community as well and could for groups to be that well I think that in terms of what we 're proposing for the James hey it will have a bigger stage area it 'll it 'll have a retractable seating now all of that is reasonably straightforward modifications so so the facility will be available in its various forms in depending on what the community wants and needs if if you go back to the venue 's matrix it lists a whole bunch of other venues and amenities like a rebuilt repertory bike the shared at Eddington when the court theatre vaycay so by doing what we 're doing we 're freeing up space around the town for those those various activities yes yes Jimmy in question regarding to the insurance payout weather has been conform with the insurer for those options okay so the the the assumptions regarding the insurance payer has been run past the counsel financial team that are dealing with the insurers and as of today that is the current situation and so that 's consistent that advice has come back from the chief financial officers office but that is that is a correct assumption couple of insurance is it insurance oh you know what I 'll come back to after I 've gone through these Tim thank you go back to your facilities matrix on 104 I was covered by the Town Hall C is covered by the Isaac theatre royal yep D is of course covered by the court theatre but with regards to B and E and that 's specifically to the James hey we were else and Christchurch as yeah I mean as you 'd the proposal to have a fly floor night you 've talked about retractable seating you 've talked about a large applaud ahead you know after a thousand a bigger stage area but at the moment that the the James Hill prior to the earthquake could facilitate a number of things so your and B is specifically for symphonic in chamber music yes so so before the earthquake the James hay was frequently criticized for poor acoustics poor sight lines and another number of other deficiencies particularly back of stage handling and things like that the James he wasn 't loved and prior to the earthquake we hey to address some of those issues where we 're at now is to say actually James and it was a really interesting comment from Hayworth in Tompkins theatres consultants and designers who were in town a couple of weeks ago with the core theater and we took them to the James hey and their immediate comment was well what a beautiful space for a conte chamber room chamber music and so they worked up some schemes for us around that so that 's that 's where we 're heading we would go that 's the gap in the market that 's the gap in the current provision and it 's a it 's a good fit with the repurposed James a follow up so I just I just think if we 're going to do that we 're going to miss an opportunity if there 's any way we can kind of forget and revamp and rebuild for the future then I 'd really like to push that and look at that opportunity because we 're not going to once we 've done it we 're not gonna be there just with regards to both the James say and the auditorium that there was always an issue of load and bite for production companies whether there was New Zealand Belle a southern belle is whoever there was it was always issues so is it specifically being looked at and the information that you 're looking at yes it is so in terms of the user groups so we 've had this initial contact with mostly users of the James hay on the auditorium the town hall and there 's some feedback on some of those technical aspects around the loadings we understand that the requirements the actual movement forward in terms of the actual fit for the James hey we think that 's gonna be an awful lot more work than in that space as well in terms of user groups to bring that so going back to the fly floor issue with regards to if we 've only got the Isaac Theatre Royal with the flight floor and the court theatre if they have a fly system what opportunities so for Southern Ballet and others smaller mid-sized touring I don 't see any just on on the screen up there is a section through the the James hay has we so that 's there 's a section through the James hay as it exists now and you can see that there 's a major flight tower structure there and you can see the stage ends at the the orchestra put there this is a revised section through where we actually maintain a small flight out we bring the stage forward we reconfigure the gallery and the stalls and put some acoustic treatment in there so that it works better as a music venue so the question you 're asking is would you know could could the ballet perform in there yes they could because it 's a they 've got a bigger stage typically they don 't have massive it 's they they do with minimal sets at the moment so we do have the facilitator to drop some simple backstage you 're back see it down through there what I want to show you is what how help might work so severe there is the seating in symphonic mode _"

    "text": "and now we move back to deputations by appointment and Robert yoga Burke is speaking to item 37 options for decision making for the Eastern recreation sports center thank you Robert Boyle and it 's on your supplementary rajinder everyone yeah thank you very much for the opportunity to address the council on this matter which is very dear to the hearts of the east as you would expect a few points to raise with regard to the report you have in front of you and my points are supported by all the members of the Eastern recreation and sports center CAG that I was able to contact since we 've got final report on Wednesday on Tuesday this week and that was most of them these are our points we agreed that the report needed to proceed to the council to avoid any further delays it 's just but it 's been over two months just over two months since the report was requested urgency for the Eastern recreation and sports center has only increased since the announcement of a three-year delay of the Metropolitan sports facility so far as they do more investigation in general we 're not really sure what might be lost from that Center as the investigations come through and watch which ones might be able to be picked up by the eastern recreation and sports center with regard to the eastern recreation and sports center capacity is the critical issue please don 't be distracted by the talk of a must-have 50 meter pool it 's a red herring the current proposed scope is under capacity for the explicit and suppressed demand that will hit that facility and just for your information that the I sort of drive to that report there were five options which covered the broader range but option to appear as a at the suggestion of the keg as a compromise between what was a full review of the scope by the keg and the option three that you have in front of in front of you as the document now stands and I believe throughout the drafting process there it has significantly overrated the disadvantages and underrated the advantages of keg involvement there are two of those disadvantaged I project delay will result in a scope will result while scope is re-established and to our mind this could have been done quite easily in the two months it 's taken to get this report to Council so it 's slightly frustrating that we 're back here I 'd like to point out that that the majority of that time had nothing to do with the keg we there was no delays from cave responses the second point that I 'd like to talk about is that may create expectations that cannot be fulfilled eg the number and size of pools I don 't believe this is likely as the community is clear that what we have is a choice of options within a limited budget nobody in the community believes that this is a Christmas wish list with an unlimited checkbook a number of the other disadvantages could easily be managed appropriate controls therefore you might be surprised to hear that the CAG members that I represent don 't support the analysis and conclusion of this report nor the recommendation regardless of the council 's decision on this report continue engaged directly with other groups interested in kirito Park to ensure we all work together for the best result for the Easter community the keg is very keen are very keen to work with the other interested parties towards getting a facility that provides appropriate capacity Paul capacity for the wider community the high schools and other interested parties within the the yeast because our youth in the east and in nearby Ward 's really need to be given the opportunity to get to their their individual aspirations and I know that 's a very much a theme from the high schools as well they need the equal opportunity to achieve the competitive goals and that is compromised be excessive travel that 's needed to cross the CBD to get to appropriate facilities in some circumstances that could be three or four times a week and that can make it prohibitive in terms of both cost and time for families to do that our community needs the fair and X fair and reasonable access to deep water facilities to maintain health and wellness through the you know the normal with hip problems etc we also have a large number of families in the area and learn to swim is critical for them in easy reach without the need to compete for spaces that are very limited we also have an age demographic that needs to be recognized and acted upon and the costs of not having facilities nearby that people can self manage their their own health really will will hit us in the future and finally the community wants to be involved in defining those family features that have been earmarked by the 6.5 million dollar fund so that it would truly does turn out to be a facility that 's fantastic for the kids for the to improve their enjoyment of the facility we 've been receiving continuing feedback from our community groups that supports the direction that we 've been laid out the council has a choice today to embrace the way of thinking a new way of thinking and acting with regard to the and cross church communities to step up to the challenges of purse quake post-quake recovery and the 21st century by truly which trusts and respects that the config all the communities that this council serves and to regain the trust that has been lost over the years or you can follow the recommended approach which we believe has been shown again and again to be an adversarial authoritarian and patronizing model that divides the community from the council rather than brings them together it assumes that all knowledge and wisdom resides in the council and that the community does not want know what it needs it cannot be trusted with the information to make the hard choices and contributed to a great result it can only be involved peripherally after the choices that have been simplified for a consultation process this is the time for community led initiatives we stand ready to be part of the council 's the future council engagement model for the benefit of all in closing I 'd like to leave you with one piece of feedback we have received recently that neatly sums up the vast majority of opinion that we have and continue to receive and I quote being a long-term resident living in the the swimming complex was one of the most enjoyable assets we have ever had to lose this during the febri quake was a lot a huge loss not only for us but the hundreds of people who use the facility every day it is appalling to think that now after over four years of fighting for what we rightly deserve it is still lingering on without any end to this matter being resolved please listen to what we want and what we were promised the east side of the Christchurch it is one day going to be a thriving community again with the high schools being built on the same site as qe2 now is the time to plan the swimming complex sensibly to cater for all the young people middle-aged and elderly people who will be using this facility for many years to come thank you very much thanks very much Robert and you know I would like to say that I don 't think that there 's anyone around this table that wouldn 't want to express gratitude for the input of the community advisory group the process have had discussions about it before but you know the valuable contribution of voluntary time as as appreciated so kind of want to kind of say that from the outset in terms of the the Eastern sport and Rec Center that the comment that you just spread out i think is a very good starting point it 's great news that the schools are co-locating with the eastern sport and Rec Center right absolutely there is absolutely no question that the if you put your mind into a positive mode and think about how if the community gets together plans how the site is going to be used and how to then extend that site out into the the red spite the red zones and the you know all the ideas about a wilderness area you know the using the the red zone as a thoroughfare for for recreation for water sports you 've got qe2 in just about the key point is the keystone to that and you can just start with the schools in the Easter sports and recreation center and start building out but what you have as they here are all our needs how do we accommodate them in the site we 've got what 's the best way to start it and perhaps you know some sort of an arrangement where the schools are on one side there is some shared facilities as the eastern recreate Sports Center and then that flows into green space sports fields you know wetlands the whole lot it could turn into something spectacular for the for the east and the fact that we 've got all that investment waiting to happen in the East will be I suppose just the the marker to the community that right we 've got started we are actually doing something and you know we 've heard people who are frustrated they 're stressed and even yesterday 's when the last speaker i was watching on live stream was saying how the stress is now starting to take its toll on the community just the stress of needing to fight for getting around getting around town you know if you go anywhere in the east don 't be guaranteed that you 're going to or even this morning I know there 's there 's all of that that that has been wearing on the community so we need to see some positive stuff going through and the community wants to be part of that really involved in it and I 'm sorry I 'm getting slightly passionate because I think it 's a fact as we want you to be passionate about it Robert that 's the whole point I think it 's a positive thing I we need to be careful how it just seemed more excited when I heard that the schools were going to locate it qe2 because I thought this is it you know not I mean I know they 're people in that area who 've been wanting a high school and that part of town for a very very long time and now they 've got to high school single sex education as an option that a lot of parents would choose for their for their kids but it 's going to have the sort of kind of its bigger bangs for your backs as it were and an aquatic center is it I mean it 's a recreation center as well and it 's a starting point you could build on as the years go by we know we have a limited budget but we need to get it right we need to plan how the whole thing is going to work properly so that we can easily add to it so that we don 't get people disadvantage with access that the schools have what they need and personally my family is right in the center of this argument because I have two children that would benefit from those high schools and we are all four of a swimmers so you know and I 'm by no means the only person in the East that is in that situation are very closely but we have a broader range people as well so catering for those needs and being having a balanced view where the community contributes is really the key thing that 's why we support option two rather than option three and you 're in the paper you 're having fun but having the criteria just said we want a place for the eastern sport and Rec Center where it can grow over time if there 's further to be added to it you see there that affects where it would be located yeah you know the schools have needs too we 've actually also got a road that 's already through there but it 's not used as a road I never even thought of it as the road that creates other options as well with the buses travel down that road instead of continuing down Travis road isn 't it yeah it goes down yeah so you know so all of these options but that 's the conversation that we now want to kind of spark spark up and develop we have to engage the schools in the ministry in that debate as well so it 's a broader community debate absolutely we 've had contact with various representation from the schools and they they saying so many of the same things that we are about and they still have concerns about the size of the facility because they know what what they hundred students they 're projecting not in in the near future they 'll hit 2600 because they 've had a drop of role but they expect it to pick up again because you 've got a lot of young families in the area as well so you 've got all those you 've got intermediate nearby you 've got Y tecate which is whereby daughter goes that 's 600 children just there there 's Queens Park was the similar size there are a number of schools around there there 's a lot of suppressed demand and they have these funny little above ground plastic swimming pools to do this swim training and I 'm sorry you know I possibly get wet to the knees if I standards they 're pretty shallow things yeah that 's all we have at the moment they fit the category better than nothing but they well you exactly want Justin yeah so I mean that 's that 's really we 're coming from we still see this is positive we still want to be involved with it you know this is not about getting at being part of it and and having the community and the council work together and and it as positive way as possible and that 's really why we 've gone is gone no thanks Robert no well that 's that 's time so are an uppercut course of domination as usual so thank you very much I 'm just as passionate about it is cheaper so all right so let 's move on _"

    "text": "participation and the first person that I 'd like to call it up as Helen brought on Helen must out yesterday on the deputations on the Town Hall due to not seeing an email that arrived later than then she was available to read it so come forward hallinan and we 'll have heavy 45 minutes as part of our public participation as we dealt with these deputation easy and thank you thank you for this opportunity and I will be in fact brief and the background probably i have on the Town Hall was that I was cheer about sand heritage for the first Tomb of the last tomb of council and in the second term I was chewin finance we are a lot of time was spent on affect insurance so I 'm just concerned that in the media does miss about the town hall and I just want to give you my perspective because I think some of these and myths the first one is insurance money it seems to be an implied that if the council walks away from this and builds another town hall you understanding and I 'm backed by Deloitte 's which I 've now read if you walk away from at you will get the indemnity value only of 32 million so I think there 's a financial issue there that you have to keep carefully consider the other second myth is that there was little consultation done that 's not true the last council consulted through the 2013 2016 plan eighty percent of submitters supported the retention of the town hall in at that point that was the general public feeling but there was definite consultation done you 're probably surprised to find it 's a group one Heritage listed building because it is a modern building I was asked by than previous mere to compile a list for the minister of of heritage buildings that must be kept if they can be and your note and the listener article he states that he was originally thinking of Fort he 's now gone to infect 30 now that is that list it was compiled not with me but a range of heritage people went to Nicky Wagner and Ruth Dyson as modern heritage buildings which we requested be kept the other two have been demolished so the Town Hall is the only one of modern heritage which is still potentially able to be saved the fourth math is that James hey must be restored as us the last council had no concerns about the jamis a being remodeled changed fourth future for future use I personally have no problems of the foyer has changed remodeled so it 's not true that the James hey must be set in concrete the fifth point is that it 's not feasible in engineering terms in august 2013 the councillors of that era did a walk around the building it seems surprisingly good and i 'm sure you 've had the same walk around the land seemed to be the question the engineers believed that they had a solution that had worked overseas but if that wasn 't going to work deep piling could be done at little extra cost and i 'm very clear that the engineering company said they would sign off on it because i asked him directly so there is one sign off on this as being safe it was an additional 30 million set aside in the council budget for the Arts precinct now my understanding was that that was originally going to be provided by the crown it 's 30 million and the last day of the cost sharing agreement that offer was withdrawn but regardless of who funds that it was at that point an extra 30 million was put into the council budget for the Arts at precinct so just to conclude I 'm playing with you to restore the Town Hall as quickly as possible the Anglican Cathedral also a group one heritage building has caused huge upset within our community please do not let another another heritage building that you have control of be so divisive I 'm asking you to get on with restoring our town hall as soon as possible we thank you very much and two-time torti obviously won 't practice thank you and I do have if anyone would like this list that went to the minister I came circulated that it was there at that time in april 2011 a thank you very much and just for those that are interested in christchurch town hall was an issue will be debating met and making our decision one o 'clock this afternoon we go thank you yeah i should actually say also at the assets of the meeting that we 're having two adjournments one at ten-thirty to 1130 and then another one leavin 3212 the tool sorry 12th even twelve thirty two to one and and because there are a number of openings that are happening today which is fantastic we 've got the innovations an evasion precinct and we 've also got the sports academy football academy out at your to switch is fantastic venture as well so yeah so various ones of us will be going to either of those so the next _"

    "text": "uh Tamar da it 's a pleasure to be here for the fifth time in three years to advocate for the full retention of the tunnel so this morning I 'm going to give you five points and let 's see if I can get through the 15 minutes I 'm just a word on the return on investment so the deloitte 's report outlines very clearly that you get a significant return on investment and making the decision to restore the town hall and fall but I just want to repeat something Ian seed that we are will also get a return on the investment made by our predecessors Christchurch have been without a town hall for a hundred years when the people of the city banded together to raise funds to build one and as you 've heard by the time the building was opened the public raised nearly twenty percent of the total cost of the building now you might want to think about after being the people christchurch if they want to donate again they might some of us certainly would but can you imagine them today over and above the contribution through rates I can 't see they 're happening I really think it 's important to honor their investment made by our predecessors made by the people of the city my second point being world class now there wasn 't a CREP investment either I 'd like to point out the words world class are bandied about frequently an official statements on the rebuild of Christchurch by restoring and repairing the Town Hall we know we 're getting a world-class venue we don 't need to speculate about it we don 't need to talk it up it has already repeatedly being recognized as a world-class building it is already meaningfully world-class my third point sustainability what is the environmental cost of demolition this is a question that hasn 't been asked enough in Christchurch in the past four and a half years for someone of my generation it is a really important question no one 's talking about what an environmental disaster it has been for us to have seen a hundred and sixty years of accumulated urban fabric to the tap to it and to build it all that embodied carbon taken out of use and Bend and then we have to replace it from scratch with new material using more energy and fossil fuels retention of the whole of the town hall speaks to a range of values I think you 've heard that this morning but one of them is environmental a recent American study in 2012 confirmed that the greenest building is the one already standing repairing and restoring the Town Hall is the most sustainable option for the city now just a quick word about option to a partial rebuild of the limes room and restaurant like to challenge the assessment made in the option analysis on page 107 of the agenda of the RMA risk as being alone for a partial rebuild of the limes in reliable and restaurant now their comment if you read the report and footnotes is based on a single comment made by a peer reviewer commenting on another report made in 2012 now what the people behind me joined me in challenging that then and we would challenge it now we could whole Linda Ronstadt Jamie 's raised edge and those two rooms do are essential to the architectural quality of the whole building I didn 't properly introduce myself I 'm Jessica holiday dr. jessica holiday have a PhD in art history and architects history so you know it does have this important contribution to make to the whole but think about this what about the contribution those rooms make to the sitting they make a significant contribution to our sense of place especially when you view the building from Victoria Square and in the past year we 've seen people stand up to express powerfully their passion for what their session means to them ah and just a word on the restaurant thing that 's been raised already it always seemed remarkable to me that ok councils maybe not very good at V base at running restaurants but they 're as such a beautiful session for a restaurant I mean it 's an ideal setting for a restaurant I we can any restauranteur and the so she would love to get their hands on it and would make it work quickly gobble down and an intermission the toughest or dim sum I mean it just needs some creativity and thinking and I don 't think the levels are going to make any difference to how that works as a restaurant one last point in took place and well-being I would argue that there is not one building in the city that can match the town hall for the way Adam were in which it has shaped our collective lives many of our most precious shared memories accumulated over decades are associated with the Town Hall science fairs theatrical performances canter meth school choirs and the big sing the first experience of a full live orchestral performance it has been the setting for the full spectrum of public life full price givings university graduations citizenship ceremonies public meetings and major public funerals the majority of the population of the city has established a meaningful connection to this building the sense of place created by the town hall was remarkable before the earthquake now an assoc that has had a sense of place hollowed out by widespread demolition it is extraordinary all the effect that this hollowing out of a sense of place has had on people at notes that some people feel that Christ Church is no longer Christchurch the research notes that there is now four years later a greater understanding that demolished buildings and infrastructure has had an impact on people 's self identity and I 'll quote one of those people from negra port one of the difficult things for me when you drive it 's just like scorched earth all the familiar things have gone what was a net big gap it makes you feel lost I 'm at sea the Town Hall is one of our few remaining anchors and the sea of loss it provides us with sense of place which means it is connected to our well-being remarkable special buildings like the Town Hall not only provide physical shelter to house our fragile bodies they house our memories our fantasies dreams and desires the town hall in riches our experience of Christchurch and it strengthens our sense of belonging and our sense of citizenship for our city to thrive we need these qualities generated feel a sense of place and a sense of belonging thank you ok um yeah the never forget the greenest building as the one that 's already standing I heard mere mere Bob from Greensburg Kansas say that and a speech that he gave in a conference I went to a couple years ago and but you quoted it from a there was a study in 2012 I can send you the link yeah if it would be great would be really because an American study and it showed that if you build a new building got all the latest greenest technology and methods that still takes 80 years before it 's up to the point with the building that 's already standing hey now we 're looking at I mean the one of the options obviously tomorrow as the do-nothing option which as I 've cost attached to it of 12 million including cost to date of 7 million so I assume that they 're saying 5 million for the actual cost of demolition but that seems awfully like to me but but there is as you say a is the which is the environmental costs and I do worry about this because I you know I see repairable buildings being demolished every day when one 's being demolished at the moment to make way for our library so how does that make our library ever sustainable because we 've not done a building that could have been used for a different purpose like a hotel as it was I mean I worry about this i don 't know i don 't know why other people weren 't worried about it but i 'm glad you are and i 'm glad that you 've raised it Jonnie thank you for your presentation um but number of submitters have commented on the importance national ad and also internationally of the space do you think there 's a case for and able to meet with the minister of culture and heritage this afternoon for the first time since the earthquake so that 's really exciting do you think is a case for us asking for central government help given it significantly ah yes if you if you see an avenue for difficult argument to make I 'm not quite sure what ever knew you 'd facility I think you might have more luck with the provincial council okay yeah I might yeah which is also important it is very important really that we 've we 've had to kind of almost like moth ball but protect it and well protected you know and that that has a cost to it as well but you know so now you can take your time yeah it has to take its time and you and I mean maybe that 's a question here around the town hall I mean components of it you know that you know are we able to take our time and repair but so that it was interesting to see that there Deloitte 's address there and the report and came to the conclusion that it was actually be sure to have the big bang yeah it was the phrase they use yeah a different kind of big bang no no you know if you think of this is our cultural stadium and you think about if we go crown seems to me you know possibly it is a oh maybe you should have negotiated in the cost year yani sorry I mean it 's not fair to ask somebody who 's come along to make I think the points that you 've made to comment on what was in fact a political discussion between ourselves and the crown so look thank you very much for your contribution it 's been extremely helpful and i found today very valuable indeed so I think of Jessica with the last the last of our submitters last of our deputations is that right alright so being that and yannis defense Jessica to confirm that the building is of national significance and I think that was something good is an open asking whether this should be a contribution from central government it 's actually something we need to have that discussion with with central government and I 'm sure yani doesn 't need defending by anyone and he 's perfectly capable of defending himself anyway well it would thank you very much everyone and thank you all of the submitters and staffer present as 's been extremely helpful and you know just just as kind of wound it up just to you know remind people that you know nine of the people sitting in this room here we 're here when the decision was made and it 's been incredibly useful to have the degree of advice and support and acknowledgement that you 've been able to provide us with as a council that is going to make some decisions tomorrow but that 's that 's the end of today and tomorrow we 'll be dealing with the matter it 's highly likely that we will deal with the Town Hall item that we 've addressed at one o 'clock tomorrow afternoon and think I 'm going to try and aim for that so that people know what time they can either TuneIn on the live stream or the time that they can come down here and observe the debate so thank you very much I was during the meeting until tomorrow morning x 9 13 9 30 _"

    "text": "sir miles Warren and I don 't know does Morris Manny want to come up as well I 've got them down as a double weight or hey thank you good morning and welcome you go first hmm yep get all done on a other side good morning and welcome I never thought to say just a couple of points one about the use of the place of Bigfoot team and a little comment about costs but the after the februari 2011 earthquake I asked V base the people who have been operating the town hall for you information about what uses of Italy hood serve in a typical year they came up with the figures for the whole of 2010 because despite the sep tember earthquake the complex had continued in full operation for all of that year so therefore the figures were as up-to-date as possible they showed that a quite amazing range of functions had been helped there that year a much greater variety than most of us would suppose and that is not unreasonable to assume that it would have represented a typical years operation in in 2010 all the following kinds of events took place there breakfast cocktail parties concerts conferences demonstrations product launches exhibitions gardeners graduations meetings seminars the big scene school givings school balls theatre performances and the wedding there was in fact overall a grand total of 316 bookings in that one year very far short of one a day this is where the repeat of what you 've had i think but many of the uses to which the town hall is put a functions having large numbers of participants who need to be prepared and organized elsewhere in the premises before taking their places and turns on stage luxe functions whether in the auditorium or the theater most of the risk the complex is often required those situations arise when the place is hired for graduation ceremonies schools music festivals the biggest thing schools prize-giving and so on they 're all regular and your functions so just retaining the auditorium and giving it a large new entrance for you in places the theater will not meet the needs of those customers at all or will it provide any or any a theater it 's certainly true that the Town Hall enjoyed a hugely extensive range of uses in any given year far more than just orchestral concerts and although undoubtedly much of its worldwide reputation is due to the superb acoustics of the auditorium what is this mint and still means to the people of Christchurch is that it fulfilled our need for a grand place to gather and especially to enjoy all manner of community functions have that need more than ever and every effort must surely be made to restore our favorite gathering and entertainment building to its former glory and as to the cost involved hurry must remind you and all the media that a a payout of the town halls insurance money cost to the city right of the quakes that else had already committed to spend at least 16 million upgrading the complex but there for the cost of the city of restoring the whole complex will actually only be about 40 million more than was originally intended for the upgrade that 's my short little comment I 'm actually did do we want to first and then have a double egged or well they hand over to you oh hey daddy 's here how much to say and I haven 't written the out in fact I 'm only said very disorganized when the winter James hey did the campaign to build a town hall his main contention was that the four main centers Auckland Wellington Christchurch and Dunedin Christchurch was the only city with no Town Hall no auditorium for civic events festivals large-scale performances and so on the city only had the inadequate Civic Theatre which most of you won 't remember and the King Edward barracks you can imagine a concert in the king and it would barracks and that black hole if rain you couldn 't hear a thing Morris has covered the uses of the of the town hall itself basically the auditorium has become the place where we gathered to enjoy and celebrate the life of the city it has become our living room with remembering that the James hey was first designed as a theater for drama for speech not for music it was fully used for at the time the JC Williamson at that time JC Williamson had abandoned the Theatre Royal but now it has been splendidly restored I should it be bought a group of us bought the Theatre Royal for a hundred and sixty thousand dollars thank goodness and the long struggle to so that would have been lost to theatre has quite properly moved the Theatre Royal quoting the words of the executive summary the James hey will become a mid-sized auditorium for classical music and a midsize flat floor contemporary music venue for 500 or 600 seated and 1,000 people standing so the James hey will be changed from a whole design for speech with a dry acoustic to an acoustic for appropriate for musical events I think that 's all I have to say issue I 'm sure that people have got questions yeah Ellie I ask this with the greatest of respect but can I get your opinion on the acoustics that we hear so much about and I do understand Russian that has put the world class exceptional amazing acoustics do you think that in this day and well the Auckland Town Hall attempted to do that to do it not by the space itself and it proves be a total disaster the Auckland Town Hall York and watch it now called the IdeaCentre the orchestra refuses to play there well it hasn 't been done so far I should say that the generator of the war the original stimulus with it for the design of the Christchurch town hall was the man 's gonna blank great controllable the Albert Hall in London and I only one went there once this was well before the thought of it town hall and Christchurch and set high up in the galleries and to hear that a great space was just astonishing um I took my mother came to the opening of the Christchurch town hall and in those days christchurch had no resident Orchestra the wilson brass band fortunately the heat the days of the big mask was i tried to persuade the organizers of the concert we should have some at least one composition that drove the haul to its full capacity and volume but unfortunately it didn 't concert we there was a full choir they saying we sing god save the queen and the first person the first verses were at standard forte but the second verse they gave it fortissimo and it was mostly it was the first time we 'd heard this great space and my mother turned to me and she said she was in haiti in those days um mouth and you know I heard noises but that was a special noise I said mother you 've got it in a while but it has you know the Christchurch Town Hall had as you all know that extraordinary reputation as a it 's been the forerunner as you 've heard of all the work of how old Marshall leading up to the great French concert hall and just picking up on on some of the dollars and cents you know because tragically we do have to talk about you no money and these circumstances that the insurance cover for the town hall in terms of replacement value which don 't seem to be rather extraordinary lower amount compared to the numbers we 're repair it then the most that we can get from the insurance as 32.4 4 million because that 's the indemnity cover if we build somewhere else then actually the amount of the contribution from insurance as significant what it 's almost halved the orders half is more than aft so that would be a factor that you 'd want to take into account as well yes I mean you thank you for this could you please tell us a bit about the importance of the integration of the whole of the Town Hall semis so the importance of keeping it that all together gems of its original integrity well the building suffered very little damage in the building itself it was the ground that moved you go into it it 's probably something many of you did and you really couldn 't see any damage it went down about so far and well at one side but the real problem was that the ground all the ground between the town hall and the the river had moved and suck so that so much of the cost is in the go into everything will watch damage so it actually survived the earthquake extraordinary will it keeps my questions more along the lines of the importance of keeping it all together because I heard you say before it 's built as one integrated structure so you can 't really chop off bits and that it in fact loses its know it 's going to be a tragedy just to Princeton 's to retain the main of Georgia order form alone with the circulation space relative what what I mean one of the pleasures of the Town Hall those spaces to circulate in before round the town hall and to the James hey into the limes room and so on at three levels it is take all that away and just have a foyer reduces the whole desire and sugar bleah Jamie thanks and we 're fortunate of all people make deputations by think we 're very humbled to be in the presence of two outstanding do you know what in Christ it was made a huge contribution so thank you for being here and speaking to this I want to ask with firm in function and there 's no one better qualified than both of you to da over time we learn from the people that operated the Town Hall that the cascading levels for instance and boaters restaurant wasn 't ideal for holding functions just that people would tend to gravitate on one level what would your view B with respect to the integrity of the heritage and the original design to perhaps make modifications or create what didn 't work so well in the past from or build as time went on or would that ruin what was actually quite special originally so it 's around form business function i can t sorry I we can 't hear you I can 't hear that I 'm sure cue sticks are terrible in this place really to you our doughnuts to be a physics but what Jamie 's saying is is that you know if the if there were elements of the building that didn 't work before and he use the example of boaters being on the two levels you know would it affect the integrity of the building the building in order to retain the whole of the building but to use it for different purposes well maybe fix what didn 't wish the James has can be can be criticized for not being good for for music which it wasn 't designed for wasn 't designed with it is designed for the speech but it can be and there 's a design has been done for already it can be easily modified and era marsh orange team has been involved in that to make it perfectly appropriate for musical events mm but I think that Jamie was talking about other parts of the building as well yes pisode azhar be strong voters restaurant being on the two levels in terms of a restaurant facility you know and I thought the same was the two of the limes room upstairs that you know in Tim it was just such a waste heaven that beautiful view completely cut off you know I guess there has been argument that a key element or a key heritage element of boaters restaurant for example was the cascading levels however from a functional for used previous management were really but weren 't bothered with it I mean they reduced it to a training ground Charlotte basically the management of the Town Hall over a number of years wasn 't interested in running a restaurant and I think it was sadly neglected but maybe councils that very good at running restaurants because it was competing with the park royal alongside which version pretty tough tough deal yeah so would you be amenable to the levels perhaps changing or key heritage elements slightly being older to make it more functional with what we 've almost doubles of the restaurant are to be changed and I don 't know happy baby that 's actually already been been done as part of the charm for the restoration I mean not that as part of the work that was being done before the earthquakes no no no post-earthquake wasn 't oh ok so it design some design works been done in that regard no I don 't know that we were told to be unchanged it because was good and up to RMA rest around some of the Town Hall involves the complete replacement of the air conditioning system mmm inchi enough there were complaints quite rightly in the James hey of the limes room he did overheated and so on and when we eventually it was here conditioned and them at the time they were complaints cool why wasn 't this air-conditioned in the original brief and so we chip back to the brief for the town hall and the only reference to air conditioning as them what at the Town Hall the auditorium shall be choppy heated and ventilated full stop early days early days there but it has been and will be superbly upgraded yeah all right look thank you very much for your for your time that 's some fantastic and as Jamie or it is for such an idiot pressure no no there 's Jamie see that 's just hold on old age get what I want to have you here it really is thank you and Jessica hello _"

    "text": "um Graham Wallace and maybe awesome oh they 'll help you and distribute thinking good morning on Graham Wallace and a present of the Christ at civic music Council and also involved in voice of music which has made a few submissions also like to welcome to the stage Margaret Austin and also David cell David was also failed voice of music the way we 're going to work is Margaret 's going to speak and we will endeavor to answer any questions that you may have practice anything thank you very much indeed as Graham is indicated we 're here representing the Christchurch Civic music council and the voice of music representing the music interests of Christchurch with the class trip civic music council having some 54 affiliates so that it is highly representative of music of music interests and we are here to impress upon you that we are totally in support of the recommendation to fully restore the Town Hall the voice of music was established by the Civic music council when it was challenged by the then minister Christopher Fenderson to engage in developing the case was made was music in the city of christchurch venues for the community solution and legacy which was presented to the minister and to yourselves in August 2011 the present recommendation in the papers before the council is fully in line with the submissions which we have made over the years October 2011 May 2012 October 2012 and jun 2013 these submissions arose out of a series of meetings which brought the music community together to look objectively at venues and facilities for a city of the future and in one of them given the discussions that have been held this morning in the jun 2013 there 's a list of new concert theatres it can suppose in Europe and Australia against population and whether it was a vegetable use hall or a multi useful and the size and ambience etc of our town hall fitted perfectly with the assessment around the world so we are very encouraged by the ration are presented in the documents before council and we endorse the uses that they 've referred to for both the lilburn on auditorium and the james safe theatre as big Seng primary school festival school orchestras and also of course graduations price giving ceremonies civic events and social functions associated with the Convention Center and other activities there are a number of aspects of the that contribute to the success of the auditorium and some of those have been canvassed this morning it is a room of outstanding visual and atmospheric ambience which is inspirational to performers and audiences I might add as in parentheses when the hall was opened and the acoustic problem occurred it wasn 't for the audience that the problem occurred it was the performers and having had two daughters down there playing on that playing in the orchestra 's at that time they would come home and say we couldn 't hear anybody else but ourselves once the dumbbell went up that was absolutely fine they were perfectly happy and smiling particularly after they had an audience was the of a forgotten his name never mind yes the capacity of 2200 has proved to be an ideal size for many musical activities it is on a par with other city venues in New Zealand and 130 the market michael fowler center with 2209 and the dunedin town hall with 2,300 the configuration is flexible and the mystic quality is highly regarded adding to this is the purpose-built raga organ which is a significant asset to the venue the James hate has been used for chamber music arts festivals theater and specialist performances the foyer is particularly suited for social functions we assert though that in addition to the restoration there is a need to improve backstage facilities and the acoustic properties of the James hey which were under consideration prior to the earthquakes the town hall complex has the advantage of being accessible allowing for flexible multi-use is located in a central position with access to off victoria square it has proximity to the planned convention center and other performing arts facilities the Town Hall is a public facility a meeting place and a central place of celebration and critical to a vision of the arts as a key economic driver for christ 's church it contributes to a strong vibrant community in christchurch as a living and livable city the civic music council an essential amenity for the city a landmark public building an exemplar for auditoria around the world and the comments about being identified as a landmark have already been referred to and has the new auditorium in Paris that was opened just recently and that no greater compliment can be paid then to have got marshal and day involved in as the experts and acoustic properties do for that auditorium is essential to marketing a recovering recovered and restored city with the ability to contribute significantly to the economic health of the city similar to the data that was collected for the Wellington City Council in 2010 that the City Council is seriously engaged in a decision on the Town Hall has given the arts music and performance community ate half and confidence and the civic music council and voice of music reinforced their submissions made previously and endorses the proposal to restore the Town Hall complex in its entirety the restored town hall facility will undoubtedly contribute to creating a vibrant and diverse social and cultural community for the city of christchurch and we 're looking forward to 2018 on you know and this is the you know this guy sounded but that and unreasonable coming for me because it 's about dollars and scenes so with the it appeared that the proposal and the Performing sorry and the cost sharing agreement said that we could have it all for brand-new a 1500 seat auditorium a 500-seat mexi venue plus a court theatre space plus CSO administrative space and practice space all for a hundred and sixty seven million but we 're told now in this report that replacement of the existing town hall with a similar 1,500 seat auditorium and 600 seat mixed-use venue alone would cost a hundred and ninety-three million plus site costs we saw it we are we what was going on I mean I wasn 't around for the signing of the cost sharing agreement but did they get that horribly wrong it would seem so from the data that 's presented in the papers that are before you know and in fact we have we argued right from the beginning that a 1500 seater auditorium was not going to suit be a multi-use right which I think Matins submission was absolutely accurate and embracing that a town hall without without the organ was unthinkable in the 1500s data from the evidence that we gathered from around the world was simply inappropriate for a city the size of Christchurch if you were looking for flexibility and multi-use what would preclude graduation ceremonies I wouldn 't yes okay um I have others got questions Yanni you think you think one of the points of your submission what you 've touched on is that it 's an important Civic space and obviously councils are also consulting on removing be less from the strategic s it lists jaani jaani could you please not go into LTP meters this is about the Town Hall because we based on the town hall and we 're proposing to remove fee vs its potatoes so I was just trying to get the sense from you how important is it that this facility it is repaired is kept in public ownership for the civic functions of its head is that an important element to having a building of the scope and size it 's owned and operated and is part of the treasures of the city of the people of Christchurch mm-hmm I 'd agree it 's really part of the fabric of the city and it has been for years now and I still remember when it was being built that there was not mentioned this before there was that little slogan will have a brand new town hall and that still rooms in my mind from those years before and and so people have a sort of an ownership as a venue for the city and I think that 's really important and the other thing I 'd just like to add to what Maddon was saying the Civic music council raised the money for the pipe organ that was five hundred thousand dollars approximately and we also got Rotary clubs involved it took us five years to infect get that all together has so you know there 's been an interest from the people of Christchurch and the town ball and I thought I am absolutely sure that they will continue do you think that the public would would don 't you ask us yeah well that 's what that 's what happened do you recall what happened when Mona Vale was up for sale hmm well we bought everything from a square inch to a square foot and suddenly the people that the people of Christchurch came to the party and bought and did so i was involved in the fundraising for the ordinate the organ I think literally the fundraising committee was chaired by Sir Haymitch hey no and nothing was easier it was rather like the fundraising for the art gallery people actually wanted the App Gallery just as they wanted the organ and they need to be asked hmm we have an ass heavily no okay thank you very much very helpful _"

    "text": "um could I invite I don 't know if Helen Broughton has arrived no Martin hitch hell morning monik may be able to continue nicely from what dr. Lockett has been speaking about in particular the reference to the mushroom though I 'm Martin sexual since 1997 I 've had the privilege of serving the city as the town halls organ curator and I want to focus on the auditorium and in particular a vital part of that whole acoustic ambience we have there and of course it 's the pipe organ in the hall when the mall opened in 1972 that space behind the choir stalls was designated for an organ provision had been made funding was not fully available so the organs can and it was a quarter of a century later in 1997 when thanks to the fundraising efforts of some 50 years the city finally acquired its pipe organ more importantly the organ even when it wasn 't being used at all because obviously the organism used to every concert and I as an organist I wish it were but I accept that it 's not thing is that that structure which which filled in the sort of eleven o 'clock to one o 'clock bit of the you think of a clock face its casework reflective polished beautiful wood you 've all seen it i hope the pipe work with burnished metal these things in a sense completed the acoustic the the problems which have been referred to about the acoustic of the early days yes i believe the where it was before i came to the city and when I first came and played on stage yes the mushroom dome had to be fixed lowered to a certain height so that we the players could hear other players even across the state the interesting thing and the significant thing is let me lay this to rest once and for all once the organ was installed marshal and days original acoustic plan as a whole was only then complete and it 's significant passage to the organ was in school the very end result said it was only the incomplete right in my in my view the eye view because i think that the lack space where sound flew everywhere that was part of the reason I 'm not an acoustic expert I can only speak to about the all but certainly from my experience of many performances in the town hall very rarely after 1997 when the organ had filled that space was it necessary for the orchestra 's to use the mushroom dome it 's it 's virtually remained high up since then but now I 've come a little more to the instrument now because it 's not just the acoustic it was designed and scaled them voiced specifically for our town hall not you know you don 't just buy one off off the peg as it were and put you the hall this was a specific structure designed for our town hall I for a large concert hall two thousand plus seats it 's part of the structure it 's firmly part of the structure it 's a continuation of the wall it 's an integral part of the auditorium we have you may know that it was built by Riga or Baba of Austria one of the top ten downtown evidence but one of the world 's top European organ firms I would say it 's the equivalent of a BMW if you want to talking to top of the water yeah oh no no that would be an English organ and that is an interesting point because Ian mentioned the revolutionary thinking of kiwis which I as an Englishman have always been terribly impressed with I mean Matt honestly one of the revolutions that we made in our decision to go to reader for the organ and not to Harrison or to Walker autumn and ER in England was because of this whole revolutionary thinking regas design and the sort of incident they built was perfect for the acoustic which marshall in visits but we were striking out in a new way all the other old town halls in finland in dunedin in wellington and in oakland all have english style edwardian instruments from the turn of the century ours is revolutionary because it 's a 19 is that the most modern instrument and yet a wonderful sound so we dared to be different in going continental the gentlemen in 1997 I can only guess at how many times more that is now worth conservatively at least three to five times more and what 's even more important about that money is the fact that with due respect the council did not purchase it no virtually the whole amount was derived from fund from the funding of good people of Christchurch over many many years families made bequests we ran a a buyer pipe campaign families have got pipes and they ring me up as curator every now and again and saying you know my pipes number sound so can you go and show me which one it is because that sample bills pipe who died and loved or me there is a whole heritage of history around this issue so it 's very much the people 's instrument in an other cement and its use with all the the various users the orchestra 's the antenna so the choirs and so on it 's played its part I won 't dwell on that but of course in its own right it has attracted some of the world carlo curly so the organ as well as the building installed about the building but remember this our organ is itself significant locally nationally and very much internationally if you want to read about it go to its website dub dub dub n said organ calm and you can read everything feed about the history for interest it sounds like a donation dr dot n said organ calm on on the very good assumption as only one said one new zealand organ and that 's out but don 't get ok now in post-earthquake christchurch just thinking of organs generally we know how many of fine instruments have been destroyed they 've been dismantled the future our own to cathedral instruments other large instruments is very very uncertain shall we say therefore if this Alton was important before the earthquake it 's even more or now for the city as as if in its own resource a further aspect in the report it mentions that the facility was in the midst of refurbishment when the earthquake events occurred you know that the context was in the midst of refurbishment this out by Riga in the very week of the earthquake they were just at the end of this the reason for that was that the trust which I am as organist to death XD she remember the Friends of the Christchurch town hawg and charitable trust it 's has registered charitable trust it 's funded and supported the organ since it was installed we were left a generous bequest of about half a million dollars and we put that towards improving you know adding new colors to the organ which weren 't there before think of it as adding new colors to the paint box we didn 't have before those were installed of course sadly we 've never heard them they 've never been used because the earthquake in to me but they 're in there they 're ready to go once the organ is restored the City Council as you should know I hope Commission Riga the Beadle to visit and inspect the organ you were given a reporter full report in november two thousand eleven i 'm sure the staff have shown that to you venla naval organ is unbelievably minimal there is nothing which can 't_''_472.11 be repaired or restored and only a few pipes need to be replaced all the organ builders and international experts have advised us that it 's far best to leave the organ in city during the restoration not remove it and take it somewhere and store it and bring it back that has hazards and dangers of its own sure there are some risks of leaving it in the building we know that but to prevent damage the the organ has been encased thoroughly very carefully by the builders inc and in conjunction with Rigas exact specifications to protect it whilst restoration takes place of course the main reasons for not moving off site are apart from security are horrendous costs you imagine how long it takes to disassemble a huge jigsaw like that the costs of storing it in a large warehouse for how many years and then even greater the cost of reassembling it those costs are significant probably in the reason of over a million dollars so to sum up the organs an integral part of the of it I wouldn 't claim it 's the main part but it is part of it it did complete the auditorium acoustically it 's part of the building there for restoring the building with the organ inside it it 's the only way we can be sure we will retain what we know we have whether it 's one of the best ten in the world or amongst the best ten really pounds into insignificance it 's the fact that we know what we 've got it 's the devil we know any thought of building another one risks the fact that we will not replicate it quite apart from the question of size I have personal experience of performing in some similar halls in the Esplanade hall in Singapore and in the car honk honk cultural center which have organs I 've been invited to play them and I always come back and think how lucky we are in Christ shirts without and I tell you that sincerely so please we 've been without a large concert hall for four years four and a half years please don and the unanimous vote of your previous council and confirm to proceed with the red repair and restoration of the question town hall auditorium thank you i 'm sorry i 've only left a minute for this it 's my questions appalling to call me what an education it was thank you very much yeah I actually was even wondering where is the open is it still in the ER yeah it is it 's in case maybe I 'll ask me that and I spend a lot of time you know my job is to the a 's between council between the public between the friends charitable trust of course and many people bring me up and say I 'm so sorry we all they think it 's been destroyed because we 've heard terrible tragic stories along as being an organ builders even killed in Durham Street Church trying to remove tragedy people people tear it with that brush and I 'm able to assure them that the organ if we could get the power on and the building was safe we could play you know within a that 's never been tried out what grade on us and you can imagine fasting today yeah you know a group has ok it was a request but five half a million 's gone into something that we haven 't yet near the benefit it was good before but it 's gonna be fantastic now it 's a laminate but I used to visit the website if you are interested in the history because that will give you far more Tiffin it was them I was just going to say that I have my own theory as to why the damage wouldn 't have occurred and it 's called what engineers would describe as poor man 's base isolation the land was just so rubbish underneath it that it couldn 't transmit the strength of the vibrations up into the building which is why the only damage inside the building is lectris bread not shaking damaged so we 've been to have a tour of it and your arm season ii was an eye-opener to me there it 's part of that that that horseshoe Chet is part of it high up it 's on the wall the damage was suffered by instruments stored in the basement our grand pianos and so on because of the water the orders Matt because it 's higher and because it 's structurally a part of that in a wall was was really fine and that 's why I bell when he came out I drove him through the city and he covered his eyes when he saw our destruction and he got in the hall and he almost cried with relief yeah and he sliced on Albin elsewhere in the world through an earthquake you know right alright well thank you very very much and I think thank you for your patience so you love it _"

    "text": "Ian Lockheed Lockheed sorry he he 'd you sorry my I 've got the flu and it 's come back worse this week than it was last week and I don 't actually know why somebody suggested I might be run down well I don 't have that excuse but I am just getting over a cold so but thank you for this opportunity to submit on the on the town hall and I should just say I 'm Ian Lockheed and I 'm submitting on behalf of Historic Places Canterbury and keep our town hall and I 'm pleased on went before me because what I 'm going to say follows on from his final comments what I want to emphasize is that you are not making a decision on just another damaged building this is a building of not just local importance not just national importance but absolutely of international significance and that 's mainly what I want to address this morning I 'm sure you all know that the town hall is one of the most significant heritage buildings remaining in the city it 's a group 's an outstanding example of a really important period in New Zealand 's architectural history sometimes referred to as the Christchurch school as a Heritage listing authority under the RMA the City Council has a responsibility to protect its own heritage buildings and to set an example to other building owners buildings such as the Town Hall result from the coming together of many different factors in this case a long-standing community desire for a civic space that would place Christchurch on a par with Auckland Wellington and Dunedin a city council which recognized that the time was right in the 1960s to embark on such a project a moment in architectural history when Christ had emerged as the leading Center for architectural innovation in New Zealand the development of a brief that was specific enough to be useful but broad enough to allow for creativity the commissioning through one of the largest architectural competitions in New Zealand 's history of a design team with the skills to produce an outstanding building the key members of that team were as you 've already heard so Harold marshal sir miles Warren and sir Myles is coming i believe and Sir Harold came and presented to the City Council in August of 2012 in Charles Lonnie there was a contractor who was able to realize a brilliant design and on top of that there was the total commitment of the people of Christchurch which resulted in twenty percent of the cost of the building being met by the public not through rates but through public contributions and I think that 's a really important factor this really is our building such a precious combination of key factors really occurs when a major building is commissioned and it can 't_''_212.72 be replicated at will and I think it 's also important to remember that the Town Hall is both a performance venue and our most important Civic space when used for university graduations for school prize-giving he 's foremast school concerts of the kinds we 've just heard about christmas concerts and other celebratory events it is barely big enough and the whole venue is used and i 'll come back to that point in a moment another context I 've described the we come together to mark the significant moments in our collective life as a city as a complex the Town Hall is greater than the sum of its parts the clarity of the planning the spatial complexity of the multi-level circulation areas the connection with the avon river in victoria square all make an experience the experience of visiting the town hall exceptional and i think you only have to go to the likes of the victoria state theatre and melbourne or the q packed the Performing Arts Center and Brisbane to realize just how skillful the planning of the Christchurch all is because you always know where you are in both those Australian venues it can be really baffling experience to negotiate your way around through the foyers and or even just to get out of the building at the end of a concert the loss of any part of an architectural complex square all the parts as closely integrated as they are in the Town Hall would be seriously detrimental to the whole and I can 't speak for the University of Canterbury but I 've been a many graduations in the town hall and I can confirm and this really relates to the point the question that was asked earlier that during graduations the university 's makes use of the entire complex graduations in the CBS Rena are in comparison pretty lackluster affairs there 's no interior space for marshalling graduates so if it 's raining it 's a real problem so just getting the graduates or graduates in their sequence before the event is a problem and afterwards there is constricted space for socialising with graduates and their families in the town hall the James a theatre allows us to marshal the students get them in the right order to file into the town hall and the range of function rooms the Lyman 's room and so on various foyers faces makes it possible for various groups to go to designated areas so that the staff know where their graduates will be so you can socialize with them and meet their family and that 's a really important part of that graduation experience that just doesn 't happen in the arena so restoration in part is on the 27 22nd of November 2012 so Harold Marshall stated as a professor of architecture for some 25 years I have no hesitation in declaring that the Christchurch town hall building as a whole is the finest piece of architecture built in New Zealand in the latter half of the 20th century it 's fitness for purpose the elegance with which it is crafted handrails dolls detailing structure and materials and the clarity with which it was conceived all contribute to the whole and as a whole it must remain this is a true talent speaking of the acoustic design of the hall so Harold explained why this building is unique and I 'm quoting again from Sir Harold submission there are aspects of the acoustical design of the auditorium which are unique and which will never be repeated and perhaps I know these better than anyone else the design was you or the design was acoustically unique in the following ways when it was designed acoustical knowledge was in flux most of the metrics in use today were invented after this hall was designed reverberation time alone was opportunity for the invention of a new design paradigm the importance of lateral reflected sound it was the first building designed specifically to ensure the audibility of lateral reflected sound at all seats to do this the building broke new ground formerly it was entirely without precedent in the late 60s it was the first concert hall to make computer prediction of echo and the audibility of lateral sound and so Harold pointed out that there is a connection with the space race because the computer analysis was done on a former NASA computer at the University of Western Australia and he also emphasized and it was here not in Europe or America it is representative of the willingness of New Zealanders to be to be collaborative across disciplines in exploring a new paradigm what Sir Harold explained so clearly has been validated by other authorities in the field of acoustics professor Trevor Cox of the University of Salford in the UK writing in The Guardian in March of this year rated the Christchurch Town Hall is among the 10 of the world 's best concert halls our town hall acousticians as being revolutionary in its design of the other nine concert halls on his list sex are in Europe one is in Japan one is in the United States one is in Brazil and only one the Christchurch hall is in Australasia the Sydney Opera House for all its spectacular exterior doesn 't figure following the opening of the new Philharmonic Hall in Paris in January of this year Cox identified two parts appalls as the most important precedence for that prestigious Parisian hall the first is the Berlin Philharmonic Hall designed by hand schroon and completed in 1963 a world-famous building and the home of the celebrated Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra the second precedent for the Paris or was the Christchurch Town Hall the Paris Hall was designed by the famous French architect jean nouvel in conjunction with Marshall day acoustics the international consultancy founded by Sir Harold Marshall and it is being recognized as and I quote again from the Guardians music critic one of the most dynamic and exciting places to listen to orchestral music in the world and it takes a lot to impress hard-bitten London would not have been possible without the revolution that occurred in Christchurch between 1966 and 1972 the sound quality of the Paris hall has been described by that same credit as pretty stunning having a combination of dazzling clarity and generous depth across the full range of orchestral sonorities these very qualities clarity of sound within a warm reverberant acoustic of what to distinguish the Christchurch auditorium the true significance of the Christchurch talk Town Hall has scarcely been recognized in New Zealand because we habitually expect innovations in architecture to originate from other parts of the world as Sir Harold has explained it was our ability to innovate without being constrained by received ideas you could say our ability to think laterally that made the revolution of the Christchurch town wall possible with imaginative promotion the new you the unique qualities of our town hall could bring visitors to Christchurch from around the world but most importantly we should restore it for ourselves it is our Tonga and we must treasure it and just to amplify that point about imaginative promotion now if we 've got one of the try and bring the world 's 10 best orchestras to Christchurch in the way that cue park in Brisbane has been bringing the world 's best dance companies to their venue and promoting tourism in Brisbane and they have targets for enormous income coming from there you know why wouldn 't we invite the Paris Orchestra to Christchurch for a week to perform to give chamber concerts in a reconfigured James a theater and it would without doubt bring people from all parts of New Zealand and from Australia as well I heard the Hamburg Philharmonic in Brisbane the people I was sitting next to we 're from Melbourne they 'd flown a similar distance from Melbourne to Brisbane as it is from Melbourne to Christchurch for these reasons and our groups fully support the recommendation before council of full repair and restoration of the town hall to a hundred percent of the NBS thank you we really haven 't got time for questions but I 'm kind of reluctant to let the opportunity of you know having your aseem steam self in front of us as a couple of was made before about the donut heaven to go on to actually remedy the defect and the original design do you want to comment on when that happened and and why that was necessary well I think it 's exactly as as Don explained there was a there was a problem in terms of the performance being able to hear one another and it 's not a critical for a yes and there and that was remedied but what you also have real was at remedy rao sorry i don 't know the answer um relatively early on i lived on within about six months right yeah what what I think you you have to remember was that this hall was going where no other Hall had gone before and so inevitably they were tweaking things and it 's also acknowledged that every concert hall with all the sophisticated computer analysis that happens now is tweaked because acoustics is not something you can predict with absolute precision so tweaking concert halls is the normal yeah and the other thing because I know that others are going to rely on it submission during the long term plan which highlighted that the guardian article was in terms of the reference to 10 of the world 's best concert halls was the sub editors version of what was published what was actually published was Trevor Cox picking teen landmark concert halls around the world where brilliant design means brilliant sound so it didn 't actually categorize them as the teen of the world 's best concert halls they were landmark halls where he was asked to comment on design and sound so I just sub editors have a habit of looking at way and I mean if you were if you were writing up if you were writing an article or an item for a for a journal you couldn 't rely on a sub editors version of what the article was about as a source of valid source for your assertion that it 's one of the ten of the world 's big concert hall it was just a comment that was made by a submitter and they reference touch which we 've now changed no I mean I was very careful among ten of the beers no he said that it was he was that know what I 'm saying what i would say in my submission yeah I 'm but no no but he wasn 't asked to pick the Beast he was asked to pick ten landmark concert halls yes and and and and let their land different reasons and your reason is that it 's a landmark because it 's the first of its kind in the world yes it is a landmark but also the reason it is a landmark is because it yeah if it had been the first of its kind of in the world and it was a dud yeah it wouldn 't be a landmark but it was the first of its kind and it worked brilliantly and it changed the way everybody thought about concert hall design from then onwards it changed the paradigm and as I said in my submission the Paris wall couldn 't have evolved in the way that it did were it not for the design innovations of the Christchurch town hall so but not every subsequent concert comment around the music I can 't even read that because my eyesight so bad the music bed iron and Vienna yes and making the point that it 's shaped like a shoebox your long narrow the acoustics and that rachel is one of the best if not the best in the world absolutely but it has the problem that Gong alluded to you are not people intimacy it doesn 't have the intimacy and you know that 's something that we we value in our experience of musical events that the sense of engagement so to be able to have both there and an outstanding it acoustic is an extraordinary achievement yeah you know it 's not to say that shoebox format concert halls don 't work because they they tend to there are good and bad examples of that but one of the points that Sir Harold made and I think it 's a very valid valid one it was the flexibility of thinking of an architectural team and an acoustic designer who had a radically new theory that made it possible for the paradigm to be reshaped Austria you wouldn 't have had a show because the music Vereen model was so powerful it was powerful in the United States well into the 1970s and if you take for example Avery Fisher Hall which is more or less contemporaneous with the Christchurch town hall this is the concert hall in lincoln center in new york there now i think on their third iteration of trying to get the acoustics right you know we had to put a donut above the stage hmm oh and I 'm not I 'm not disagreeing with you I just think it 's really important that we I mean I made a comment on radio the other day that I hadn 't really near the paperwork now I have so but I just I almost you know fell into a reverie at the point that you said the development of a brief that was specific enough to be useful but broad enough to allow for creativity and I thought imagine if that 's how we were rebuilding our city oh there you go so thank you very very much okay _"

deputations by appointment and go invite done we 're done to come forward please thank you try to avoid hitting you with the material that I provided last time pictures and documentation when I spoke in favor of the retention above all that just table that in cases what he would like to refresh their memories I bring with me today very strong endorsement for the idea of restoring the venue particularly from three representative groups my first the first comment is from Richard Osman I 've been asked to speak on behalf of these people who had tied up with school commitments the practicing teachers such as which of Osman was deputy principal of Elmwood primary school and often involved in using the ball he says he writes and I 'll try to summarize because I realized time is important for a sort as president of the Christchurch schools music festival Association I of the christ trip to town hall the school 's music festival association was established in 1939 by a group of primary school music teachers between 74 2010 saves the music fest from the town were six night festival season 4500 ef5 eight students performed in their families often to packed houses in the

arena while it 's been good to keep be able to keep the festive operating between provide a forum for commuting by primary school children on a large scale the venue has severely compromised the ability of the association to meet its aims quality of experience greatly diminished us the sports stadiums acoustic properties are most unsympathetic Eric towards performances of traditional vocal and instrumental music the audience to be able to hear and see all groups must be the production costs about 45,000 of staging the festival long-term without considerable generous financial support

to group performance a subject that the double versions of announcements made through public address system no joy through hearing a sound bounced back off the back wall production of headphone difficult to encouraging I 'm trying to summarize because of shortness of time I hope people realize the speed reading exercises to save your time I urge the transient City Council in the strongest terms to improve the restoration of the town hall auditorium so a children of Christchurch may once again enjoy the thrill of considered music-making in one of the finest acoustics created by people yours sincerely Richard Osmond prison Christchurch schools music pistol Association I 'm Toby nails point number one excuse me at next representation and comes from paul ellis who was involved in many ways in that paul is currently working in a primary school that was for a number of he says I have been involved in the Town Hall as a music critic associate conductor and celia representative choir director for the Christ chips called use a pistol for 13 years I have also been involved in graduation ceremony and school prize giving presentations and concerts at least one of these concepts was attended and appreciated to buy a presiding city councillor participants would no doubt have been blown away by the atmosphere the ambience and the venue to replicate otherwise would be a hard ask Christchurch needs the cultural security and assurance of what has been so successful as a venue socially and musically in the past for the existing to be reinstated different my last and representation on behalf of is from the secondary music features of Christchurch their president is Dave pet who has head of music at Peponi high school again he senses apologies for not being able to be here in person because of his teaching commitments that asked me to table this on behalf of all the secondary school music teachers of the Christchurch Country and Western Area the canterbury and western music music teachers who are committed to the educational needs of music students across the South Island this association provides professional development and support for all music teachers in Canterbury and Western CWM ta supports the view that the Town Hall should be fully restored if inside the orchestral festival and the biggest thing in particular have not been able to continue in their previously highly successful format because of there being no venue large enough affordable horncastle arena too big and way too expensive unlimited budgets and acoustically suitable this has had an impact on the numbers of schools able to be involved and is stopping any further development of these highly successful events in addition several schools have used the town hall for prize-giving and would return there if the venue is restored as one of the top ten acoustically pleasing concert halls in the world we believe that it is vital the town was fully restored so that it may continue to be the quote jewel in the crown unquote of large performance venues in Christchurch the vibrant cultural life of our city has been severely impacted by this venue restored so that the apps may continue to grow and develop we also need to be able to continue to attract top international artists Christchurch and without a suitable venue this is really difficult thank you for your time on the slanted date that can be whistle music teachers association chair head of music Peponi high school most of the three submissions I brought to you from other people may I just also make a brief comment on the value of having more facilities beyond the auditorium for the presentation of events well for the 20-plus is that I coordinated the big scene with 35 choirs from all the schools of our city and further afield we had to use every possible space we had to use the samoan room above the auditorium we had to use the obviously the green room out the back but we also had to overflow into the cambridge room and the various other conference rooms behind and above and around the james hey because with 35 choirs going through in succession those folks had have to be able to rehearse separately have it 's had lots more cultural festivals now that we 've become an even more multicultural City these groups many groups of this kind need more spaces to perform too I would also very strongly endorse the value of the James have been redeveloped as an acoustic musically acoustically redeveloped venue my personal view is that there is a looking at the report some very exciting possibilities I 've heard from experience and places like me in bridgewater new performance halls Singapore has recently on this thing up of the new Singapore concert hall many of these places have acoustic very variable acoustics Singapore you push a button and sliding panels move and things around the roof move and either curtains come out to deaden the acoustic or they go away and reflective panels come out and suddenly very live acoustic you simply dial up whatever you want large hall bedroom don 't know about the letter so all power to your elbows and thank you for the opportunity to speak to the piece de please stay this time for questions le yes I just wanted to know it you the very end there how many other events in your opinion all your knowledge would you know of that would require the same a number of spaces to be used that every space and the order and the Town Hall complex would have to be used I can 't speak for any other groups really than the musical the school groups that I 'm associated with weather is huge pressure for more and more rooms and what I 'm trying to get to is that what you 're suggesting with the old flown all spaces don 't exceptional it would be exceptional that every space in the town hall would be required of linked to a main eventer oh yeah wait for maint 19 but of course the whole point about the town who was that because it had a number of facilities a number of auditoria it was all that what always seem to happen was that there was another event maximizing the use of the facilities and maybe if the James has booked for something then other rooms can be used in vice versa so I think the plus 1 1000 plus as the report argues is that this provides an essential facility for our city for all sorts of groups to hire large and the comment made that not every seat might be taken while he would be very dangerous that every seat was taken and neither of those auditoriums it would probably prove that your determines were too small it 's always good to have a few spare spaces okay i don 't think the reports report suggesting that the james hey remain a thousand seats seated i can see the phone provider hundred to 600 seated and thousands standing flexible so I I would suggest that that some further research needs to be done there I believe that you know there could be a lot of I saw reference thereto seats that can be brought in and changed and all sorts of internal configuration so I would have thought with a bit of imagination that sound being the important issue transfer between spaces is terribly important Jamie one question personal reputation it looks like your particular emphasize repair the auditorium as whereas the James hi a different options so which option you the polls repair all now only the auditorium skype are also consider a leg of a four year or like 10 bridge waters noon in the limestone room or just James high in the auditorium can you space that clearly i can 't speak for others all I can all I can give us my personal opinion that I believe that the the restoration of all the facilities as originally designed provides the very best option for our city and I believe that 's in Boston report sorry I will allow fail to ask a final question Thank You dawn could use scripts describe you what you say what your viewers of the standard of the acoustics for the main auditorium I think they 're very good I 've never been in no hall where I 've been completely satisfied and and who is how many of us can ever look for you no satisfaction about any experience that we 've had but I I mean relatively speaking I think we 're extraordinarily lucky and remember that this hall was a trailblazing experiment comparison I can and I think sir miles will speak words himself but that is model as I understand it was the the royal albert hall in london where you have that wraparound opportunity for lots of people so that empathy at a kind of concept that everybody is close to the action whether it 's lines and christians or in this case of sequester at symphony we 're all sharing the action and the problem with that and as he himself i 'm sure will eloquently explained us that that and then you 've got a nightmarish acoustic you 've got sound dancing everywhere they spent a long time in the oven for trying to fix it eventually they 've hung those balloon things above the stage as we had to do here when the foot when i played the organ for the very thought an organ down from christchurch i played it for the first Messiah i was sitting here with the pipe organ the cellist francis the gardener sitting here we could not hear each other we could not hear each other so they abandoned the things beginning and put the donut in sound goes up and bounces back so it has been tweaked but but that is I think a wonderful endorsement of the fact that this was the first and if you look at the books on architecture you will find that this is this is lauded as the first opportunity to provide a combination of close involvement for an audience and an acoustic which is as good and possibly get because of course what they 've done is transfer transform a circular building into the traditional horseshoe acoustic shaped by putting baffles in at various areas and that was what national and de acousticians achieved so it 's not it nothing 's ever perfect in this world but I think we 're extremely lucky to have a remarkable closeness for the audience and as good an acoustic as you could ever get well I 'm glad I allowed that last question that 's very helpful thank you very much thank you _"

to introduce it Glenn north I could please what I 'd like to say I think this officer another very good opportunity to work collaborating collaboratively with what is that with government and in that way we 've already worked over the city mission project I think it 's also pretty nimble ability to actually get a job done and this is the job we 've been given homelessness was one of our terms of reference the meetings that we 've had with the 25 approx groups being very good rich tankers Lee 's helped us see a move which I think does put beyond doubt that human rights obligation that local councils have hard to find affordable and available rental accommodation in the city or housing that 's vulnerable young people single older men and single-parent families and we have some existing groups with such as ycd who will get things underway if we can do this well what we can do here I think is a very effective use of funds without the lute ly in this situation we 're kind of acting as a gap filler and we 're literally bridging the gap between phone calls that 's that 's more than five dollars Rory council meeting the dream actually got to be a double double whammy they 'll be shouting the Christmas do sorry that 's all right there 's bridges the gap between the IRS and market rent and in some cases that may have to go further but we 've got to cap over that for Council of 130 thousand dollars so we 're working with already existing chips to do this now MSD is coming on board vicki has done tremendous work to get us to this point and I think if we could do this we a long time pre quake and poster they there at the coalface they know it 's going on the situation isn 't pretty dire so if counsel can show leadership here that would be great in it it 's a good example of partnership with government as well three MSD thank you so it will open it up for questions first so thanks for the introduction um Yanni I was just wanting how um you know this this isn 't like a band-aid that we 're slapping on as quick as we can and that 's that 's fine but I just wondered whether they do in any discussion around those more fundamental issues that are leading to this problem which is things like roll no warrant of fitness and the lack of an increase in accommodation supplement when our rents are on par with Auckland so as anyone talked to government about addressing some of those other more fundamental issues that are leading to this problem enough so what 's the response mean and if not when can we do that I think we 've got the housing accord to this report um I mean I mean yeah this is a bob geldof situation yeah band-aid_,_243.45 so those fundamentals have all have been long recognized for several years it go right back to home ownership declining asset for all the interventions that could be made the problems we 're right now in the urgent space and I think we have to attack address that important stuff which is in the accord but there 's a real agent kill Greek so term yeah question I 'm I mean I 've said it before that the issue is the beads that situation which we used to be you know quite a few down by Baylor Street they 've gone no one 's filling that gap we can see that this is a party too but I don 't want any part of a and a right or a lease agreement I would prefer if this man is available to achieve what this working party is there to do then it should be a grant we should take no part and we have the the community housing providers and we have the don 't they are the community housing providers have stepped up and say they need support so I would prefer us to give them it and it 's kept at one-thirty to give them support rather than undertaking any way shape or form of a lease or underwrite responsibility in any way I see the issue but how do we do that it 's very easy and there is one but lived in here that 's my bed and 3.1 oh and the last second to last sentence where it says and the council was underwriting the lease that should come out and then I think the other but that you were concerned about term was in 5.2 where it says in Christchurch to source the private rental properties and for them so you 're quite clear about its change of the end for them to minister to well that 's actually what it means but you 're just unclear you just want to actually spelt out one of the Dean took so yeah well if you want to be pedantic then that 's what you need to put it don 't expect infidel take nothing it 's about making sure that it 's right can I just ask I know that there 's been some concern about the mix any council housing there are some pretty gnarly issues which we 've already heard in referred to with regards to the homelessness issue vulnerable young people single older me and I don 't think you mentioned ex-prisoners but single and parent families is kind of mix and in the current housing that we have at the moment that 's been a big challenge for our organization do you foresee any issues house loads if you like of people all with these issues in the one place and that being managed and if anything did happen who would be liable it 's a good question and it 's something we 've talked about with the community housing providers and the community support groups and so because they work with the vulnerable groups of people they 're only too well aware of best practice and so that 's why they are suggesting just a number of places together in terms of making be living together and also for the support wraparound services as well so what they 're saying is that for particularly vulnerable groups of people that there are ways to provide shelter for them that doesn 't exist about the loving conditions Deacon Lee does any expenditure at the moment put extra pressure on our housing portfolio housing portfolio it does have constraints and any expenditure does just adds to the constraints of that portfolio and requires us to be innovative but can you confirm that there 's no rates funding going under this amount right there 's no about something right I just wanted it on the record is there anything any other questions I 'll open it up for debate Andrew Yanni Jimmy thank you I 'd like to start off by acknowledging the work staff have put into this speed at which this has been done and also acknowledging the work that the deputy mayor and cancel the Livingstone put into this as well because a lot of work has been done in a very short time I attended the excellent homelessness forum that councillor Livingstone chaired hadn 't previously been aware of and some of which I found not only concerning but shocking it 's fair to say as well and homelessness is something that we don 't spend a lot of time thinking about and the reason for that of course is because when we leave here today we go home and the only point at which you perhaps would start to think about it would be if you were engaged with the homelessness or evil or in fact you didn 't have a home to go to and as I said at the committee meeting when we discussed this the meeting that gave rise to this report I 've never been homeless and I couldn 't even begin to understand what that might feel like but if you add to the fact that a person hasn 't got a home issues of addiction issues of prejudice issues of social exclusion health or mental health issues any number of vulnerabilities that people out there do have then you 're actually starting to paint a very real picture of what 's going on in our sitting debate about who 's responsibility is to deal with that and yes there are agencies that could be doing more there are all sorts of ways that more should be done but my view is that this is a problem that everybody needs to play a part in solving and that means the city also has a part to play means the council has got a part to play so in terms of this decision today I welcome the work that 's been done and I feel that there only is one decision which I can make and that 's to walk this and support it very strongly today thank you jaani thank you yeah I think it 's important to recognize that through the council 's own central city plan one of the targets that council Livingston and myself wanted and there was to have zero homelessness in the city because we knew from all the international experts that we heard from that those who are most vulnerable in a natural disaster such as the earthquakes we have experienced even greater hardship than they otherwise had previously and the so we knew that there was a sector enough City who were going to really find it difficult to face to face the challenges that exist it so you know it is a shame that for years on we 're only now starting to get some solutions to this and I see this is a very very temporary solution I worry about these temporary solutions because for example simply subsidizing excessive rings actually doesn 't address the underlying problem and it 's a bit like the accommodation supplement so if i was looking at this in terms of dealing with it i think the most critical phone is a supply of affordable and social housing in our city whether it be in the new growth areas which virtually have not nothing or whether it 's in the government housing developments in the eastern frame which we also will have nothing in terms of affordable or social housing to address these social economic issues if you can 't have an increase in supply than the next critical thing would be rent controls and maybe we need to also repeat our request that the rents are just going through the roof and in fact well some increases are justified small increases I don 't think there 's any justification for the excessive rents that some people are judging in our city and we know how hard it is for people to find those affordable houses particularly at three hundred three hundred dollars a week level and if you can 't do rent controls and maybe a warrant of fitness would be good so that people actually had a basic standard of accommodation rather than living and some of the atrocious places that they are and of course the accommodation supplement but for the same reason I have concerns over this simply giving people more money to pay more expensive ring doesn 't actually address the underlying problem and it becomes very unsustainable so as a temporary measure I support this certainly not a long-term or a medium term solution we still need to continue to put pressure on government to start acknowledging the housing crisis in our city and the impact on those who are most vulnerable and continue to ask them we hear there 's been no social impact assessment done it really worries me so thank you to those that have done the work thank you for the community providers who have tried to come up with those temporary solutions I 'm happy to support of today but I encourage those who are doing us to look at those more permanent solutions Jimmy I also supported this recommendation because I was attended a not only one time that our council housing Task Force on 20 nights or April after one week also attended a attendance the protection des and Association they also organize the similar kind of homeless forward no you know deeply impressed especially for those the young people the 80s between 16 and 17 they stated in the kind of abandon the house you know it 's wavy wavy the maze and also when we caught it how they can live in there you know just kind of the picture even right now the steep that the tip in my heart I have this kind of situation also which we the newspaper and elderly men you know live tennis fee to live in the accommodation but you course is the length of affordable rental housing a moment in a market so there 's a series about how to resolve that is poverty no like a crater he mention earlier that was where we embrace you know we are not organized that is forward only but we take the further the action the action is very important after the foreigner who organized the action have a discussion of the possible options that you know then right now that we can bring to learn council the table I think that 's very important to show the community show the people council can make the same thing happened with the positive the 82 positive response so I think they 're very very important and also if acquainted our funding here we can see 130k but is formal the housing back the housing from HR is not a paid by the rich pay pair is now business updates so don 't in any impact to the rates thus charter rates the situation a sitter so I think that 's a very good Elliot in right thank you this is not an issue about who 's got the biggest heart it is not an issue about who cares the most it 's actually an issue about making sure that the systems that are there that are designed to deal with homelessness and social problems are utilized that 's what they are funded for there are 78 organizations that are funded for and responsible for dealing with homelessness just in Christchurch alone I find the comment that money from rates this is not money from rates doesn 't include money from rates as really disingenuous a housing portfolio we have a housing budget that is bleeding six hundred and sixty thousand dollars a month it is eating itself by the end of the financial year next year it will have nothing if we were rolling in cash we might be able to look at deviating from what our core businesses but our core business particularly where we have a big black financial hole to fill at the moment should be about the things that asked that he needs us to deal with to keep cannot support this I have never supported this right the way through I supported the partnership with the mission for the emergency housing and that was to the tune of just under three hundred thousand dollars but I cannot support anymore Rev we housing is a very complex issue and homelessness is even more complex money out it is not always the right answer I think is this is something the government needs to step up and put their hand into and it 's it 's unsatisfactory you could argue the council as the local authorities should be in charge of this well that would be fine if we have the appropriate funding to do that and I 'd certainly be happy to look at that so I appreciate all the work that 's gone into this thing I don 't really know what 's going on in this housing fund and if the people running that are happy to take the money from that then actually I don 't have a problem but I would like the invoice that we should speak with them very soon and ask them I think this is actually relatively simple we have a problem in our city of particularly young people without homes these actually could be anybody 's kids thing has happened in their lives and they don 't have a home at the moment what do we do as a city I think the purpose of city government is actually that you solve the problems that are too hard for individuals to solve that 's what I think a city council is about and the business of housing the core business of housing is actually housing as creating homes let 's look at what 's being suggested MSD to their enormous credit tipped up to the plate incredibly well the government through MSD has said we will found IRS on any of these houses through a chip provider fantastic not only there we will put in a person there to help these young people into employment and to make sure that they get all the income supplements including the supplement that they help that they can get and buying the fridge which I didn 't exist it that they muck that big time and coordinated a whole lot of these groups ycd has got 18 young people it should say very not nine that they want to look to create nine bedrooms or at least nine bedrooms so that they can young kids into houses that become their homes they 've worked out that on independent youth benefit you can actually afford eighty dollars a week and 484 a house is paintable so what they 're doing is using this as efficient to sustainable homes for these people they will not be needing to be subsidized in an ongoing way they will provide for them the wraparound service that those kids need that our social housing hearings what we over and over again and the city was the need for young people to have homes they 've already started working with some of these young people one of them they were saying the other day is now saved two hundred and twenty dollars towards their bond to get into their house they expect that these homes will become sustainable for these young people living in them and they 'll provide the the capacity of the staff to respond so fast to this and by their groups and the government actually coming to the parties so quickly and so well to do something about various groups of homeless people in a city like Andrew and I continue to be shocked by the people in a city who do not have a place to live and I think we actually have to do something about it I 'm not okay with leaving these kids on the street it 's not an option and that 's the do-nothing option that we face here today so we are either do something and that 's the role of the City Council all we do nothing and we say to those goods on you don 't matter I 'm not a pool I 've already been quite as saying it as they share government issue and they should be stepping up and suing this problem out there are 78 agencies here in Christ you said deal with this issue a basis what are they doing we should be asking what a layer as you doing what my make sure you may sit by approving this year and and that concerns me we hit rate payers who can 't afford to pay their rates with your increases we 're going to be placing on them you know and and and we really draw the line on what we try and resolve as a council we 've got so many issues of our own that we need to resolve him and we just figure out what we can do and I don 't think this is our realm understand you know the issues that these people are facing in and I feel for them you know I do but like as a counselor I can 't can 't_''_1345.44 see me these problems you know and there 's a government issue and they obviously aren 't doing enough to sort the problem we 're not funding into the label they should be funding it too so you know and again I 'm just going to point out as a precedent we 're sitting you know and I really don 't want to set a bad precedent that every time you that they want resolved the council cannot just be the backstop for that because we 'll just end up driving our ratepayers out of the city of matches a pub concerns me more and Phil look I thought as councillors we were elected to get things done not to make excuses as to why we do nothing and like the comment and councillor mangi made it throwing money at it if council advantage had been here early in the debate in the discussion he would have heard that in fact a whole lot of preparation and planning has gone into into this whole project it is certainly not just throwing money at it that is belittling the whole process and the huge work it actually went into this and I think the staff and commend you for there and I commend councillor back and council Livingston tone for the huge work that 's gone in at some of this discussion reminds me of that simple Bible story about prep the priests walking past the wounded man this is a huge money in air hot and our whole budget that clearly Development it is an example to be fair to them where government are contributing we 'd all like government to do a hell of a lot more but if we cannot just stand by and do nothing and expect everybody else to take care of the problem or do nothing or have people dying in their streets this winter and 10 thank you your when I first looked at this and the way it was worded are they I was concerned because the key to me is getting the money to those that can actually do job if we have indeed have that money we 've been told by our staff that there is funds available we 've seen and the report then there is a process that we 've get it they 're going to get five to six houses up and running first rather than take it a huge run edit they 're going to get it right first we are not a reprehensible we nor should we pretend to be but we need to get that money to those that can deliver it we we can sit who shouldn 't be doing we know that that bead cert area and the housing market has never been looked at as been totally those people whether they 're coming out of prison or whether they 're between jobs and fallen on hard times or have an illness of one way show before or are young and homeless they used to have those beads that 's around the barbados the East Christchurch area there is no longer existent so as long as we do not have a connection with regards to the leasing etc and we are given the proper organizations of financial support they need then I am and favor of this because we do have to get the sorted but we knit those that are expert do it rather than ourselves Thank You Pauline thank you and look it 's all very well to say is this is responsibility but what we 're seeing here is a proactive initiative we 're actually leading this and I think really good model that the government may pick up on I think that 's it 's a way to start it really not be with Tom that 's those beads sets that that 's that level that there 's a huge gap there when you look at 233,000 that we 're spending to repair one unit 130 thousand is a very good investment when you 're getting six houses which can haz look 20 or more so yeah well that 's the beginning so you know i think it 's it 's money well spent i 'll be watching this space and i think this could be a model that will be picked up and gone and I 'd like to congratulate Bucky I think it will be very successful we 're going to be empowering these people we 're going to be some supporting these young people in here yeah and I think that I support it Oh Jamie thank you look I I have no doubt are you are you on the speaking list yeah I 'm sorry I didn 't know I didn 't notice but I did notice your babies Jamie Jamie you go for you want to do you want to go Dave no I didn _''_1641.47 've got them down now he 's obviously after me um yeah um when we talk about social housing I think in my view the easy option is to say that it 's ring-fenced from rates or that it doesn 't affect rates but I what I struggle with is that I see I see six hundred and sixty thousand dollars every month going into something that is just getting bigger and bigger you 're talking about tens of millions of dollars going into saying that well it may well be totally true to say that it 's ring-fence what you 've got as a black hole is getting bigger and bigger and bigger or a series of cars that have been placed on top of each other and sooner or later something 's gotta give sooner or later the house of cards actually is going to come down and I actually think that is our duty is counsel say there 's a saying that we need to address not that it 's going to be someone else 's problem not that it 's going to necessarily be another count 's the precinct issue I think that we can I think that we can tip lots of money into lots of noble goals we could come up with goals to say we 're going to be a city with zero obesity we 're going to be a city that has no burglaries but there are a number of things that we are actually legally charged with as a local authority that we can actually do we 're not doing it we 're underperforming you 've read the CEOs report there are things that we 're actually expected to do as a council that we are not to the bring on I think that we need to stick to our knitting and I think that Joe Bloggs by and large they want we need to get the search pump we need to get the roads folks we need to keep rates down we 've got to make sure that we 're actually not account you know in all honestly we have a financial strategy in front of us that we 're putting together which is a monumental task there are a actually struggling to do and I think in my view that 's where the priority is I don 't think being an effective council is about being the father Christmas I think that it 's about doing what you 're charged to do well and look I 'm not going to be voting against this because i don 't believe that it 's our problem this is a problem for the city but i 'm voting against it because i know for a fact there are a plethora of other organizations out there that are solely charged with and I don 't think the council is best placed to be the be-all and end-all of everything I actually think that a major problem with the counselors when we try to do things that we 're actually not that good at doing so I think we stick to our knitting I think that we assist those organizations which in which your taxes go towards to get on with what they do best David this is you have been noticed I think I probably should have spoken before Jamie because he said actually think that we need to acknowledge the yes we have a problem with what homeless in our city but I agree with a lot of other speakers that we eat to prioritize our money and look at what air core businesses and I think this is clearly I have people in my ward that our hangout for footpaths I think that 's our core activity are a number of other speakers a about the housing budget I out of funds and potential solvency issues coming up so I would really like to see a full set of accounts for their I guess you put this this issue this conjecture that 's right you know had that clear picture on the table of where the housing social housing unit sits sleep but in terms of this particular item here I won 't be supporting the other speakers of yeah I just want to say a couple words before I hand over to Glenn to wrap it up you know in this post disaster environment I 've obviously done a lot of reading and research about a number of things and problems are really hard to solve and they 're hard to solve unless everyone who has a role to play sits down and works together to make a heaven and this proposal which does see an allocation if it is required and effort is required there 's no guarantee that any of it will be spent but if it is required this this enables community housing providers community organizations NGOs and the government to come to the table to help solve a wicked problem so for the amount of contribution that the city makes to solving the problem the difference as fewer homeless people sleeping out rough in our city and I 'm afraid that 's actually a cost to the ratepayer too it 's not just a cost in terms of the you know that you know that the look and feel of the place although there is something that 's quite important because I don 't know about you but when I travel internationally and I see homeless people begging on the streets of very wealthy cities it does say something about those cities and I think that about the cost to the ratepayers of the city of having people who are so desperate that they haven 't got enough money to support themselves I mean ninety dollars a week by way of income I like the idea that these young people and actually older people and I 've met many of them their stories are not stories that simply come about because somebody set themselves up to be put in this position you know that that one of the stories that that springs to mind for me and it 's not a young person but it 's an older person who had a very good job and then had an accident and had a head injury and the funny thing about head injuries is that they don 't show and actually ACC 's not really interested in you after a while and actually he lost everything he lost his marriage he lost his home and he lost a big component of his life so I don 't think that a small investment that editors a large sum of money but a small investment in the scale of money it leverages support and an opportunity for these people to get their lives back on track so I 'll be supporting the staffs recommendation and I 'd like to invite cancel a Glen Livingston to finish the debate thank you me I have tried to avoid this becoming a custody battle because actually the human rights obligations that you zealand has by being a signatory extend to local governments as well and richard Tankersley who opened our homelessness foramen see framework for our work spoke recently during the long term plan submissions and on page 89 of volume 6 we find the special report the United Nations General Assembly where national or regional governments provide funding for housing and related programs the realization of the right to adequate housing does not rely solely on one or the other level of government but on their relationship our young people depend on our relationship with the government and the NGOs they do not have shelter many of them when i attended the social housing conference in Sydney which the mayor asked me to attend ahead of us who was totally homeless own home there is a possibility we could set people on a pathway to that dream which you and I also hold and have realized if we can do this I think we can open up some real options and possibilities or our youth please remember that many of these people have no money and no options we have money and yes it has dwindled but within the housing fund we still have options within that fund please remember this for me personally we can do all the flesh was being things we like in this recovery but actually if it 's going to have some meaning we have to shelter people thank you i 'll put the motion it looks like it 's a split vote so should we just go straight to a machine assistant vote I don 't know what you call it electronic vote thinking so if you 're in favor press yes if you 're opposed press know and that 's carried 10-4 so thank you very much for that can we return now to Clause 14 which is main road parking at Red Cliffs village report

    "text": "um 2015 would anyone like to move that David seconded term there any commentary comments questions yep I thought you might counselor east we 've got staff here there were 44 by laws that were up for a review of them it 's just been rolled over the waste management bylaw 2009 which essentially deals with curbside collections and preventing contamination of recoverable resources and maximizing recycling we 've had a section 15 report which just basically addresses as the vial or still appropriate is it the most appropriate way of addressing a problem and other and Penny implications under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act there were some minor changes in the tombs lot by law we 've deemed as being able to be publicly notified the community input betrayed waste by law 2000 bows to replace this with a new trade waste by Allure 2015 which any significant change to that is looking at some permitted discharge characteristics and then the old act sorry the old by law the discharge of fats that were not animal and vegetable was allowable at 200 grams per cubic meter animal to limit them both to two bare root system it mainly impacts on restaurants food shops and those sort of things as also has gone through a section 155 report and then we 're recommending the change to the discharge licensing by law and the license waste handling facilities by law they be based by one by law the clean fill and waste handling operations by law much of the activities in these two bylaws were in common and there 's only really about 30 affected that would be affected by this bylaw changes really in just in the purpose of this bottle so there are a few minor modifications to that you by law but essentially it 's just combining both them so the recommend is to approve the three now bylaws and it 's quite complicated oh it 's on page 238 funk yeah so they 're the three of them are outlined there in seven point one two three four and five yep yep and we have a seconder doctor and if there 's no oh Yanni go turn me on e fo Christians are you you I mean this is just I think if you look at their issues it 's really great that those issues have been identified like this this goes back into the whole issue of you know what are we doing posted earthquake so we just seem to be going around in a cycle of identifying issues and not having any kind of enough regulatory or enforcement so I mean the question i really want to our staff because i note in here that you have talked about some of those issues but is there anything else i know when we developed by laws we 're supposed to also look at what else we can do to address the problem and i would have thought something around the district plan and brown permitted menus or consents for certainly Aeneas activities would be that would come through I 'm just trying to find a page where you 've touched on the the problems associated with the old Bibles I think perhaps it 's pertinent to nasally program of reviewing existing vitals we 're not looking at these are four vials that are that 're required to review them and so these this will fall into that category and we 've made a decision to consolidate 12 under one so if you look at 279 what are the perceived problems difficult in monitoring temporary waste and lingual storage sites which are being allowed under emergency legislate but 2010-11 earthquake current and ability to collect accurate waste data and information to meet legislative requirements and a lack of purpose disposals of materials turn in clingfilm sites which in it not to be and when they are interact with the environment particularly groundwater so I mean I work apart as a closer by the in DF that went there and it took ages what we seem to have as a reactive regime where ever by law and if someone breaches that we spend six months or two years monitoring before anything actually happened so we still have that the problem so I was just curious to know what we 're doing to address those problems identified in eight whether you 've considered any additional things that we need to do the two hours out of tomorrow the solid waste which I understand is your concern capsular same hi I 'm Taniya unmanaged a solid waste objects and the front of you around the Queen fills and but we don 't actually look after that it 's an unfortunate team and growing nervous in there are some white and white the farm monitor and requirement and enforcement actions that can be taken the issue with a wicker as I understand it was historical but the ax did know that the purpose of this file or was to give er to make very clear to the parties involved the consistency in standard so we we prior to the introduction of a flame for violet originally and we 're it was the Wild West fundamentally and we have come a long way in terms of making sure there is consistency acceptance for the type of material let 's to come and but for all the purpose of this report which is about the boiler I can 't really speak to the enforcement side of things I can speak to the file or itself and there the issues that the give you details on that enforcement crisis is unhappy arrange for it to heck and you can I suggest because it is outside what we 're dealing with which is the the bylaw but but council Johansson raises a good point and I just wonder if we could invite the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee to actually seek a briefing on the because it 's actually it 's actually the into n process it 's the bylaw it 's the enforcement and or in consenting yeah it 's kind of across the line us enough why doesn 't it just come back to the regulations and consents committee oh yeah no I 'm happy for their sorry I was just looking at that because i was thinking of ways but yeah but it but yes because you cover enforcement as well don 't you yeah so so we 'll hit a range of briefing if I could leave that with you counselor is to arrange a briefing on the inter in process is that right it 's also theater comment in this particular instance of these three vials are coming have our regulations and consents committee meeting and major to the LTP I can 't remember the exact reason and something to do of the implementation of the bylaws deal situation and perhaps are coming back to the patients and consents committee before coming back here may picked up few more things when are you when a unique meeting we won 't meet until the third week of june all right okay so that 's too late because I mean we could make it subject to your sign-off and I 'm not happy now sign them off today but I take take the point of just looking at that into end process I can 't stop yeah now there was fell when I 'm not sure who else I 'd question I hope is quick it 's just resides us were by Lord if for example the stuff in it up and through through the way through wastewater systems if we look at consider the question of say chemicals coming from factories ending up in our waterways like our Avon hiscott which which by law is that attach to and right and that is that 's probably unfair because it 's outside the scope this report but it just be at sort of fit salons knowing some message from trade premises gets discharged into the sewer so technically shouldn 't get into the rivers so no technically but it isn 't the by law that applies to is which is a violent one so I in a sense the the water water supply wastewater and stormwater by law is relevant because and that was reviewed last year 's you may recall and there is provision for us within that I law and to fit up standards under the bylaw which is one of the implement part of the implementation program for the Bible it 's not it 's so that potentially may address that issue you know of discharge but the other of course discharges to water are dealt with primarily by ECAM there 's an overlapping thing okay are you need to get a given that we 're kind of off topic I just wonder whether it actually should be a joint meeting of the rigs and consents in can get an overarching picture of these issues just throw a workshop well the workshop will be good and yeah cool I can go along to the to that to the oils committee yeah but you could work you could work with David to say that sorry I was just well she was yeah that 's not a racer all right you know might suffice yeah it may well be but but I think ya knees raised a good point which is sometimes and in our individual silos and it 's not it 's just a simple comment that sometimes you don 't get the big picture because you 're only look dealing with one aspect of it you 're dealing with the with the rules but then there 's the enforcement and then there 's the consenting the planning process is at the beginning and they 're all relevant to each other it 's called in to end I think will not be here anyway so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you very very much on to _"

extension of delegations to fulfill the speedy resolution in action of rebuilding hundred thirty three units yep that 's what its ears would anyone like to move it Glenn M Andrew yep all right Pauline on the first page we 've got proof 9.8 million 49 new so that we 've set 300,000 a unit oh ok so ever turn but when the repeat we get there appears at this meeting yeah so yeah so yep so Ellie James asked the same question and the truth Samuel with the same person it 's there yeah I can 't tell them apart from here and in the future we 'll make sure we clarify that split but what it does that fun includes three different things that go on one portion of it as much about the BAU repairs that need to occur to get that those unit open another portion is about the earthquake repairs that need the BAU work that needs to approve the whole complex and so it make it within a block of six units once closed in in some money to get their closed unit reopened that the significant portion money actually goes to complete the BAU an earthquake repairs on the other open units that already exist and I 'll clarify thousand dollars per closed unit to get it reopened improvements in there as well no I 'm Yanni do we have the report from the Committee yeah because this was obviously discussed at the meeting other day recommendation committee oh so so did you hit the recommendation we recommend a to recommend exact same se sterilization and in fact we 'd already approved point 1 and 2 as an earlier meeting so point threes the only substantive change that we 're making today and yeah the staff recommendation of the committee recommendation would align staff is how will community boards be involved when you decide to repair these units is there any reporting to the local community boards so that they can have oversight of any pre-existing local issues and address repair so what we commit to at the moment if there 's a boredom a quest to go there to give them an update of the work that 's been done to date in the word that 's coming up in the future and so we can make sure we 're available if people have been put your questions or concerns about the plans that we do have coming up there they 're able to provide direction to us at that stage I was really can 't_''_208.09 you know not not to hold things up I think it is important we get on but I also wonder whether it is a role for actually organizing meetings with the tenants existing tenants and talk me through with local boards about what any issues are so that when we 're doing repairing we actually imposes just simple things like Landscaping 's not being maintained or it 's in the wrong location and things need a bit of a tie up so is it any easier capacity if give this delegation way that we could still have a process by which we engage board on a case-by-case basis so we we think is just part of our operations we do engage with the tenants but I think you know the point you 're making you know we need to have it the forefront of our mind because many of these years and rebuilds involves scaffolding involve intrusion into the lives of tenants because the many of our units are quite small some of our tenants have to move out and oh you know we do have a whole engagement process with our tenants around these repairs but i think you know we take on board your point about involving the community board and those communications more than what we are at the moment as well le and it 's a process issue more than anything I voted for one and two but I did not vote for three in the meeting wait i I just but I did have a question as well I don 't know what I 'm supposed to do this time I don 't know my yeah can I just ask you with regards to the housing optimization program changing that delegation to that level and thinking of three dollars preempt possibly a lot of that work that we still need information on though the sight of what our housing portfolio needs to do to be operating well I mean how is you know putting that up to a million dollars and so I going to preempt that if we don 't have a letter that are at a committee or council level so at the moment if we think of the closed unit appears that we 're targeting that we 've committed to as part of the draft LT Peter reopens 73 units there is the potential for us to go to open close to a hundred units and so what we are doing at the moment and the decision-making is to is to address the reopening of the units that are high great quality units rather than the ones that are contentious and if we are dealing with the ones that sorry not the contentious to provide more asset challenges we are minimizing the amount investment that goes on in there to make sure we get it view of the property money into what we are now seeing as low performance when it comes to the housing portfolio or will it just be those mid-performance which we 've also been on what made aware could quite after further analysis be tipped into the low performing level so you know ranking area sits in ranking the units in terms of how they 're performing in their condition you know we need to take a more joined up approach so we see that as well as these delegations will be coming back to you with you know the implications of these decisions you know we don 't believe in throwing good money after bad and in fact some of these units is going to be very complex if we spend the money or how we spend it in terms of the life of the unit vs it but also what kind of condition the tenet is going to be living in so we think you know joined-up approaches as the way to go and will be certainly coming back to you with these decisions we don 't see ourselves is a significant investment FL yep but thank you for the report and I 'm really delighted that in fact there is a plan around getting the repairs done and I can mean due to for taking on board health at the Community Awards involvement and clearly we 're suggesting that 's from a governance point of view and not not a management one but at times they will do contact commutable members of course and it 's good to have your board involved so with the group discussions or individual discussions effect that 's doing that so thank you very much good crack on that 's what I say yani I think so I mean I did vote against us at the committee because I wanted us to delegate to community boards because we 've said that we do want to give them more powers and responsibilities and I think it is really important that we you know we put into action what we say so I was just appointed that the committee didn 't support that but I think you know the staff have the delegation but still 's just those really local annoying things can happen and some of these complexes that really you know that we could fix at this time that I think there 's important to do so I know one example where the resins just somebody wanted a landscape plan so that I could understand how maintenance was done and a Jewish some of the trees that had overgrown and those little things like that so I 'm happy to support it today even though you know I think that stuff and said they can work through to work with community boards on a conflict by complex basis as they develop the repair strategies I think they 'd be really useful and again involving the existing communities we 've often talked about communities being involved in partnership and I think our city housing tenants are no different so let 's try and come up with a model that enables the work to get the authorization to proceed but also involves local communities as which so often said that we wish to do I 'm just thinking that that actually should be added to require staff to to engage with tenants you know prior to the commencement of any work and the complex because I mean I think that 's the point that you 're making is that it is that in conjunction with the community boards as well ah speak I think the emphasis really a conjunction with the community boards on oh yeah and the staff of see look they already work with the tenants and advising them in it I think the emphasis on the community board role and in conjunction with the community both the reason that the reason that I think it is worth putting it down as a kind of a direction is that is that it 's just it 's just putting it down and writing that this is this is the way that it 's going to be and and I 'm hearing from staff that this is the way they want to do it so we 're aligned but but sometimes you know if people personnel change or something like that they don 't have a direction you know so yeah it 's for the _``_645.69 a lot today so anyway I still got more to go but um this will speed up the repair if you think six to ten weeks there that 's two seasons of the year yes it 's gets more people in their houses quicker so the starting point is our tenants getting them into houses it actually helps the fund as well and it saves internal staff costs and having to wait this amount of time so I 'm right behind this as you said I think we just need to crack on yep we 're actually getting more units open than we first thought oh I think your amendment as she is it sort of answers my question but I 'm my comment would be around that I don 't see how this resolution actually takes away from the community was they can get involved they want our operational level if they really want to do Andrew yeah I mean certainly my experience of if I take Boyd cottages in Littleton as an example the community board and I as the counselor were were involved there but I certainly 'm really pleased to see this when I first came into the air into the housing area and this was before the eqc settlement had happened I was concerned that we would end up with money sitting there ready to be spent and we didn 't have a prioritized work plan to do that we 've come a long way since then and now we 've got some some excellent work done which has given us those priorities and with regular reporting regular good quality reporting I 've got to say back to the committee I 'm very comfortable with this i agree with others the important thing is we just get on with this work so that we can get these units open so that we can start delivering against those priorities that we 've already identified I 'm very comfortable with the resolution and look forward to seeing some more units open I think it 's great great all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and counselor Eddie Jones to oppose will move on to _"

    "text": "so look I 'm very mindful of the favorite there are a number of people who don 't normally sit at the back of the council chamber so I 'm going to move to item 13 public notification of the provisional local alcohol policy yeah that 's Jamie goes look I doubt that we 're going to get to another item before we break for lunch Jamie so you can go if you if you want yeah early pass I 'm happy to move the staff recommendation on that item great and do I have a seconder and Thomas Kendra so that 's moved and seconded all right now would you like to present the report I know that we 've kind of been here before and you know that there is a comment that I want to make about about the timetabling of us and why don 't I just do the timetabling but because I mean I 'm the reason that this wasn 't publicly notified at the time that we became the council probably i think it was originally brought to us in early 2014 so and the provisional local alcohol policy at that time was because it would have put us at the front end of the appeals process and because christ church is in such a state I mean we 're in a unique state and the country we 're still rebuilding our central city we still have provisions in place that are quite unique to our city there are these the the development of of bars and other licensed premises in ways that would never have been imagined prior to the earthquakes one because they wouldn 't have been financially viable I think there has been an element of one fallen the outside the central city that simply wouldn 't have happened otherwise there have been restaurants restaurant licenses that had licenses till 3am but actually it but but actually they were always close before one o 'clock in the morning but replacing restaurants with kind of night club type bars the license already existing to 3am and and there you see how the problem has has kind of been being developed but the last thing that I wanted to do was for Christchurch appeals process before anyone else this should have come back to the council just before Christmas but unfortunately the person that was kind of working on a lift and and and I overlooked bringing it back so we 've now got it back I think we didn 't give enough notice to councillors a few weeks ago when we put it on the agenda was came as a late paper we 've learnt the lessons about late papers so we 've been we put it off and and we took it out of the long-term plan hearing process so now we 've got some some clear air and and that 's why it 's back here it 's been instructive to me to read the report that we 've had on the on the appeals that have happened around the country and that 's also what I wanted to do was to have a clear understanding of how the now I 'm going to get this wrong the alcohol regulatory and licensing authority has made decisions and and what I 've been encouraged by actually is the knowledge that once and appeals are lodged that a number of organizations have met with the local council in order to see whether there is a an ability to resolve the issues that are between them and and I think that that has been of great comfort to me because it seems that the alcohol regulatory and licensing authority or our I think we 're allowed to call it would would in fact approve and agreed position even if it was different from what was publicly notified so that to me gives us great hope and the view that any outstanding matters that can 't_''_292.08 be resolved in terms of the views of those that might appeal can be resolved in that process so I 'm very happy that that this is now being hopefully today at the council being publicly notified and that we will be able to be in a position ultimately to provide certainty in terms of development and and and the the connection with with community now and I just I just lay this one on the table because this is where I I did take some advice over and then then deferred it during the district plan review process we had a concern raised about the potential for the independent hearings panel to change some of the rules that are not covered in the local alcohol plan so I guess that what I would signal given that we have no ability to amend it at this point what I would signal is that if that would be the case then we would need to be looking at an amendment to the local alcohol policy once it 's implemented but of course we will have conversations with various interest groups in relation to that before we would proceed with it but I just wanted to kind of put that on the table because there is AD is an element of uncertainty that exists around that and it is particularly relevant to communities that have an expectation that there will be certain hours of Trading limitations that are protected by the district plan and I 'm worried that potentially that that protection could disappear and that 's the eleven-o 'clock one within so many meters of a residential area so terms of those those comments is there anything that you would like to comment on in terms of what we 're doing here now by way of process and then we 'll open it up to councillors well i guess i would like to start by saying that the provision for local alcohol policy is a very new one it was bought and by the act and it recognizes the local communities desires to be part of planning for licensed premises in their communities the hours and their locations and that 's new very new it 's quite different from the previous legislation and it allows councils to have you know provide strategic oversight of things like hours and locations for premises and it provides important guidance for the district licensing committees and making their decisions you will know from reading the report and previous letters from the chairs of the deal cells within deal district licensing committees within christchurch city that they are very keen that council gets on with having a local alcohol policy at present they feel that they have no community guidance on you know which hours for example and and so you know this is and and i would also like to acknowledge the enormous the enormous contribution of the community who to this preparing this la p the stakeholder group in particular which was pretty well there from the very beginning which in cluded industry and health and police and number of others and certainly there wasn 't agreement about what should go on in a local in our local alcohol policy yes but they were certainly agreement that pretty we are universally that can 't that the christchurch should have its own local alcohol policy and there was tremendous goodwill and real listening you know to everybody 's perspective so you know a lot of time and effort and it was no it was it was really rewarding to be part of the process which I felt and I want to acknowledge a deer Broughton especially I of course Ellen by water but especially a deer who really provided the leadership with our engagement process I think it was superb so the there 's only one recommendation and that 's two sets a with the professional local alcohol policy and to notify it for Appeals I think that 's all I really want to say at the stage thank you i did notice that there were more submissions for the local alcohol policy then we got on the entire long-term plan Phil thank you very much and thank you for a very full report over something in which is always contingent the history of christ church owes that and hopefully we can get a resolution today and i 'm urging counselors to strongly to support the recommendation that in fact we now notify the local alcohol policy I make my comments as a former health professional well I guess I speak a lot of my time as a psychiatric social worker putting band-aids over this whole problem and I think that the local aspect and having the community involved in a play in now gives us a chance to really start addressing the root causes which clearly is that cut a culture of heavy drinking and binge drinking I also want to give the last council full credit for all the work that councils of the table and the staff have pointed out how in fact when the consultation happened that in fact there was general agreement that a local alcohol policy was needed needed it as a tool to actually reduce their whole problem of and so in fact that we could achieve the aim of reducing alcohol-related harm and all that entails and so really what though when I referred to changing that this will help change the culture this is sort of like getting this kind of local local bylaws in and a leader bylaws allows really that culture to start to change right at the bottom because people have been involved and there 's no dealt to that clearly that government organizations they were quite clear of the support for a for a local alcohol policy it 'll be a useful tool so other things of comments I 'd make is that counselors will have received a fairly late these are ready from dr. Ruth spearing on behalf of the Canterbury hospital medical staff I draw that her comments to your attention and Anna Stephenson represent over 500 health really was reminding us of what they they said at the submissions that we heard last year and they referred to to the cost of alcohol in it alcohol damage in air city being 19 million dollars a year and the impact on the health services including mental health which is clearly a interrelated problem not only do we have addictions but we have the impact of people 's addictions on other mental health illnesses and disorders and they 're really clear to about the evidence from australian cities like New Castle how in fact earlier closing times has led to a significant reduction in crime and assaults and they also pointed out last year and i want to remind councillors of what it 's like for example in the world real world if you work in the emergency department at christchurch hospital you 'll recall they showed us pictures of people with broken bones disfigured faces children assault assaulted by the appearance ended the course we all know about the horrendous impact of motor vehicles accidents and in the link with them with alcohol in those cases and they impact of their more than fifty percent of the spinal injuries at burwood hospital are directly linked to alcohol so overall there 's no question that this is that the plan is a very good document it 's not perfect but overall it 's very good and i 'd certainly urge counselors to support it thank you yeah that 's Andrew then re thank you yeah the uncertainly came to see this piece of wood proceed I obviously looked at the options in the report and the only two options that I would be considering would be option 1 and option 3 and obviously going back and doing all of the work again that has already been done call me sometime ago isn 't an option that I would prefer saan I 'm going to be supporting option one but I guess with some small reservations and i 'll put my comments in the context of littleton as i often do I support having a local alcohol policy and I don 't want to hold this up but as I say I 'm aware that the public consultation in particular years ago 2013 was two years ago there have been some some big changes both in terms of stakeholders people running businesses in that time and there have also been some big population shifts and people moving in out of various suburban areas city center and also in and out of the city at that time and I as a matter of process and as a matter of principle I think it 's important that everybody has a chance to have their say including those people who are residents of the city now who weren 't in 2012 2013 and that 's why I 'm particularly interested in the comments that the mayor made at the beginning of the meeting around ways that that can happen there 's a particular issue in my view in little certain where the document we 've got in front of us today proposes 1am closing and in my view the the future economic development of little turn and the future success of little to mean in terms of its town center and what it 's able to offer as a point of difference in food and drink theater and all of that sort of thing and there is a view certainly among some in Littleton that 3am closing would be more appropriate that recognizes the fact that Littleton has in the past been and will in the future be an entertainment hub and that at 1am people aren 't going to necessarily want to jump into a taxi and visit a precinct in the central sitting rather than continuing getting on with what they 're doing at that time as I understand it in a in a harmless way in a way that has happened for many years without too much in a way of difficulty so my understanding of the process for people to to get involved in making those views heard given we 've got to where we 've gotten is that they can obviously appeal to our through the process going forward I 'm certainly encouraged by the mayor 's comments that organizations have met with the Council through the process to to make amendments I 'll make changes and certainly am keen if we are seeing issues coming up that the first time around that we are able to quickly move to make amendments once we get to adopting this policy in the end so I will be so sporting option one because I I believe in the direction of travel and I think this is something that we need to be doing but you know certainly make it known that i will be as the the local elected member working with the local community to make sure that they 're aware of the steps that they can take so that we get the right outcome for littleton and i 'm not saying that little tins necessarily unique in this regard either but i do refer to it because it 's there iran most most familiar with Thank You Ellie I 'm not convinced that the alcohol-related harm is reduced significantly enough to warrant as wide-ranging and as far-reaching as this lint and education host responsibility personal responsibility these are things that our city should be promoting whereas idiom flux a population we have a hospitality sector as well which is how did that shift work for Bella ping entertainment we face in this country at the moment around obesity and fast food and diabetes we have 24 hour a day fast food restaurants are we going to start limiting the availability of that as well i think that there 's a balance that needs to be struck between controlling this and offering people freedom and personal responsibility that they should be making I after hearing them as comments today because i think that the major issues my concerns that I 've outlined can be addressed when we look at a review and we need to look at the specificity that can be or needs to be looked at with regards to exist as as the city starts to change you know I 've see no effect stated within our own paperwork actually that the reduction in alcohol harm as results phasers would be around one percent and I don 't think that that is enough when you look at the restrictions this does base for a developing city so as I said I 'm hip this quarter with the proviso and hearing from the mere with regards who once to pull these the perfect regional and local policy tulip ha be notified in the people still can appears because these are the whole process is open in the transparent I was last time the counselor I 'm the also currently under this Thunder counselor I still remember you know this one i remember in need of May when the stock dropped these the local policy who to a public consultation we receive a 4060 submission and also we heard 168 the inner individual or the community group business school or some of government agency so we heard all of them you know so we need to focus on the point is what 's the purpose of this alcohol the kind of local alcohol policy you can see is a minimized alcohol-related harm in a community but not against our business it 's not against the vitalized economy of the distal city and also these the kind of local policies only in relation to the licensing this licensing we focused on there 's a location density one widow condition discretionary condition as well as a maximize the trading hours my central city area if we will review loss term April no we separate to defend why is a central city call the other is a central city the priests in the surrounding area unique difference to us up to the 3pm up to the 1pm and also baser come agency the information in the mud more later you know you drink the kind of the alcohol the more series the alcohol relating ham and also this is kind of the peace economics external discipline is because the community society spend too much the poster for dealing with that is the the situation so my personal view these are provisional local alcohol policy is a title appellants ennis so I strong requests the mayor in our fellow cancers support especially I would like to acknowledge II the formula the chairperson of the planning and the strategy vague and the regulation the sewers my personal my understand she contributed a lot regarding tu lista policy thank you thank you 10 I 'm asking questions of an IV debating thoughts Oregon 's no no where they weren 't there wasn 't questions because or games really oh sorry okay David thank you initially I was probably leaning towards the option to listening to the discussion today on one however um I am heartened with some of the comments that we 've heard today particularly with reference to looking at ways that we can work with with the am in doubt bomb once and I 'm wondering whether in our ocean today we should acknowledge that and I refer to the findings of the hearings and on what we look at 14 be on page 85 the hearings panel had recommended that a review within two years or within suitable time frame be conducted on on various matters and I am sort of concerned at the moment that we have an L AP worked up almost two years ago now from quite pertinent to point out that a third of the more than a third of their existing counsel at the time took no part and up for various reasons we had 4060 submissions and of those submissions this in large focus on business and the contribution that the industry gave to the city bit more severe on it I also looked at a point number 55 of the post almost fifteen percent of have your say submitters wanted no changes to the draft la p the majority identified ways in which it needed improvement most commonly there was restrictions for city and its urban areas which is a point that 's been raised on a couple of occasions today Andrews mentioned it and to a degree le and more restrictions for off licensed premises it 's always been my belief that the the hotel and hospitality industry in Christchurch have very responsible and they they operate under a quite strict regime of legislation their license their livelihood is at stake if they don 't provide premises with the responsible attitude it 's always been my contention that the biggest issue in the city is actually pretty loaded people that are coming into the city their times in the problems and in fact I 'm led to believe that in bars and Dunedin is what three bars have closed all owned by the same operator because he got sick of turning away intoxicated people 'd spend a minimal amount of money our recent statistics have shown in a market decrease and been binge drinking and so I think what I would like to see is the adoption of our la p about an addition there are staff recommendation that council review of the LA p should a number of objections to the LAPD received i believe that we are still evolving as a city we are still establishing areas of hospitality we tility areas that are outside our current structure and that what we 've actually formulated almost two and a half years ago is appropriate but needs some fine-tuning so I would like to David I i I 'd have to take advice on that I believe that would be out of order because we can 't_''_1681.349 anticipate the appeal was been lodged so I think that staff would come back to us if there was and we actually we can addict signal that we we wish wish to immediately review the LA p no there 's no need to do that what we need to do is to give everyone a degree until we actually publicly notify and have the appeals process dealt with in a decision agreed but I think the staff are getting a very clear understanding from across the council that that we are very willing for the for a collaborative approach to seeking to resolve any outstanding issues during the process yep I just wanted to clarify this and once about who has the right to lodge an appeal because not everybody can lodge the video it 's only a person it made a submission that may launch appeal and lodge an appeal if you don 't lodge a formal appeal you can still apply to the chairperson of our lot in seek leave to be good in the following people can join us any inspector any constable any medical officer of Health any other party who made a submission so you can still say you want to be in the hood but you 're not appealing policy and any other person who satisfies ala bet he or she has an interest in the proceedings apart from any interest in common with the public so you would have not you know it 's not open to everyone yeah I understand that Allah yeah but the point is is there in two cases already the there was an agreement reach that I 'll are approved he 's somebody really here yeah well fancy appeals process is underway yeah that 's right but it 's once the appeals process is underway so I don 't want to signal anything beyond that I thought it was appropriate to mention the district plane one because the rules affecting the district plan are different from the rules affecting less this is about harm reduction the district plan is about nuisance you know nuisance for neighbors having people slamming car doors and and generally behaving loudly and a residential neighborhood so I be concerned of the district plan in rules are affected but I 'm just signaling that if they are we have to review this to see whether it provides some protection but the rules for protection are quite different so it may not be able to be anticipated and I guess I 'm mentioning it now because there are parties in the plan because that is an issue that is of deep concern to all of us but anyway we will there 's Paul and Glenn and I want to see a really vibrant city for a young people and for our older people and I think it 's really important we apply some balance and with that said you know we 've got issues where we have residential areas right up against some of these other areas and concern we want to see 20,000 people living in our central city and so that 's where the balance really needs to come of the plane in my view and it 's about certainty so certainly for not only the residence but certainly for the businesses as well who are wanting to establish themselves creating these new areas these businesses will have certainty of what their hours of operation will be and they can actually then adjust their business model to suit so I think it 's really really important and on the other side from a residential is rebuilding your residential areas in the city and in the central city those reasons will be operating so if you 're a young person and you want to live in the central city and you don 't mind an oyster three or four in the morning well then you can actually go and live in those areas and they will certainly be proprietor lighted for but there will be others that do not want that so we have to put that balance into place and I 'm really hard to see there is an appeals process and having to see that term I think most people that will have a concern I would have already raised it and within the 4000 submitter so I think that over that they will have the opportunity to actually put the case forward and one thing and in particular as the one-way door policy which is for me a bit of an issue because what you have is a situation where you will dump all your people out on the street at one o 'clock o 'clock trying to get to a place where it has a later license so I 'm pleased to see that that can process and in like with the Littleton area to me it 's not a center at support and I think that it should have some flexibility there as well so I will be supporting this I want to give some certainty to all parties and I think this policy will actually help guide that thin thank you i will be quick i was here in the previous term a similar length process to the LTP in my view wide views were canvassed I 've concluded that the lat actually as it stands this policy is full as with councillor clearwater in my former professional life often came across have 20 years the effects of alcohol-related harm from generation to generation we want to make Christchurch a fun place for our younger people but my view on this is that too many freedoms isn 't freedom at all you actually do need a policy you do need some certainty for our community I feel within the policy that the hours are reasonable there 's more more than plenty time to access alcohol with a off licence or online premises I think the inner CBD and I ended some one way door fully support we need to hit that I need you to please support this thank you all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much _"

    "text": "so the next item is the report of the chief executive and I will hand over to kaylene edwards and thank you I take the report is red but I just want a highlight a couple of things so one is that a number of our bouquets in success in the last month so you would have read that Anne Marie Robinson and Linda Bennett from a communications team won the public relations institute of New Zealand supreme award for the appropiate home truth communicating a risk of land side to port hills residents and so now they can enter their global com pre-award and the chief judge in a Redford said the project stood out among a record of 68 entries and I 'll read to you what she said with around 1400 port hills homes me Victor derya the tasks was not small and was carried out in a very short time frame the infant 's work was thorough thoughtful and showed extensive handling of a fraught in complex situation this combined of intelligent planning excellence stakeholder analysis and very professional with empathetic implementation it was about by the only award classic art gallery 13 excellence awards and the 2015 museums Australia publication design awards or mec does the gallery took top honors in three categories exhibition catalog for David Cook make me in the square for the magazine bulletin in the poster booster flipper wobbler tripper refers burner sticker shaker maker and carcasses so it 's really a great was a result I think that speaks volumes about the patient and pride and innovation that staff walked even expected galleries produce despite the building being closed that was coming from the director uglier Jackson thirdly lbs ki square and Littleton one the engaging communities category of the New Zealand community boards best practice awards so Carol Anne bond a second unit manager even design in regeneration see that the design and improved Albion square was a product a really great collaboration between the council and the community at large during both the development of the littleton master plan and identification will design options for the square so it 's really a model that we should be using moving on and of course finally became free architecture awards the oval pavilion One World Resort the awards and the public architectural category last week and so both are now eligible for international architecture awards so I think it 's important to recognize the work kept going on and the passion and commitment of people both in the council but also in the community boards and the rest of Christchurch and in the rebuild and the work that we 're doing around that and the only other reminder is though the fire under-20 World Cup beyond 2015 may do here and twiddle of June and councillor Henson has been meeting some of the teams arriving but it 's really the most significant global football team tournament classics be the same with this local game taking off next monday so they actually is a really exciting event for Christ 's Church in terms of the input that will have a around it and it 's a worth participation on have you taken in questions about Rachel reform Glen them yannis in Germany David you kaylene I think it 's wonderful that the stamp on that award that and sometimes their staff well aware of how hard they work and we 've seen us through the ltb process and sometimes they 're not always think so i think it 's great that we you know can acknowledge that today I 'm sure we all support there just got a couple questions just on page 19 and 29 a reference to procurement work streams just curious if you 're able to get a little bit more and also over the anything that 's come out of asbestos dear what the government 's released anything that 's adding too slow in terms the procurement work stream that 's part of our great the Christchurch so the executive team approved a work program going starting with procurement cause it 's a very easy wins earlier and also just approved to other parts customer and community focus and middle and back-office but in the procurement area there already some significant savings that have been made by renegotiating some of the contracts over cotton take about a million dollars a year and the so the procurement and the organization is worked quite hard and some of those those savings as well and so we have a programmatic cavity to look at all of those areas and we can make savings but it also improves a contract management and the the objectors around some of the contracts as well yani and a number of questions thank you for your report just under the skirt and westwood a network rebuild obviously we 've got the horizontal infrastructure of you can you just tell us when that 's going to be publicly release and what communications we all haven 't found those waste water overflows should i well should I peps interject here because we 're talking to the minister 's office at the moment about putting a joint release out so it should be it should be today or tomorrow so it 's not far away right okay and what 's the message I mean what 's the key message around the waste water overflows give them the information we 've head back wastewater flows through the waste water treatment sixty percent higher there 's a risk enable agree that will not achieve equal or better than proved quite 're waiting to June 2016 to do the mod more but they 're still testing that 's going on at the moment and work around there so it 's part of again a greater program around the waist an environmental management team that are doing and I think you 've ideas identified in do some of the work that 's happening so people will know when that review is released where the extent of the damages that won 't be fixed these are the wastewater parts yes I actually the sexes around where there are big areas of damage if there are small areas of damage then there 's usually possibility of continuing to use those pipes rather than replacing the whole lot so the the videos can help you tell us where those are I guess in simple terms what I want to understand is in terms of the wedding to the end of the skirt appear to know where the gaps are with all the money being committed how do we know that the areas that are causing these overflows are being addressed through the skirt process as there 's a prioritization process and where we identify the bigger shoes then they 'll be the ones that are urgently looked at as opposed to the smaller issues okay and just the second question on this viscous demolition waste in test management I know that we 've just again hit the same information that we keep getting back so every time we get a natural environment recovery program update we get when we ask that asbestos we keep getting told the same thing but we 're also being told that there 's continuously new sites in the central city with our experiencing issues like the justice and emergency precinct I think the bus interchange I think than me I 'm just interested in why we keep getting told the same information but we still have the same problems time and time again so is there any strategic look at what 's causing these issues in the first place and what we need to do differently to actually stop them from becoming issues so we 'll identify those please bestest when they start to you know develop those areas and specifically what you 're asking before about what we would do differently intro sports is a really good example so it wasn 't until the hospital put the car park horn that we even discovered ahead a specialist of it so why wasn 't that picked up at the start when the buildings were being demolished and why wasn 't enforcement taken or monitoring taken when the building 's roof can go cleared to find out that the asbestos was there and then be treated why did it take several months for it to even become in a shoe well I can 't answer that I 'm not sure what the process is accepted there is the pro active site still visits to all sites and the work that happens so when there 's demolitions head happening there 's certainly monitoring too cheap for things such as asbestos exactly what I wouldn 't appear that that 's working if these cases are still being reported but that so pets are being reported because there is monitoring but there 's a time delay I think it 's a process of understanding talk to your flying about and just the final question for me is the UM the capital program will not be spent on page 20 only 37 seen my budget has been expended that 's that 's pretty extraordinary are we going to get any kind of full information around actually going to be complete and when are we going to get that because obviously today on the agenda we 've got some requests for spending of some capital on some projects that are ready to go ahead and it would be really helpful to know particularly in terms of making substitutions so that things can heaven rather than carry forward so so there is a list of projects that generally timing the lathe about feared or the projects are outside of our control center around scoot managed or around the anchor projects but our contribution to those shared projects may actually be within the next financial year so those that funding will be carried forward around that and then there are delays and some of the other areas around community facilities which you know about or the art gallery such as waiting for insurance receipts or delay or difficulties or complexities around those rebuilds so I 'm very sure that the list comes really to the committee 's and it 's sitting about but it will be about things part of their LTP and I 've our thoughts daft I will ask for staff to I have asked for staff to be available to answer the question in relation to whether there is funding available for the project that you 're referring to grow yeah I 'm Jimmy and two questions first one on page 4 20 we got into a level of service for a performance report in here the figure is the at 85 percentage however I 'm not sure that because yesterday also issue you know the kind of overall our satisfaction with the council service performance from the resistance this kinda is only 65 percentage so they stock ape I mean that why have this a bigger gap in a strategic we can narrow at least a cape yeah so so they 're two different things one is our levels of service that would cover sit there at eighty-five percent so that 's the the targets out of the activity management plans for instance the which one would be resident satisfaction and also staff engagement but there are some of the figures so what that will mean is that that let because we didn 't reach our target around residents data section that will drop down meeting a target of label to see this so it 's just it 's one of a very hundreds of targets that we got a second patience on also located 20 in top right corner capital expenditure here you will review this figure you know if the up-to-date ear today 's is kind of the expenditure behind the deciduous 80 3.5 million dollars in our order for year is 107 point of four million dollars however we reviewing here in the middle part in here a council consider only 91 million dollars under spin will be carried forward well about the rest of 16 minutes and also I would like to follow the cancer ya need a question why 's the kind of strategic way we came in order progress of the Lost hell wrong told infrastructure so if you 're talking about what we need to do around capital expenditure per se so we 've looked at an end-to-end process about what happens and and making sure that we don 't have delays that we can manage you know that we 're responsible for in trying to streamline it prices the other thing is around issues such as how we monitor capital expenditure so you 'll see that um we meet we meet our milestones beer but the milestones don 't actually reflect spending the money or or delivering so that via we need to review those sorts of issues the other thing is around our forecasting in terms of what we spent so for years the council hasn 't met its forecast expenditure and capital so we need to make those more realistic as well because what we 're capable of em what what capacity we have to deliver on those I would just reinforce that some of us as outside of our control so it 's about other agencies that such as skirt or anchor projects have in terms of expenditure there as well thank you David thank you look at fish are just like to congratulate the chief executive qualities in the detail of the of the report just like to focus on page 26 health and safety I think that the half accidents is caught up on last year and particular hit market is that we counsel will be faced with the implementation of the new months time but provisions are particularly draconian particularly we 're up to whether it 's going to apply to us or not but directors but certainly to the chief executive if procedures aren 't followed or we knowingly don 't action to prevent incidents continuing and happening so I 'm interested to know what work is being done in Council at the moment with through the pending new health and safety legislation particularly Harriton packs on the on us as your employees it 's been I cannot screen I could go to jail but I think we 're not in Australia I could go to jail or if I ignore you could so a number of things so interested in making sure that we have a healthy and safe environment for our staff to weaken so some of the increase actually about us being better at recognizing and reporting so not notwithstanding that it 's not it 's not a problem to see an increase but just recognize it you know these things actually happen so that 's a good thing in a sense but it still recognizes that you know things are happening with them for it to our staff Ivan a health or safety issue in terms of the what we 're doing at the moment we 're undertaking an internal audit around health and safety culture and organization as part of the internal audit process and that will give us a baseline from which we to develop a health and safety a strategy for the whole organization which he needs to flow through to the agencies that deliver services for us as well and with it will be will be doing some work with counselors around what your account abilities and responsibilities might be as well and essentially it 's important that you know that think i just can 't emphasize strongly enough the importance of this sort of work a couple of other organizations that I sit on as a council representative three health and safety as a paramount issue it 's generally the first item on the agenda and it is treated with a huge amount of respect and I really want to see this organization take health and safety very serious and important aspect to follow through so i will be very interested to see how that Penton anymore okay thank you Paul just around the capital expenditure and the earthquake rebuild expenditure at just the so far behind our plan of how much we can and what we actually are steaming and I just want to know what we are going to do about bringing that back into mine so we actually have some reality around our expenditure because it seems to me iran air out that capital get seems to get we go so i just think we need a plan so when we look at this year we 're actually talking about realities and what we can actually achieve I mentioned to cancel a chin that 's exactly the work that we 're doing so it 's not only about improving the way we deliver you know the capital program but it 's actually about how we forecast what what what were actually had capacity to deliver on so we 've been over optimistic in the past so we need it to think about not only what we can deliver but what can be delivered you know through the community through other agencies as well so it 's a big piece of work just in terms that be good to see this issue resolve like just like next report let me just come back to a reality should we give you a summary and the next we 'll talk about what 's actually happening and how we 're going about a lot of us will be surfaced with the LTP as well I guess that the thing that kind of threw me more than anything else was the fact that we actually didn 't budget to borrow everything we 'd budgeted to do because we knew we wouldn 't an absolute revelation I think there 's a part I was trying to flesh out yeah public so they actually understand there is a process and and we aren 't boring we are getting on top of it and and it was part of the resolution that we passed earlier this year that we instructed the chief executive to report back as part of the LTP process on a number of matters including getting our operational expenditure down but an addition to address the carry forwards and actually the carry forwards are looking way better than they were looking at the beginning of this process so we 're on the way but there 's still a long way to go but thank you for raising it the issue i wanted to raise was the report back from the national natural environment recovery program which is the pirate park update this was an issue of concern that was raised when we had the presentation on the national natural environment recovery program which was the potential for leasing out pirate Park which had been initiated by the Burwood Pegasus community board potentially of interest having been really sparked off by the interest of the celebration church lion sports trust I think that the people that were running the national natural environment recovery program were a little bit concerned about the location of platters Park as it is and the you know in the cut behind you know whether the natural run of the river used to be and its proximity to the residential red zone and how inappropriate it was really to be entering into any sort of arrangement not knowing what the what the whole future of the residential red zone would be so I just wanted to thank you for reporting back on that with such detail Glenn just in the board support I have sought clarification because that wasn 't mine David 's reflection we have from the board advisor Peter Crouch of that the board resolved to have to consider proceeding not actually to proceed but to consider proceeding so that was taken a step further without knowledge so so an opportunity purse don 't have been proactive accurately let 's start obviously very Pro it yeah it raise an issue for me which is that the community board has the power to set off the process of an expression of interest over a matter over which they don 't have the final decision because pirate park is a metro facility so it would have had to have come to council anyway and and given that this council had already expressed the view that residential red zone proximity was an issue that would be taken into account in terms of any land use issues you know it really does highlight a problem and process overall but I 'm you know I 'm glad that we 've got this now under control and I think we should we should actually report back to I think Chrissie Williams presented on the natural environment recovery we didn 't have the delegation to sit in EO I exactly exactly just well you did give the delegation to sit the eoi process you didn 't have the delegation to make the decision and it to me as nuts and anyone 's language so hopefully there is something that we will be able to for that and I 'm happy to move that the report be received you 'd like to ask another follow-up question as it is it necessary okay just very quickly I 'm just do we have a date when we 're expecting a report back on the syrah transition that 's raised under the your ability which which just on page 27 which part it just is that the council staff continue mate with Syrian government first discuss a whole bunch of areas around zero transition and ensuring our preparedness for transition as the key focus of prison I was wanting if we had a date when we could expect a report so that we can provide some governance feedback around us we don 't we 're working at a number of levels around a range of issues and so you know I 'm meeting on regular basis with my counterpart John Umbra and other staff meeting at other levels are around details so there isn 't a date that we can yeah I mean it there will be I mean that this is something that I feel you know 've been appointed to the transition advisory board I 'm on the board because I 'm the mayor of Christchurch but not as the mayor of Christchurch so it 's actually quite a challenging environment so we 've certainly been working very hard on developing a proposition that really is a Christchurch City lead transition process so you know it seems to me that the messages that we 've been getting from central government is that it is time to step back it 's time for the natural leaders of them of the the city and the two districts to come back to the fore and and that is a process that obviously has to be worked out carefully now that there 'll be a lot of public important of us so the government and you might recall they announced publicly that as a result of the ver interpretation of the Supreme Court case on the quake outcasts that they will be proceeding as a recovery plan so a transition recovery plan under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act will be developed now that means that a discussion document or a for public feedback we will have the opportunity to input and to that and we are talking with them at the moment about about what that what that might require in terms of ongoing powers beyond April 2015 but we did have an informal briefing for counselors on this but I don 't think you were there and and so but we will continue to update counselors on what we 're doing but a lot of it is about what we want to really put on the table and it really feeds back from a lot of the comments that people made during the long term plan I think people would like to see the City Council play a stronger role in terms of leading the development of the central city and I think that 's a very realistic possibility like just some clear communication maybe if we can around the two different processes that are underway and how they relate because I do agree with you actually we 'd rent free we look review as well so we need to actually be able to to our communities over where what the time frame is illegal can be involved the transition recovery plan obviously under the legislation as something that 's ultimately signed off by by the minister after taking it through cabinet and we 're certainly promoting a stronger role for you know the christchurch city interests because i think this is the thing that that people forget the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act covers Christchurch City Waimakariri district and and Selwyn district but the interests of Christchurch City are quite different from the interests of the two districts Paul at the land use recovery plan and a district plan once a district plan is in place is there actually any need for the land use with every plan to be in place well it continues in existence and because the crown is legally required with the Akeem is legally required to review its operation that 's actually in the process of reviewing it at the moment so there 's a discussion paper out on that at the moment as well so there 's a lot going on but look I 'm moving that the report be received as seconded favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried but I think we 'll do _"

    "text": "item on the agenda is the residential advisory service funding request Ginny Huey I 've actually asked die Keenan to join us on this as well because the residential advisory service has been a core part of the the hub and and linwood and we actually haven 't had any visibility of there at all and I did want to have died give us a little bit of a flavor of that if that 's all right sorry dive put you on the spot I know you probably didn 't realize I mean come up to the table when and advise us I do i do want to mention this because i think that you know they 've been lots of debates around the residential advisory service but i just wanted people to kind of see this in a broader context so so it died could I just invite you to give us a little bit of a snapshot of what 's happening at the hub because I think that would be helpful in the residence advisory service as such a key part of a hard further half as at as intended to close it on the twenty-fifth but the communities made a real call for us to keep it open it 's basically being pioneered by Ken soon we started as a pilot but they have got other agencies involved including the council as being funded by both Sierra in eq c and they also got our money from the community trust funded they have people there basically for monday tuesday thursdays late night till eight o 'clock the resonance advisory service as they 're from when the doors open on a monday so we may finally close at eight o 'clock on thursday night on thursday nights they have seminars have been rotating them so you can we crowned I 've been having this week it 's cash settlement so there 'll be two seminars today at one and seven on Casey two months and next week we 'll be back to their plotting issue we 're here as a council we have staff there what we have staff they 're also all the time communications staff meeting in the mornings where we basically take everyone 's questions which are also posted on the n- website we also have consent staff there from eleven to one on thursdays and we have rain and drainage recovery program nearly every afternoon so we 've got on southern there who as much love much respected by the community and we 're giving just such a great response from a council perspective we 've had 11 hundred and sixty-four people through the hubs and that opened averaged 60 a day most people are coming and clutching their eqc folders and seeking resolution so that would definitely be the biggest quiff number of questions as coming through for EQC but again people are finding it great head that point of face-to-face contact where they can actually raise issues be taken through the case and then move on from it but it 's fantastic having the residence advisory service sitting there they can then you know if someone comes on as I said with a great bundle of papers they 'll go and talk to me if you see the resonance advisory suit will come over and they 'll work through these cases together pendant Lorca and I 've said you know people of civil what 's the difference between the residents advisory service and you at a law firm and one of the solicitor feels very involved in drugs Casey you get the same advice the only differences between the residents advisory service advice of my advice as you don 't need to pay for this you know it 's the same quality advice that people are getting so they just had been awesome a net recovery community engagement space so I 'd like to I 'd like to move the recommendation and the reason that I want to move it is because originally the council what was was reluctant to contribute this is significantly less than the contribution that was originally budgeted for out of the out of the Christchurch earthquake mural relief fund but I 'm satisfied now that the that it would be appropriate to make an additional grant we 've already made a grant and this grant as I say significantly less than the grant that they would have been expecting that you 're going to see conduct so any questions of staff Andrew Glen Ali looking at the table in 3.13 number of contacts both face-to-face and otherwise are increased between the 14 year and 15-year connections to other services and organizations is significantly down is there any explanation as to why more contact would be resulting in less referrals does it reflect a change in the nature of the contacts or in the subject matter or it just interested me that you would expect if they were more context then there would also be more referrals and that 's not what we 've seen I 'm sorry I 'm sitting at countless cuz I 've set all the government 's order their residential advisor shifts look I don 't have this the quick answer to that but I can certainly find that out for you it is certainly we are guess had expected that the demand would decrease over time but in fact we 're finding that the topics that people focus on us certainly changing now there are certainly a strong demand which is why the service decided to extend for another year but I definitely 't have that information at my fingertips I 'm Glenn no sorry just debate later on yep Ali I wondered whether it was real and if you could find this out as well whether it 's related to the cash sea and the prices higher if you like voyage as Andy QC to cash settle there for cape because I see the number of cases that are closed and finalized as up as well I 'd be interested to know and the cash settlement move but there 's certainly and councils I do circulate a monthly report you know you get a thousand emails a day which identifies that and certainly the large numbers of people now coming with a I 've been offered a cash settlement I 'm not sure whether I should accept it I don 't know whether the time frames right that 's become a significant partners when we started obviously it wasn 't on there so happy to explore that fall 12 I know that CS and and res are working closely together now now we 're 45 years on and the level of stress with that are you finding that there are more being referred from red to see us than they would have been safe year ago not sure the figures on that but I can certainly find that yeah I think I mean it might be useful to get res and says to come here for a presentation and I think that might be a useful thing cuz I mean these are the I mean Michaels their representative on the on the board so he 's not probably down on the detail of the referrals but it might be useful at this time because we have had them come before to actually get an update on on that process but I think be dry dies comments about I mean that 's why I wanted her to talk about the hub because I really had no visibility on just how how important it was and how close we are to the deadline of it closing and I would have thought there we might actually want to do some thinking about whether we keep that going because it 's an important part of actually in a way that suits them popping into the shopping Mormon it 's in the food court so you know it 's actually worked out really really well and the other thing that I just mentioned on this is that I 'm concerned that you know that that these sorts of things you know get get promoted as as kind of pilots but when they 're successful because you know because their acidity ongoing ongoing funding so I would really like to to support this so do you want to debate it now yeah sure um we 're putting money into this as a council clearly where despite the mou hasn 't been signed we 're acting during this process are we getting acknowledgement as a funder to use a person using this service do they realize that the city 's is partially funding it they certainly should there was a bit of a hiccup because the old mou has expired and we 're about to sign the new one I think we 're just waiting for the resolution of this to write that up but there was a media or associate minister about the extension at that stage this was unclear whether the council was going to continue to provide so it wasn 't mentioned in that however I think that will rapidly be corrected I 'm not sure minister is going to make another release but in students immune to the website and up until now that 's been cleared but it has been but a convoluted process getting there and I mean they would know that on the assumption that this is approved today I 'd be keen for us to get obviously as much energy as a funder as we possibly can yeah thank you I have had that correspondence back with the other person who manages the suicide dive against problem Jimmy ask you one question that based on your gala involved in the governance is all you know party code is the kind of meeting if council Gwen defined in this year by how about next year are they the planet Mantinea Lord is the last a year I think this that 's a very good question and I think that me is really the transition of the city away from Sarah and back into the hands of the city that 's one of the things we 're looking at as to what aspects of the service will need to be continued regardless of May 16 deadline which i think is when the money runs out and that 's partly this is asked of course heavily funded by eq c and the insurance insurance groups and so they 're keeping a look on is this good value for them at the moment and the answer is yes this is a very good way to resolve things in a way that 's effective for them so we are having a look at what do we lift get left at the end of it we 're talking with mb about what they might pick up in terms of some of that technical advice that we now have built into it so that 's a piece of work we 're going through at the moment to see and i guess we will if we need to we 'll come back to council have another chat but I some aspects of this that not suddenly going to disappear on may 2016 we need to make sure people can access in a way that they can afford they need to settle some of these things so there 's a real awareness of that okay so is there any debate if you have to go Glynn Lovingston i would like to me because I actually would like to say this has been great leadership shown by this council and in this respect I would like to acknowledge my colleagues council Johansson who unfortunately has to set this out in Catholic Jones prior to her time coming on the council there is obviously in it being four years you know doing this but the fact is I think the council is proving its ability to touch but that 's local the build the case for being prepared to continue to lead after April next year because actually at a local level councils have a way of connecting with their people with but its central government it 's just how it works in a way in which central government cannot because it that people are able to access this in particularly one of the lower socioeconomic areas of the city I urge you all quite a statement if we could thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no carry it unanimously _"

and enabling us to have this welcome here too Colleen Edwards our new chief executive it is just so exciting to have you on board and I know that I speak for every one of the counselors that we are really looking forward to you taking up the helm of this organization that has been without a chief executive and nearly for a year so that is a long time for an organization to be the eight month anniversary of us being elected to our roles and so we are still feeling like we are a new council and everything that we have been doing up until this moment has actually been about preparing for this day so we believe that we are going to be handing to you an organization that will challenge you and every respect but we have prepared the way I believe in a way that will enable you to enable this organization to step up to the role that it ought to be playing in our city as has been said with the challenges that we all know that we face I deliberately wore red and black today for a reason I wanted to make a point and it was a point that i made last year about our province and we wear our colors with pride and canterbury and they are red and black but I had it did some research on the history of the Crusaders and when the super 12 competition was first set up the Crusaders came last in the very first competition and I mention focus commitment and a plan of attack you can lift from the bottom to the top of the ranks and that is what we believe can be done for our city and three years time when we have done we 've completed our term and office all of us myself and all of the counselors we want to look back on these three years with a sense of pride and we have pride in our rugby team and we need to have pride and our council and we think you can deliver that so no pressure riff and I think looking forward so that we can decide now what it is that we want to look back on in terms of achievement I think that 's a very good way for us to step on so today we put a line and the sand everything up until today has a link to the past everything from today onwards as firmly focused on the future so welcome Carlene you are most welcome tena koe tu tena koutou tena that ok talk you you hey ah a lean from this day we outward to the people of Christchurch and captures all of the energy that exists out there at the moment and to look with them the organization to unleash the huge potential that we know that is there we have great confidence in you we 've been looking forward to this day for a very long time tena koutou tena koutou tena that has work at war tena koutou tena koe totemic Otto cartel excuse me this I 'd like to just acknowledge the traditional owners of a land upon which we meet today and pay my respects to elder 's past and present thank you so much for the very warm and generous welcome and to see so many faces that i recognized and you have to catch up with people I feel like I 'm likes friends and I think that 's important because we 're going to need all the friends we can get but as a person from Christchurch my place of origin is hi hi my family 's from Christchurch my mother from Wellington my own sisters from England and Italy and my husband 's family so we 're delighted to be back in Christchurch it 's a place I really must I 've missed lots about Christchurch the green spaces the gardens the clear rivers in the sea the port hills and the mountains but most of all I 've actually missed the people in a sense of community that a place like Christchurch brings and a community I think that 's stronger since the devastation of the earthquakes it 's not something that you see in a large city but soonly something that I feel every time I come back to Christchurch and I think about what we need to do essentially my vision for Christchurch is that the world see that as I see at a great place to live work learn and play and a prosperous innovators 30 and also for the world to know that we 're open for business and we 're not that we 're not defined by the earthquakes but they will use what 's happened and we use our abundance of resources to actually build our city of the future so the things that we 've talked great place to live again and to visit and to be part of its fear and we continue to develop it into something that we 're really proud of and really enjoy being part of and other people enjoy coming to visit as well and want to come to live here and I also think about this job for me is about people in relationships so it 's about the people in terms of our community and people in terms of our team within the council so the people we serve and the people we lead and it 's also about relationships so this is a big job the council has a huge task ahead of it and we can 't_''_1591.409 do that on our own none of us can actually face the sort of challenges that we 've got on our own so we need to be working together whether it 's our staff the community other agencies ewee central government we 're all in this together and we need to be sure that we 're working in partnership to achieve that the things that we need to and along those lines and succeeding in terms of finding the future that we want for the city of christchurch kinna koto tena koutou tena koutou katoa you you you _"

    "text": "Android tuna to introduce this report yep happy to do so there 's one past pay item on the report which is a relatively procedural matter back in April of this year the committee and council approved a grant for the west haven apartments building picture in the report it 's a building that 's familiar to most of us Howard imagine since that grant approval was given the building has changed hands the main difference is that the proposed future use of the building is now a commercial use whereas at the time the grant was made it was a residential use the external Art Deco form and detail including the metal windows and the existing feature entrance doors on Montreal street will be retained so our understanding and we asked some questions of staff at the committee is the external appearance of the building will be retained despite the use will be commercial rather than residential there was a question around signage that came up at the committee that heritage staff weren 't able to respond to as that 's a planning rather than a heritage matter the so the building in an as is where is state again we spoke to staff at the meeting around the implications of that and it was suggested and there 's certainly an argument but the new owner in as much as the new owner isn 't holding the Insurance contribution is making a greater private contribution to the refurbishment and maintenance of the building then the previous owners would have done had they been applying the insurance funds to it so the committee recommendation was to approve the change in scope and to maintain the grant funding so that 's the only part a the only other issues I would make reference to from this report is item 12 memorandum around leasing houses for the homeless this came directly as the result of a forum on homelessness that precipitated some work we 've got a report item 19 on today 's agenda and I just like to know the speed at which this work has been done and commend staff for the speed at which this has all happened and also acknowledge the input of councillors buck and Livingstone in so quickly but we 'll be dealing with the substantive matter in item 19 in today 's agenda right um and you 'll move the recommendation arm I 'm happy to move the committee recommendation on the path egg mass oh yeah and do I have a seconder then Livingston is there any questions or comment yani okay um I just wanted to place on record um and you can see from the voting around the change of scope of works for the rest haven apartments building just wanted to express real concern that if we want people living in the central city then rezoning some of the best residential land into commercial or enabling that through provision of these sorts of grants really concerns me I think you know I was really happy to support this going into keeping the fabric and becoming residential or continuum of residential apartments I 'm really concerned that we are somehow encouraging the change from residential to commercial in this building and therefore I wasn 't happy to support this change so i just wanted to place on record my concern and the thank you I can understand your concern yani I wonder if we had much choice in the middle it so my question was I don 't know Andrew did what he asked if there 's any heritage items and the interior any up staircases or any other features that need to be protected Lee my mind goes back to the business building scenario yeah that question did come up in the committee and we we weren 't able to get an answer as to exactly what was proposed but the focus was on the maintained external appearance of the building as the the contribution I guess to the public good in the public realm and that was the part that there was the most interesting um Oh Jamie thinks I wasn 't gonna speak to it 's quite straightforward but yani just want to reiterate his opposition around it I 'll reiterate one support at this is called the central city landmark heritage crown it 's nonsense grant we actually do have saying to incentivize that and it 's the central city residential development contributions rebate the whole purpose of retained it was the only thing worse than not being able to save a beautiful historic landmark iconic heritage building is to save a beautiful iconic landmark heritage building in for it to be demolished by neglect because it doesn 't financially stack up unfortunately that was the part that was going to go down the previous owners found that and weren 't able to make work a new owner came and he 's going to be tipping I mean he 's going to be able to save this building with the ground that was um that was previously allocated for the purpose of retaining these buildings so I think it would be a terrible Preston to then whip the carpet out from underneath the feet going to be able to do exactly what the council wanted by setting up this grant in the first instance so it 's not going to be demolished by a niggly because it has no use they found a way to make it financially fly and I think that should be of course I 'm supporting that Paul I makati echo yannis comments around to come back and live in the inner city I because that 's something I do firmly believe in however this is a hit heritage recognizable landmark building and I want to see it survived and sometimes all these buildings to savoy they need to convert the use to actually and they 'd like to happen and I makes you heartened with an atar who development which is straight across the road which is going from commercial into our for residential so and from that respect I think there 's been a balance that mean needs to put in place and as I say I want to see this bill entertained it 's a beautiful building it is one of those landmarks which we don 't have any of them left unfortunately post-earthquake so I 'll be supporting and justice this way my crown yeah Oh Andrew um yeah I 'll just speak to the comments that have been made I mean worst I understand the sentiments of counselor johansson 's comments the issue of balance between residential and commercial use of buildings in the city is a far wider and I look at this as an opportunity for us to assist in the in the presentation the preservation and retention of that building and it 's in in that context that I 'm supporting this today so yes there is a wider issue around encouraging people to live in the city but we 're not going to be able to handle that biota see on one building on more keen to to see this served and that 's the reason I 'm supporting ya know I 'm going to support the motion as well I think I 've said before that I used to live in the West Dave and apartments and the bottom left hand flat and it certainly is a wonderful asset to our city I was disappointed that it 's no longer going to be available for residential but I agree with so I agree with yanni in that respect but I also agree with Jamie that you know too that the one thing that would be worth would be to see it demolished and no longer part of our our landmark heritage and I think you know there is a lot of residential development going to happen once that police building disappears and that 's going to really alive on this part of the of the city and I think it 's going to make a huge difference so I 'm in favor of it there 's just one other thing though that there was a comment on it that just did a little alarm bell for me that as is we 're a state with no insurance funds for appears that means that the previous owner took the insurance money that that was settled for a residential and it just reminded me that we 've got houses throughout Christchurch where the residential component has they 've taken the settlement and that there is no mechanism and place to record whether the repairs that actually done for cash settlements so I 'm just I 'm alerting people to this because you know and I don 't want to be alarmist people know that I 'm not that sort of but this could be the leaky building crisis of 20 to 30 years time if people kind of warning is is that when you 're in the market and you 're buying a house you 're going to have to know whether the repairs are done or not it 's not our role to keep that record but I have asked that the chief executive look unto this because I think it is a risk issue I 'm not going to take any more because it 's I 'm side trekking and that 's because I 'm the chair and I can do that but I 'm just making the point that it 's it is something that we need to be alert to is a risk that could face the city and the future in terms of the range of farm cash settlements but I just make the point that when people are in this market it will be very easy for the first sale and purchase but it 's going to get more difficult as the transactions distance themselves from the event so memories don 't stretch that far we know because we keep repeating the mistakes that we 've made over time so aye those opposed say no that 's carried and Andrew and Glenn will move and second that the report as a whole be adopted and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then we 've got Civic here land drainage content _"

    "text": "the item on the agenda quickly and and then we 'll have a break for morning tea I think this one will be relatively simple Phil would you like to introduce the report of the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee seem at the May so this is the only protein getting the cheers to introduce their reports look like an ID put on where strangers anyway it 's some when it came to our committee I guess that they made a minor recommendation to to the staff recommendation and like I would emphasize this as a trial and it 's it 's quite clear that in fact in terms of delivery of postural services now it 's parcels and packages which are the main items and the this some trial that you Zealand Post have agreed to do or ask to do fits in with trials and the rest of New Zealand at the time of our committee we were concerned about potential impact on footpaths and certainly you know that will be monitored carefully and the routes that will be taken were but by during this trial they 'll right so with that in mind soonly I would move the committee that 's fine do I have a seconder for that I 'm Thomas Kandra Paul Glynn this seemed to me that the Baxter vehicle struck a number of overhanging trees and hedges against the Makai booze on this wondering but they just thinks you use the kybers rather than the Baxter this booth pics are from makes you the the operator well stuff out here but my and cutting I think they would use the more appropriate vehicle okay yep I 'm Glenn and in turn you and deal with Pegasus I 'm more concerned about the impact on the footpaths on vehicles on the other way around because it is pretty bad but are they going to extend the trial and to some of them because if they can get through some of the worst footpaths I think they might be like door the trial will be extended successful Glenn and that 's something we need it in terms of I think all suburbs in terms of them safety footpaths and Tim I mean that when they that the posters are already on push bikes so you know the vehicles just slightly different they they are going to a spread across the city with different areas and pills included so that they 're taking events of the city right across and they are looking at horses for courses with both these vehicles to answer your question with regards overhanging yep Andrew there seems to be a bit of an anomaly in the report but I 'm sure they 'll be an explanation 4.4 this is likely to cause damage over time especially in wet weather referring to damage to the berms so line three and paragraph four point four and then in paragraph four point seven the results trial clearly demonstrated the vehicles can be safely driven and are unlikely to cause significant damage two berms now presumably this is about the the choice of vehicle appropriate to the route so I 'm guessing that what we will be looking for in the final proposal in the management plan would be mitigation of those sort of issues by the the choice of vehicle appropriate to the root that matter will be addressed by the management planner we 're expecting it to me and secondly the question was around the process for that full approval presumably that will come back to the committee and then be referred back to council for a final decision I you said certainly will come back to committee into council it has to be brought in mind where that and certainly that 's concerned when a any vehicle was on booms and that was like a test run with the drivers first chance and and we would expect that drivers will become more competent at looking what 's the other picks up pulling be that these are trials there trialing a new plymouth at the moment sort of whether to make the investment yeah but you know they believe that they 're more environmentally friendly because we don 't they will not need to use the courier vans so much which of these situation injurious driver education as well so there 's stuff to be weird through yeah but it 's not a given that they will actually adopt this son ya know and regards to things like health and safety and I this seems to be an admission and the report so I just want to check in terms of if we have any legal liability if these vehicles are using the footpath and you know people have accidents or crash well I 'm not understaffing to answer that Jonnie but what I would say is currently we have posties delivering services on the footpaths currently so I would expect that in fact and I 'll agree with you it should be referred to we should look at that to make take sure there 's part of a one thing we do it in I guess that 's more interns it but what I mean is that the law already must be legal cover in place now well so if someone pressures on what about footpaths because our footpath wasn 't you know hasn 't been maintained his big holes in it and one of these vehicles goes belly up or whatever then we respond are we do we have legal responsibility for their look at that obviously the chicken answer that that the council adopt the staff recommendation with alteration to the first bullet point is indicated below and then also add subject to confirmation of legal liability it 's not legal liability what 's the word it 's subject to confirmation of no I understand it but I 'm unless you want me to throw the report back to the committee subject to well no confirmation of legal legal liability with respect to the conduct the condition of council footpaths again we haven 't got the staff member here but I think we could not anticipate that the conditions cover that so we could add a bullet point and just subject to legal stuff i love you i love you yeah but i had a Power Beam tree colleague who used to say why don 't you just say things something like subject to possible legal issues being addressed subject to well suddenly subject to ensure ensuring legal issues covered on and live ensuring council legal issues of sure and get out pretty legal I look I understand exactly what it is it is an omission from the report so to try now question was here legal public liability was assessing holds an airport path to the stairs on for posties our ability scooters and ya know it 's the focused here yes of course we do I just don 't know what it is I don 't know everything so the electrician nice very popular bday clearly these are going to damage the boobs that 's what the trials shown so when you think about winter weather and vehicles going across yeah the how I still don 't quite understand as someone from these of a post gonna have a camera attached to the vehicle or how we going to monitor they are monitoring it they 've already there already this the purpose of the trial is that they monitor it so um subject confirmation of legal liability with respect well with respect to the use of council footpath put it that way with restrict to the use of counsel for parts for this purpose and the trial and this is to give this isn 't a full approval for the use of these vehicles on a network that if Clearwater and skandars a good with that I 'll put the motion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried right well let 's break honor the reporters a whole move by Tim scandrett seconded by full clear water put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say

    "text": "Ted Robinson Robinson our page 4 of the supplementary good morning and again apologies miss spend all morning apologizing to people good morning and thank you very much for the opportunity to to speak I I 've been a ratepayer winery since 1980 and during that time I spent 15 years or so as a building inspector for the bank 's financial aid though I know something of the sewage problems on the furniture has been stated that effluent of leaching into the sea in the past I did want to testing and winery teak our French farm during the summer periods this is for Environment Canterbury it 's very seldom that there was an adverse reading however this may have changed it is it is suggested by the council that all properties in minor he be connected to a large mess rating punk trying to the property is fed into the land disposal area this is a matrix expense and I can see value in properties on the flat being using this system it can not fathom why it would be necessary for properties on the hill surely with downhill would be cheaper the option for these properties exponentially council and city council have done very little for the right path of winery writing from barry 's bay to wineries and very poor condition the water tables has never been cleaned for four years and thus several sections have slipped during wet conditions while you rewrite residents association has taken several preached on several projects over the years replacing and concrete on the old slip by a raging placement of rocks and the new slip by building a toilet block and stanberry reserved decommission of the old toilet block island winery beachfront converted the toilet block into a changing said pre-planning and stanley reserve and the ferry road maintenance of the old hall building the rural farshid and trial for why new rule 14 resurfacing the tennis courts and repairing fencing around tennis courts reading to the winery wharf there was no a rubbish collection or footpath so my opinion that the right players they hope the right buyers that council should complete this waste water system as soon as possible we the ratepayers can then get something for the council should be go ahead we were told at this point with no expense to the ratepayers park and the cost of electricity connections is a macerating pump so I think the council should do look at this a wee bit more closely I know where your stretch for money but these macerating pups must cost mega bucks and it 's not necessary i don 't think for the uphill properties to have these pumps so therefore there must be a saving someone online i think more study should be made of the to Iceland but thank you very much for the opportunity of speaking yeah thank you very much and we appreciate you coming over there 's anyone got any questions Adam do you think that being annex building inspector do you think we took with the blinkers on with regards to the issues and and one know in other rural areas I mean over the last 25 years you can google straight away you know that composting toilets other things and other options to solve their environment problem we have looked at this composting toilet system that heat to compost the air Floyd this doesn 't always work we 've tried it a big problem I can see my newest maintenance of the septic tanks there are a lot of properties change hands and when they change hands the new property owners don 't know anything about septic tanks now that they have to be maintained that which means they have to be cleaned between three and five years have to be completely cleaned out if they are not cleaned out you get the scum on the top of the septic tank who gets the sludge on the bottom and when that meets all that rubbish goes out to the different lines clog them up there for you get problems and you 'll get leaching sorry this one hmm so is that apart from self responsibility of some environment property and not understanding how to operate it do you think it 's Annie can ensure a council issue or a personal issue because it 's the the environment pays the penalty in the end but it responsibility with the maintenance the septic tanks should fall on yeah they don 't know anything about it and they haven 't been told i think it 's council responsibility to make sure that they our mind type you said that the council 's responsibility is to maintain people 's septic Kings no no no what I 'm say to get the message across utterly home yeah thank you and that hasn 't been done in the last really year that I 've been neighborhood but isn 't it II can that 's and speaks to septic tanks I 'm sorry you say he can he 's nice pattern and especially do you think that 's the earth he came I don 't think they 've got the experience they need a qualified engineer okay to be please please I 'll just take one more from Pauline 's but are you saying that if if the cyclic maintained and operated correctly that they would suffice providing the they 've been put in to an engineer 's specifications there should be no problem whatsoever but thank you very much that 's incredibly helpful much appreciated making

do i havea you do or muckle it icky who had a mic auditory upon a teen ada notated go to Coto my name is yang I 'm here representing way to Aruna and all new coruña no data kilda cocaine as you unfortunately apologies i 've just come from ecuador being at the the one the awkward or wastewater hearing over and unfortunately the rest of that fine i was still there fighting the good fight over there regarding the harbour and our resources in the minguk I as you probably know awkward or Harbor has been a food basket for us for over sixty five generations the rival of rock a hoe to and from then on we 've been using a cord or the all other harbour and around the area there 's a as a food basket is our resource mahouka is very important to us it was part of the nine tall trees of the of the chi thao settlement and it is it is it is a treasure and it does has submission Mike Burke from from Christchurch City Council talked about 170 years of European wastewater going into the harbor I mean maybe I wouldn 't be acknowledging that and in my in my presentation if it were felt was me anyway and in nineteen sixty when the sewage awkward or sewage plant went on takapuna key one of the most likely Topham sites inside the harbor and in and in having four areas of sewage going into the harbor in takapuna key at devotions Tikal and winery itself over the over the years we have been trying to work with you the alcohol borough council then the bank sperm into district council and now the Christchurch City Council of trying to remove waste water out of the out of the harbor to Cold Bay you know that is a positive step that 's a tool and devotions we 're working on it hopefully we 've got we 've got a working party working on looking at using the Christchurch City Council golf course to move to anchored onto land and unfortunately what that 's why we 're in hearing at City Council want to put a 35-year consent on continuing putting wastewater into the into the harbor why no II so we thought we had to finish with winery we thought we 'd took that one off so stage one is you all know that got commissioned 2013 and now is stage one seat sea view lane is going in to land in winery the reason why you know we also support it was because there 's going to be a stage two even though stage two is not there 's no direct outfall and two why new into a little harbor from wainui but I don 't know if you know batches of been stayed over at winery and some of the septic tanks and even the the YMCA I mean that was hoping for the upgrade as well because even their septic tank is not not very good so there 's a lot of just concrete boxes so when it does rain and the soil and one thing that fights to see council talk about over there Matt at the moment with regarding land application as the soil of lot of rain and we can lot of rain events recently the water gets saturated the language saturated and water just runs off so even though why knowing the septic tax do leak and win a large storm events they overflow and they go into the harbor so that I mean it 's not a direct flow from the question city council infrastructure but the reason as I said the reason why we signed up for the whole process was stage 1 stage 2 was to get fecal coliforms out of the harbor we do not eat any bivalve shellfish from from the winery side anymore that includes cockles and also muscles because they filter feed and with filter feed with frequent calm contamination you get the norovirus there has been go from from also a knuckle or side my new eastside nor advice cases you know in the last summer even though that was in the summer when it should be less less rainfall going into the harbor so it doesn 't matter of course so a member and summer there 's more people staying at y no use of those septics and therefore with greater use it does flow in and in the winter with a further rainfall it does flow into the into the harbor so unfortunately for whatever that 's our side of the harbor when we come over we have tummy in and funeral and gatherings at the Moroi we get our eels from the lake but also we get chrome awana from from a coral harbour two weeks ago auntie gnome bunker who was not my auntie she lived it grew up in la puerta here y know she 's the one probably one of the main reasons why I 'm here just to carrying on her legacy for her tongue II it was unfortunately I because we really wanted to go and get some Chi from where she grew up but we couldn 't we had to go all the way over to the to the eastern Bay 's of the peninsula to get her to get a the climb wine to celebrate her 89 years of her life so to me that 's pretty I 've pretty devastated you know did there 's perceived priorities that 's my that 's my word in you know we 've had the earthquake there is a lot of pressure on the council no LeeAnn knowledge you for you know on the east side I live on the east side at the moment so I know what it I know what it 's like but you know I mean how much do I have when how much does environment go for cost for the environment that 's all I can say you know I looked at capital expenditure you know I mean people might think I 'm wrong here you 've got the coastal pathway you know 10 million 10 million on a footpath that 's my that 's my perspective where we 've got a call or harbor which has been a you know a food basket for ya for sixty five generations that we 've we have lived off and now you know it 's no I mean we just can 't_''_454.06 I mean that perceived idea of you know clean and green and I 'll tear or whether you can walk out can get power over there because it 's not a filter feeder I mean but even so you know you 're still a bit hesitant on gathering that kind of food and if you want to get a catch a fish I mean of people you talk about 30 years ago red cod you know straight off I me now you have to have a boat to get out outside the heads so doesn 't you know just proceed priorities capital expenditure I hope I plead that you stays in the 20 15 to 20 25 ltp you know we could say that goes out to the 20 18 and 20 to 20 20 18 20 28 you know who 's going to say in next year or in two years time you know you could be a new council perceived ideas that it gets bumped again you know and for me for buidlings flat as well that 's another area no no burdens flat we saw an agreement in 20 2008 between Christchurch City Council it can and us about looking at reticulated system in burdens flat and even Andrew knows this he 's been here in the the complaints about his constituents out on the peninsula that we just seem to be like the poor cousins keep getting bumped this was an opportunity for you know with the with the christchurch city planner melgen Aaron Bankston to Surrey County Council a plan that you know that the peninsula would be perceived as a jeweler how we see is a talker or what it is it 's a particle kayo duck I hope to raise the food basket of that 02 we live on it we get food off it if we can 't do that we can 't sustain our culture abilities on the mirai and our vironment all properties you know we say more tatto more more Cara Maria a moody a keen eye for us and our children after earth and Aztecs it 's yucky as the guardians to try and look after that those areas if we can 't carry on that what 's what 's the point we received here is there 's treaty partners here I don 't perceive myself as a stakeholder you know that was the children am i late oh we 're more on the ground the ground here you know the ones getting our hands dirty we 're the ones you know trying to feed them awry and feed our people and if we can 't do that why am I here I know you 've and with I mean with you earthquake you know it 's devastating and I think about that all the time you know cuz i was when i was running down the road and trying to pull people out of cars you know so I you know for a while I couldn 't get it flashed back so many things you know it was a tragedy but perform that how we had a chance to for me for the environment we had a we had a chance to do something special do something different in regards to the environment and looking after the environment you know stormwater discharges and those kind of areas I we haven 't seen to be able to got there in Christchurch City but you know still in winder we know feces mummy you Ryan out of the harbor on that side of the harbor because tikal by you 'll be out and actually put her onto land you know Papa tanuku is there she 's our deity of cleansing she helped cleanse you know we put it on the lam and but and it 's used by tightening my hotel the god of the forests it 's used by Papa tunica to cleanse and what time that water gets back into the harbor from at the top there it is cleanse it is is the water is pure again ready to be used the Modi has returned you know once you put I mean yesterday we tie new here one of our karma came out to it from Allah coop I said would you put waste water on your garden to grow your garden to eat question it would you would you put your wastewater from your toilet on to your garden to eat food and feed your family oh I probably wouldn 't so why do we put waste water in the harbor that we feed from you go and click every day well we could if we would you know because it used to be used to be that that was you know internet to go have a fridge because you had the harbor you just walk out and go and get a feed no data I 'll probably got more unfortunately as I said it came from Ecuador what Megan said that I might have the opportunity just to put a little supplement together so ready for your for your committee on Thursday next week so I 'll make sure that we do that once again apologies for not having the rissa far no here but we ready now our activities over a knuckle door for the rest of water hearing over there not at Athena will do they 're not cool do I fear not good to go to it gotta fill her and thank you very much for presentation and when councillors going to make this decision I guess we 've got so much money and in terms of the areas that are polluted you 'll be aware and I think it 's my like the oven and the heath get are seriously polluted and putting too awful awful pollution into our history so how how can we get a balance and two if you 've any suggestions how we can get a balance and two so the money we spend to clean up pollution around here estuary and our harbors well I mean I could say is before the earthquake this was this was already sitting this has already said you know they 're ready to go last June to get it signed off to the council and the council pulled the the the the terms of reference off the table because they perceived it was it going to cost too much too much money yeah i mean it is hard to go to it is hard to balance it 's not it 's not easy it 's not an easy question not a quiz an easy answer I mean it that the environment you know if I was know if i was to a hoodie sitting here i 'd be pleading pleading for the you know for the history and the rivers you will get it you know what what you know which is which has got greater greater value you probably is when you speak to the individual but I mean I do pedal on the on history i do paddle on the river but I do have lots of sanitizer when I do get off get off the off the river and I don 't paddle on it after a large rainstorm and I 'll make sure I do not flip in any way but you know I mean I 'm pleading cuz ya 'll my here for handy gnome occurred or harbor so I 'm talking about the values over there I cannot speak on behalf of my toyota t for the values of it who thi even though i do use it in pedal it i would love to see it cleaned up you know one thing is the sewage is out of you know i mean the main the main pipe is out of the air is you enter the into the harbor I mean adding to the unto the bite so the history does have a waste waters not flowing into it except from the broken pipes and the storm water issues in town yeah I remember being in a meeting I think next door and in Sierra and looking out and seeing the building on the corner pumping their their water out you know from the ground water out and where was a gun probably was going straight into the into the Haven yeah I mean no point you know point of source deal with it you know it 's not it 's not the rivers fault that you 're pumping groundwater out you know so there is point source issues more than you know so it 's at the point of source dealing with it they 're more the in by the time it gets to the history that 's my point yeah so I think that purpose of the question was really not to know I know you make choices but really to help you understand I know that the significance of the balance saying that we have to do around the table but look thank you very much and do pass on is fine that they 're not here I understand why there 's you know and and again can you pass on apologies for the oversight you know it 's one of those things that shouldn 't have happened but it did and we 're trying to make up for it as best that we can under the circumstances but we really appreciate and value your contribution this morning Gilda _"

    "text": "yes to present now you won 't have the submission in front of the counselors because we didn 't know oh you have you 've just had it handed out so we have your submission excellent as you can see it was very rushed thank you everyone my name is immaterial I 'm here representing the st. Albans residents association in the residents of all the residents of st. Albans I really wanted to i missed the real time so thank you very much for filling us in but i suppose i really want to actually sit here and first of all congratulate every single one of you sitting around the table i 'm one of those crazy people that like to read plans like to follow what 's going on see what 's happening and the change in the last couple of years from the last you know i probably say ten years is amazing so you 're obviously putting a huge amount of effort into making things happen in a different way and from our community thank you very much it 's great to see and I 'm in like what can 't wait to see how our community can work with council and build some great relationships so st. Norbert 's residents associations been around since 18 and 1896 and I 'll sorry eighteen eighty eighty six so it 's been around a long time and you 're talking about community governance models we have it I hear sane Auburn I hear New Brighton talking about having their local plans st. Aubin 's Residents Association went out in 2012 surveyed hours twenty-two thousand residents and we 've got a community plan from 2013 to 2023 has 20 projects and it that the residents in our area would like to see it happen we started on that and we really liked partnership with the council and some of those one of them includes again you 've had talked on it one of them includes getting the trend up to each we 're village so we 'd like to see their happen in the mouth next ten years and of course your budget issues our problem but our community probably has some ability to help there as well the on that Cranford 's on the cranford Street thing at the same time in that topic huge amount of effort was saying we did a two-hour presentation to the commissioners on that and which is why we sort of missed the long putting the effort into the long term plan so apologies but not that this is you know just as important so our sort of from the plane we see that st. Aubin 's Park has a million dollars budget on it but not told 18 19 20 that ground is needed now so if you could move that money forward and the budget perhaps that would be great to see that part being fixed so that our youngsters can be using it in the weekend for their local sports there 's one little bit of rain and I think they 'll be out the great see some money going into a bleep playground shame about the everly park paddling pool being closed again you know before any closures of what or anything of any community facilities be great to see people the council talking with the community first do we know our resources and perhaps some of these Kent things can be taken on by the community or helped by the community so you don 't have to be the whole brunt of the financial cost yourself community events don 't cut money in the community events really important for christchurch people we are all tired we 've all got down on ourselves every now and again there was just a report out in the newspaper the other day about New Zealanders not meeting enough me like 25 percent of us only meet socially once a month and it 's actually making us a very depressed nation so we don 't want to be a depressed nation we want to be excited about our our selves so keep up the community events they 're great find partners do more things that are grassroots that don 't cost money and again you 'll find out what those are by talking to the people in the community each we 're suburban master plan great or first of all and correctly named each we 're doesn 't exist really its rear of st. Albans but it 's great to see that happening and the 2.9 million dollars in their budgeted for the traffic improvements so yeah it 'd be great to see that that that work is focused on making it feel like a village at the moment you know the trench that the traffic rules their area and we great to see it become more of a village I just got here the Norn arterial take the money out of the budget put it into park-and-ride facilities in rail from the north of the city don 't be spending our money on citizens that don 't live here melvin park there 's whispers that there 's contracts being negotiated with canterbury rugby in regards to that park parts well used by our community one of our projects in our plan is actually to put a pathway around the outside because it 's very boggy during winter so that it can be used all year long and also to put in some fitness business of fitness equipment around there it 's a community project that council we 're working with the that 's a very well used community space and we would hate to be given over completely to some corporate group don 't don 't cut community funding you know christchurch price shoots people have for a long time put up council that wouldn 't listen to us we 've now got to cancel that 's listening to us put the money into those communities so they can do the work for you and they will you know you 've seen it the last two weeks there 's so many people here with great ideas and not just the ideas but actually the willingness to do those projects for themselves so keep up the community funding and support that is then the last thing I mean there is going back to our connection with the cranford Street project I believe that there they will have a huge impact of transport and our using our roads our cars using our roads in the area and I believe that the last renew Street the renewal so the last plan of the area for the transports looking at the transport actually in their traffic into our already congested area it would be pretty important to actually look at it what 's going on in the area so you actually know so it 'd be great to see a transport plan for the area for the whole area and for our little way streets that of course were a lot of them made for horses and carts because it 's how old they are so great to see that and also I 'd recommend that there 's a lot of people and I 've seen a couple year today excuse me of looking at individual streets and individual issues how about getting a street renewal program out so people actually know where they sit so they know if people know then often they 're a lot happier and the last thing I 'd like to mention is the st. Albans community center thank you very much for giving us the management back of that Center it 's made a huge difference already to our community and from being down there a lot recently connections are starting to happen community which has been absent for I see that there 's 3.2 million dollars in the budget for a new center I would like to see some discussion happen to see whether that 3.2 million dollars is actually necessary at the present time maybe that could be put back for the next 10 years in our communities putting another building themselves on there at the moment we 've got the Lions building and also there 's what we call the White House which is a building that the council bought before that earthquake to extend the community center that was there it 's still sitting there in community hair and council council-owned and could also just you know 50,000 100,000 be brought up to scratch while there we go we 've got we 've got our community we don 't need three 2.2 million dollars at the present time to provide what our community needs because it 's there so you know put that back put your 3.2 million dollars and something else roading perhaps learning programs and yeah we can help save some money there so yeah yep just think soon oh I 'm sorry 's well beyond the 10 minutes and I 'm sorry I can 't_''_610.06 you know this that was that was that was it was exceptional it was exceptional there were hundreds of submissions I know it was but ten minutes is all that 's allowed for submissions and continue to be vocal at other time no and look there 's no problem with it but thank you emma there are very knowledgeable counselors that we promised live to get away to phillips town and i know they want to go and to be back for our meeting this afternoon so appreciative thanks very much cheeky okay afternoon alright thanks very much so that 's the end of the hearings and so I will work to clear these meetings closed yep the meeting closed and once we 've got everyone cleared away will just quickly decide what time we 're going mate _"

    "text": "um and limps lenska now I 'm not I 'm not very good at pronuncia is it is it Rams rumba ramstein good thank you page 75 I wasn 't so tell me um hi everybody like you obviously my name 's lenska I 've only been under new brighton for a year I 'm actually a flight attendant so i only spent about seventy percent of my time at sorry twenty-five or thirty percent of my time at home teresa matters in australia so as lien has just pointed out i have put on my submission about the small free to charge barbecues and brisbane you 've got south bank of same time and time again we 've gone over there as crew we 've gone ahead barbecues there you just bring in international people or even families out into the area to enjoy because i haven 't spent a whole lot of time in South Brighton since I 've been there I 've really actually just come to support everyone that knows what they 're talking about who but as you can see there 's a huge amount just wanted to reiterate what I 've written on the back page we have an amazing area which has good bones it can be easily amplified with the support and the help from the Christchurch City Council it would be a great idea to invest in these areas rather than allocate the funds to entirely new projects you 've already got quite a bit of stuff going on there so if we can just keep the ball roll in there and you have a community that is already in full swing to improve the area so it can be done basically that was just what I wanted to reiterate of course I talked to lots of people that are coming internationally in to Christchurch they come into the city and they 're actually quite devastated by what they see however you can talk to them about all the projects that are happening in the central city to talk too much about New Brighton doesn 't really happen because they do sort of focus their area but again as Kathy probably said so to focus tourism into their area as well of stuff done and then we can be seeing people out there they 're not going through potholes they 're not feeling that I 'm tional connection I guess to what they 've watched about the earthquakes it 's going to stand in itself so that 's kind of comes back down to that the jewel of Christchurch of working yeah well I 've just done I 've done a lot of reading obviously since the earthquakes happened and came across something called asset-based Community Development it 's easy to remember because it 's a b c d and jim diaz and Joe McKnight have sort of kind of proponents of this of this idea which is that instead of looking at things from a needs space you look at what are the assets that are already there and you build on those and when you look at you brighten you can really see what the assets are I mean it 's easy to identify problems it 's much easier to start with what are the assets and how do you strengthen those because I mean one day I mean someone the other day you know that photographs of overflowing rubbish buns and it 's the council 's fault not the people that rubbish into a bum that was already full so one and I said that there are some parks that I 've seen in other parts of the country and overseas who don 't have rubbished buns they just have a sign that say don 't leave any rubbish behind you know and they get people to take their rubbish away and when I repeated this to someone on your brush and they said we 'll get there we 'll get to the point where we will be able to trust people to do there but in the meantime we 're going to have to find a way of making those rubbish tins effective and actually provide recycling facilities yes it is a real site clean there 's a massive thing that you see everywhere and it works quite well I think exactly so our pool and then Glenn they see the mirror was quite right though I had done a bit of research around rubbish Tim 's my bro 's create casters here to use them with your travels and stuff and in my view but I to hear your point do you think that christ church has just forgotten that actually as a beachside city yeah definitely I don 't think there 's any direction anywhere apart from maybe a few local businesses that try and send people out that way and you have people that would go out there and they 're like oh it 's like we 're back in the sixties or sup you know it just hasn 't traveled forward from that time it used to be amazing that you know you see all that sort of thing it was amazing to get the library and all that area up and running but it still hasn 't connected properly lots of people that I 've seen in the library and sent they just go in there and sit in there they 're traveling as well it 's a great hub for them to go to so that 's a great asset as well as the beach but you and I don 't the city and then they 'll cruise over to the west coast see all that beauty over there go down to Queens down flow that again some of us to do with the travel to though to those natural assets and we don 't have very good travel to those natural message yet to go through like it I think Gary water all over speed home Amina when are you going to summer Walter New Brighton yeah there 's like a quick speed all the way there and summer salsa to do with Simon John how to get there unless you feel feeling like you 're going on a journey somewhere okay so if you go through the wilderness and I think that trip to Brighton is sometimes you go through a wilderness nothing and it says he 's creating something on the way so you actually feel like you 're tripping send me yeah definitely yeah I think again like it just comes down to let 's just have some ice roads that people can drive on and their rental cars if they 're going to go out there to those areas I mean that 's something to build on gradually like obviously you can 't just put it in there now one 's going to go it 's not going to be sustainable but definitely I think that there is potential to have that that visitors coming in will know about their area and they 'll actually go to their area as well for crash it thank you Glen think thank you let 's go for highlighting how different obviously coastal communities are ya so in terms of rubbish bins we 've had a very good offer we 've my we 've also realized that if you use the same rubbish turns throughout the city it doesn 't work the coastal communities you 've got wind seagulls and people like to be on the beach they take bishop papers so I think you know our community board can look at that offer at least it 's been put towards it and come up something different if you have the same bins throughout the city it 'll work in some places but it won 't work and you will ones that are sort of about lowering I 've just gotta the hole in the middle and kind of see them along in Australia they 'll always be a recycle and then a rubbish and you if you 're just putting it into the bend then rather than him in this top button and then trying to put it as just like it literally a small hole you can actually fit too much stuff so people would have to take that stuff away and I think I have seen a lot of the community taking responsibility for the rubbish that may be overflowing and taking it back to their homes or walking along the beach and seeing that it 's more visitors that have come in I don 't know from the other side of this well no could it could be everyone I 'm not gonna I 'm not saying that as international but you know people are just going to come after travelling with five kids and they 're going to go back to the other side of the city they don 't necessarily have the road take always necessary to have you know like you say a really good system there I know don 't know what that is you guys probably know but he doesn 't like my views are just from you know sort of what I 've seen but like I said I didn 't really prepare anything cuz I 'm away all the time and I just wanted to know you are you your new new broad near New Brighton so enjoy I think citysearch so I 've sif all over so from corridor the Caitlin 's all the East Coast yes you go to tomorrow they 've really invested and Caroline beau beautiful and I mean if you want to cold easterly you 're gonna get out of the water and coke or the Catlins that apart from the refreshing water temperature but why is it do you think that Christchurch week as everyone focuses on the easterly which no one else and Dunedin got it omorrow you okay anywhere why is it that Christchurch sees this is so that 's just something that everyone talks about which is in a sense I haven 't noticed it because I say I 'll go away for five days I 'll be at home for two days I love it I love being there even if it is blowing a gale I 'm from Wellington so no problem to me yeah it 's a light breeze and and you know like I 've lived over and fox glacier for a few years of being in tourism over there as well you know I 've sort of been all around I love living out there i 'm down the South frightened so i would like to see you know some of these things not just being at North Brandon it 's nice to be down south Brighton because it 's nice and quiet not as many people go there but it would be nice that there was more of a draw for you know people to come down there if they wanted I mean all summer when I 've come home there 's been cars all lined up right down Marine Parade yeah kitesurfing you know people are coming from other places there so just much you so much thank you thank you so that 's the that 's the kind of end of the of the New Brighton group and I 'm mindful of the fact that Emma came in this morning and through a miscommunication I thought that she had presented when she came up here so she wants to quickly present probably the cinnabuns group sorry I 'm trying to read yes sir Norman 's residents association submission I mean some of the issues have already been raised by others but if you want to quickly come forward and just cover that off and while you 're coming forward I 'll just say thank you to everyone who spoke you weren 't really just speaking for yourselves I think you 're speaking for the hundreds of submissions that we have received I think that what 's happened today is that even though we haven 't had the numbers this has been much more engaged there 's been time for questions people have had been able to feedback and bounce ideas and I think that 's a much more constructive way to have but you know that this is this has been much better than just the quick five minutes and and no opportunity to engage and that 's why I 'm actually really pleased with the the numbers of you are here today because you 've actually traversed all of the issues and you 've presented really well for your community so there is no question that this council was going to be reporting back an LTP that will make sure that new brighton has the capacity to be the legacy project for Christ yet so thank you very very much and even if I could hand over to you now _"

    "text": "Katherine Baker 115 sorry I was just going to keep that to myself met a man met him formal in you madam city councilors community board members I 've been to dab it on my arm submission sorry and the end I 'm terribly sorry if people have been getting at you we know your heart is on the east and I personally appreciate everything that you do or try to do for us and I think probably most of the people in New Brighton do to thank you sorry thank you I much appreciate this opportunity to speak today and apologize for my husband Ken Baker who is on location photographing today so he can 't be here I kind of want to look at the international potential of the coastline in Brighton in eastery areas sorry this is more a positive submission than a negative one the council has a lot that it has to deal with and we appreciate that you have very difficult budgets so keen and I have come up with a small solution for part of our area we have lived in Keys road we didn 't appreciate the uniqueness of the area we are passionate about it it is absolutely stunning thank you also for informing me that you 've had discussions with the rafti golf course and that that the stage may not close very much appreciate that it is our understanding this is the only links course on a Christchurch and also the only 18 hole public course it will become a wonderful asset for the new high schools too we live over the road from rafferty golf course and the main park we are often woken the newly morning by the threat of golf clubs on golf balls and no it as a match loved induced facility apparently it has lost money but perhaps that is more to do with management then the number of people who have been using the course and not paying the fees since we moved over the road from rafti domain we 've watched its deterioration over the last 13 years the earthquakes can 't_''_168.68 be blamed for this because there was very little damaged course to it trees have been removed but have not left to rot by the council toilets have not been cleaned on a regular basis toilet paper has not been replaced nor has there been any liquid soap I haven 't checked recently to see if the sump has improved but in the domain area there is a picnic table a child 's playground in these toilets and a dyani toilets that they can use I used to take my grandchildren to the toilet behind the bushes because I certainly wouldn 't let them go anywhere near the toilets because they smelled and we 're really quite disgusting my husband and I are keen to upgrade in beautify Rafferty with new plantings and has spoken to locals who are really enthusiastic about our idea and who would be keen to help we would like to form a guardians of Rafferty domain to beautify the area in form an alliance with the council whereby we supply the labor for the upkeep of the garden plots and the council supplies the irrigation scheme in the moment the sputum occation could also extend to the golf course as well we 're quite happy 's been discussion about some buildings some social housing well that housing is already there we have thought that perhaps if fruit trees were planted around the outsides of these houses it would make it a much much nicer environment for the people who are living there at the moment and the in perhaps once the emergency housing is no longer needed then that could be perhaps a social housing area because everything 's there you may not be aware but bees have disappeared from our area because there are very few flowering shrubs or flowers most of the plantings over the years have been natives flexors and grasses and many natives do not attract the bees locals who grow vegetables and fruit have had difficulty this year because the bees didn 't arrive and the numbers to fertilize the fruit trees and vegetables like beans and peas there are thousands of camellias and rhododendrons roses and other flowering shrubs in the red zone so we hope Sarah would allow us to transfer a few of them into some beautifying garden beds there is a free supply of horse manure to be a little like Everly park where families can come in picnic and spend time by doing this rather he would become a welcoming friendly place to picnic or have a wedding if you build a little gazebo that could be a revenue earner for the council of weddings were held there the flowers would also provide nectar for the monarchs who winter over in rafferty there is huge passion and pride and the people who live along the east coast line it is the ultimate lifestyle and they have bought onto it there is a wonderful sense of community that you don 't get anywhere else in the city the majority of the residents are owner-occupiers they love living in the East for that lifestyle but for those who live on the outside the East is actually warmer so the easterly doesn 't affect us as much as it does you the coastline could be the jewel in the crown for the christchurch as it offers so much more to people and leisure activities in the rest of the city combined it could become a fantastic environmental tourist redzone green space and perhaps we could patch up somehow with my Tahu I walk on the beach regularly and speak to people who are walking I always ask them if they are locals there are honest from spreadin surely burnside record on pendleton wealth and Pepa nori redwood kashmir barnwell valley you bring their dogs here and even a walking group from sumner who come to our beaches because they don 't have the expense of beach for walking that we have none of them can understand why the council has allowed the deterioration of our area but more to the point I 've kept a tally over the last month of internationals it has amazed me Sydney Perth Adelaide London Liverpool California Texas Sweden Germany Belgium Canada New York South Africa France Korea Japan India they love the unspoiled expense of beach and dunes I tell them about the salt marshes the spit and the history and the trev 's wetlands which they know nothing about and want to go and see I tell them about the godwits which fly from alaska every year and they are amazed is what they call it where is the tourism information center there isn 't one I seen people to the library but that information is limited there it beggars belief that the council has ignored this incredibly natural rich area for so long and let it rot sumner is getting double spent on it and the ltp well currently from my statistics here with where we have three times the population and you have nearly four times the rate take from our new brighton area then you do from the Summoner monks bay area this discrepancy I don 't really think as fear I don 't get it I simply don 't understand the Edit read that has been in the council for year and years and years there is so much tourism potential here for the natural and eco environmental areas there are not many cities left with a coastline as in its natural form and hasn 't been tampered with like the rest of the city we pay rates that as time they were spent in our area I plead with you to take off your blinkers and beg you to start to remedy the dereliction of duty that you have displayed for so long thank you thank you it was a right royal telling off well I think there was some positive things in there too yes no did was and you know I think that sometimes it 's not helpful to look at how much is on a budget after an earthquake when you know in areas lost a lot of facilities like someone lost their library that all Seth yeah you know so they 've lost council facilities yes our library stood up very well now say that it Jason Mel was one of the reasons why yes so you know I think that sometimes it 's not helpful to make comparisons with other areas in that regard but you started off with a you know a patient about in a description about what you could do to bring the bees back for example one and you reference which which park is it annually Emily yeah Edna that 's that 's a local community easy to have taken that over that you know would you bringing together a group they 're actually do that yeah that 's what we want to do I 've spoken to lots of locals and they go yeah that 's fantastic it 's the period they have the elder network they 've got a mess of network of people there there are people who are living in smaller houses now because I 've got older who would probably love to do a bit of gardening yeah we want to make it into a really beautiful area it could be it could it could just be beautiful your people to be able to picnic had some picnic tables it would be lovely it could be like a barbecue you anything I 've just if I said that to the chief executive tralia they have quite a BBQ yes you know yeah at albert park my daughters lived in st. kilda road and we used to go to albert park and they have the barbecue areas fear where you pay for the gas and that 's fine and i bought all the wash-up facilities and it 's brilliant it 's really really too so you can get a bunch of families and say hey we 'll go to ralphs a team we have a barbecue because sometimes if the wind is blowing very strongly on the beach it 's not conducive to having family picnics on the beach because the sand is blowing yeah look I just I mean she could just going to take your submission as an offer yes it is and yeah I believe that we will find a way of accepting that offer right yeah that 'd be brilliant Yankees so much thank you very very good hey thank you thank you _"

    "text": "um Christopher Folsom page 269 hi welcome million counselors ladies gentlemen good morning thank you for the opportunity to present my submission a couple of years ago my youngest son fell down a storm water drain in New Brighton the irony was he was helping remove a wooden crate which we erroneously thought vandals had left but it was actually a makeshift cover for the drain I reported this immediately to the City Council however it took two days before anything was done I believe this is an indication of the neglect that the then said he canceled projected towards her suburban if we forward on two years later Paula Zahn and delivers an excellent speech to the City Council which only four members attend we 're a community of passionate people who have been through a lot of adversity in the last four years and we need the support of the City Council the last City Council sadly consisted of cowboys in my opinion but believe we have good people on the current city council of course I understand your hands are tied not necessarily by wiser higher powers the reality is that much of the council 's budget has been allocated to other districts than it has to New Brighton to areas of smaller populations but with larger per capita allocations moreover the payment from the qe2 has gone to other parts of the city and I agree with mr. Shannon when he calls this asset stripping if I want to take my kids to a pool I have the choice of travelling several several kilometers north or south to do so I think this is unacceptable he break needs a pool like the saltwater pool which was promised but hasn 't yet come to fruition the great people of this area have achieved so much over the last year the course the caused the rockabilly ball design competition to name a few all of this has been driven by a passion and a concern for the area we 're well aware of the little paint jobs and effects up the crack in the small driveway and the less of affected areas of the city and of the disdain held by small-minded people towards our beautiful home we living on a gorgeous coastline we have so much to offer not just the city of christchurch but to overseas visitors also we 've got plans and dreams that will make this area the jewel in the crown of the city but we need the support of the City Council every step of the way with every citizen behind us cynical disregard and narrow-minded snow buddy have got no place here I 'm not the only resident of New Brighton who 's calling out to all who live in the city to support as an orange the City Council to work with us we can build something Christchurch will be truly proud of and will last for generations to come and God noise we need that no more than ever so I came here today to ask the City Council to support a new brighton get involved with us and work with us and might be the best thing you ever do thank you for listening my submission I think that there 's a unanimous support for that around the table Glen in yani thank you very much for your coast to coast finish line to New Brighton we had a conversation and he said it new brighton will now become part of the coast to coast story and i said yes from the independent side of the west coast to the independent republic of new brighton and we both laughed and what do you it becomes a Facebook page anyway I think reading through all these submissions is a clear recognition that this is actually a jewel in the crown which is undiscovered and that is that what you 're saying to us that 's exactly what I 'm saying yes yonni thank you um thank you for your submission and you know apologies for the council 's who were doing we were actually doing a bomb to and plan presentation so we couldn 't be there so but we did pass on our apologies and unfortunately things do get doubled watch from time to time but there wasn 't because we weren 't interested and I 'm I mean I just speak for Paul them with myself on that point but we 've heard through the week you spend more money and get to churn during the figure eight in the central city and as I 've heard people come and talk from you brighten about or from those eastern suburbs that the poor quality of the roads how you know that increased cost for cars and transport and the lack of access and the need for a connection I wonder whether we should be thinking about something via Bertram going from the central city our two new brighton again whether that would be something that would try and help i guess just provide that greater sense of connection and deal with some of those alternative transport issues we 've also good things that the bus is no longer service seven communities up there they are nothing nothing that 's a very good point if you 've actually tried to get out and you brighten this present moment in time pages road is one way Dyer rod is dire to try and get onto because rush hour it 's almost impossible which leaves wine or knee road which have our ironically Kate titled the highway to help because you right in route so I think that 's a very good point I 'm really not sure about light rail I think why not put that out there to the community see what the goddess here but it she was support we 've got for it see if we can run with it yep any other questions hmm okay look thank you very much and thank you for thanks for your shipment as usual thank you _"

    "text": "thank you and Jason Mel thank you for everything you 've been going down there as well I know that I 've mentioned Paul a lot but you 're another one of the name she is one of many secure to Meerut delzell in other counselors this quick introduction to Who I am I 've met most of you but it 's a few faces I haven 't_''_33.39 met before my name is Jason mill I 've been an architect in working in the construction industry in the study for about 30 years I page 217 everyone sorry 20 years of that I 've been the director of my own architecture company and for the last 12 years we 've been running a 3d startup it 's got very involved since the earthquake we 've clients such as Google Trumbull Sarah in city council also since the earthquake I 've got quite involved and the background of many groups is Ian said I was the founding chair of the transitional movement which you 've seen us support festivals I fester and laxity we supported get fella where we can I and I on a lot of community groups I support the Christchurch circus trust which is successfully moved into the arts center and year where we can we we work away in the background making things happen my architecture company we have a reputation for adaptive reuse in a long history of seismic strengthening so I 'm very proud that everyone walked out of my buildings and the earthquake as an architect on the day it was very tough to know that some of my buildings might have fallen down especially a school so yeah I could quite happily retire now and be happy with the work I 've done early days were working for Antony golf we were part architecture team that created the strip work on casual mall and then we quietly worked their way into the fashion district of high street a lot of the laneways we also adapt that a lot of commercial buildings to residential two officers etc and all the time the earthquake strengthened Anthony golf taught me early on that it 's an investment not an expense and it seems very obvious now time air works been published internationally I 've spoken internationally in 2006 eyes known makes at 25 most innovative young architects in the world which very proud of even though we work away quietly in Christchurch we seem to be known better out of town than we aren 't here and a lot of the innovation has sprung Lee our second company Zeno which we are 3d digital company where world leaders in 3 DG 0 which what Google started we were in the red zone 10 days after the earthquake and almost lived there for two years we took 3d data of the entire red zone we also salvaged many businesses and help them get back on their feet we were also embedded in the government 108 blueprint process we supplied the authoritative 3d data set of where the demolition status was at and then we worked with in Taylor to produce the bells and whistle video that you saw on launch night we also work with Sarah on creating firstly the amazing places and display showcase and that later involved into what 's now known as future Christchurch staff those units I spend a lot of hours and then myself we have spoken to almost a hundred thousand Christchurch people and we 've offered them an immersive an immersive look at their future and to be honest we spend more time less than than we do telling and we see that the the level of knowledge and the community was often higher and often more relevant than the experts we were working with and I 've heard that term bandied around by a lot of people but to me I see it in my community I see that expertise and we 've been out there talking many people have said that my knowledge is second to none on the rebill and I could give some detail of the sunless of the blueprint and some of the things that went on there but I 'm still under nondisclosure agreements and coding convert sweeter they cut off for another two weeks really okay yes I instead i 'm here to talk about in my community that i live in and sincere quake of of work done Denise and I and 've built a home there and as I said we know run a business there my written submission was very simple I didn 't scrub those words but there 's a lot and they were scripted by Easter and a few locals but there 's a lot of words he that pulls on an honor I 've been banging around for a long time and I so I 'll quickly read the ones that I think her report and one to me just back up my background we were commissioned early by the pool and the persons and landowners alongside eastern division AV node carry to review the council 's master plan for New Brighton we were very concerned early on that the staff didn 't have the mandate to look beyond the CBD so there was a dotted line around the CBD they could not look at the foreshore they could not look at the beach the forest the river and other natural assets and they couldn 't look at the red zone and the potential of what we could look at there so we were lucky that we myself able to work with even Paul and a lot of the other silver and a lot of the other community groups and say what is this holistic picture and I think Paul Sonnen 's articulated that better than I could so I 'll leave it with them but we work very hard with the crusher city staff and I commend them for the master plan that they put out there was a lot of sort of read hearings and other distractions at the time but I must have met there 's some good solid work in there and what can be done under the the council 's lean and the council 's things there 's a lot of private assumptions that were made but must design and in the community are getting on that so in my mind the outcome of the master plan provide a solid basis that both the public and private sectors can rebuild on to further enhance what I see is a city SEO which is this key activity center of Brighton so very quickly my submission now some of these aren 't relevant and to the closure of the south broad and camping ground and the closure of the Rafferty golf course and I commend the council on the process it 's been put in place for the expressions of interest and the direct dealing with Rafferty I take to the lack of funding for the repair of the pages road bridge and we 've heard a bit of explanation on the red zone things that go there but I feel that 's important let investment and public spaces and the new zealand new zealand loop right in pedestrian mall and object the decreased operational budget for baseline maintenance and we 've had a number of people in the public some of the habitual users that walk the beach every day have told us of their decline and in the LTP I wish to support the following funding allocations the funding for the development of the foreshore play space again there seems to be two separate silos and the council working on the master plan and that 's for sure so again I would like to see that combined I wish to see further this is the big one etiquette and appropriate funding support to support the Christchurch City Council New Brighton master plans and the outcomes to date from the community consultation and the care groups their projects ready to go but two million dollars purely for the land isn 't going to get us anywhere it 's going to hold things funding allocation for the new zealand new zealand new brighton or could be new zealand legacy party project this stage it 's a hot salt water pools I won 't comment further on that but it 's been an interesting process and I 'll speak very quickly to that in funding allocation for highly used public amenities and services such as the beachside toilets the seagull resistant rubbish benzac suture I was a junior draftsman on the brighton pier for andrew barclay was my first graduate job and some my jobs were the circles and the pier and the influence would got over the tsunami risk the toilets which there was no budget for those so that 's why there are concrete cell blocks but it 's quite amazing I can 't changed they haven 't been damaged to bed so we were more funding to finish that job would be good but in general the building works very very well its world class and I was proud to do the few little details that I bet on it and then adequate funding for community groups I know that and the LTP has tweaked up but years we 've been exposed to community groups and bright and more than ever in my life and especially when they 're working together they 're doing great things and then a small one appropriate signage for wayfinding and Brighton and I list out my my personal vision for booooored Pegasus and more specifically Brighton as a village in the natural water park that we reviewed the water park scheme that was put forward for Brighton and my final feeling on that was we didn 't need a water park in new brighton we want a new brighton to be a village and a water park before its natural assets around it and i think they 're thinking has come to the floor and we a safe friendly family a safe family-friendly environment we are changing there 's a lot of single people leaving the village and families are moving in as a demographic change a place where residents individuals and families could have in needs met locally the doctors aren 't leaving the doctors have got busier the clubs have got busier you brought in rugby club is the biggest junior subscription in the city and is getting bigger embedding Sport and Recreation hub for the city we are a recreational Wonderland where we are I bike surf cycle during my work days I take a lap around that frost lunchtime it 's not quite warm enough to surf at the moment but if i can i will a green area with a focus on the environment and Environment Protection a venue for international quality events a place where the city comes to play they do already they just don 't spend any money because they can do it for free and a destination at the end of this recreational corridor we have to work on I just want to finish not with my users like Joe Gowans who walks the beach every day from 93 year old Margaret has been there her whole life mark gibson homeish and gene have got businesses in our village can money and a group from north brighton and their promenade and Paul owners just spoken first you want to congratulate City Council on this long-term patent process in the transparency I 've been working a week and watching this online and I watched the broken ones but then I kept it running and watched everyone else 's as well and it 's very interesting across the wards very similar problems between wards and the more scrapping within themselves for the money so I 'm wondering if that can be looked at over the city rather than in these silos and a few words have taken out of their online stuff over the week of course pulls Annan on the first day can 't_''_738.36 approach these projects in isolation and I come in raft for getting on border from on Monday and coming out and speaking with some of the people out there and he 's done a there is a strategic plan their of iterative work to get the village we don 't need a white knight we just need to plug away at some interesting talk from hagley ferry meet who some of you have seen on facebook up in critical of some of the funds they have got it was interesting at one of the first things was that we have to be see a credible equal access to funds across woods and that we can 't forget communities that have nothing to start with and that 's not from our ward we heard a great talk from Eleanor bodger and John saying that there 's been no mess depopulation of their area we 've got busier every clubs got busier the doctors haven 't gone the doctors our fault we heard their daughter Esther tell us about how the cross generational families in the area Phil and I love the way that she said New Brighton has one is it that no amount of assets tripping closures or minute retreat will take away and that 's the ocean her father then told us that beside an ocean and a nation surrounded by ocean so it 's very important to us in a way we love yesterday we had even Smith and George from Eastern vision and they told us that we need to listen to the community but also to the environment and there 's a real screaming going on out there from our environment we need to listen to and I loved his idea especially in Brighton of an Adeptus adaptive in phobia City this idea of transitional I want to see that move them to both our communities and also in this handover period from the people who have been working for to the people I hope I 'm soon going to be with people in our X mere Gary Moore he 's always full of good advice he said don 't let the red zone be the judder bar to the yeast now I thought that was very good and until the government decide what they 're going to do and we have this consultation or whether you guys take it off them so you can do it properly don 't make the East your capital project and just maintain the West but sundress and I go to that side of town quite often the two weeks after the earthquake I had to go to that side of town defects a generator we had running most of our neighborhood and everyone has shared and smoothes and smelt good i still haven 't shaved since the earthquake and finally in my own words I 'm interested in what this development authority is going to be and I think you LeAnn for giving us funds for a legacy project but I just like to say that we don 't need a legacy project imposed upon us a new brighton and that when you need new brighton to become your legacy project very simple thank you think was very much there was he said it 's time for a couple of questions but yeah just Jimmy and soul okay Jason might ask you two questions the first one you because you have the kind of for the new brighton and easter area the regency to belong temperature your waist in relation to the budget for for the next 10 years so 1.2 billion dollars regarding to all those the project and do you have any the kind of timeframe which wise like it has to be you know algebra need to have which one is nice to have we can t for for several years even outside of 10 years do you have any other priority second question is the earlier one of lady is a civil she particularly recommend maybe partnership between a community in the council you know because allison can save the money and improve can become conversation and also is more kind of poster effective for harness older have for energy sheer is particular shield responsibility why is your point of view read this one thanks Jimmy good questions fiercely budgets I found it really interesting watching the wards all scraped within themselves with their own little budgets and yeah I see similarities we 've all got master plans across the different ward and I see some disparity in the spending there but by the sort of polarizing of each Ward that doesn 't seem to be looked at but to see go through as the master plan and I suggest finishing the master plan could be a legacy for the council because there 's been three that haven 't been finished the money for it if I was going to take money and even Smurfs going to hate me for this I would take it out of the AV node akari cycle trail now I 'm a love cycling and of commuted to the city since we 've moved to broaden for 13 years but pages road is the best commuting street and Christchurch you can see the city the whole way it 's a straight line I don 't want to be in the through the red zone to get to commute its effects pages road take that 28 million dollars and dirt summer us and also the best cycle tracks in the world are made by the public the joint together of little habitual cycle tracks that people use and ref side there are voluntary crowdsourcing I can guarantee that cycle tracks will be made by cycle enthusiasts and a lot of them will just be joining box and share an idea and all these other things but a lot of the time I feel it 's people tick in the box because I want the person in car in front to go cycling they 're not going to do it himself and those figures have been proven by Simon canyon at the University so although I 'm a cyclist and evens going to hate me for this I would repulse in that cycle money and again ten years the tracks will form themselves in 10 years and through through that red zone and it 's not your land yet no got online secondly the partnership totally agree my end even the master plan has been a real partnership between your staff and our community groups and there 's been some really solid work done there I 've had to stand up in front of the community and back up your plan and there 's parts of it that I found were valid and I got it in the face from the local mafia or etc but those conversations have been here and I think you brighten to in partnership with ya and Phil thank you Jason I mean I would ask you a question some of what I asked a Stephen Smith yesterday the wars and if we take into account changes you refer to the ocean changes not only with the ocean but in terms of our land to in their environment and future sea-level change and also increase storms and possibility of tsunamis hell should we as a council don 't get that balance right for investment and things like flood protection along the coast with right currently what we should do now how can we have that sort of aligned with our long-term strategy around dealing with those those those chain those environmental changes or if you two centuries me mention even i quoted before you 've referred to an info BS city and coming from the transitional movement I think we need those sort of rather than a fixed Dutch type seawall type thing you know floods are knowing we know floods coming and if you know there 's places overseas half the world 's under sea level most of the city or build so that we can repair we 're now doing post-earthquake we 're building our houses so that they can be repaired floods are easy get everything out of the water let it come and let it go out clean it up and get back in you all your ground floors could be you know concrete so that they can flood and flow out again you know putting there 's a mark or we won 't open a cafe and Brighton that has the sea level mark on and so you know don 't leave children or cell phones below there 's high in case of a flood we know fads are coming earthquakes we don 't floods we do so let 's be agile let 's have the sort of transitional in phobia city that we can move in the next fifty hundred years when we know what the environment is going to do but you know look at the dunes they rise with the sea level and that 's happening the dunes have been getting bigger the higher the sea level gets the more sand will be that 's been proven by you can proven by the local guides you know that area I 've seen the dunes grow so yeah let 's be flexible and see what the environment teaches us thank you very much and I just love the way to you ended your submission let 's make you brighten the legacy project for the city is a challenge the end yep we 're a pro we 're up for it thank you very very much _"

    "text": "cream do you want to come forward 322 sorry hi everyone my name is Corrine Bolstad I love in North new brighton where I 've loved since the 30th of July 2010 and I grow up an iced of christ church not far from here I wanted to start by thanking all of you for the opportunity to present this morning and it 's obviously thanks Lee in for your passion my presentation will be quite brief because I 'm in a way reiterating and the points that have already been made and Russian in oral submissions I am one of the trustees of renew Brighton so also support Sylvia 's submission the the main point of my personal submission is just to reiterate I think that you 're all aware our community is incredibly active and engaged the Greater New Brighton community and we 've demonstrated through many projects that we are willing to roll up our sleeves and get on with helping ourselves so what we ask of you is to have conversations I know is gleams just mentioned there are all sorts of rules there everyday people to do things about perhaps it 's a time to open up those conversations and find out what the opportunities are those of us in our community have a fantastic vision for our future and we 're very committed to making that happen I think if we can partner with council in other agencies in achieving we have so much to offer our city and we have an incredible lifestyle value we 're an open and friendly and supportive community and we are a massive resource for the city and what we can offer people whether it 's just an escape from the weekday work life and the value of nature that 's all around us so that 's all I have to say thank you David just to comment more than a question sorry Vicki I think it 's very encouraging we 've heard it not only from from people in New Brighton but across the city this this desire to for us to help people in the community help themselves that 's coming through in a number of areas and it really is encouraging I think that 's submissions sort of saying look we 're not here to ask you to repair our GT for us we 're here to get you to help us repair our GD which is what we 're committed to doing you know and that 's completely different frame and it 's like the gym Diaz model that they were talking about before you know the you know the community neighborhood matching funds you know where people bring their talents and their ideas and their energy and their passion to the project and the you know the council can throw in some some expertise from its departments and and also some financial support so expertise from the council expertise from the community combined to get way more than anything else bill Thank You Kareem I just something I think about as you were talking about and other people referred to this to having a partnership with council and it 's just how that actually can work like if we see the two partnership as like a relationship a personal relationship the aim is that that 'd be a neat that partnership be based as a council you 've got all this power and I guess the bottom line in terms of long-term plan is the funding and there 's only so much so if you 've got any sort of ideas just want a few building ideas about how in fact we we as a council can work with people like you in other communities and New Brighton so in fact we have as equal a partnership as possible thanks for that 's a great question actually I think it 's true that the council has a lot of power and in terms of being the traditional body that managers infrastructure and resources and maintenance of those things I think the community has incredible power in our energy and engagement and their access to the skills and wisdom and resources that we 've got some of the one of the examples that just occurred to me while you 're asking the question which is a very small thing and but we had an event I wasn 't involved in organizing there so I was just one of the people that enjoyed it but make some quick changes to a car park so some older cars could get in there to be on display and people put their hands up in people with contacting businesses came in and made that happen so even if it comes down to the cracks in the footpath or you know these kind of basic infrastructure things there is an incredible power in our community so I think it 's just a matter of changing perceptions about how the relationship between our governing body and asses members of the community works and to look at what we do have to offer and how those things can be brought together do you think it would be worthwhile for us to for example to I mean I know no it was in one of the submissions that i read that we should resource the new brighton business and landowners owners association so that they can actually be that sort of kind of conduit for bringing the community together to prioritize projects like that i absolutely think that 's one of the organizations that and that could be resourced definitely it 's organization that already has influence and power in the respect and bayern of members of the community so that 's a really great idea I 've sit in my written submission please help us by communicating openly with us about our needs and about the council 's needs we understand there 's a limit of funding there are countless examples throughout the world whether it comes to risk management or just management of facilities and infrastructure we you can educate a community about the decisions that need to be made and empower them to make their own decision so that 's the kind of thing we ask from a partnership with the council yani thank you for submission in the key points a lot of people have talked about felt capital facilities like swimming pools recreation centers it occurs to me that we 've never asked the community to be involved in the discussion about the infrastructure appears in terms of priorities or even how the infrastructure is repaired to what standard or two to what kind of skype in terms of sustainability or environmentally friendly design or or even gap in the whole conversation but it be in New Brighton in those areas that you 're talking about around us actually communicating openly around the infrastructure choices that we have to move thank you for the question because that 's exactly the kind of matter that we are addressing and I understand you can only achieve so much in a period of time but but certainly I think if there was a meaningful way that you could consult with us about our priorities for the infrastructure rebuild yeah I mean I think I think the community would probably be interested in saying you know we need the pages road bridge to be prioritized over you know for example something else people like the earlier presenter talked about new brush and road if we can 't that what are the other options how can we help them you know and the era works about to come up just just you know really close to where the earlier presenter loves and that may make life a lot difficult for the people who are living in Palmer 's road in Baker Street how are they going to get in and out of your homes and we 're closing off another road that 's on the other side of New Brighton Road win that 's flooded you know so yeah that would be fantastic if we could have those kind of conversations and and put into the prioritization of infrastructure appear the last question that I 've got us as going back to this concept of transition do you think that the community understands the importance of submitting on the transition recovery plan because I mean I there won 't be any sort of kind of public sort of view of it I mean it 's all being talked about that it 's being developed but you know how are we going to be able to I mean there will be something that will be open for a very short period of time probably just about a month you know how can we generate the enthusiasm again that you 've managed to generate on the LTP to make sure central government knows that the East can 't_''_599.34 be forgotten either I think that with the example of hair and some fantastic people and have managed to get together and mobilize us to present and to submit on the LTP I think we can hopefully achieve the same kind of input into that it 's a thanks for raising it thank you very much ok and

    "text": "come for it I 'll smile sorry yeah I 'm sorry my brain is not working kill me everyone and thank you so much for the opportunity it 's really extraordinary for me to sit here with all of you it 's quite overwhelming really i work at renew brighton we 're a community grew up a new brighton that brings all adverts in bracken together we try and lead and encourage collaborative projects in the area i also used to work as a strengthening communities advisor for council so i guess i 've seen the new bride and community from the community point of view and also from the council point of view um lien thank you for your passion the area I really think that when I when I look at what 's happening and brandon from brusters viewpoints I really think that I 'm not here to talk about one single issue but Moor how we work together how counseling community can work together and I think that 's what I would encourage you to think about more moving forward I don 't think antagonism is the people and council try and do good things in so many people in community trying to do good things and it 's really about how we remove the blocks and between those two yeah I think council has some outdated ways of working with people social media is amazing we see it and Brighton they just think about new ways of partnering going forward and I think if you want to think about new ways of going forward I think that new brightens the perfect place to try all that especially at the moment and I want to tell you a little story of something that we 've been involved in that um yeah that can speak to that idea I think also that I 'm not an expert on the process and how you do that these examples from all around the world where that 's happened Jim dyers has been really inspirational to me with what he 's done in Seattle but i think if we could harness the energy that 's out there right now we could do really amazing things so the new brighton Community Safety another cheer in 2013 there was huge concern around a perceived lack of safety a new Bratton and amongst the community and the council and the community board responded by allocating 150 thousand dollars through the capital endowment fund tinny Bratton to the credit of the community board and counselors they didn 't say it had to be spent on something specific they said we want the community to come up with recommendations for what could be done out there and so at the same time a partnership was set up as a mixture of council community business and police and they were tasked with making those recommendations to council about what that 150 thousand dollars could be spent on the figure of 150 thousand dollars was calculated and council by thinking through a city safe officer program and looking at how much that would cost and that was sort of how the figure was arrived it so now two years on the the safety partnership still meeting for just over half of that 150 thousand dollars the guardianship project we call it as in full swing it 's going it 's being delivered by positive directions trust which is a local group than you brighten an addition to that program for the 150,000 we 'll see around a hundred prepare a hundred parents provided with scholarships to attend parenting courses also over 30 at-risk young people engaged an intensive programming targeted at theme we 've distributed over 5000 fridge magnets the way that raise awareness of safety in the area and we 've done a number of other things as well so i just wanted to illustrate that when you really partner with community i think you can save money and I know that 's something that needs to happen citywide at the moment but I think um more importantly you can have more of an impact and not just an impact sort of in a tangible measurable way but also in people 's hearts and minds when you really empower them I really see that you can harness their energy and take it forward as a partnership we feel much more connected to the police now we feel much more responsible for community fokin how they and how so um this is just one little example and I 'm sure there 's suddenly other ways that you could imagine that you could partner with the community that council holds a lot of power and holds a lot of resource and I think if that was distributed in other ways that could be really powerful um just to finish the earthquake created a lot of difficulties for people in the east and in the city but it 's also created a lot of opportunities as well and I think now 's the time to harness that if we could grasp that I think we could pilot something really innovative for the city out a new brighton in perhaps even the world and so i think just the essential is moving away from pure consultation past just listening and really enter partnership and why not just try very good clean thank you and thank you so be you 're in a unique position of having it kind of hit it having had a foot in both camps if you if you know what i mean we know you from the if I can about how an example of this new partnership might look and I hope this isn 't too soon a question I think of the South libro de moda camp residents who came here and we did be in the rule so they could speak and I 'm pleased we did but the property because it was during an LTP process the problem is we here as council a kind of imposition of all these rules which a lot of other people don 't know about and all the ways and means in which things go so can you give an example you know another example of how something that comes to mind at the community at the moment of how that could work out also it 's actually yeah it 's difficult because I 'm like I say I feel like I 'm not an expert and I feel like I could do a PhD on this subject and you know come back with some great ideas and I 'm sure other people have but I know that what happened was I did print out something in Diaz example in Seattle so what they did was very got communities together at a small level and what then ward level and they resource them and I also got an existing community leaders to beyond their boards that made the decision so principles principles and like Kira you know police and people that already had kind of like local power and they resource them by learning them hire their own consultants to research they involved 30,000 people and developing 37 neighborhood plans between 1996 and 1999 and citizens subsequently voted for an extra 464 million in additional taxes to supplement their own efforts and implementing those plans so I just yeah I don 't know i think i think there 's lots of different models and you could let your mind wander you know I 'm sure there 's just experiment I 'm just to support lee n on this i mean i think it 's always been your apology you know with jim diaz and those models of other ways of engaging that 's Nikki our team I might file thank you very much silver that 's great is exactly what we want to move to listen thank you _"

    "text": "as we move to the new brighton submissions and I 'm kind of hoping that with the live streaming that we have these days that people who are on the list of residents who made submissions and asked to be heard by the council or in relation to facilities and infrastructure in the eastern part of Christchurch that if they are watching online and they 're expecting to be heard data in the day but please come on now it would be great if you could come and join us and the way that I kind of want to handle it from here on owners though I 'm not going to run the clock you know I think that five-minute submissions are unfortunate because they don 't give people enough time to really express their views and I think that this is an important opportunity for people to have a say there has been obviously some miscommunication around the the nature of the hearing today it was certainly not our desire to do so we asked people to be here at nine thirty this morning and I really it 's to don 't really realize that the idea was to have everyone here and that those that wanted to be heard after an initial presentation would do so this was the arrangement that we entered into with the promenade group they made a very powerful submission and then there were a number of submissions that were attached to that or included with it who all wanted to support the promenade and but with the with the numbers that wanted to be heard I think they were 80 that wanted to be heard on the promenade issue alone we contacted all of those a large number of people on that list we 're surprised to find that their detector box that said they wanted to be heard so we were able to sort of cross them off the list but by approach the organizers of that petition we were able to get agreement that they would come and make a significant presentation which they did and it was an exceptionally powerful presentation I think every counselor saw that and and then individuals who wanted to comment as well we 're invited how important the promenade would be to them and their families and I thought that that was an exceptionally powerful way to present and in fact I read on one of the facebook comments that somebody said aha maybe it 's not the quantity of submissions maybe it 's the the quality and the presentation of a longer period where you had time for questions that might be a better way to present and then just have the smaller presentations afterwards really to back up the main submission when we tried to find the person who authored the document that is the basis for all of the remaining submissions we did manage to find her but she said she wasn 't responsible for any of the the people that had signed it so it wasn 't possible to bring forward an individual to to lead the way so we 've invited Andrea Cummings as the chair of the board Pegasus community board to present an overarching view of the issues that are raised and these submissions and then we 're going to invite people to underly come forward they can as was the case with the promenade group on a personal level I 'm i do find this very difficult to end and I 'm not going to cry so but you know to read the submissions and to read how much faith people put on me personally as their Member of Parliament and to read that people feel that letting me as them here that I would stand up for the east and to read how let down people feel and many I just all I really want to do is to say I 'm really sorry there is no intention around this table to let anyone down and the wonderful thing that has come of this terrible process which we will never repeat a promise that the wonderful thing that 's come from it is that there isn 't a member of this council that doesn 't understand how important it is to prioritize work in the east and there isn 't actually I don 't think anyone who 's made a submission to this council from anywhere in the city that doesn 't understand that the priority have looked for us to find solutions to problems that are not entirely of our making and the solutions can 't just be found in this space so I want to repeat what I said to the young man that came here from Kashmir high school earlier on the government is about to release a transition recovery plan for the city the transition is how do you transition away from the domination of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act and the authority that has been put in place by central government to a to local government leadership and community engagement in the decisions that affect the recovery of our city and every single person who has submitted on this plan must submit to the government on its transition do we want to be in a position where we as a city and making decisions for ourselves and the question is are we ready to do so and can we back each other to do so as communities and as a council and our community boards together the silver lining and I always look for one because although I 'm not appearing the silver lining and all of this is that the new brighton community is more United than i have ever seen it the fact that they now have a business association that includes the landowners which has always been the floor and the ability to do anything a new brighton is fantastic and i think Paul 's are none deserves an honor for what he 's been able to do and I think that the community itself has actually proved itself to be more United then then then ever before and in a way that has enabled the business community the landowners the local residents and the wider community that value the resource that it is to come together as one voice and that to me has to be the silver lining of a not-very-good process so on that note I will hand over to you Andrea and if you would like to begin the presentation on the new brighton submissions okay thank you me a million how do you follow on from there thank you for your passion that we 've seen today and it 's been so good that you guys have her in our voice I think you 've kind of just done half my speech for me I 'm sort of trying to I wasn 't aware that I was to sort of submit on be the overarching submit her for this so I haven 't written a speech I haven 't written my speech based on that I was merely sort of introducing the community to you no no that 's fine its own it 's like I 'll read my speech it may not all be completely relevant as it was when I wrote it so I sit here today feeling very proud proud of a community new brighton a community that has been hammered years of decline thousands of earthquakes in what seems at times like blow after blow from those charged with their recovery and I don 't just mean you guys not trust me this is a community that could have given up and it 's just accepted their fate yet over the past year I have seen a revolution taking place in New Brighton where other suburbs around us are this suburb has united and decided to stand up it 's been incredible to watch this community has become educated on the ways and means of council it 's incredible to see how many people now watch the live streaming of council meetings and how many really do follow what 's going on so high tal you new brighton guys watching today it 's been mind-blowing to hear people working together to help others fell out submission forms it was amazing to see the turnout at the first public meeting pulls on and and i called and then to watch the ground swell of enthusiasm turn into her sip and submit nights at switch we 're local businesses sponsored the photocopying and even provided pins facebook was alight with our community activating our community the council asked the city to tell them what they wanted in n thought of the long term plan and New Brighton did hundreds and hundreds of submissions not just about a single issue not just having a whinging cap not just because everyone else was doing it but every submission was from the heart every get off the seat and do something about it each submission has a story behind it from the seven year old who just wanted to tell you how she loves New Brighton to the man who was illiterate who had lived his whole life in New Brighton and watched every day what was going on to the stranger who sat down and spend half an hour helping and put his thoughts on paper it was incredible to watch this community feel empowered and feel United in their patient at the beginning of this LTP process I had a number of discussions with people about what should be the main issues we tried to get our community to focus on in their submissions but it would quickly became apparent that this wasn 't about one foot path or one camping ground it was about a community that feel forgotten a community that field just like because they suffered the worst they have to accept the least it 's a better community that feel they 're not getting a figure some issues have been around for 20 years or more others are the why and how we got to where we are today but I don 't want to do that and i 'm pretty sure nobody here wants to either we want to look forward the existing budgets for the east seemed awful most of it is simply patching what has been damaged almost none of it gets us betterment and I think that 's we want what we want and deserve we are a destination we are where people want to live and have their needs met locally we have an amazing number of natural assets and we want to protect them where necessary and also utilize them for recreation and tourism new brighton knows it has something specials it knows what it has to be take what it takes to be awesome it is worth it so while I hold my men date to speak on behalf of those who have submitted here today and I 've not been asked to buy them I do want to ask you to listen to the issues in the passion and allow this community to flourish for the benefit of the whole you want to take some questions just to kick things off or do you want to just hand over to I mean I 've had a quick flick through through the submissions photogate as i said i don 't i don 't even pretend to it too on behalf of all the submissions okay well we 'll if you 're going to stay then we could invite you back later on maybe for a bit of a round table yeah yeah I 'll be here for a little bit hopefully like alfredo and bribe my babysitter right Pauline Pauline would you like to come forward Pauline still recovering from a bit of a fall so anyway before you just enter our page 219 is Pauline submission think you 've been here and thank you also for all clean positive we can 't look back although i 'm going to my open stance i was involved and the save railway campaign in the late 1980s and I experienced alongside my husband throughout New Zealand and in particular are the following three years of men in their fifties put on the scrapheap vanished and the government did not account for it what happened today bears the same outlook I 'm not political in any shape or form but I know the experience we are head re bought the railways we are now suffering the likes of Ralston rang gora to name a couple where we used to be able to take the train to relatives we 'd backwards and forwards at least three times a day what are we trying to do exactly the same thing that is my background the other phrase my mum used to use change what you can change and leave well alone that can 't change I now speak about victoria square that has been the gym over the last four years it has been a real lively place from technical meeting friends walking and the flowing river oh please yes repair things ie the bar found the rubber banks we 're not saying not do anything but what we are saying leave well alone and don 't spend money where it 's not necessary I 'm back to the asset covered ten years down the track jaws if there is room to sell what is really not the jewels but the lacs of the airport that are and putting again back into our City Council and don 't forget the major area of the city council funding comes from the right there we are broken still we 're still working through von Taer appears on earthquakes we are still working through the likes of New Brighton Road flooding the whole time and getting the high tide up our drivers as well these are the things the practical things there are a lot of the east people are working through but the gems are the apple trees that moved on intersections helping a family across the road the chutneys the jars are tucked in his exchanging tomato sauce exchanging just to name a couple things yes our neighborhoods have started to get back to community back to realities and back to life so when you are looking at assets please leave the jewels in the cupboard fight for what will help in the future and particularly my great grandchildren are they are still part of the city other major thing is New Brighton first year following the earthquakes and particularly the first six months my neighbor and I were him to walk round from Parma 's road foremost level and bare ass to get a loom gun cost her foster family the other side of the city there were three lose and a spate of two box they are the sorts of things that we in the East had put up with in are still putting up with it as a seed new brighton road but it 's having an impact on families cars i 'd had my car my car as a late waste at the 2005 offenders until has before model but I 've already had to have suspension done new tires in fact because it 's a front-wheel drive and I 'm not McCann it 's had to have two sets and new tires on the front these are costs that respected families um for me personally we lost our whole community school church neighborhood to name that locked we 're having to travel now to even meet up with those communities on a the roads so let 's bet get back to core structures and these before we look at the grain geo replacement of Pioneer fraggin see what we 've got to try and do is get people back the communities that they are had been part of the grassroots but also the linkages a car bowling club for argument sake many other members now cannot get a bus from A to B because where are the buses thus a few theremin between and particularly in these the roots are not practical in lots of cases so let 's get back to the course sir I suppose that and natural but in relation to the prom that I think it 's great idea but I think one that comes to mind it 's been floating for many many years even when my children were going to Don Dalton 's swelling and bury em over road is the salt pools yeah that would be positive even the pier even if it 's repaired the first part the structural part was reasonably sound from what I hear embrace Lee extended again as money permits down fishing off the girl couples and i think one quarter seagull at one stage but those little pleasures let 's get back to those sorts of things yes the East Lee 's a hell of a wind and it is cold bleak and the township itself has two dollar shots I agree with that that let 's try and get there some of the well-known firms to take the plunge and regrowth because I believe in the future with the big schools going up and kiwi to ie surely boys higher and Evans I think it 's a positive move it will bring back communities and bring back the strength I know some pools will not be rebuilt there but there are other positive things I do not believe they won 't any at least the aranui complex for education it will do nothing normal feel lost in a city itself it 's personal belief and years of experience in social work so that 's basically what i want to say is to get back to positive get back to grassroots and please look at new writing road it but you know but we don 't know what the future of new brighton road will be because it is so low it has thanks so much and of course the stock banks are now so high that you can 't even see the river from New Brighton Road and and the river comes to new brush and wrote regularly you know from underneath so we 've got a lot of work to do there so what we 're looking at is is you know do we have to move new brighton road should we move the stop banks out you know that that 's why we 've got a lot of work to do we 're not a hundred percent or so it 's not as though yeah i mean because it faces onto the red zone because that holds drop up as you know because i know where you love and i know that your neighbors have gone for that red zoning reason but and we 've been given an opportunity by the government to look at what our needs as a city are in terms of you you know how do we how do we use all of the opportunities that perhaps the red zone offers to fix some of the problems that our city faces as well so we 'll be a wee while working out what we 're going to do with new brush and road and but we will be talking to community first before we make any decisions because we are very we 're very clear that it has to be an engagement with local communities before decisions are made well I think the other thing on a personal note from my personal point of view is that there needs to be relooked I City Council Sarah government whatever on the low-lying areas of palmer 's by Baker by who buries the new brighton rhodine because we 've already had I further 14 more drop yeah I believe the lens still settling so yeah I 'm Phil thank you very very much Pauline for your very deeply moving submission um I just want to ask you about something related to the land haven 't dropped and people really enthusiastic and understand it about I 'm just wondering f and fit when we look carefully at the science if in fact we find we have to be really careful about engineering anything on top of the dones would a smaller smaller scale walkway for not only local people but City PD would that also sort of me to meet some of what the new brighton people might to see it 's hard to say again I would rely purely on the engineering side of it I think anything too high you 've then got to have fencing if you like or some sort of railing system particularly if you take people with walkers and I could see limited use of you like and thinking about a lot of people in that area are of the older creating myself of that group so whether they would use it to they descend or whether it become a skate way and a cycleway and again the older people probably would not use it if it 's a common combination or whatever I am NOT engineer nowhere near that generally mean I would probably rely rely on expert mean I thought I think Pauline thank you very much I I think we 'll move on to the to the next emotion but thank you very much for making the effort to come and I hope your 100% soon oh he 's getting me all right I 'm Sylvia Smith but _"

    "text": "the next submission is Ainsley McNabb thank you for this opportunity to speak at the last minute I my submission is about as an opposition to the modern material extinction on the cranford Street upgrade i couldnt the submission to the RMA hearings and I didn 't realize that that that was going to be to a panel of Commissioners and thought at the time when I spoke to them that I should also in speaking to the council because it 's your deciding on the funding of this way I don 't think that I don 't think that we can is it still before the commissioners it has it 's been been adjourned until June well I mean I 'm can I can I just take some quick advice on this because I don 't think that it as legally appropriate to take a submission on the long-term plane I mean I agree that the fundings on the budget but but you know that whether that 's spent or not is dependent on the commissioners ruling I mean can we get some advice ugent Lee sorry awake awake I 'm just wondering can you can you present your submission in such a way is to talk about the allocation of funding to two large capital projects which are required for the reasons other than earthquake-related I mean can 't find an edge of the way to the itch to the actual project I 'm I 'm otherwise I 'll have to give it a lawyer to give me some advice because I don 't want to put us in a position where where we are reviewable for a decision that we 've made because we 've heard a submission that we haven 't made available to anyone else right I 'm India look I 'm I 'm sorry I 'm just think slightly cautious I 've been aware before of councils that have you know I 've been told for example we cannot hear submissions on the local alcohol plan because if I here is submission from one group I 've got to hear it from everyone so okay yep the understanding that we have is that we 'd have to wait for the commissioners report before we we 've had a number of developers come and talk to us around setting district planning matters and infrastructure requirements and asked that we bring funding forward for their development so I guess I was just interested with this mission was around the funding or whether it was around the kind of technical engineering things because I think it 's perfectly reasonable to end we 've had a number of people with private developers coming in talking through while they should put money on for funneling beer infrastructure I don 't well some of those ones before they 're looking at hearing spin-off yep again you can frame your summation oh well I 'm sorry I don 't know i don 't me because i 'm not meaning to be difficult i 'm just i just know what will happen if if we do the wrong thing yep we expose ourselves to judicial review and it 's not me that pays for judicial review it 's the ratepayers in Christ you so it 's not you know I 'm not being difficult i 'm just being cautious no it 's times do we hear about new roads been created and to improve traffic flow and all it does is encourage people to use those roads and i think now with our future christchurch we 've got an opportunity to think of smart solutions sustainable solutions and we 've got to involve public transport and those my opposition to this is in terms of the cost of it and i believe that is not going to solve traffic flow in the area and that we really need to support priority bus lanes park-and-ride car-sharing have priority lanes on all major roads coming in and out of Christchurch because it 's not just this northern area that are contested so I think there is a precious transport although you know about Patricia transport strategic plan objectives we 've got to think about those objectives when we 're looking at projects such as the Northern arterial and other roading areas they are to improve access and choice create safe healthy livable communities support economic vitality and create opportunities for environmental enhancement so to me any money spent by the council has got to to me you know we have to go all options and that 's prioritizing public transport getting people out of single community communities out of cars because you know if you look at a lot of conduced dear is in the city that 's still what we 're seeing it 's in potential for the railway lines that already exists to be part of that transport future I think it would be a wonderful option you know having lived overseas where we it is just you know kids get on train to go to school you know we 've got this huge population growth outside of christ church whether it 's rolleston whether it 's running or a coyote way and not Pegasus you know I think that would be a wonderful option and and a new zealand I think we 're we 've had this privilege you 've been able to drive our own cars everywhere and not having you know not having head congestion for so long but you know we 've got to make people see that it 's this peaceful that 's it 's actually very for people people use public transport if they can see that it 's reliable and quick you so you know reliable is about the timetable and quit means that it 's quicker than than jumping in a car and it 's you know and that 's affordable you know so all of those things wonderful break into it but you know the point that you made right at the start I 'm quite interested and exploring that a little but fear that because seems to me that you know there is this view that a few if you build more you know like bridges and roads and everything like that that that will help the flow but it actually just increases the flow that 's not there 's quite a bit of research that shows you build a road and the cars come and within very short time it is again congested I think New York City found that with what was his name the Robert the guy that built all the bridges on Cory know many many years ago it was just it was just he kept building bridges info um just when you mentioned you know that you 'll put it financing the big roads to get people into communities but we 've just hair done a bit bread short eres we 've got others an Arab war with them growing Street you go right through cartridges huge amount of work that don 't you what 's your opinion on where that money should really be looked at with it as the communities with the broken streets or to the main streets to the feeders if you liked anniversary um Geneva answer this is a community seem to represent it and I would say that the money needs to be spent on the local streets the the money there is going that 's in the budget to to do this project would be better spent on local streets there people of course using the motorway and not even Christchurch residents and not paying money into our into your pocket so at the present time why should we be supporting that and also the plans that we 've seen rely on the fact that the roads are up to that project on our communities rely on us having streets up to standard now how long 's that going to take 30 years so whilst you 're bringing people into the city the residents of Christchurch in the st. Albans area and down there done that section of blend are actually going to be heading to put up with bad vibrations noise etc which we 're already doing and this is going to actually double the number of cars make it worse and our lives are actually going to suffer for it so the social social impacts upon us a huge so you definitely put the money into the local roads yep Phil thank you very much for your submission rossini got me thinking and like really you 're suggesting about public transport on Peppa new erode that there be passive brass priority lanes and and all that they 're already there and because of the number of cars there 's some compa some conflict of course of public transport and private Kerrigan so like if we follow your suggestion wouldn 't council also need to really upgrade Airbus priority what you 'd said used to go there and I would presume to that would include upgrading the interchange at northlands she 's wondering if you have any specific comments about what we would need to do to really get the buses moving on Peponi road you know I think priority bus lanes is a really good idea but I think it should be not just on how can we rode I think they should be also priority bus lanes on cranford street because it 's obviously a you know I main entranceway to the city yeah so anything that can facilitate moving people in an efficient and sustainable way well thank you very much and I congratulate you on presenting a submission and a slightly different frame then you had anticipated doing but you did it extremely well thank you thank you thanks your feelings so here 's an ad for this more than a paragraph I 13-8 yeah yeah thank you various various interests who are seeking to do d yeah um _"

    "text": "otherwise known as Andy Lee welcome welcome thank you I 'm a resident of South you brighten but I 'm making mo submission just generally about the long-term plan I am concerned it seems to be an element in places about there is no alternative the selling assets in a century what I 'm suggesting is that there be no asset sales I voted for the people Choice candidates and I support those to the candidates campaign and the alternative plan reality I recognize is that the rating base has dramatically changed but essentially I hear that the need is to cut your cloth to sit down to see your circumstances just before I go back to my principal points about asset sales I do want to support what the council does they do good things like the summertime 's and busters festivals there is a lot a lot of stuff that people may go an overlock behind the scenes and I I just want to endorse that end and make sure that you keep on keeping on with those positive things that despite all our travails under the earthquake returning to my principal point about the asset sales I think all the asset currently returning a dividend will be at some of them are small in some cases but at least it 's a a positive income stream through every dollar that you lose and their income stream then you do this to go and make other cups the assets have been built up by previous generations we it 's not for us to squander for a one-off benefit you can only sell it once the companies act one of the things that are here at times is that well we 'll still be a majority shareholder in these particular assets but the problem is that the companies act and accounting practices does allow minority shareholder tails to wag the council body and I think that it 's not the initial sale that happens it 's what happened subsequently down the track when you get soul upon sale and at the end of the day the council won 't necessarily benefit and the community will certainly pay modern accounting practices used to escalate the prices to consumers it 's you have had presented to you through unions Canterbury and other submitters the Wellington Taylor two networks it is exactly on point because in that particular situation looking at the historical thing the the water conservation has actually gone has improved the usage of water and the prices have not kept up with inflation whereas with the electricity network has gone up by nearly three hundred percent in the last 20 years and that will happen it isn 't the council that 's actually in Wellington that has borne met it has been the community it 's been nearly a billion dollars taken out at that same time and the community has paid to consumers at the end of the day to cut your cloth I think we need to rear the techs and I 'm pleased to hear you saying that you need to look and reprioritize the point the council East made about bear ever there being on plans and suddenly they are not there anymore you 've got to go and run your roller over everything because your operational costs we just have to go and reduce it is a major so I don 't envy you your task at all I would see about renegotiating the council government sharing agreement I certainly agree with the proposal that has been submitted by be quite a lot of people to the fear the stadium if it 's going to take 20 or 30 years so be it so the convention center despite government meeting costs are meeting that cost I think if it 's that important business should pay for it not you guys oh well I mean there 's always things that you have to pay Emma Council to support the convention center and I don 't think that we need to deal with that so basically defer reprioritize in the dresser operational habits costings thank you well you 'll be pleased to know that we 're doing all of that so if that is final but I just want to support you thank you is a reason thank you very much thank you very much _"

    "text": "um because the Bradshaw Tara Street upgrade was on my agenda and I overlooked it so yeah which I shouldn 't have no problems was it was nice listen to that to the universe speak more spoken right look I 'm a path of i 'm here on behalf of bradshaw a tourist residents brett two terraces effectively located about a block block and a half away from boys hi so good location and the the issues that we have residents face is that bradshaw terrace has issues with we 're here that are based on 60 years minimal if no maintenance and some earthquake damage subsequently post-earthquake to our road service l curbing our drainage stormwater system over that time sorry just to sort of diversity but you 've got a bit of yeah presentation with some limited swamp on the second page sure it 's there 's some evidence that releases do tell the story the road service has deteriorated more poster earthquake to the point at along both sides of the road areas of approximately 1 to 1.5 meters from the curb out onto the road this with no road service the next page in addition in the middle of the road we 're seeing areas of cracking large pot holes full of bitumen if you look at the picture at the left of page for you see exactly what we 're talking about the curb in on both sides of the road is also in a similar state with cracking all the way around the entirety of the street the footpath is chipped it is not level it is full of holes at is full of patches it has cracks and in some instances i can put my fingers down these cracks simply it 's not safe if you look on the picture on page four on the right hand side you can sort of see the circle curb next page the 60 year old stormwater system of clay piping is really adding unwanted use in real problems and pressure to the residents of great short errors it 's an old clay pipe system a recent pipe burst effect in the water system so we were out without water this is only probably six months or when city care came out to repair the issue they informed us that the whole drainage board system is so fragile due to its condition as a result of age and earthquake damage that it is due to burst at any time and to expect ongoing issues subsequently we also suffer from reoccurring flooding issues when it rains in summary the stormwater drains do not drain the gutters continually full with water they 're filled with mud and debris in most cases that debris as fishermen from the Eurasian from the road and at times some of the residents have had sewage running through their front door for other front yards we have a very fragile road urban drainage and water system which is now rapidly deteriorating the council may be aware of this for a few years ago Brett short terrace was due to be upgraded and the terminology used back in 2011 was to be beautified but subsequently the earthquake struck and the project was cancelled the residents were grateful when recently with some kinetic that with some continued pressure and acknowledgement of the issues that we got of the road to effectively hold the road together temporarily this has not worked the very nature of the original problem as problematic it 's too problematic within one month the chip seal was already cracking and breaking apart to the point that it says or it 's really back to the stage but it was before some of the other issues that we have is increased vehicle traffic with with workers in the facility of riccarton using bradshaw terraces their long-term parking destination on page eight if you just turn the page you 'll see with images of what has been the road with the chip seal on in some images some of the stateless continued deterioration on page 9 you 'll see some of the water which is accumulating in the drains against subsequently post the chips will benefit on look in summary the new chip seals not working it 's a short-term fix the parkin has been an issue for us for some time but we were in the process of resolving that and we may we may get some time to parking what we do or as a priority for funding and to look at basically redressing the full infrastructure any questions yeah I was just highlighting to the chief executive the phrase coming months around time parking I mean we 've we 've become very aware of a particular process problem within the organization or the chief executive hairs which we 're seeking to address so that these things do not take a long time yeah and that respect we 've been running around in the street and we 've got great support and we 've got signatures so that that 's well and truly under process yeah Ellie David you taken an associate to if anyone before now right well we 've been to the woodland community board in December last year we actually had counselors and community board ribs as representatives on site and regional terrorists to show them so we 've had some support to date but I guess the biggest issue goes back to to funding correct correct yeah um David this is a problem that 's pretty symptomatic right across the city so in my mind I think we would the city so would you be happy if that process took place and maybe you the opolis but then again you might be down at a lot there 's probably a hundred or more streets and the okay my biggest I totally understand and that are as bad if not ten times worse than what I 'm seeing in your photos but but i think we probably need to look at a prioritization process would you be happy of that happening happening in the city it 's a bit of a catch-22 situation that we created 22 personally I 'm not happy bearing in mind that i 've also got to be quite sensitive to the fact that we 've posted quake now you 're dealing with riches of regards to funding but pre-earthquake the allocation had already taken place the confirmation for bradshaw terrace in light of the greater radius around our area where all the streets have been done all the curving had been made into modern current curve in a row services we will lift out there was an admission that that we had announced to us marine on a program for for reconstruction they 're off it and nowhere near back on it again so i gets back to my summer i implore you to have a look at it but the pipes need to be fixed i mean if the pipes need to be faxed she wouldn 't want you you wouldn 't want you straight completely repaired and then have to dig into it again and do real nice so I mean it 's got to be the whole top being problematic he has got to start from somewhere information if you 're if you 're still on clay pipes then they probably are gonna be problems yani just just interested in the issue of how much damage that earthquake that recognizing that before ever get was a problem that um has it been noticeably worsened because of the earthquake and it 's not something that staff may have said or city care that is going to be something that 's effective through the earthquake repair process good question that in terms of the the the road service and the and the the curbing can see the cracking I think I might look clear if we have enough time just quickly talk about that the things that we don 't see which is what sukhiya raised with us just reasonable things people we had presented several times to the record on web community board and Vicki back and Jimmy chin are both aware of our issues now its fleet channel and it 's really needed an hour Street we 've got a street like this and the original drain was put in in 1949 now that drain goes down through number fourteen house through what is now celtx out to rickett and wrote that 's the drain that is always blocking and last year the city council did three days on the main drain at fourteen to clear now I have suggested to Vicki and Jimmy that we have an open drain that runs through 16 18 9 and 11 through to Harry Kiki street now we could put a fine grating over 14 and then put the majority of the water through the open drain out to Harry Kiki street and it would every house that sells is subdivided into two or three two storey townhouses so therefore we 're getting all that extra gray water in stormwater and of course we 're getting more concrete and more bitumen so that the problem is going to increase as long as we are using that 60 year old main drain to take the water and that 's the one that blocks at the top because the people who go to the irish pub on Riverton road part at the top of our street and then come out at night and their bottles and glasses and everything else are coming down blocking the 14 drain so the suggestion we 've made is that we flat channel and we bring the bulk of the water out to Harrow Kiki stream you should be an engineer thank you ever you know but I mean the thing is isn 't there i mean it 's um you 've obviously worked through these issues and you know we are faced with a number challenges in the city in terms of getting everything up to scratch and it 's going but thank you very much for making the submission I know that it is in the record and would grum community boards submission that we prioritize this and the list of priorities that we are looking at so that certainly heard the concerns that have been raised so thank you thank you very much you 're welcome thank you for your time okay and relay _"

    "text": "not to catch me at high school awesome Harrison Austen Harrison is it it is welcome thank you good morning honorable nearly and L zeal and members of the City Council my name is Austin Harrison and I 'm here as a representative speaking to the Kashmere high school submission to the long term plan um first of all I just like to thank you as a council for giving me the opportunity to speak here today I think it speaks wonders for the democratic process and New Zealand and in Christchurch that even non-voting young people get the opportunity not only to speak but to be heard and I just like to thank you for that I know among others you 've heard from I have some water polo players this morning and the Christchurch Youth Council and today I would like to elaborate and expand on the essence of what you think about the future of the city I feel particularly lucky today to be speaking here as I had to change hearing times twice in order to be here because I got back from an overseas holiday bags under my eyes but it was worth it because on my travels I visited some of the greatest cities in the world cities such as London Glasgow Dubai I even found city bigger one of Brunei and I left each of these cities thinking wow what an incredible place to be what an amazing city and I 'm sure like everyone in this room there is the response that I want people to have when they come to Christchurch now but also in 10 years time and beyond the long term plan without a doubt provides us with the buildings the facilities the infrastructure to give us that dream city that we are looking for and it 's fairly financially sensible however as you well know the books are not quite balanced and when I was attending a community outreach meeting about six weeks ago it occurred to me that the central issue with the long term plan was going to be savings with a 1.2 billion dollar shortfall of course you 're looking for places to save so that was the exact question that I posed to the the idea that probably targeting one large saving area would be a superior way to save some money and we decided that two hundred and fifty three million dollars worth of brand-new stadium would be worth the weight and and hopefully prevent some of the asset sales or at least help to balance the books a little in the long-term plan we went out with petition papers and within the space of one six and a half hour school day four hundred and thirty students looked up from their phones and peeled away from Facebook and science support to our submission which was quite incredible I 'm aware of course of the challenges that are faced when trying to manipulate anchor projects it 's these projects that you know are often inhibited by things like crown agreements and Sarah but the submission if nothing else is really to show how much young people care about the future of our city the level of support that I received when putting together the submission is surprised even me and and no doubt will surprise some of you too but I think that bottom line is that in 10 15 20 years time it 's my generation that will inherit this city and naturally we would like to to live in vote for and make up a city and a council which is rich in assets and low in debt not one which is rich in debt and sorry which not one which has low levels of assets and requires you to be rich to pay your rates the tagline for the long term submission process was to find a balance between what we have to do and what we would like to do and to make some smart choices smart choices can include more rates yet some asset sales yes but there is beauty and moderation and this is all for teens really want to be assured of whether it be the stadium deferral or movement of another anchor project or something completely different what we save now we save for the future Kashmir high I believe is fairly representative of all young people and that we care and want to look after the future of Christchurch and all that we want look after the creation of the city that we do and we 'll continue to call home thank you thank you where 's remind myself that I will be 70 in 1932 at 2030 and that means that the city is not being rebuilt for me it 's really been rebuilt for your generation I think you 've made that point really really well so anyone got some questions for Austin great thanks very much for that and hope you enjoyed your holiday the thing that 's coming out of here for me is that and I think actually the whole submission process even actually Malcolm 's one before is that we created this huge wish list for big projects which clearly we cannot afford and yet what people actually want are kind of a basic stuff the community facilities stuff that people do in their everyday life and I mean so for young people what are the sort of things that they would be focused on if you weren 't looking at kind of a big-ticket items um I I think young people are not so different to anyone homes rebuilt is obviously priority number one we want community facilities and in places to go we want things to happen for me I see a lot of young people who are super keen for things like the arts priests to get underway because that the more events and and sort of cultural happenings that that we can see the more energy there is in the city and the better place that is for young people to live so those things definitely take priority particularly when we have a stadium now which is working out and and doing the job that it needs to do Oh clean clean Thank You Austin thank you you know I realize have just hopped off the plane you 've gone places but further than me and a recent trip but I did come back with a few impressions of things like we 've got the best water in the world you know sort of connectivity for getting around is imperative these kind of things issues about homelessness graffiti is it true do you got some impressions from you all that was right now about a public public transport actually is a really good point traveling around the UK particularly they just have phenomenal public transport and and that 's not just with the tubes and things and London 's it 's as the trams and Manchester and Gloucester they 're just have fantastic public transport systems and that would make my life a lot easier you know I don 't drive so it would be great to see you know a few more bus routes and things well we keep seeing them being taken away but those things are tricky because obviously you know that 's just on account of dwindling numbers of people using them most people do Drive but I think I 'm one thing that strikes me is I had just a day yesterday visiting Melbourne and they have some fantastic but really quite simple architecture and that they have your typical sort of tilts their buildings and then they 'll come and they 'll paint it so that it looks like someone 's taking a bright yellow vivid and just done a big line down the side of it and full of beige and gray and so I would love to see some of that sort of quirkiness taken into account when we put together our city as well fell Thank You us and I 'm gonna just ask you while you 're overseas to you would have seen a lot of heritage buildings that have been kept one that is a knit airplane is that their provincial Chatham chambers building on Willis Olivia and I think from memory in the long term okay and it 's going to cost a lot of money to build like about a minute so I know I don 't know if you overseas if you learned about how in fact some of the kids to keep some of the heritage they actually spend a lot of years and just protecting it absolutely ideas about what we should do with some of our heritage buildings like the provincial the old provincial building I don 't think it can be stressed enough how important those heritage buildings and sites are you know you visit a place like England and it 's just incredible because of go there there there are thousand years of history here and who 's walked through that door what 's happened and in that building and I think it 's really important for the future of the city especially one which is fairly tourism focused and to some extent that we keep some of those heritage buildings and reminders of our history as well as brand new state-of-the-art facilities Danny I 'm thinking for submission and all the work that 's gone behind it um it was interesting that you started by talking about being grateful for democracy and it chance to speak to us given that this is a government decision have you I was just really interested if you 've engaged with government at all with it through the minister or through the school um I I haven 't a lot I was essentially drawn to attention of the long-term plan submissions because I was invited along to a community board outreach meeting and I just sort of sat there thinking well this is a hopeless situation I don 't want a city that that 's scaling into debt submission so I did there is actually an opportunity for you and actually this might be a nice opportunity to kind of put it on the table but the government soon will be releasing a transition plan and the transition recovery plan is actually all about how we get from where we are now to a future state after the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act is repealed next year and I would certainly invite you and others to think very carefully about you know yes you 've made a submission to the council around our long-term plan but actually making a submission to the government about the transition recovery plan will certainly let the government know what the people of Christchurch have been telling us through this plan which is what are the priorities for Christchurch and how does Christchurch take back the responsibility for the decision-making and these important areas because I think that 's the message that we have received loud and clear over the last two weeks and really backed up by your own submission today to further stadium are we told it 's out of order so an opportunity to think about how he can engage with central government on this very issue which is good because we 've already put a deferral on this in terms of the long term plan we are obviously going to consider to see whether we can move it out even further we 're going to try you know but we 've we you know we we are we 've got a whole lot of different issues that we 've got to take into account so we 're going to try and do that but the transition period is an extremely important period and what I don 't want anyone to think is that they come here to the council and and sort of recommend to the council that we adopt a particular position and then don 't go to government and recommend they adopt a particular position around the transition it 's a golden opportunity that 's about to happen and it will be happening very very soon I will keep an eye out and I will make a submission except I thank you for bringing that to my team made a terrible mistake before and thank you very much for for that and and and please feedback to your school that we 're very pleased that you made the submission on behalf of the school so thank you thank you and I 've narrow an apology to Gregg 's Sneden and clear much as it _"

    "text": "the next one is Malcolm frost so that this is a this is a supplementary submission on the supplementary sheet everyone so it 's page 3 of the supplementary yep sorry this is just our problem about no is just not on the book Thank You Malcolm yeah and I somehow I missed out coming tuesday i don 't know to do the winery sewage scheme anyway you 'll starve a sort it out very kindly thanks for that thanks the opportunity to say something um the situation we have a link with winery is we have an impecunious council who has serious financial difficulties contemplating i supposed to put it basley attempting to shove shite up a hill at a cost of some seven million dollars minimum for approximately 160 houses which are most of the time not occupied incidentally in a sense it 's interesting to come today with this sort of broader issue because it 's to me symptomatic of the problem i guess i can claim the distinction of having written an article way way back that anticipated your current financial crisis and the problem it back then who invited Bob to come along and talk to us and why no in such like the fundamental sort of idea that if you aggregate costs over a huge base then somehow you can all put twenty dollars in a bucket and you can all take forty dollars weather services out the problem with this and you 've seen in the newspaper today about the oval and this that and goodness knows what else is that in the end you 're aggregating so many costs so the rating base I knew he surged this that goodness knows what else that you wind up making the place unaffordable and there was a good article in the paper this week from someone who made that point and if you look at compounding rates increases you 're going to reach the point where people simply can 't afford to live in the city and I look at the situation my new here and then I I know you 're talking about new Brian and suchlike today and you have to say to yourself how can one justify seven million dollars worth go into the long-term plan and be deferred until such time as the council 's financial position hopefully in groves hopefully for all our sakes and then it can be looked at again to see if it 's affordable and to see whether it 's practical I know there 's people who advocate for it my question would be how many people how many submitted said yes off on a hand in the pocket and I 'll make a contribution to that cost if i recall correctly nobody I may be wrong you know you know better than me where that fundamentally is my position I think this is a crazy scheme I 've been associated with it right from the outset with the original hearings and I think it probably should go in that long-term plan for future consideration it 's a challenging issue to address a specific issue like this in the context of the long-term plan it probably should have been a separate hearings panel established to deal with it but you know I was actually looking forward to hearing your submission the other day because it the weight of submissions has actually been the other way around but I cannot for the life of me understand why the previous council didn 't actually put it back on the agenda after the earthquakes I mean the earthquakes changed everything and it was time to have a rethink of everything as we are having to do ourselves which is very very challenging it means that we can 't deliver everything that everyone wants at the same time I 'm Tim the figures that one of the residents gave us were 60 permanent homes with a 111 permanent residences would it be about right do you think I 'm sure does it was 40 40 permanent residents well is 40 occupied you know all year round it affordable homes yes reliable yeah sorry yeah that probably got fairly fair I 'm in the bottom line of where I know is it 's a place that most the time is desert it 's like go still especially the winter and it 's just got that concentration of persons at certain times of the year I 've fell would you say want to affect sewage so in fact their histories and harbors are less polluted would be better to put that and that simple million say into fixing our wastewater schemes but it 's also time at the moment there 's no real evidence there 's a problem there everybody talks about it but I mean the bottom line is you could do various things with septic tanks and bits and pieces for vastly less money no sorry I was also really referring to other parts as a city which you refer to so in fact like because that the heath get is very polluted in the oven that in terms of waste putting waste little structures and we might be bit do you agree we might be better to fix that the pollution on the health care before we try to try the the way noe scheme nothing a hundred percent I mean you 've got concentration of people haven 't you an acute problem you don 't have to be honest and acute problem my new it you have a nice to do down the track but if you spending that sort of money at this particular time I mean it 's crazy I think and obviously people if they 've got a desire to have it will say yeah go ahead and spend it but ask them are you prepared to put your hand in your own pocket and cough out large the answer will be the negative i suspect yanny i 'm one of the interesting things that counter in the submissions as the choice and people were saying that this is to enable a lot more development and y know as then what 's your view on the level of development in y know II currently versus what this may do if it goes ahead well there is I mean they 're always be and you know there are people who want to develop their but at the same time you 've also got to consider our people at junior you 've got to sell those things it 's all very well developing them people need to move out there and purchase holiday homes we can never particular good investments to be honest but yet clearly with the all of this wineries game if you look at rolls-royce type nature which was a term used to describe it originally you 'd have to think that a lot of it is to do with helping developers facilitate subdivision on which I suppose you 'd hoped c 'mon rates revenue and suchlike but whether that 's practical I don 't know you 've got to sell those sections and it 's got to be viable should you be in the business of underwriting people 's I suppose commercial aspirations not in my opinion being a true free marketeer the land thanks very much thank good thanks much _"

    "text": "we 've got you know this is the last day of our hearing so it 's an opportunity for us to hear from the last remaining groups we 're spending most of the morning on the on the New Brighton issues that have been raised so but we 're starting with a number of submissions that unrelated but but obviously very relevant to other aspects of the LTP so the first person I 'd like to bring Florida 's Helen Nesbitt and she 's obviously got calendars got a team of people which I 'm sure she 'll introduced to us I will actually they 're gonna introduce themselves they 're all along very good so basically I 'd like to thank the councillors for this opportunity to present the solution I know today as the last day of what must have been a huge two weeks listening to a variety of people I 'm here as a parent of two daughters who play water polo I will say about the youth who are involved in the sport as you are all aware Christchurch earthquakes had a devastating impact on of water polo in the South Island since the earthquakes pulse pace has been limited to only ten hours a week at Christchurch semi temporary water polo hub at jelly park as a parent I have been heartened by so many parents officials past players and the huge amount of time put into the sport to ensure water polo still existed in Christchurch however I am well aware people are tired and so therefore Canterbury water polo didn 't put on a submission they felt that their submission would have no effect however I 'm an optimist and I 'm sure that counselors will take absolution and to consideration I 'd also like you to carefully listen to these young people as these young people was voices aren 't heard very often and your decisions affect them they only have a small childhood and youth time and so it 's really important that is taken into consideration when you make your very hard decisions thank you hi my name is Natasha Nesbitt I 'm here living at Prince at high school I had my first watercolor listen at Kyoto a High School and was a member of for a watercolor Club her insight high school is currently allowed only one girls team in this secondary school competition due to the allocated full-time giving to secondary school sports this hesitant act on approximately 52 SUNY girls missing out every year and playing water polo even though I 've represented can read last year I was one of those players that missed out on this team this year I was lucky it 's one of the players injured herself so I got to play during the season I went from not making the team to being in the starting six hi my name is Kaylee and I live over in parklands and Ivan I would apply for four years I am reading this letter from a year sevens point of view my name is Lucy Brown and I am 11 years old I am currently in my first year of intermediate I have started playing water polo for the first time I am loving the sport it 's very competitive good for fitness and a great team water sport however with the to play water polo in the winter competition because of limits at all Paul space and time our team could really do with some more practices as I 'm sure many others would too currently we are we only play every second Friday as far as sports goes it is a short season we would really make the most of having another deep pool in Christchurch and more teams can play and practice more often and get the most out of this exciting game Thank You Lucy Brown hi my name 's Laura and I 'm from France at high school I 've been playing water polo for about seven years water polo is not only about playing the sport you love it was about developing yourself as a player coach in arif I currently run water polo for cotton intermediate in him about 65 kids for me having deep water in Canterbury would mean that my 11 year olds would not be in the poet 30 p.m. on a school night the impact of not having a deep water pool would be negative as we offer ever be disadvantaged fit an enough quality training to be competitive there 's a limited pool space looking to the future the long-term plan that the metro facility and Eastern facility we 've built and the earliest and 2018 in the latest at 2025 we need those facilities now it should not take like so long to build a pool if the council could couldn 't_:_313.88 both the poles earlier then please give us more time deep water protonic jelly pot thank you for listening and do you have any questions yeah I 'm not familiar with the arrangements I mean obviously I 've I know that water polo was played in the diving pool at qe2 because a friend of mine was in the water polo team back then back in the day so what so so what other facilities were available before the earthquakes was it just a qe2 or did you also play it Gerry part I would more qe2 was the South Island harp so most South Island competitions nish there were a lot of national competitions happening there as well but they had jelly park as a training back you know they 've lost that one deepwater facility which was not new multi-use whereas jelly it has lots and lots of demands on art and so hence water polo is only given ten hours do you think do you think that they 've they 've only affected and the diving aspect and haven 't affected and the water polo when they 've looked at the assessment for the Metro um I don 't know no no that what I 'm saying is is the small numbers diving has their impacted on the decision not to include a diving facility which is actually also award a polo facility concept there is the ability to play partition off the big pool to play water polo in there right it 's a competition with other other activities I think it 's our understanding that when there 's no specific 35 meter pool planned anywhere at this at the moment and I mean I think that the development of the new complex at qe2 possibly has the ability to add that sort of pull through their complex which would probably overcome a I don 't know the specs and others deeper qe2 complex hasn 't hasn 't been scoped entirely yet but certainly my intention to probably try and get a 35 meter pool deep water pool in that complex which would then accommodate don 't mind we 're at us yep we don 't mind what it looks like on the outside we we just need well these kids need that deep water area and there 's nowhere and Canterbury so for competitions they either have to go down to the meter or they are to Wellington right were you ain 't consulted in any way by the other people doing the metro sports facility I can 't comment because I 'm here as a parent we haven 't had the water polo and I mean I 've got the blessing of water polo Canterbury but I cannot say that yes I know because I think I thank you very much I 've just yeah well we 'll get some advice on that yeah I mean we can 't obviously make any more commitments today but thank you very much for young people speaking so you know positively about a aspect of what they do so take _"

    "text": "specs of your submission that relate to the long-term plan and not about you know central government or anything like that if you could just focus on well on a lot on the council stuff council but there is a little port ex-employee no not really no we 're not we 're not ready to yeah we 're not really doing politics on this occasion if you could just stick to the council staff what first is three rulers freebase to inflation he 's in st. lupus there 's free rates of inflation there 's two percent he can sit down you can 't sit down you some hot if you prefer to stand baseline the three rates of inflation is two percent eight percent of fifteen percent in New Zealand now I 'll tell you something what is heavy good people I won 't mention names I get this get this fricking see any every year that 's the highest sales commission oh you mean the remuneration authority and it 's actually a fix account fixer right she was like yeah let me tell you what 's going to foreign sales and dollars a year here on out of it or not not anymore why they will be good too but they used T they were getting two million dollars yeah I destroyed illustrate my point you all right a person who 's say that social welfare benefits ain 't getting 300 and all they get is 360 and 10 years hmm and I I pass it doubles the money hmm yeah so you 're going to get money from somewhere mm-hmm so what I 'm going to suggest to you is why not silly assets so all yeses if they 're not producing as a satisfactory income that return another fish they should begin twenty-five percent on your assets because inflation through chemistry and I 'll see that oh no no you know we have we 've got the issue of asset sales on our table so you think we should sell them all or do you think we should prioritize if they 're not producing money to serve one are they are producing money no I 'll tell you what to do with them on email this I 'm doing the way and you put the money in the gold and you lend it out we say Helen this is this the Magic this is imagine on one on one else of gold using your hot dog sorry you can make it you 've made a number times well actually the council 's not allowed to do that we 're not allowed to lend money we 're certainly allowed to borrow money i mean look i really want to just help you oh yeah Oh what else just use form of training me okay we 're not allowed to we 're governed by the load of them no no we 're governed by the local government eggs if you say am I going I haven 't practiced as a lawyer for a very long time but I do know that we don 't legally have the power to set up a trading bank I 'd love to but you know I don 't get that right why not because the law doesn 't allow local government a 2002 this will make you more money yep it Joe of people out dollars and see them pay member coin oh yeah you 're set your save millions your save millions yeah you 're young it 's an altera said what are you buy-in bank charge watch your turn that 's big hold a million billion sorry 600 600 billion million I Somali let 's got a better money you know hmm one percent of that well said hmm one percent of 600 million yeah that 's my last yes to put money that but I think what you said look I understand where you 're coming from but unfortunately we don 't get to kind of play the market we can restructure it please or your poor the market we can we can restructure our deed which might be something that we should look here but I don 't_''_280.91 I don 't think that we can we can 't set up a trading bank we can 't we 'll just have the cooler turning very quiet yeah what you mustn 't Jewish finance or vice yeah oh you 're make buckets of money I 'm not kidding you i compound interest I 'm sure the right pairs of crash Shh would be very grateful than someone 's coming yet telling us how to make money instead of how to spend money pretty clear here tonight today spinning biome oh yeah that 's right that 's right chris is where does it come from well that 's right it comes from the right path and and ratepayers you know are expecting us to balance a very difficult set of figures at the moment and it 's what we 're trying to do um but you used to make a lot of you can make a lot of money up you surely can we 'd love to be outside but anyway we look with read your submission at some very detailed and you 've got lots of ideas in there and see the list thing is this country is going to bowl over I 'm telling them how hearing it from the Jewish people yeah well a bowl over like up the calliphoridae speed percent weight increases I know it 's just terrible this is crazy yo obviously these people and know I know it there 's just that it 's out of control really a drive really the Jewish people say is that the sales overseas which make note they don 't want it well the last time it happened it was the global financial crisis and we 'll do what that did a thing about this weapon was a queue breaks yeah yeah well things that things are obviously not good not good but you you will appreciate that I don 't know I know you you 'll appreciate that unlike the last submitter you are the last semester and you are you are the one true so that 's holding us up from joining the meeting until we come back to at nine o 'clock tomorrow morning or but look we hit Regis emotion we 'll hear from you you 've really given it your best shot and we really appreciate the fact that you 've come along and I 'm sorry you weren 't feeling so good we 're on no but thank you for sitting back and waiting and and

    "text": "I 'm entry at page 30 sorry thank you that 's right rigea great yes yes I 'd like to think the council isn 'ta me the opportunity um I 'm a mainboard crashing shamed still if it concerns were you know obviously increasing rates and roads are being repaired so I 'm don 't want to be too blunt but it 's gonna start within another nod and analogy if we consider an individual who didn 't earn enough money to pay the bills and he 'd been hot horse and they drive and get him to vigil presented to the event miniature a solution to liquidate via dividend earning investments and music money to buy a Ferrari your instant reaction would be that 's ridiculous but that 's exactly what it 's really been proposed to you today the stadium the sports facilities the libraries they 're all really the Ferraris costing more to run them they reproduce it might then like they 're all nice to haves but a Toyota Corolla would also get you from A to B so do we need these projects on such answer i think it 's known as an example is the bus it change 53 million dollars today before 2000 you just had signs on the side of the road you know cost of thousands it then you have a 10 million dollar exchange that really became a hangout for teenagers now you 've got a 53 million dollar facility on 1.4 hectares that 's designed to cater for seventy thousand users and one the interesting things is that if it is simply thousand users by 2040 one that that single story exchange is going to be likely to be wanted for development because the land will be so valuable that 1.4 hit desert sitting on in at the ant 70,000 users a day then you didn 't need such a big scheme so either way it 's not really a long-term project you didn 't need to spend that much money to for that solution it 's the same way on these other facilities as well instead of building a whole pool pump makes why not just all part of the pool complex start with one Paul if we it these are already over a hundred million dollars and savings why build a a one hit da floor area library land that costs six to seven thousand dollars a square meter which 27 million just for the land when 150 meters away and these frame the crown was acquiring the land for under a thousand dollars a square meter that means you could get a 4,000 square meter single story library including land for perhaps 15 million dollars another 60 million dollar saving why not why not staged the building of the library over the next 10 or 20 years so I 've been blunt fear with it but I just trying to save it these facilities it 's much more than we need right now and then the immediate term if it 's excels are applied why was why you 're selling the port the airport which produce good dividends when you 're keeping 21 house 2,100 housing units there are perhaps with 420 million dollars in losing essentially ball if you include depreciation losing money but even if you don 't include depreciation I think they 're with rents this the operating expenses if you change to market rents you could double the income you guess that would be 15 million dollars initially more should actually cut rates by 5% just by probably putting those household those housing units to market rents the government provides subsidies this via roll the accommodation supplement would would would cover those amounts the other option is to is to sum of a number of those flex to pay off debt or to avoid selling other assets that produced Evelyn 's essentially at the moment for every 50 households in Christchurch one is subsidizing a council won 't flat which to me doesn 't sound particularly fair on right pairs yep no the rates don 't clap is 400 say 400 million dollar asset that 's that 's not returning any income no from not from mate so I 'm saying this account solicit so I know the social the social aspect of it but but in saying there 's also a role for central government and when you can 't afford something dear speaks and compromises somewhere the third the third to development contributions and that redevelopment contributions but look very low end of housing increase incredibly high you give 21 million dollars from development Confucians which averaged thirty thousand dollars per unit there 's only 700 units obviously refer more sections and they developed the violent Confucians large subdivisions pay a very small yet individual subdivisions paid very considerable amounts which means is actually since that policy was introducing about 2007 you haven 't had a supply of cheaper sections coming to the market which is actually pushed more need for social housing which as I outlined earlier costs more money for the council to provide if there was a beleriand cheaper development Confucians for cheaper houses you didn 't think at the rates coming in from those properties suffers say fifteen thousand and stay of 30,000 for on a 90 or 100 thousand dollars fiction at the very bottom into sub provided backyard if it was fifteen thousand seven thirty thousand then you getting extra 1,500 rates riven your year is paying for itself by encouraging that allotment so their viewers there is an advantage in HD having lower dollars development competition or ninety thousand dollar section those developments just don 't happen so overall my my point of the submission now has just been um very brief to make sure the castle wants to focus on repairing roads and which the the actual things we pay rates for and not buying Ferraris that 's the big facilities the huge sports stadium ously the Eva even the film at the swimming pools the libraries that all facilities everyone wants to use and everyone wants but do we all need them right away in the next five years think about staging them smaller smaller amounts speak now or just delaying them into the future we survived for five years without those facilities delaying them or staging is not going to be a huge impediment to the progress of Christchurch and I think the kinds of rates increases that are being proposed at the longer term and the sale of ethics that produce income which edition of course more rates increases it 's going to be more negative then a delay in those facilities Dingle Thank You Christian I meant that one on on Friday diet but everyone 's been listening to your submission as you age appeared and you 're done that which you can understand that we 've got major challenges and I know I 'm just I 'm just suggesting that it may be some of those big ticket items can be delayed or renegotiated or just to avoid those big rates increases I mean we 're going to do everything that we can to do that so thank you very much okay thank you and mr. Topher do you want to come forward now are you are you feeling okay okay lots more circles organ court actually yeah this is nowhere near like cause we 're not going to cross-examine you at all that 's for sure below version yeah but it but I might rule on the relevance of your evidence so if you would like to focus very much on _"

    "text": "this is what I 'm sure everybody thank you for Henry speak today my name is Katie Nomo and I live close to the powerful Heathcott River in a small suburb called warm out for 10 years and I 'm hoping to end your day with something that 's a little bit different in positive my submission to you today will focus mainly on the apparel Hall Heathcott River and its relevance to the long term plan the desire to protect and enhance Christchurch city 's urban rivers had never been stronger than now and this was demonstrated last weekend when our two weekends ago and it 's this just as most commonly expressed by high levels involvement by local residents and river cleanups those cleanups particularly run by the brewery or the tannery the most ambitious clean up to date was held earlier this month in just a couple of hours volunteers volunteers pulled three point three tons of rubbish out of the river in an area that streets from the history all the way up to st. Martin 's so that map up there demonstrates the length of rubbish was pulled out of the hour I 'd like you to know that we care about their powerful heathcott river there 's been a lot of activity bubbling around underneath the surface for the last 12 months and June last year a workshop about their power Hall was attended by over 40 community representatives guided walks are popular I 've run to a guided walks myself over the last 12 months and they were well attended Facebook page and use Lisa subscriptions are growing and there are five community groups running hands-on projects for years and different parts of the catchment perhaps most significantly a workshop is being planned for June this year to establish a hold of river Network which will start to draw out all of that activity into a very public interface that community leaders are discovering a very strong currently untapped community interest in the restoration of the Apollo horoscope River and this must be integrated into a long-term planning for the future of Christchurch a key message here is that investment by council in the Apollo Hall will be supported by community goodwill and grounded and informed informed by a genuine partnership with communities located with an attachment and there is an unlimited potential for a source to see concept for their power Hall that could significantly enhance the character and livability of the south and the east of Christchurch a shirred pathway for cyclists and pedestrians located along the river would be the backbone of such a source to DC experience and would connect key Christchurch attractions such as the Christchurch biking adventure park the tannery woolston village Heathcott village in the fury Mead heritage park this constant also supports support sustainable appropriate local economic development with unlimited potential to connect to local businesses and schools and it 's my feeling that these aspirational qualities must be enshrined in the long-term plan and I strongly support the concepts of a cycle way up along the river you might be wondering why we 're suddenly landing in an Auckland this is a picture of the wenyard quarter if you haven 't visited it I strongly recommend that you do next time you 're up in Auckland they lower part of your power Hall in understood and can offer a rich visitor experience of a special part of christ church that has a unique identity here are very there are many interesting and varied empty surfaces in spaces on large industrial buildings cited along the river which could be activated by artists sculptures and landscape architects and I really do believe that Wilson has the patina become the wind yard quarter of Christchurch so in the summary document there is a question what will it take to transform our rivers and it lists of the whole range of remediation options and activities on page 58 I don 't want to go through all of those I just want to say yes to all of those options and activities and a very big strong yes but there 's a few details I want to pick out around there one is that I think it 's important that there is equitable and expenditure investment across the different catchments which optimized to reflect the unique characteristics of the different rivers however it isn 't it all clear if this is the case in the long-term plan for example Avon auto car door precinct and central Christchurch from another bucket of money in a cost sharing agreement with the City Council and crown however I feel that this is disproportionate expenditure for a relatively small part of the Iron River it is also highly disproportionate expenditure across the entire waterway networks in Christchurch overall sorry we were just smiling because we actually agree oh thank goodness for the hit we were everywhere we went love you wait here when somebody said that was a good idea all right okay fuel the key point here i want to emphasize is that the Apollo home must no longer be viewed is the poor cousin to the auto car door and even both of those rivers have similar sized catchments so I would like to see similar investments going to both of those catchments technical solutions are only part of our technical solutions are only part of the picture funding for community engagement in a cable training put that on where those sorts immediately I don 't think people know that by washing the car and having it all go and they 't do no they don 't so we 're going to we 're going to put I 'm just instructing Vicky to put it on Facebook and me okay all right thanks yeah don 't do this if you wash this and that drains you might as well be standing in our pristine River in putting it straight in the river yes yeah I 'm actually an interesting and interesting unattended impact I 'm sorry this isn 't the in submission it 's easy to communicate those the intensification of our urban areas is that if there if people have leased space yep they 're not going to have grass to wash their cars on that 's right so I think it would be brilliant to have a little part but somewhere and most suburbs for people to go and wash their cars but anyway I 'm sorry yeah no no no recently on page 58 of the summary document it has noted that a range of behavioral changes by individuals for example washing cars on grass but it will be required to restore our rivers widespread sustained behavioural change this behavior change programmes required properly resourced consistent social marketing in the appropriate community engagement you just can 't_''_451.86 do one thing without the other however it isn 't clear to me of these community engagement and behavioural change programs are included at all in the LTP and to achieve this adequate funding for these activities for all waterways and Christchurch must also be included in the long-term plan ok back to the 0 power Hall I want to refer to specific lines of the budget now ones 880 which is the waste water heathcott and where the overflow reduction compared to other budget items associated with the Apollo Hall this is by far the largest investment in the river it is essential that any measures funded through this mechanism must achieve multiple outcomes for the river such as improving water quality and protecting and enhancing ecological communities along the entire length of the catchment the ecological ecological damage caused by the horse and cat must not be repeated anywhere along the river at all ever there has been a linear plan for the mid and I would like to aspirations for a boulder landscape then we live in a different world now so let 's go back to that and have another look at it ID 1972 the budget initially I strongly support the funding of the major cycle way for the Apollo whole river and I applaud their counsel for initiating this I 'm really excited about it actually however I note that the budget allocated to the 0 power river route is nowhere near as compact comparable to that of the oven cycle route yet traffic engineering solutions required to make a safe cycle route along the Apollo Hall may be complex and expensive this is because cyclists will be traveling through a more urbanized and traffic dense area than that the pros proposed avon river park this could require significant investment and i 'd like to seduce that budget initially allocated to the head cut river and the avon river cycle routes should be comparable and reallocated as the route and true costs a determined over time ID to 1132 compared to the mud Heathcott the lower heathcott has received little investment from the council for the Apollo Hobart road bridge we 're riparian strips of Chevy and damaged plus the recreational amenities of very poor compared to those upstream of their power bridge and this photo shows a significant historical site and a really has significant historical site on the corner of Richardson terrace and fury road which is neglected and poorly maintained and this is where we need to have more investment go into not just that site but all the way down to the Pharaoh Meade heritage park the Muisca area has received prior investment through the implementation of the mud heathcott linear plan it has allocated approximately thirty percent more than the lower heathcott at minimum investment should be allocated equally to both areas or the lower Heathcott should receive more funding and recognition of prior investment and the mud heathkit almost finished um ID 2113 to the lower heath get master plan implementation I was really excited to see this but it made me feel a bit anxious nearly a million dollars is proposed to be spent on the lower Heathcott master plan implementation in just one year with no and to spending the summer in the lower heathcott as puzzling and communities and stakeholders associated with this area must be consulted appropriately before the money is spent without sound justification the investment should be equitable spread over time and along the length of the lower heads get not just in one discrete area ID 1939 eight we need good transparency for the three distinctly different elements of the storm water plan to enable communities to make informed comments about investment in each ste and the kothe coast and the health get stormwater management plan will require quite different techniques and strategies and approaches and I would like to see that very carefully unpacked and may transparent to the community my last slide rivers are our well-being and there are our future city living needs balancing with a mess of natural areas to maintain physical mental and spiritual well-being to make Christ route to 25th century city we need to turn our rivers from drains and two attractive regenerative natural areas with there 's a really exciting potential for Christchurch to rebrand as a city of rivers which to some extended been properly valued or recognized and now is the opportunity so on behalf of the power of youth get river I thank you for your time and consideration of the submission and I really look forward to our future of our rivers and thank you very much I 'm sorry but there aren 't I 've got another submitter so I can 't really take questions and I know that I mean yeah I know that people are going to give you double thumbs up it was a great and exciting so better than the way I wish it was submission for the next was so powerful and positive thank you but I 'm sure we 're going to be looking forward to working with you on on on that submission excellent brilliant Christian Jordan _"

    "text": "good afternoon okay you 're rocking sure they have in front of them our submission okay Kenny Canterbury sounds a lot of flesh to them what it is it 's a Facebook group with about 50 members currently okay so who I 'm here to hopefully offer a win-win because I know what the people get down on the council about what they haven 't done it 's really easy to do but hopefully I 'll provide the solution okay over the last four years we 've been quite stressed but the just the basic commute across town um I got back from Melbourne about a year ago to do my instructor 's rating it 's quite charming having to learn the potholes around town I 'm pretty sure most of you have done it but at the end of the day gets quite tiresome so in front of you you see the submission and we 're looking at high speed rail now I understand a feasibility study was done and high-speed rail wasn 't on the air as far as I could see normal route was but high speed wasn 't the payment we 're doing through the work on ray Lampe we felt he can the leading a further study to back at work til to follow up and what already be done ok but the the studies that they looked at were hell it would work say from regular and and hope we say coming in in input possibly two from Ralston so that was as far as it got okay I didn 't find that one yeah but only I mean anything compared to the roads at the moment would be high speed right okay so Queensland have high-speed rail and they were on the same gauge we r which is 1067 millimeter ale okay it 's not over why then generally hasn 't been conducive to to a high-speed rail until the tilt train has created which reached reaches speeds of up to 200 kilometers an hour if we could have that rocking around the city I think life would be a lot easier on the commute and you can see in the system section three i think it is on the first page the us the 60,000 people to the south and the 35,000 people to the north I know a lot of people say that we don 't have the population to I guess substantiate having rail but the rail was already there Wellington have a comprehensive rail system with a population of 380,000 Canterbury 's christchurch to the alone has 375 with the surrounding areas 500,000 people live in the camry area so we 're be utilizing the Queensland Rail model which is the tilt train with the capacity of 300 people and top speed of 200 kilometers our way to help through here those running mostly between rolleston and ronnie or with another three Rijo swinger type which also run up to 160 kilometres now now here 's the money going to be made the tell trains which would run across the city during the peak hours in the morning we 've sent out to the lights of Dunedin green Mouse and picton the Dunedin trip would take two hours and 15 minutes which puts us in the realm of taking a plane so on the next page you 'll see the service over the distance and going from city center to city center it is comparable to take in a plane within your zealand so it would be in direct competition with also along those routes enter city would be affected and other bus operators the land demand along those routes would increase which would love a demand on the city and the city 's infrastructure itself so it 's the tilt trains that leave the city throughout the day there will be the biggest income generators what will be left behind will be the three swinger type commuter trains which would take care of the off-peak and should be able to do it fine coming back into the city the tilt trains across the city again and take care of the peak traffic on the way home so we 're multitasking the trains which is how you make the best profit Alabama conservatively I estimated thirty to forty million dollars a year and profit of the tilt trains alone so I 'll give to the conclusion and the everyday movement of commuters students and entertainment seekers if the everyday to the CCC coffers while providing a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution is this not a win-win situation of an entire intelligence society Canterbury is there is the ideal shape to build a super region a better and more efficient setup than the super city and rail with Halpert reckless I don 't think that you find any disagreement around the table Kelly two quick questions firstly if it 's so obvious and such a no-brainer as you 've laid out here why has it not been looked at so now the mess about a cost yeah okay yep also did you see the story on Campbell the other night and huntley with the housing that had opened up on line from Auckland to huntley I heard something about it didn 't see it so no my question is because you 've referred to that and hear that this could be a way to address our affordable housing us you could not yep yeah absolutely and live an ugly yeah well I believe the problem was what the Hunley situation the Hamilton to Auckland as I 'm looking at reintroducing of seventy to eighty kilometers an hour yep but the issue was it 's still fast at Auckland and also the problem at the moment is that the trains don 't actually stopped as they go through Huntley which means people can 't buy cheaper housing and commute to Auckland using the train which is the issue and that was being referred to here yeah and my initial submission there i put it online you 'll see that the stops are Amberleigh ringing for a cowboy belfast Northlands motivate Eddington we will finish yeah so I would anticipate ashburton to Amberleigh yeah the inner city Mona Vale Eddington Middleton and home be and coming through the other direction from a little town you 'd have heathcote Linwood which is a little bit both of his net and here it 's still use evington and put one in at morehouse like it used to be it is in the middle of nowhere but it would serve us hagley quite easily at services the yeah put one of them white house yeah oh but but in terms of in terms of the wait until the weekend report comes but it is something that 's on the agenda I mean we 've all raised questions with the with kiwirail about it you know that yes our gauge will take high speed yes our gauge will take light rail so there are a range of options but in terms of accessing that that line you know there are as you say huge capital costs in both but you know it 's something that I don 't think it 's going to go away especially if our region grows is it potentially could over time yes you can ask one final question because it 's not even time yet we were so to borrow the the cable car although the trains from Wellington Wilshere than or whatever we already have the Trix whether it 's from da field or Rolleston or H Burton or embley etcetera we have all that many stops because they haven 't been taken away because if you could take the trends Alpine takes a week to get to the Alps because they stopped me free free cup of tea to that we could negotiate at kiwiRail so what is the huge cost and doing this because of with bits year that transit New Zealand going to spend hundreds of million dollar on on roading yeah if we transfer debt to the round it will with a huge cost would be the rolling stock a tilt train on its own is anywhere from fifty to a hundred million dollars by itself but if we skip the fast trains and borrowed slow trains if you like or help I really like but right rather starting with the flesh model we start with steps and and go from there this is where the feasibility study kicks in and i think a lot of people would just go through like maybe maybe but it would be a lot harder to generate the sort of interest required to actually push that model okay it 's it 's all about speed in this day and age we were rail travellers once and then the car came along where we can do a hundred kilometers an hour to attract and seventy sorry we will change thank you mo _"

    "text": "oh so this Donovan first of all just thanks so much sure it 's been a long wait for everyone and you 've done pretty well staff you 're fine once I cut is what I can help and so I think I want to discuss today it 's an issue of consultation which is obviously why we 're all here what I mean by this is the process by which these decisions have been reached the liver of gagement with the public and how much real space for engagement there had been foot but input and changed to the plane in other words what is consultation many pregnancy so I recently watched a TED talk called how to upgrade democracy in the Internet era the basic idea of this TED talk is that we 're 21st century citizens trying our hardest to interact with the 90 19th century design institutions such as the council that is based upon information technology of the 15th century so they argue on the talk this kind of system only produces two kinds of results silence or noise that isn 't it 's not frustrated at the Selective meaningful engagement feel like there are any options or public protests petitions or other forms of adversarial politics to me it seems like the 18th century slogan that was the basis very modern democracy no taxation without representation should now be updated to no representation without a conversation we want to see at the table we want to sit at your table another key idea that I think we should engage with this how we can use technology to inspire public debate through this create many forms of democratic engagement if we play this concept to the way councils are currently engaging with these citizens there are some positive development Wellington Francis is using lumio which is an online platform for decision-making they use this to the alcohol management strategy done innocent City Council 's currently accepting Facebook and Twitter comments is official feedback yet it seems to me that the Christchurch City Council has by and large stuck to old models of engagement focusing on getting feedback through town hall meetings and for men formal written feedback which I 'm sure you 'll be aware or the I said an older generation I mean how many young people want to go to a meeting in a drafty Town Hall especially when they think this is likely to have no impact so I think as a result of this there 's a sense of disillusionment and dis can 't between what the community is saying and what is actually being implemented within the plan what has been engaged within the consultation preset process including the current focus on asset sales which is perceived as being predetermined this perception i think is reinforced by the fact that this seems to be attempts to limit sort of alternatives such as the people 's choice plan which i think during a consultation process all options should be on the table because this provokes her healthy debate and also gives scope for public and put into the plan so we know what the alternatives are and as we will know this plan has critical significance for the city it 's probably the most important play in it we 've ever looked at so as i mentioned there 's a disconnect city i have to say and the community wants to needs this feeling as you I 'm sure you 're well aware by now is particularly strong in the East which is where I 'm from I think Anna City blueprint is a prime example of this lack of meaningful engagement and disconnect between what the government wants and community needs I think it 's remarkable that over two and a half years that it took to design a ting inner-city projects there was only four moments of public engagement this includes a design of a park and then it clued a transport plan and our playground apart from this is ben nguoi public engagement on inner-city stuff there 's got a 500 million dollar convention center half of which has been paid by the taxpayers which includes ratepayers here 100 million dollar river park major bus station and development of public squares which for the most part haven 't_''_267.42 been debated at all i don 't think it 's all doom and gloom i acknowledge that the council 's made some effort to go to the public the counselors for engagement and through this people of Christchurch have clearly indicated what they want I think first of all nice it sells people said that they don 't wanna sit cells or they 're not in a position to make an informed decision about X who sells which i think is not surprising given the fact that many of the counselors here have campaigned on a platform of nice it and there isn 't actually been much space for debate around that apart from five minutes here or rest of consultations second of all I think people want basic repairs to the roads i live in new brighton i think it 's it 's quite appalling really that i live in new brighton and the city on that side of the town feels like it did I imagine post-quake and then you go to the other side of the city in it you 'd think that earthquake never happened and thirdly more cycleways I mean that 's sort of something that really should be front and center I think we should just be replacing what we have but actually upgrading what we 're looking for is 50 50 years into the future really so what I 'm saying is the answers are basically already there we 've already told you what we want as I 've said nice it sells and we want things like the cost sharing agreement renegotiated I understand that 's a complex issue but it is something it 's about the council making a stand and telling the government that we need to take control of this process as my father said yesterday I would say that i would call upon you councillors to make sure that all of this feedback which provides a clear direction for the city is actually incorporated into the long-term plan and isn 't just empty noise I would argue that this public feedback such a stronger opposition to asset sales a call foot call for greater and put into the design of the central city which ref highlighted the other day a greater focus of renewal not just rebuilding the east side and a development of public transform cycle routes must be a key focus of this budget appreciate your any comments oh okay I guess that feeds into my comments about consultation for a little bit thank you whew time ya go yeah yeah thank you _"

    "text": "not here sorry if I gone to the wrong page Colleen so there 's none here you two free night and I saw what you said they weren 't here ah oh ah sorry sorry sorry I misunderstood Jeffrey night page 174 thank you good afternoon I want to speak in philly general terms against selling off public assets and I think this is a we should start off by recognizing this as an ideological thing is not rational and I would like the council to be clear about that in particular not feigning reluctance to sell assets I know one or two counselors have spoken in favor in general of selling assets whether or not the city is in financial strife I 've seen the numbers to 1.2 billion from Rob Cameron I am old enough to remember that name from the 1980s and who famously set on both sides of the table whilst I 'm getting rid of telecom I would query using an investment company to come up with the scale of the debt and I do hear that only a very small portion of that is and you 'd get her accountancy company and what is there to quantify that even if we did except at one point two billion years the issue of at the time frame over which that is due the bill did you of some of our out layers happening over the timeframe of decades then there 's no immediate pressure to sell assets i 'll also be wanting to compare that figure with comparable cities I do hear that the 1.2 billion sounds a lot when you say a quick but we are a fairly significant city it 's not out of proportion to other cities I do think it 's a fundamental responsibility of the council to maintain and enhance our asset base in general I think that leads to numerous economic and social benefits and not not to be underestimated is the effect that it has on democracy its been meaningless having the vote of the organization you 're voting for has no arms and legs to actually put anything into a fit Thank to abdicate that responsibility can only increase cynicism and alienation and undermine democracy I think alone the City Council going the same way I think if you look at societies that do run on private lines and have very little public ownership I think you see societies that are in trouble I 'm thinking particularly at the moment of the United States and I think you would be buying future trouble if you were to go down that road I think now that prime responsibility of the council is to look after the interests of the citizens particularly the most vulnerable I think you 're losing the ability to control that once you get rid of the assets I think that the selling of assets is prioritizing the wealthier interests of the wealthy and as of seem rather than submission I think they 're prioritizing the needs of the wealthy whether or not whether or not individual counselors benefit from that in any material way there 's a form of corruption that 's not what counselors here for I think I have heard some councillors putting in some work to come up with other plane I realize that the tough battle with the central government if you did take on it battle you get a lot of public support I think you should be applying some pressure the other way not just catering is the dominant I the market ideology is the dominant ideology at the moment it might not always be so and I think you get a lot of public support of you stood up against it I do think cry teachers had a double whammy with the earthquakes and with the national government being in power I think it 's really up to you to make sure that you 're not making it a triple whammy Christchurch 's down and you shouldn 't be kicking it that leaves you 30 seconds to reply not reply but ask question yes yes please she 's family does anyone have a question no pretty clear pretty clear thank you so like you sit are you really saying that in terms of like the proposal that is in the LTP comes across as like based on ideology rather than the sums yes because the songs themselves aren 't trustworthy like the 1.2 billion also I don of your assets because you 're getting rid of future income scream thank you _"

    "text": "property manager for the Ministry of Education covering the South Island so I 'll come out this big slowly up appreciate up going accent and I 'm not precious boy originally so just bear with me that 's like gives anybody hadn 't noticed my father was born under need meds okay I 'm the ministry of education is concerned around the policy 3 by 4 point 2 which is concerned the development contributions which in the clause example in a crown from paying development contributions but not non crown providers so and I don 't believe that 's what the council had it in mind by way of background the 2009 19 policy comparable clause three point three point four wear crowns landlord it is exempt from playing from pain DC 's the next iteration of policy was a 30-22 which is what is currently in force and this is quite different and including a sentence not all government bodies can be defined as a crowned including chart or any great skills development undertaken by those bodies me require development contribution in using that policy one of the early charging founded contribution of thirty three thousand dollars for the development kids first and diamond harbour they approached the council discussed the council who sought legal advice and were told that that 's appropriate the new policy change stipulates private developments on crown land line and not exempt for pain development contributions our concern is that there 's a real chance that that could prevent future development of early childhood facilities on crown land land and certainly doesn 't support the council 's lifelong learning policy so we believe that that that is an actually clarification which is how it 's worded it 's actually a change and we would suggest that actually if there was to be changed it should be changing the opposite way that education providers on coming online don 't pay all the contributions but if you 've got a private school then it pays development contributions if the private school builds on public land then you say they should be exempt my concern is around early childhood providers especially well it 's pretend we 're talking about charter schools okay that a better you know exactly the same education you know down the road I mean why would you why would you have two different rules because I believe not sorry well certainly I think early childhood providers who enough of profit organizations and while at court kids first here they a lot of early child providers aren 't profit that it could well hinder their provision of service we give them the land I think to your use of the land and thirty three thousand dollars could significantly impact on an early childhood provider being able to provide that education in an area I didn 't think that the supplied to early childhood centers that were not for profit so so if the wording were explicit that that was not that they were exempt as well so that they were under the existing policy is that the way well the existing policies still alive tell me the example you use its diamondharbour kid kids first kindergarten Emma when we say sorry when did that happen the sectional here they had to hand over the payment 32,000 in December just gone December 2014 and they a certificate of compliance and what which school site were they on diamondharbour our diamond have a school all right that would agree with you if it 's if not for profit organizations were exempt then I think that would be fair right okay yep after would that mean that early childhood facilities like kids first which are clearly not for profit that they would be exempt but like clearly win some early childhood centers are open up just as a private organization that in fact they would have to pay that you should pay the disease I would because as a whole whole lot of them have opened up the last few years yeah more in the future yeah I think that would the current policy does allow the flexibility I don 't think that flexibility is being used if I 'm honest while certainly wasn 't in this this instance and I think it should be allow some flexibility around the need because what they can 't get a license from us unless there is a need in the community so if there 's a significant need in could work with yourselves around what were they what they exempt or not but the current change just says now full stop you have to pay yeah all right so we 'll take some further advice on that but thank you very much for your pretty neat to it appreciate the time especially especially changing my time to now when I couldn 't make earlier in the week but very happy today say like thank you and _"

    "text": "the East Christchurch water sports community trust David Goodman hi idea thank you so yes my name 's David urban tier of the each cottage water sports community trust we 've made a written submission reason we 're here today is the trust is concerned about the east of Christchurch and the revitalization of the east and the use of that land that 's obviously is owned by the crown and what to do next the trust is promoting a project to project as a community asset immunity for Christchurch people East and also a flat water sports facility in one you 've had that fetcher I think distributed it 's a very high level indicative picture but it 's just to give you an idea of what we 're talking about the lake will be to the left of the river at won 't connect with the river because of different water quality issues we 're looking to avoid going near pirate park ideally we 'll be 2.2 kilometers long so commune international rowing course but also waka ama cable boarding all sports p class picnic area cycleway you open to the public it 's a community asset something that we feel the eastern Christchurch deserves so that the nub of our submission is this 6.3 million dollars tagged in your plan for a espera crazy to help with recovery of the yeast and our simple submission errs is leave that money there we 're not asking you for money yet but at some point we 'll come to you and I think it 's very important that I know that money is tight that sum of money has lived here because there 'll be us and there 'll be other projects no doubt that are looking to do to do good things out there and that 's really better we 've got questions term and then Paul thank you David have you been talking to other sporting bodies with regards to this project you mentioned that right across those borders should be a community because you certainly so there are number for trustees got a broad range of trustees into their professional skills but also Julian felon who CEO of sport Canterbury is trusting he represents the the you know the community component mountains the sporting community sport component Julian is a conduit to Jerry Dwyer who 's you know chairman Musil and rowing the likes of Ian buses will use white water so we 're connected through all the sport through Julian falloon but it was felt appropriate just to have Julian is a trustee representing all sport because it 's not just about rowing or school it 's about a community project of which involved a number of activities in sports this one more yeah I most recently New York and at the end of the Manhattan Island rizzoli Harlem etc and is a rowing club here with one of the universities is a movie stand I cannot remember the mary has now set up an Academy for kids in Harlem to start rolling is and so I 'm different they 're really going to be any of those types of things for kids across a chore yes one of the I guess part of our vision is a lake for for Christchurch fennel and young people and visitors so when the key focuses young people schools lower decile schools that are not actively involved and you know what is sometimes perceived as elite sports like rowing get involved you know so that the mary has delivered high schools you know surely which all his orion club you know they get involved and it 's a good sporting immunity for them to us to assist with the revitalization of the area so that 's very much and a nursing team Paul well I just do you guys have any idea what that would cost to admit that was my question yes well we I mean yeah the budget the budget for the lady Isaac like was was 10 million this one it was years ago that was years ago this one will be more because of a lot more because of the geotechnics so you know digging the hole is is about four dollars in cubic meter you 're looking at eight million sorry you looking at sort of two million cubic meters healing about eight million to dig the hole but the real issue is is the engineering around it Greg CD estimator needs to we don 't know that until we 've done all the engineering and design so unfortunately it 's chicken and egg to get to an accurate costing you 'd have to spend a considerable sum and design and engineering so it 's a bit of a chicken and egg and we don 't feel we can spend that money until we have a mandate from the people of Christchurch so we 're waiting for the red zone consultation once there 's the red zone consultation will go up the idea of people are keen on the idea then we can say well look it 's worth pursuing further but yeah answer this it is you that knows I don 't want to get caught in a finger I wasn 't it yeah but it 's not just the capital cos it 's the ongoing operating costs as well all the old already who would pay that because I mean I know that there was there 's a lake and Perth that n you know we 're a lot of preliminary work identified some of the costings but they never factored rotax tend to lean ideally the landscaping will you know be such that you don 't attract those sort of wildlife but the costs are running a water facility like that very much a big body of water won 't attract ducks and Geeks what pins on that if you have lots of grass at will but if you please grass and didn 't in a white I mean it 's an issue about the landscaping as to type of boots you attract and but to answer your question water bodies least costly to run them parks so you know Central Park in Europe and cost 30 million dollars a year to run how much does Headley Park pasta run annually millions Karapiro the bud with karapiro it makes a loss it has revenue expenses but I understand to be look at the White Power district plan that the loss is about half a million dollars a year so I would put up to you that actually it would be less expensive than it was a big pack it 's the road to rotate the amount of money that we ocean just to use a phrase well it 's it 's the funding will come from from the crown charities you know a whole range of issue the Crown has got no money on budget for the residential red zone that 's yeah well we 'll see yeah um clean and I was thinking of a name for the lake that 's all thank you David I came with thee thank you David thank you for coming to our community board I think obviously you see this is quite important is coming from from community I mean I see it as a way to teach the United the city if it 's absolutely you know Peter be Christy Williams that you constantly sort of ypres frame as this needs to come from a community you can 't_''_452.02 be seen to sort of impose this idea on them you 've got to take community with you and so we 've spoken to your board which is you know the tip of the community ivano takeru network even was in here before eastern vision which you know the ends involved in as there 's an awful lot more consultation to do but it 's it 's again you know how much work you do before you know your idea has support so you know we see the red zone consultation as pivotal to getting that necessary mandate if that if you know the general reaction to the red zone consultation is yes this is a good idea yes it 's expensive but we should look at it further then we will pursue it if they say no we want to golf course within fight hmm these events the association 's want to keep talking about it yeah i agree i mean it 's some that 's it nice packed up a lot of interest and phil just from the questions we are asking like is it at a stage where it 's already had a pre pre feasibility study or is that something preps that you might like council consider supporting very good Christian so it hasn 't had pre-feasibility pre-feasibility and itself as you know is several hundred thousand dollars it 's craig price from beaker as on our trust we high-level briefing document focusing on key issues such as resilience to seismic event ground water levels hydraulic supply from equi thurs water quality issues the whole range to understand the key issues but to actually didn 't get to the bottom of it do pre-feasibility as a substantial cost and we don 't have the funds for that begin its chicken and egg you know how much do you spend before you know the ideas apply yes some of us today she suggests that that might be a useful and put that sarah could make now is to actually resource some of the pre-feasibility stuff because the last thing you want to do is have a community engagement about something that 's just going to let them down because it can 't_''_576.199 be done you know so i think it 's a very good point it somewhere painfully aware and we would love serious do that but the constant refrain is we can 't_''_584.569 be seen to actively supporting one project ahead of another well it wasn 't the only project that i suggested i actually sort of said well process which is going to get there 's no point starting from share an idea and starting from scratch other people are going to have their expectations raised and they 're going to they don 't look at this and they 're going to go there is what my vision is yes you know and and then you find out that it 's just too expensive or it can 't_''_612.079 be done or you know I 've much rather that we and it 's not committing any one to favoring any project it 's actually just working out whether it can be done I couldn 't agree more and it 's something we lose sleep over week you know we want to we need to sell the idea yeah then I 'm doing so we create an expectation to answer questions we don 't have the money to answers yes if council was prepared to assist us in it regard that would be painted there is nothing worse than dashed expectations yes something was very aware of so but so wait so your suggestion is very very helpful okay we investing a bit of money at this early stage while we 're still because I mean we 're not ready to go to a consultation yet we 've got there are a number of things to do but one of the things that needs to be done as a is for a full analysis of our you know sort of stormwater needs and all of those sorts of things so that there is still say a lot of water to go under the bridge before we get to that point of consultation but anyway thank you so much and you know I 'm sure that I 'll have support from colleagues for making next approach again yeah a time right Simon

    "text": "and could be here far louisian what 's Canterbury Community Trust or we can keep the pictures guy cars cure thank you for the opportunity to talk to you today I feel a little bit like I 've got the late afternoon late Friday afternoon graveyard shift but anyway my name is Louise Edwards and I have the great privilege of being the chief executive the Canterbury Community Trust the Canterbury community trust was set up 28 years ago from the sale of the Kennedy savings bank and that money was what 's put into trust for the community over the past 28 years we put more than 300 million dollars into the Canterbury community and the last financial year alone we funded over 18 million dollars into the community for everything covering sport health young people arts heritage education community and economic development environment and social services we share many of the same goals as counsel and that 's building a strong and vibrant community we also co-fund many of the same organizations and projects which council funds such as swimming pools community facilities community events and festivals and staff sharing information and working on Partnership funding our submission relates to the proposed reduction on community funding I was going to talk about the key points in our written submission but given that council is now not going ahead with this funding reduction I just like to focus on a couple of key points the trust and council fund many of the same organizations and the proposed reduction and community funding would have had significant adverse effects I realized council has many competing demands and I understand the financial challenges for the council I just want to emphasize the importance of council funding for many community groups who rely on that funding any reduction in funding or change in the funding model needs to have a transparent collaborative evidence-based and strategic process to result in fear and just outcomes thank you all for having me today and I wish you lots of luck and your deliberations yeah rare thanks please for coming in on a house Hey look quick question I mean obviously I mean you guys do a great job and you know this sector inside out that you disperse I mean should counsel consider actually partnering with you or getting you to do a lot of the work that we do cuz it seems like we duplicate and fund exactly the same organizations you do and we run that overhead to do that that make any sense of me really happy to have those discussions with you and I think that that 's something not just particular to counsel and the kender be community trust I think funders as a whole could work together a lot easier to save on overheads for assessment processes and also to make it easier for applicants to apply for funding because we say that to the NGO sector and I think actually those one group that came in and said there was some astronomical number of NGOs as if that was a good thing because you can just imagine all the admin and setting up of trust and chronically that just eats up so many resources so we 're asking them to be a bit smarter how they deliver their services and we should probably be a bit smart of how and I think funders can do a lot more than working together okay please yep great now there was somebody over here that had their hand up though oh he Bossin actually but you were next oh you 're always like a look my question I 've got a Christian look just I 'm plenty of time um under the key issues you 've got reference to the Social Policy Research and the correlation between reductions and local government spending and so social deprivation so just what I 'm so is that something is is the you 're like funding criteria is that kind of like attached or aligned to that kind of van or the outcomes of that research I wouldn 't say with it that far advanced yet but we 're certainly looking to use research more to be more strategic about where our funding guys we 've got a limited pot of money so we 've got to be careful about to make sure that we get the best outcomes for that money so where are the gaps what does government fund what does council fund where and how do we get best bang for our buck and get the best outcomes for the community and we 're still in early stages of that journey and making sure that we highlight what our funding priorities are forever comes just sort of so that would be an example where effect clearly you obviously already have a partnership with counsel by discussing that with our staff and done in terms of how that funding your funding and as history absolutely and we commissioned research as well and we 're very open to sharing the results that research as well with other funders thanks Louise Yanni thank you for taking the time to come and make this submission we 've had a lot of group to talk about the lack of affordable community space in the central city and are quite concerned about their highly wolf rent increases that they 're facing if they 're not already paying high levels of rent so I just wondered if you 're doing any work around affordable community space in the central city and whether you 've considered you know the rebuilding of mitigate some of those factors that 's a question that we have debated quite a lot and we are still like many people and organizations throughout the city waiting for our insurance proceeds on the old community house so we haven 't got those who 'd we have helped fund of the new community house so we 've helped with foot out and various grants to help get them set up we 've also taking up your point about increased rental increases rental for community groups we one of the few funders that does actually fund for overhears rent salaries administration and we 've had to take that into account with applicants putting in for grant funding in terms of recreating the model and there is a new community house that 's up and running I don 't think we 'll be looking at replicating that or doing a new and another one long side that then as like in the medium to long term the sustainability of us or you as a funder paying more and more expensive rings that 's a bit like the accommodation supplement we out serious financial experience as I 'm sure you do but if our money is not going up in reeds are going through the roof that we actually aren 't helping those community groups as we can note on the phone thank you we just have to be careful we found 1300 organizations and they 're not all going to fit into one community house and so we need to be keep about equity and fairness across all of our our funding groups but it 's certainly something that 's on the table and often debated by my trustees okay um hi Louise and just huge thank you for all that you do because it is amazing I just wondered by any chance if there was any money lived in the need help now fund here is Vicki cool not a huge amount but but and in terms of in terms of just a sort of kind of follow up to a cup of the questions I mean obviously you know you 've got a large number of investments and it is the the revenue of those investments that actually enable I 'm just wondering you know I mean I presume I could look it up if i look at your annual accounts but what is your rate of return on those that you 've got 530 million dollars invested what 's your rate of return on there of course varies year by yeah but not not announced yet but our rate or a tune for last year was twelve percent right so in some years we have good years in other years its spirit you know down so I 'm we have to make sure that we build up reserves for the bad years because and we 've also got a reasonably conservatively invested portfolio because many groups rely on us obviously for the ongoing viability so we can 't suddenly you know if we have a bad financial you suddenly closed up shop and say no grants this year so we certainly try to keep up a stable and consistent donation base but it 's actually quite a significant rate of return it in certainly if we look at our own a seat base and look at our fascia 's just food for thought I think so yeah thank you and as Vicki said thank you for all that you do I know that a lot of community groups are very reliant on that resource and I think the more we do collaboratively the more that will actually be able to do because we are working together so thank you very much agree great thing and you I _"

    "text": "it 's marie marie being it oh no that doesn 't look like oh there 's two of you yes hi thank you your worship and counselors I 'm mark Christensen I cheer the trustees for the Conservation Trust and they have a Merry brunette who is the general manager now we 've got some pictures but no words so they 're just going to play behind us and some some things that on the peninsula and we 've got a short amount of time so you 've seen our written submission and I just want to emphasize six points from that submission the first is that the trust was founded in 2001 and that arose from a mediated settlement out of the district plan around a significant biodiversity on private land and within banks peninsula District Council agreed to the Trust 's formation in 2001 as a community driven organization designed to protect an enhanced biodiversity on private land and across the district crossbank submitter generally through the use of non-regulatory methods and we say that that mission remains just as valid today as when the trust begin there believe they are success in biodiversity protection has been due to widespread community support and by working with landowners and a non challenging and non-threatening sort of way the third point is that we believe that the successful delivery of the council 's biodiversity strategy is dependent on the council achieving support from the community and from landowners now view the strategy simply cannot be achieved without the community helping to deliver it fourth point is that the trust can access funds for biodiversity protection in leverage a volunteer workforce workforce which isn 't available to the council hopefully we have effective relationships with the council now with staff at both the operational park ranger level and also policy levels and finally the sixth point is that there is an increasing level of interest over the peninsula in conservation and sustainable land management generally and with with the resources that we have currently we currently are unable to meet that demand working with landowners so while we 're extremely grateful for the continuing support that the council has gives to the trust the the increase in funding that the trust to make a difference in getting the council 's biodiversity strategy coming so thank you those are that only comments we wanted to make an support of the submission and invite any questions thank you good doing have any questions I thankful yes thank you for clarifying that right from your point of view of the trust and my parents at assembly as chair of the community board sheet often makes those some of those points too but what I wanted to ask you in terms of the work that you are doing and this might be sort of alongside or outside your scope but it 's that there is some funding in our long-term plan earmarked for fencing of areas which I guess would be erosion prone and where some plantings might might be desirable is that something you 'd also support and I get I assume it 's not a specific part of your word but is it something you 'd support well we certainly support yes and we do do a lot of work with landowners around helping them out with Pete his control but also fencing 's his powers to covenant lend other than qe2 which is a special legislation but the only community organization in the country with those pairs so we were in our covenant enroll we need to seek funding for fencing I 'm Andrew thank you for your submission now in the context of your request for a grant of 150,000 I mean we 're very much in the space as a council at the moment of looking at ways that we we can save money of course both within our organization and in terms of our dealings with other organizations an uninterested in the way in which you are and you 're possibly already doing it or otherwise looking at opportunities for working with other groups so community groups groups maybe like the rod Donald banks peninsula trust or the banks peninsula water management zone committee and so on groups that may have similar objectives to your own where some of those things can be achieved without perhaps the need for such a great amount of money we definitely clear eight with all of those organizations that your reference in others emphasize to you that we believe we can make a really significant contribution to you achieving the outcomes you 're looking for in the biodiversity strategy and a more efficient waiving counsel probably came by supporting us because of the volunteer workforce that we can engage and I guess our opportunity also she gets and funds that come from other organizations that versity the city can 't leverage it clean thank you i 'm meeting you working in with colin work on this it is a system by temptation and biodiversity well not specifically with common indirect role but we will work with a lot of the ecologists so here and we 're getting a lot of help from Hugh Wilson of courses is engaged but but also scientists from Lincoln in Canberra universities it 'd be another opportunity for a synergy over this and we 're actively working on what we 're calling sponsorship agreements effectively with tertiary providers and science provides including Lee and clearly colon comes from to get some science arendt to demonstrate the efficiency or the effectiveness of what we do in particular in the be able to actually produce some science which demonstrates that you know we make a difference we 're in Italy people say we think we do and we think we say but we need to think some more science around there so people like common sense certainly help great thank you very much and we 've obviously got a big task ahead of us so we 'll carry on with the submissions thank you very much in both making me except to come out _"

    "text": "you can go after the next one okay Bennett Calder thank you your shop and counselors site for the opportunity to present this submission I 've got four and a half pages here so I 'm sorry I would just be cheery picking through it and a few additional comments do any court from South Shore generally I think the council must get back to its basics with so much infrastructure in need of repair or imminent replacement it 's time for council to abandon nice to have projects such as neighborhood Street enhancement artwork etc and concentrate on the efficient provision of basic services regarding the anchor projects i 'm not in favor of ratepayers money being spent on former ami stadium or the new multi sports facility we should not give up trying to rig it and renegotiate these methods for the crown however i would be for one would be very grateful money from one of those facilities a little money was diverted to the qe2 site to ensure we had a 50 meter pool but we used to have before i 'm in favor of repairing it 's an exceptional building but the limes room james a theater are not so special and not so essential either i say that provided engineering assurances can be given that it won 't slip into the river the city center was the base from my work for 45 years but now holds very little interest to me so much has been destroyed not just by the earthquakes but by Gerry Brownlee and Sarah 's misuse the section 38 demolition pairs most of our shopping needs can be met in the suburbs however i do not want central cross church with its magnificent groover even to die completely and feel that a few administrative type businesses can and be encouraged back in apartment living and entertainment businesses and venues should be encouraged there but please don 't spend 29 million dollars on a playground with a centennial pause that would be a gross waste of money when one teeth of that amount would repair the facilities at the South New Brighton camping ground rather more important severe than facilities it 's a central library is larger and more grandiose and about fifteen percent of my sorry council Andy cameras rates absorb about fifteen percent of my pension I 'm opposed to further increases being larger than the annual CPI the council should title its tighten its collective belts delay your script non-essential projects and sell some non-strategic assets including unused land and steve i do not think ratepayers should be paying for any services that have traditionally been provided for by central government even if the government 's have provided the legislature this to happen within our an effect properly paying twice regarding selling of it assets I 'm philosophically opposed of selling of shares and our strategic assets the airport the port company and Orion is soo Ryun with city care bread thus enable i support the council selling some shares there but pets retaining 51% regarding social housing important on second page I do not want rate payers to be subsidizing social housing in any way put a few riders to that further on I 'll skip to matters of it are affecting the eastern suburbs and I like to pets comment on that there 's something I with the decision-making within the council staff we 're damaged buildings aren 't council lend more common sense and empathy that local views are required I cite the South private and camping ground South writing bowling clubs still scheduled unnecessarily and there had to be a new community center on the park considerable cost problems whether oet golf club could have been sorted without the scandalous activities at heaven the public being dot denied after the earthquake the use of only slightly damaged single-story wooden buildings in a part-time cabin door like yourself could have just about guarantee you come to know Harmon the CEO needs to shake up the department or departments responsible for these seem stupid decisions in some cases more to the eastern suburbs previous administration was stupid enough to sell the forest he writes to bottle lake forest without consultation with ratepayers but he more since autumn brought out cell and councils remaining shares establishing a controlling interest interest and impossibly selling the remainder in your way the result scenes of the council is a poor relation and controlling what happens on its own land via companies to have them refrain from filling the presently unloved section of the green track and to cross the further permanent mature exotic forests close to the head quarters and access points if done properly we can have the benefits of a hamner springs type recreation exotic chorus on the city 's doorstep and now skip a few things that go to bexley the beatsie wetland suffer badly in the earthquakes and because they 've dropped over half a metre and lost most of the islands on a variety of habitats do now not support the breeding of many species probably any more importantly the wetlands supported the breeding of two endangered goals species the rental goal and the blackboard go with a total of two hundred check surviving each year the opportunity exists by eq vay excavation and ethics behind behind the stop being surrounding what was civic park to recreate similar habitats to what existed before the earthquakes such a sanctuary would provide both an invaluable contribution to the wildlife of the city and the fitting memorial to those horse from the area by the earthquakes and consequent my desire for God walking itself bright and domain that needs to be reinstated what it was before really just asking two things in yeast to be put back the way they were but there is an urgent need to give protection to the properties on the history side of rocking horse road on the south shores but there are people who if we 're not on the ester is sure that a couple of houses each on the history side have been red zoned and these people find themselves facing the the wrath of the history and a southerly with nothing between them and the sure and in some cases the water 's lapping up on people 's lounge window slams sticks so there 's something I think a local council that 's heavy made aware of it that I 'd like to reinstate me for urgent work there in the next few weeks thank you it 's great look thank you very much for your submission and and as you say these many of these issues have been raised before but some of them are new the bottle submission and I 'd like to thank you very much for making it and and you know say that as we 've said to all about submitters that these measures will be taken into account as we make our final decisions thank you thank you very much now let 's _"

chamber so I I could use a cotton street I do he did consider them a mr. smoke should I didn 't_''_25.949 I 'm here now on behalf of a reverend peter bit so i could actually chose to put a dog um who is convener of i think it is convener of eastern vision and he apologizes for his absence which is due to another appointment out of town we thank you as easter vision for this opportunity to submit on the long term plan there are feet for key points and our submission the first relates to the need for an holistic integrated plan for the recovery of the east of Christchurch which in many respects is not even yet started what we mean by this is a clear comprehensive vision that is agreed by communities and the recovery agencies and that informs all decision-making that the plan is more than a vision for the residential red zone is an overarching bird 's-eye view perhaps eagles view of all the eastern suburbs and their relationship to the wider context of Greater Christchurch it must spend agencies transcend silos and be collaborative so that housing recovery is integrated with education is integrated with environment as an integrated with sports and Rick with business and with community recovery it must be focused on and grounded in the local communities of Greater Christchurch my colleague to borrow Nolan ahem says if we rebuild for the fish in the birds that people will come so too if we rebuild for the locals the visitors will come here in a sutton CEO of the company developing the christchurch adventure part refers to this as generating warm beds if the way that if the beds are warmed by the heart and passion of our local communities then that will be translate into bed nights for visitors but the target audience must always be the locals of Greater Christchurch the plan must encompass an overarching concept that embodies the values of the community in the set of guiding and funding options each component must be a part of and contribute to the whole it must include an overall business plan the community is hundred percent involved in and addresses the need to sustain operational costs but it needs to lift itself from the shackles of treasuries focus I 'm a financial return on its readers are an investment and consider the wider economic social and environmental returns in our view there is nil value in the redzone lands for residential property investment the economic value of the land lies elsewhere it must include consideration of long-term governance of public round green space particularly in the residential red zone so half can counsel assist in this process with its long term plan we would submit that the best use of the 6.4 million allocated for a legacy project in the red zone is to fund the processes to define with communities a comprehensive crop prehensile integrated plan for the recovery of the East including initial feasibilities of potential component projects facilitation of development permissions and consents as a contribution CCC can make without a cost implication well we can the recovery of the East an agency set up to develop and deliver large physical projects is unlikely to be the best vehicle to deliver an integrated plan and vision that requires strong collaboration with communities the second key point of our submission is the need to work with communities in the development of solutions for flooding and water management we support making the most of opportunities now available in the rear design for doing this by the rebuilding of stop banks further back from the river margins to reinstate the floodplain and restore wetlands for enhanced stormwater treatment and flood carrying capacity however we submit that the location of stock banks needs to be considered with a degree of flexibility so as not to comprise a compromise future uses of the red zone lands that may require a level of flood protection we consider that a total barrier would not be a sustainable solution to the flooding problems in Christchurch and would have negative environmental and economic effects thirdly we submit that there is a need to prioritize budget for the capital and operational requirements to maintain the amenity control of aquatic weeds such as yellow flag iris planting of the riparian zone and the repair and rebuilding of walkways cycleways and footbridges including the a minute a prairie cycleway restoration of the immunity value of the city to see a Tucker corridor even on an interim basis is critical to the restoration of the community well-being in the east finally we would submit that significant budget is prioritized for the recovery of New Brighton is a key activity center new brighton is the counterweight to the CBD at the other end of the AV Natori corridor now such needs as much support in its redevelopment the saw then provide the necessary balance in definition for the restoration of the corridor as the backbone of the Eastern recovery we endorse the submissions of New Brighton business and landowners association even at our quarry network Taruna not on my tahoe and bringing the red zone thank you take questions till glean thank you very much even and you sort of alluded to this verse wonder if you might comment on a bit further in terms of like the flood protection and especially for example if we look at what we put in now within this current long-term plan by way of sort of all flood protection infrastructure and how in fact though we keep and have that compatible with a longer-term strategy say for the next hundred years would you like to comment on there I think they 're very consistent on particular if you utilize the red zone land as the in restorative floodplain use it is a way a means of stormwater going directly out into the to the even it gets treated through wetlands first but I I think a lot of the answer also lies at individual household level back at source we need to do more than educate householders and how to reduce the amount of of storm water getting into the system in the first place we need to be incentivized householders so that there might be a discount on the rates if they have their own rain gardens they have they click their own rain water so it doesn 't carry off into the into the infrastructure systems but I think they 're sea level rise might end up being a very much in alignment we certainly feel with an Eastern vision that we have an opportunity here to to lead the world in many respects and how to live with sea level rise in make sure that we 're building sustainably with neighborhoods that can survive in 100 years time just goes back to what a burn attacker was saying in terms of putting it in 30 year city rather than the barricaded city clean thank you thank you evan and thank you for what you do i i 'm pretty aware of all the hours you put it on know that we 've had a few months here my question is about how critical this whole recovery in the Easter 's community lead and some terms of the modus operandi and i 'm thinking back to your previous submission over the way I mean going right back to the way that quite frankly a predetermined grid was put on top of the city so in other words those who came here didn 't work with the land they actually ran against is I think what you 're saying and that actually we 're trying to reverse the whole paradigm of thinking and making it community lady how critical for you that it is infected I think we need to listen to the communities and the communities have to be very involved in the decision-making processes but we also need to listen through the back into a you know what the environment is telling us as well so both are important there 'll be different they 'll be conflicts the for sure but we can work through them but I think there 's a lot of areas where the synergies more than readers because anyone else David in your submission am I thinking and the earlier one as well you expressed some concern about the proposed appraisal for a title barrier at share groc or close by what 's your attitude to perhaps having that facility but that have only be used an extreme storm flooding periods by understanding that would still have the similar effects I don 't see it it 's still building a barricaded city that once it 's the south shore spread is a very dynamic environment that 's changed incredibly over the last few centuries I don 't think it 's a feasible option and the advice I 've had from a variety of different sources and a variety different disciplines is that it wouldn 't work it would be an expensive light elephant that would destroy your environment there 's other ways to resolve those issues without going down that path it 's good thank you very much your energy and _"

are the lifelines of our city and the even flow of the tides its heartbeat you wouldn 't tie a tourniquet around your heart and string lit into cardiac arrest that 's what we 'd be doing if we put a titled barrier across the history I don 't want to bring my family up in the barricaded city fortress Christchurch fighting against nature because as we have seen sooner or words of de Lucas the memory of the land in the waterways will always return to leave its mark I want my grandkids to live an adaptive amphibious city that embraces change that embraces nature and knows how to live with nature and that leads the world in doing so local manaphy Noah knew what that meant it 's time to listen to the wisdom of the two pina again when my ancestors came to auto tahi they a saw a land that had only had value when it was when it was cleared cultivated tamed and urbanized by contrast monofin AMA so the inherent value of the coastal dune systems the wetlands the rivers the air stress and the lowland forests is tana as a treasured place of moringa kai a place of sustenance a place of sustainable resources a place of community a place of learning a place of play in the place of healing well-being in spirituality we now have an amazing opportunity within the red zone lands to return such values to at least some of our city yes it comes at a cost but the get that we can 't afford everything that you have to make prioritize decisions here but when you make your deliberations consider your great grand kids in the city they will inherit and fifty to a hundred years time helps in this respect consider how as a city and you as our elected reps an error risk-averse council could be held to account in a court of law in the future for your decisions that you could be making imagine for a moment that the river systems and the right period margins that surround them where a legal entity in their own right we 're vested with a legal personality an imagine if the car TRT the governance board appointed legal counsel on behalf of their entity and took the people of Christchurch to court for all the neglect maltreatment and abuse of the past and of the prison perhaps that might make you think twice about how much you should be prioritizing the horizontal infrastructure work both storm water and wastewater how much you should be incentivizing individual householders into taking responsibility for their own contribution to the quality our rivers a much you should be spending on restoring in nurturing our waterways how much you should be embracing the opportunities of the red zone lands to do this you have an enormous responsibility in your decision making this is a pivotal point in this city 's history we urge you to take the time to make your decisions and reach back and embrace the wisdom of the two pinner then transport yourselves forward into the distant future and view your decisions with the eyes of your great-grandchildren if you look at the health and well-being of our rivers we will look after the health and well-being of the city and the people that live within it now and for generations to come rees owned empty breezes wander streets where the windows of silent houses gaze without any expectations there was no time for farewells only the howard leavings calling come quickly don 't turn back nothing is left here now it 's around

he Akita uru Tapani otani kiawah Tia Tia mama takako to Tina not a wider kita era Takata carrera y roco area a Kiki rubric via Tina Tina for me a Hui tightly thank you not to take questions Pauline thank you and you 've mentioned and the new submission the tidal barrier or um you 'll you consider it would not be sustainable solution have you got any scientific evidence or anything to ground their opinion on please there is evidence in international literature of experiences of other other cities in doing such things and there 's also scientific evidence from a variety of sources including local ones that would indicate that it would be an economic and environmental disaster to pursue that as an option it 's a bullet but it 's not a silver bullet it 's a bullet right through to the heart of the environment of the co shoot city how Paul thanks Evan and thanks all of you doing fuel Brooke and we had a presentation this morning from the a promoter Kara Boris park have you seen us talking about yet what 's your thoughts of it you know there 's been quite a few ideas about there what we could do with a red zone and I just want to get your views on on only their fault of changing it from this yes I 've been green in there in zone yeah i mean the the avatar is co pepper if you like depends on two central tenets one is to return as much of the red zone lens to naturally restored habitat indigenous habitat as possible which is what that proposed was doing the other arm is that we also believe the sufficient land there to support multiple purposes and to meet a whole range of community needs including sports and recreation recognition of culture and european heritage food growing a whole whole raft of different things so we don 't see it being exclusively natural indigenous habitat restoration but we 'd see that as being the core infrastructure that for the green and blue space so very much compatible with their thinking as well thank you that 's very helpful darling a similar question from the Eden Project and I just was kind of interested in your thoughts how involved you are connected with what 's proposed and how that fit so do we are certainly connected with them have had a number of meetings of the course the last two years to 18 months and insofar as it 's compatible with the vision yeah and we haven 't seen anything that 's incompatible yet however we don 't have any great detail on what is planned it 's more conceptual anything else and it 's it 's something that Easter vision has also been involved other questions AB Phil thank you even so just from what you see it so far you already saying to us look that the you 're asking us to make the storm was the storm water systems and wastewater systems in terms of their appears for the even fixing them to make better priority is that really the thrust of what you want to say in your probation that yes the repairs to the water wastewater and stormwater a key building back clean and green and smart doesn you might think it goes out along the river through the history out into Pegasus Bay we need to ensure that those that area is cleaned up but for far too long the east side of town has been the place where the city 's dumped at site we need to clean it up this excellent i think i 'm going to certainly ask our tech people if they could have off the poetry at the end so it 's a separate a separate piece so that we can we can link it on our various facebook pages very moving i thought i felt quite sort of blown away about it because yeah i was resentment I just sort of felt this terrible lump in my throat so i pologize anyway thank you very much for that submission thank you very much indeed _"

    "text": "I 'd like to thank Brian for the housing issues these brought before the council to i think is being paid less very good give an unfailing welcome good afternoon first of all one like the compliment those responsible for the logo what the smart choices are and I want to just address what I don 't think SMAP choices are and what I think smart choices should be and one i speaking chris they 've got the rule rakes is pretty brutal to increase the rule rates as a very small minority of the right person for chips individualize us like that is we think very unfair i I 'm against subsidizing non-essential services and I think somebody mentioned the christian era thanq yester park and I 'm concerned about how things have evolved and it would seem that there is an insurance money has been offered that we 're turning a blind was that narrator what paper unfortunately the civic insurance chief executive decided that it would be a good idea to put measures in the public arena with a particular lens torch the exam does not reflect dispute with our insurers and his comments were very unhelpful to resolving those to see I 'm sure that I got that wrong but no it 's not your fault it 's entirely hers well I 'll have somebody also mentioned and the juncture with that about the professionalism and the professional age that we live in and I believe that if we play golf at the heavy pack we pay our subs or fees every bubble ondas squash club war Bowling Club warts in all our recreational utilities we all as members pay subs all I think it 's what this tells me that we should be charging out the crystal players green feasibly users of our facilities already believe that yeah it 's just almost out of hand and that 's for another smart choices that we 've got to look at ways of being more specific about a budget and I think it was beats and both the previous people about but I feel strongly that we should be putting their time frame out to do things properly not quickly but do them properly over a longer one way that we should be looking at other this might be a touchy feely subject but I think another thing that conserves us is that the cost the right path of our bureaucracy and if we look at Orion or the port company or the airport and we compare the size of those three organizations compared with that maybe the hospital board or maybe take industry or that goth and businesses that brought types of those three utilities are talking about I feel that we should really only have one CEO of those three council entity so I feel LP office he has got out of hand another part of our bureaucracy that we feel strongly about is our enforcement area where we would like to know just him effectively our enforcement officers have been in our area with the quarries where there 's been pretty blatant misuse of the conceits and there 's lack of consideration boy paying people the fact that they chlorine and west of rice church hmm is something that we 're having allowed we haven 't even allowed for may be heading to pure horrendous I hope we 've got a room on yourselves that the whole of that area of my claims Island to pass the rifle range at west milton was set aside as a area to pick the ground water across church and now though hurrying in that area it 's right point blank in the firing range of the whole city and we think that 's there 's a lack of foresight there I think Vicki 's going to get in your ear straight afterwards and make sure no no and make sure make sure that you put a submission and on the district plan review because this councils made a stand on that and we need support from people to actually make submissions on the district plan review we 're having a meeting with the commissioner on monday night at quarter past five and with that but there 's an ongoing issue really is and i 'm very hopeful for this of what we 're getting from Vicki and other counselors because so many people are going by that and just cheering a blind or we have a precious consents rather than the effectiveness of the enforcement team yeah yeah i mean the enforcement team are only trying to follow up on the provisions that are consent or conditions that are consent seats and if does a wee bit of both but i mean i think the the primary issue is more with the consent rather than the people that are charged to follow it up and they 've got a huge workload on and and i just think that the problem goes back nor we see what 's happened and the roberts road though that that decision was just a disaster or just would just require don 't you 'll find anyone in the room who did the brief of you so I 've got to go on I don 't want to take more time of it it 's just you 're doing for ages but just thanks for your patience I just remind you about their smart choices I think we 've got to be really smart about a poem owning the development getting our choices right I think the to see pose another facility of 've got a facility there that should be able to be fetched it 's been through witnessed winter in our history last year and it 's a plant men problems earlier the thought of wet concrete order central was really unsafe it I think you know that 's very helpful thank you very much _"

    "text": "federated Farmers of New Zealand I can seem that Clark there and now Frank Frank now I 'm not going to pronounce your surname correctly Brendan mule is it close enough it is good welcome thank you yeah my name is Frank Grenville and I am the president of North Canterbury federated farmers with me as nick clark federated farmers policy manager based in the christchurch office we are presenting north canterbury federated farmers submission on the counselors long-term pink consultations i am assuming that councillors have read our submission so i wont to recite it and all the points in it north canterbury federated Farmers appreciates the relationship it has with the council and the work it does in rural parts of canterbury particularly on banks peninsula federation supports the effort of the city council has been making and is making to rebuild and recover from the earthquakes the situation you are facing is unprecedented and hugely complex not to mention very costly there has been much said over the past year about the funding gap facing the council which seems to get bigger with every forecast and is the council 's proposed approach to close the funding gap by releasing 750 million capital by selling down shares owned by the council through christchurch city holdings increasing rates reviewing its program of major works reviewing its operating spending and managing debt prudently we have always said that a combination of all of these options is necessary however we are concerned about the growth and depth and the large rates increases that are coming over the next few years and we believe that if anything the council should give serious consideration to releasing more counts more capital from Christchurch sitting holdings then currently proposed it is all a matter of balance and we believe that the council 's approached in the consultation document strike as a good balance as we can hope for under the circumstances turning to other matters federated farmers had a close look at the council 's proposed changes to the rule differential the way it was worded did cause some initial confusion but we received helpful assurances from the council 's rates officials that it would not affect farms on the basis of these insurances federated we express last year about roading issues on banks peninsula both the local roads in the state highway where heavy traffic generated by cruise ships causes problems of wear and tear and road safety since then we have had constructive engagement with councillor Turner on the local roads and we have been engaged with New Zealand Transport Agency on the state highway NZTA was sympathetic but non-committal and the City Council could an hour view play a useful advocacy role regarding local roads we do believe that the council should ensure that it continues to adequately maintain and improve its rating network which we see as critical as a critical council responsibility and the main value that farmers get from their rates we would be concerned if the maintenance of the peninsula roads was allowed to lapse especially as this can exacerbate problems when there are storms and floods exams examples of basic but critical maintenance include keeping culbertson drain clear of debris and keeping roadside trees and other vegetation regularly cut back and trimmed sometimes it 's just a matter of being better enforcing complaints contracts rather than spending your time and considering our submission thank you thank you very much and I 'm sorry about the change at the front it was some emergency that was going on and so questions fell thank you for your submission and in terms of the scenarios like one of the scenarios which is referred to but we don 't have any figures liam is councils potential to reduce their capital program and tues vs capital spending which is their big money do you do you agree that we should address that 's an hour it 's one of those issues which the council has a grave responsibility around then it 's in it 's one of balancing the ones and the whatnots well they 're not once and we think that there is possibly scope for that an example would be for example if we are going to build a completely new stadium should it have a roof will not have a roof stadiums traditionally lose money making a fancier one does not necessarily means it 's going to make money thanks without usually have federated farmers to question it is you 've talked about a new submission around the need for the sustainable transport networks I think one of the comments you make is those who use a benefit um should should pay for them do you take the same kind of approach or thinking towards things like professional rugby or professional cricket do you think we should be looking to not rate subsidize those but actually more direct charge those professional type sports by and large we do you know we 're a firm believer that user pays except where there is a general community benefit which exceeds that and you know we 're not against general rates funding it you know a lot of issues but where you 've got specific use we believe is that you know that should be related to the cost and time okay any other questions if not it was obviously incredibly clear thank you very much indeed man I 'm silane silane listen to hear I think so Lynette we 're in your head _"

    "text": "who was later in the day so it 's on page 167 of a 187 of your of your folder thank you thank you my name is Howard Livingston I 'm no relation to the counselor or not it well it has it you haven 't got an e at the end of your name so I kind of guessed that 30 I want to speak about the Christchurch town hall and i believe the the budget to repair this building is 120 7.5 million new zealand dollars so when this building was built in the 1970s the town hall auditorium was a revolutionary building the architect was a famous local company the acoustic designed by Harold Marshall enhanced early lateral reflected sound and this produced quite a broad sound in the auditorium it was the first concert hall to be built for this new concept and as a concert hall it 's been very successful for small groups particularly solo piano recitals but for symphony orchestra concerts there were severe problems of balance there was only a small section of seating in the hall where a well balanced sound you where that is so in case you decide to go ahead and repair it I don 't want you to tell where your fringe with the best seat sir otherwise I won 't goodnight musicians originally complained that they couldn 't hear across the stage what other players were playing but then a new device a flying saucer shaped device which is commonly referred to as the donor was installed above the stage this produced sound to bounce down to the performance area and amongst other people gain key rican canal deep Takata worth can hear herself quite clearly the recent guardian article which was incorrectly published in the press did not mention that the Town Hall erupted audit room was one of the ten best concert halls in the world rather it was on a list of ten concert halls worth visiting this is a very different statement it is an important building in the history of concert hall of acoustics that doesn 't mean it 's one of the best now many of the great concert halls in the world are shaped like a shoebox they are tall they are long and they are narrow and not too wide for example the Great Hall in Vienna the acoustics in that all they are rated as one of the best if not the best in the world so do we need to reinvent the wheel of concert hall acoustics I don 't think so so James hey theatre is not really a concert hall at all in fact it 's difficult for singers to hear each other from opposite sides of the stage I know because I 've performed on that stage now that we have the Isaac Theatre Royal up and running the James a theater really is surplus to requirements there are buildings in the crop in Christchurch that suit small music recitals such as the Great Hall of the Art Center wonderful acoustic the new Charles lani auditorium it 's and Margaret 's getting well used but not particularly suitable for music and for smaller audiences there are churches such as st. michael and all angels do we need to resurrect the town hall auditorium I know the architects a local company but can we rock concerts for large public meetings and school price givings they can be all help at the arena where there 's plenty of car parking in 2008 a new building in Melbourne was finished for 125 million australian dollars it combined the melbourne recital centre with two concert halls the Melbourne theatre company with two performance spaces it is built with base isolation and is surrounded by thick concrete so that no sound come comes from outside I 've lifted to the names of the architects although I have no financial interest in their company many in the Christchurch musical scene know of the acoustic issues of the town hall auditorium they don 't want it to repair so that they will eat into the budget for the Performing Arts I would like the council to abandon plans to spend a large amount of money to repair what was never an ideal concert hall but to build a new one on a better site further from the river how about we build a traditional shoe box design concert hall to seat about 1600 near the theatre royal oh you 've here before so it 's been an incredibly valuable to button thank you very much thank you thank you _"

    "text": "thank you for the opportunity to speak to you the guts of my submission is basically then I believe the City Council is misleading the public in their promotion of asset sales quarter Memphis said 100 million dollars what we are short forward the Cameron partner said four hundred and nine hundred million obviously either very poor analysis the leadings of such widely disparate figures and city council still paying Cameron 's who are now quoting 1.2 billion now Karen partners are known for promoting asset sales and for making big money out of managing asset sales no one would contract Cameron 's for advice unless they had already decided to sell assets and needed the hugely biased firm like Cameron 's to support their decision we know there 's something very fishy if not collusion and the engagement of Cameron says the city council refuses to let excuse me I 'm just going to have to stop you here I mean this is not relevant to the long-term plan and I mean we we don 't have the system that they have in Parliament where somebody who has where a jour affirmed that they get a right of reply so it can be written into the record they don 't have a right of reply in this environment so I 'd rather that you focused on the issues rather than you know advisers or you know naming individuals if you could please just stick to the to the issues okay a number of red herrings I believe have been floated in the argument when I heard the other night was that without asset sales we wouldn 't be able to repair the east I think it 's a red herring and that East has never been a priority for the for the council and asset sales probably not going to make any difference to that another red herring the convention center is not a cost to christchurch is a cost to christchurch given that christchurch could have made a much stronger demand of the government to not waste the money on the city on the on the convention center and instead to put it into the repairs of christchurch now the previous convention center lost money almost every year to lose twice as much and the council needs these hundreds of millions of dollars not the overseas contractors the red herring that there 's no other options obviously alternative plan put forward by some of the more farsighted councillors as one example of other options cutting expenditures the particular capital expenditures is a vital option why as the council spent money on upgrading carbines and footpaths and reserves in affluent areas rebuilding roundabouts or replacing them with lights when they were working except ibly well before and I notice on the way down here there was a sign durham street saying we want to hear what you your feelings about us totally changing the obviously durham street it doesn 't need to be changed it may be better if it 's change but doesn 't need to be changed now spending hundreds of thousands on unneeded park and reserve amenities like the useless look out at the sticks mill reserve or new footpaths and Regent Park when the previous foot bus were not even damaged I happen to live in Regent 's Park every house on the street that my own and the attention the council is given to the the waterways the footpaths and everything there is being extreme and you see the obvious difference between that and the east or very little attention has been paid I believe that if councillors could see with our own eyes the unnecessary capital expenditures that continually made in areas where there is no necessity and no hurry they would find they could pinpoint savings of millions of dollars and perhaps even hundreds of millions the claim that selling only part of the enterprises would leave the council with control and they build protect the public interest is another red herring under corporate law in New Zealand the majority shareholder cannot take any action that would disadvantage then the minority shareholder as long as that minority shareholder had twenty-five percent which is what will happen either because a large corporation buys more than twenty-five percent or one buyer accumulates more than twenty-five percent through the market which is common practice after asset sales the minority shareholder can demand higher charges for electricity port or airport services bus fares etc to maximize so they can sell their share for a capital gain the new buyer will then argue that because they paid so much more for their share than charges for services must go up so they can get adequate compensation this is exactly what has happened in public private partnerships around the world over the last thirty years Wellington 's sale of their electricity network is an enlightening the privatized company was sold four times the last sale being three times the value of the first sale Wellington City saved 11 million dollars interest costs every year yet their consumers are paying 80 million dollars more in in the cost of their electricity a two hundred ninety five percent increase whereas the council Wellington Council still owns the water network and the cost of running that is only risen by seven seventeen percent so to say that selling assets will keep rates down when the actual expenditure for electricity of ratepayers or the cost of getting goods through the port or the airport will reduce rates is a red herring in fact it may reduce rates or may keep them from by in a greater degree by the ratepayer interesting now one hundred million dollars is exported out of Wellington to shanghai city council because of the their privatisation 160 million or so that is visually we 're well over time so can you just come to record conclusion okay let 's very very quickly I don 't think you should spend money in the city cal the city center because it 's there are so many vacancies now and there 's so few businesses wanting to move back into city in this city center and the I think you should spend a lot of time looking at international situations where they 've sold assets which is being disastrous in many cases and the last very quick point is the trans-pacific partnership agreement that the government is going to sign basically says that if you sell if an overseas company owns or even a new zealand company owns some of our assets here then if you make any move like lowering electricity prices to attract businesses or something like that they can sue the government and if you hold one hundred it 's actually not true but you can be just as liable under the investor state provisions but I just hit a weak point if I may raise a little point of order there I felt your comparison with Parliament isn 't right because this is a private citizen who I think is entitled to know anyone who comes before a select committee in Parliament or who makes a statement and Parliament who is actually commenting on someone else then that someone else gets an a right of reply that gets written into the record and we don 't have that and local government I think it is an omission people can come here and say what they like about someone I 'm actually protecting that interest that cannot be protected in any other way which is to say come to the point we 've had that point made before and let 's just leave it at that but you know that the submission timers as well and truly over on the submergence stripe years being to our bounds at all well I 'm sorry you have a particular view to cut this out right now so just thank you charles that 's very good to see you thank you anchored I 'm quite Howard Livingston to come forward _"

    "text": "it might sound as if Deborah and I are on the same page because we probably are beyond the effect of the funding cut that is maybe going to happen or maybe not going to happen and the effect on the city and public art so my involvement today is as an independent member of the Christchurch City Council 's public art advisory body and obviously as governing patron of escape public art and I 've been in that position or involved with scope for the past 17 years by way of background in 2007 escaped public art then art and Industry made a submission to the City Council to seek a fund for public art this was presented by myself and Deborah McCormick 's at the time of the presentation it was noted that the lack of such a fund seemed in a mission in a modern city such as Christchurch given many other New Zealand cities had already committed to such funding our submission in 2007 was successful and the council established peg resulting in an annual fund for public art on the on the basis that at draw down on it this scheme has been hugely successful with a great number of important works commissioned and delivered such as those such as those were expected in your handouts so it 's quite a big hand out that you 've got but interesting flower power by oregon gentry which is by the old bank of new zealand passing time down by the CPI tea and tree houses for swamp down dwellers which is just in the escape pod gloucester street there my late husband and i became the first match donors under this scheme financially contributing to flower power at stewart plaza and i think it 's still called Stuart plaza but not really referred to but at the time it was pretty current the work has proven to be as resilient as the people of Christchurch and I 'm quite proud to see it this up again and working after the earthquake I might add that all the sculptures that are around the city as a result of the work done in public art didn 't fall down so I think that 's quite a nod the so I want to speak to the peg long-term plan submission on behalf of myself and Anthony Wright director of the museum he would normally do this as the spokesperson but he 's obviously away and in Venice and so on got the job we are the two independent that is non council members of the council 's paid group other members include Jenny Harper Lara Stroman who Nicholson and councillor Paul lonsdale when he can 't_''_182.97 be involved because you 're inside the tent at that point but you 're listening our submission is against the proposed decision to make a significant cut to the public art fund which was 296 thousand dollars in 2014-15 with a now proposed drop of 71,000 to provide 225,000 for the 2015 16 year we are not seeking an increase on the past some allocated but strongly recommend that this proposal be reversed and that the 2014 figure be reinstated into the 2015-16 budget we have in our submission outlined our reasons against this proposal and I would like to briefly reiterate and speak to these points the City Council 's public art 's public art advisory group with a major objective of leveraging at least one dollar of other contributed money for each one dollar a public art fund committed to major public artworks in other words its mandate and success has been around in a public philanthropic drive for public art this modus operandi is really and clearly in line with current practice nationally and internationally in the arts we are all well aware of the critical importance to the city of a healthy and vibrant arts community and establishment of paid by the council was an indication of its commitment to this the council 's expectation of a dollar for dollar has been a target that has been exceeded by peg essentially through the management and delivery of works through scape over the past three years each dollar of the council 's funding has been matched by an additional three dollars twenty-five of other funding while Anthony Wright and I are the independent and voluntary faces on this group I hasten to add there to achieve this current one dollar to 325 dollar match requires a considerable amount of volunteer quo funding of 296,000 is not only vital for the purposes of funding the city 's public art program but is vital as a mark of the council 's commitment to the community who generously contribute to the program increasing the city 's financial investment in the public art program threefold as a result of this public-private partnership and investment the city has now been provided with considerable capital assets into the now notable public art collection a collection that now attracts local visitors and tourists to the central city so let 's consider the figures which are the cracks of the submission the proposed LTP over the next five years will provide 1 million 237,000 for the public art fund which on the current track record of just over a three-fold increase would be matched by an additional four million and twenty thousand dollars however if the present funding is restored over the next five years council funding of 1 million 480,000 that is the 2014 figure of 296 thousand times five with no inflation forecast available for out years added in would be matched on the current track thousand of external grants industry partnerships philanthropic funding etc thus if the council lowers its contribution to peg through the LTP this is a potential loss of almost eight hundred thousand dollars in revenue for the city 's public art program in business investments the loss of this revenue would not make economic sense equally in my opinion the reduction of the council 's base funding to peg may reduce the potential for positive public-private interaction and investment in public art in summary and as I have noted before the council 's investment through the LTP provides the base for a three-fold community contribution and resultant valuable Capital Asset program for the city through its public art program so I urge you to continue to build on the good community will an investment that this program has development and not destabilized or decrease it through this proposed LTP reduction in the base funding it is a hugely successful council initiative which is now a well-established council public and private partnership that the city can be proud of and the story my mum I hope it wasn 't in fire this me Dame Adrian the proposed LTP reduction of 70 1185 with a result in the potential loss and additional 790 2756 they 're not the same number are they ones preferring 21 years cut and the other ones referring to five years loss so it is a multiplier of live on the 71 yes leads us to a loss of 792 yes it right yep yep okay any other questions Yanni um thank you for what you 're doing it 's fantastic and I just I guess one of the concerns I 've had for a number of years has been there 's been some really great stuff happening in the central city but we 've heard through this process repeatedly from people in the eastern suburbs the really feeling of neglect decline the need for you know a bit more enhancement beautification celebration of the area 's have you considered looking at those other places you know particularly that got hurt by the earthquake around what you can do in terms of public art I think we 've had this discussion before and we 've obviously had approaches by the time it was thought that the community groups themselves the council 's of the of the various areas should handle that is not endless money and there 's not endless people in people who deliver public art so it 's a very small tight and I think we 've done extremely well to have gotten this portfolio of that you 've all got in front of you I mean these are major major works and we just can 't do everything so I would think a concentration I sympathize with the other areas I 'll do particularly sincere is crate but but we can 't do everything and I think if you 're concentrated on on a major public art fund and development in the city it speaks hugely to what you 're trying to do in the city which is basically to attract visitors so it 's a bit isolation isolated to be speaking about the others at this particular point I think but I do appreciate what you 're saying thank you that 's a good explanation I appreciate that look thank you very much and yeah very carefully well it would be great if we could see a huge turnout yeah you can be the skype happen but a city has as well because it 's going to be owned by the city is the fanfare and we 've done it and huge support from a lot of funders but particularly the City Council and we look forward to seeing you all there to celebrate something else you just going to attract visitors thank you yeah we do we do here add a tenth of June tenth of June okay thank you very much thank you very much Charles strikes _"

's premier public art events over the past 17 years we 've installed nine permanent in a hundred and sixty typically works in the central city these artworks provide a unique point of difference for the city ambitious and high impact they enhance the urban center and raise the profile of public art and Christchurch as a destination to experience it hold in central city public spaces and supported by a range of partnerships the christchurch by annual showcase created a close relationship and collaboration between business and this is a highly regarded model worldwide scape christchurch buying

fund to deliver the Christchurch biennial escape eight due to open on the second of October this year has a budget of 1.9 million of this the Christchurch City Council 's events and festivals funding is ten percent 190,000 we believe that we attract a significant return on Christchurch City Council investment for escapes sex escape eight you will see eight new temporary public art works in community participation works and you will see the completion of the installation of the first permanent public artwork in new zealand by renowned British sculptor Antony Gormley which is a partnership project with Sarah that we have brokered you will see a compact central city scape 8 public out walkway the opening weekend programs will focus on local families in the visiting art world we have an education and community engagement program of our 1.9 million for this biennial will be paid directly into the local economy to Christchurch firms we employ arts graduates artists in the arts sector and so we believe that 's a significant return any reduction to this important core funding would directly impact on the trust ability to attract the ninety percent of external grants industry partnerships in philanthropic funding the council 's proposed reduction in budgeted cost for the events and festivals band from nine plus million and 2014 to a low of circa six million and 2016 will challenge the festivals and events sector ability to successfully deliver a thriving arts and culture environment in Christchurch arts festivals events in public art remind remained and even thrive through the disaster and the rebuild it 's been the main reason of many Christchurch residents to re-engage with the essential city our market research proved this these are some of the comments and feedbacks from local Christchurch residents I think that art gives people a positive reason to re-engage with the city centre I really enjoyed walking through the CBD and being able to focus on the initiatives and Christchurch reminds us that our city is alive and well undaunted and full of energy courage humor it 's a positive art and community focused event in the rebuilding City let 's remember it 's the arts and events that have positioned our transitional city the international media such as the New York Times we 're in the article after earthquakes a creative rebirth in Christchurch scape public art and other arts organizations were credited for the entire city looks like a giant exhibition space the trust recommends that its current funding from the investable and events is maintained to enable the Arts and festival set to grow and thrive we encourage the council to together with the arts and culture sector develop a combined and coordinated activity management plan for the Arts next you will hear from our governing patron Dame Adrienne Stewart who is a member of the council 's public art advisory group of which scape public art produced project manage and secure match funding for the city 's public art collection you have a booklet handout with a number of the works that we circulated earlier this partnership has significantly contributed to major new

Anton Parsons which is at the entrance of cpit on the corner of Madras and senescence streets Julia Morrison 's tree houses for swamp dwellers by Christchurch artist Julia Morrison on the corner of Gloucester and colombo streets and solidarity grid which is our first international artists commissioned by German light artists Misha cabal which sees the lighting and gifting of 21 street lights from around the globe as a gesture of solidarity as the city rebuilds so far 11 of these lights have been installed in park terrace between armor and Peterborough streets this year we will install the remaining 10 lights to complete this global cultural exchange project and we 're working very hard at the moment to get a light from Buenos Aires to be here for the Argentinian match when the Pumas play the all blacks on her 17th of July on council will celebrate a five-year journey as we dedicate in fear a truly remarkable 20 metre diameter geodesic dome structure were 360 moving fans by local

city fanfare when it changes color and glows will further position Christ Church on the global art stage following the earthquakes Christchurch city 's visual arts community has been faced with a complex raft of issues with much of the Arts taking this to the streets and empty buildings on gaps and on end Wars this is building momentum that can see Christchurch over time becoming one of the most interesting public art destinations in the world scape public art requests that the council restore its public art fund to as 2014-15 budget at 296 185 with annual inflation adjustments in out years councils investment via the public art fund and the matched funding delivery partnership with scape public art provides a means a threefold community contribution to a valuable partnership scape is required to leverage at least one dollar of other contributed money for each one dollar of council money this partnership has been more than successful more successful than this one to one ratio over the past three years for each one dollar of council skate public art in the public art advisory group has raised an additional three point two five dollars of other funding I urge you to continue to build on the good community will and investment that this partnership skate and council has developed over the past 17 years and not decrease it through the proposed lgp reduction in the base funding this public-private partnership is narrow well established well-regarded model worldwide the the city can be proud of the trust wishes to continue to work in partnership with the Christchurch City Council through its public art advisory group to provide leadership and produce and manage large scale and ambitious legacy public art sculptures for our city christchurch has the opportunity to become the public and street art capital of Australasia to become a destination and a beacon for visitors and locals let 's thank you very much and thanks for what you do i think i 've been to pretty much all of the escape launchers over that 15 year period does one question that i 've got is around us Sara 's by the rubber project obviously we had we had a briefing on that really recently and one of the things that came up is that in the transition away from you know Sarah being involved in Christchurch and all of these different activities the transfer of that function to a some sort of trust do you see scape as potentially that that home and it 's an interesting question we have been involved and I work for I 'm a specialist advisors I have been involved in the process with Sarah and the trust are waiting our Chairman to come back from the Venice Biennale but Sarah have asked us to have a discussion with them and so the trustees are aware of this the discussion hasn 't happened yet it 's obviously a big discussion and one that we welcome them to be involved with but it makes sense certainly rather than setting up something new yep I mean certainly there would be competition of the new trust we 've identified that as a trust as a risk as its rich I think we do sorry oh well I wasn 't here two years ago so yeah I 'm Ellie quickly and I know you and I 've talked about this some Deborah too can you just give us some idea of when the next lights are going in and the sure thing oh how dear so October this year so there 's 10 more to go and so we 've got we 've actually got a couple of lights that need to be fixed and they 're not illuminated so apologies for that but the the Wuhan light came very very quickly and we wanted to add something installed for the delegation and a part was not delivered so we put it out but the part has arrived and I contractors going to install that on the top bun in july this year the Buenos Aires light is being afraid and again we 're trying very hard to light coming from thessalonica we 've got a light coming from a Singapore we have a light coming from a LaRoche in France no we didn 't get Paris quitting it Paris I thought Singapore is going to be the hardest country to negotiate with but it was it was Paris though they 're all going to be installed this year yep and then little be transferred over to Philip star sensor LED unit and number of the lights have had to be upgraded so it actually provides not only an artwork but a functional lighting system in their area which improves the ability for people to have walk

for half an hour is that all right okay money come forward sustainable ohshit ah he will do here go do some coming so i 'll just pull up a chair just in case you arrive okay Oh somebody can deliver that for us yeah thank you I 'll cure decoto we are here on behalf of sustainable auto tawheed Christchurch and I have accompanied worth by Jocelyn people and Elizabeth Guthrie and John Adams is cycling possibly as we speak from Kashmir hi to be here at one but I 'm sure he 'll understand I like we 're running very behind time so we just kind of want to get up everything so sustainable or totally Christchurch as a membership-based group of people who are very active in the community and at a recent public forum that we had about strong sustainability post-earthquake we had about 40 people present a very act of people and we come to you today from a another public meeting that we help this week and we apologize for the timing of it it would have been great if the council could have been councillors could have attended which was to hear the authors of the paper looking at the pect of privatization on the Wellington lines company we actually meet and that that it was a shame that it was held while we were hearing submissions and I 'm sure that the authors would be more than happy to come back down and talk to the council should you wish that one of them is external advisor to the Wellington councils audit and Risk Committee as well so it 's a document of substance so our aim as long term strong sustainability and I 'll repeat that it doesn 't our submission but we emphasize that long term strong sustainability means that people healthy basic needs met so that they can live in dignity and healthy communities with a minimum impact on natural systems both now in the future and it 's that 's currently written up that is inconsistent with that the essence of strong sustainability as ethics values and worldviews and an hour submission we have asked that you give a greater prominence to the principles of democracy and sustainability that they be the guiding principles that you use to make the very hard decisions that are in front of you at the moment we believe that if those values are adopted as a prerequisite and as the foundation that you will get the outcome of stability and diversity including biodiversity and resilience that we know that you 're looking for we believe also that the kind of crunch decisions that council has in front of it now mean that you 're in a unique opportunity you have a unique opportunity to take the change strategies and decisions that you need to take any organization needs to take to reach a strongly sustainable future and earn your hand out on the bag it 's an old it 's about about 20 years old now but the idea of the sustainability funnel demands on resources and systems mean that there 's less the change process of going through this is the funnel to be able to come out the other side better off and with the demands and the unusual demands of the earthquake in the spending require and income issues that you have bring the two things together so that we are working as we make the sacrifices which are inevitable 20 strongly sustainable future I 'm sure other submitters have talked to you about climate change and why it 's a good idea to believe in it that 's not our position that we 're advocating we 're saying that it 's sensible risk management there 's no point getting into an or as it right or is it wrong the prospects of disastrous climate change are expressed and probabilities and we need to plan for all eventualities so it has to be done in good conscience for our children and their futures now we have said to you that we don 't think that we can comment on many of the specifics that you 've put forward and we feel that that 's because the processes of reaching out _''_389.639 been asked to comment on or contribute to as not of substance and I mean there is a lot of sperm let 's face it we hear about unemployment for example where we 're told that the unemployment rate is virtually no 2.2% you know people say and I 'm sure possibly you even repeat it that what 's so low we know their names and yet there 's nearly 5,000 at the time that that statement was made 5,000 people under the age of 25 and the study unemployed during a so-called boom economy that 's the fact we 're here in the long term plan that christchurch rates are historically lower than those charged by other councils and yet we dug into the fine print and we see that in christchurch a property with a rating value of 600,000 as being paid it will pay two thousand six hundred and fifty seven dollars and an auckland a property valued at the same rate and let 's not get into their read hearing of what you can buy for your money in auckland it 's rated for that it it 's less in auckland okay water is on top of it but it 's less an auckland we look at the long-term plan where it says that Orion New Zealand was required to operate within a stretch statutory framework and councils influences limited or we listen to people who 've been on the electricity commission being part of the regulator 's who say that privatization is madness that if there is privatization the prices will go up so the council may as well retain those assets revalue them and pocket the increase prices at yourself because at least you 're going to retain control over there is it and you can put the prices down if you change the policy how you value those assets and if in terms of sustainability there is the example and wellington of the Lions company where the council is wanting to change the lights to LEDs to save electricity save costs in the response of the power company as well we have to maintain our profit margins we 're going to put the prices up recently sticking with power we find that twenty-five their houses properly thirty-three percent in Wellington what 's it going to be like and well in Christchurch when the power prices go through the roof under a privatized option so what we 're suggesting to you is that for assets at one minute that what you propose them will not be cost-effective for households and businesses and what we want you to do please is to step back and give some thought to the purpose your primary purpose which is to enable democratic local decision-making there is your primary statutory purpose a lot of people usually just run over it Oh we 'll just rush over to that no stuck with it give us a reason to stay in Christchurch give us the opportunity to create a future that our children will be able to and our grandchildren will be able to 11 give us the right to develop the tragic choices if those choices are there to be made if that 's really what it comes down to and take it to the next election of necessary so that we can vote on them so that though that defer rewrite your plans so any proposals to spend up over the next two or three years or any asset sales are put off go back to the drawing board and bring all the people of Christchurch into it and voc your engagement and consultation plan and make us perfect cure Dakota you ought to thank you very much and I prayed there isn 't time for questions so you know thinking for making the presentation on behalf of sustainable Oh totally I see that John _"

but Eric she was I was were talking on behalf of the secret city business association which was slightly more constrained than I to be personal yeah so this is like more out there I 'm not I 'm here not to ask for money by the way the person is I 'm here to try and solve some of your problems of trying to pay the things that everyone wants you to do but actually the pots limited so first of all I 'm just cinder the larger commercial properties will actually be paying closer to limited brakes on top of a further sixty-six percent rates differential as against residential properties in the longer term this will be unsustainable for businesses we must do things differently in my submission below has some suggestions strategic air sets we need to these need to be reviewed so not caught up in the past mindset there 's to come off the strategic asset list so that you have more flexibility to explore PPP public-private partnership opportunities providing for providing off street party at a time when council is cash short its case of back to basics then more about what a council must do rather than what it but he would be nice to do corrective ities our Road sir its regulations and the like most other activities can be tended out and achieved the same result or better with private enterprise competing in completely in providing real value for money council zapateria is an S as an asset that council has that it can use at no extra cost so for the council to tender something it 's a guaranteed payment whereas you attended to a contract he may go bust you should use that asset council should sell off totally city care and read bus sorry it 's not red bus red bus um the both of those you seek it does not look after your packs now and he looked after cemeteries I can 't see why on earth you 're competing against the sorts of other ones they 've never actually produced you enormous amount of profit yes you 're able to extract some capital out of them but it 's not providing actual income council should sell down to 51 percent sharing and companies such as crusher International Airport lizard import company a rhyme enable eco central the sale of shares to the right partner could actually increase revenue by these partners bring each to business to these business units all essex need to be looked at with an open mind asking are these really essential that the council should actually earn them a hundred percent council needs or eise equity to help pay for the council 's rebuild part community housing yes it 's a sacred cow this is not a call council activity I know it has been said that this is not subsidized by rates but it is tying up substantial capital were little or no return to council this should be on sold to other parties provide these services in the capital release the core activities and I am aware you 're looking at at doing that one of that another nice to have but can we get sorry so you 're going to retain it just put another vehicle right thank you very much um so another nice to have but can we can we afford it I believe Christ jet city is the second largest housing on outside of museum housing New Zealand and projects we need to review on our involvement and all of these delay defer or alter what has been done here town hall only repair the main auditorium as we already have the Isaac Theatre Royal a short distance away finished end of the same size of the James a theater we do not need two competing venues only a couple blocks apart Stadium you have to consider repairing the old Amy 's AMI Stadium if your insurance payout fails here at Stadium combined with the Metro sports facilities actually makes more sense as it could coach here parking restaurants and would then be big enough to attract a hotel suddenly economics change central library technology will change enormously over the next 10 years and council needs to retain flexibility here for and council Lisa back for 10 years with rights radial you 'll be surprised to see how good a deal you could cut on this one it would also save you another 85 million dollars of capital off street parking substantial off street parking is critical for the CBD revival and I know you 've heard lots about that priority bus lanes I totally support these if you want people to use buses more that needs to be faster and easier to take the bus than private cars cycle paths great read great to add to these I just crashed in the amount the dollar amount would concern over the short term on these and a nice to have but is it essential spread the expense out further thank you for listening to me it 's question time question time who would like to start david ben ali actually applauded the notion of combining the Metro sports with stadium yeah it 's something that 's been bandied around for a while what would be your preference to locate where would you locate that facility if it was actually a case with it not a mutt replace it add to it yeah all right yeah thank you it would handily make it within walking distance of the railway line Oh another little play in there Ellie it 's a nice segue mention about bus lanes and you know moving people into an easier transportation of their to use public transport but you don 't mention rail is that something you thought about to I think it 's the rail we all know what the framers cost to set up I think the rail is as another nice to have but probably out of our price range even with the hundreds of millions being spent on roads even with hundreds of millions spent on roads Jimmy unquestioned regarding to the off street parking because earlier of today when of summation regarding to the weather council consider you to provide provide the free the handle of the past no cooler CBD then the CBD have a kind of free bag kind of have the join the free bus you know public can minimize the off street parking so how is your point of it would revolutionize the city and people would part on the outskirts yeah but I don 't that you 're about to do that I don 't think you 'd like the loss of revenue and I think you 'd have pro with a lipid of net saying how big a subsidy all I 'm saying isn 't that it 's not us I don 't know no got he can conduct because good yeah but yet I think my suggestions say open it up to PPP 's I know you 've gone for expressions of interest and I put into that but none of us have heard back from Council and a skier that 's don 't take too long and come back to us um thank you he was next Paul I have a serious question it was under the CCB a heating but just the off street parking do you think that it 's actually cool critical council business to run parking buildings or do you think that this could be left to the private to seek that I think a mix i do not see it I really don 't care who owns that car pie I just worry about the price and if you have a mix of people actually the competition will ensure that the price is the right price yep Andrew oh sorry sorry sorry I mean just poking up on that the free you know two hours that you get at Westfield you know car parking up an Auckland that 's all run by Wilson 's so that 's actually paid for by the by this by the you know the shops and the thing yeah is I recognize that and you 'll notice I haven 't_''_542.19 suggested all talked about that at all I think there is an option but I think probably the better way is to actually have a rebate where it suddenly makes a sale then they actually issued a credit card that they put in the money machine when they don 't pay for their parking as they exit yeah that 's exactly the model they use an all come yeah excellent all right thank you very much thank you very much and that 's the end but I 've just noticed that my

pen and paper in front of you and I just like to invite you to do something oh I 'd like you to think about what home means to you and in one word in one word write down what you mean when you think of what home means to you just invite you to do there so wondering if I could ask you just to read out the one worried that you think of when you think of the word home seek chewy victory Emily Emily security security family peace oh well been tempted haven thank you for sharing your words we hear that the words that you 've used a pink shared with in Christchurch on behalf of the people of Christchurch especially tenants these words are the things that in these emotions and feelings are the things that city council have been providing to thousands of people and Christchurch for nearly 100 years whatever decisions that you make and whatever direction as long-term plan takes the people you serve and have a duty and opportunity to serve in the future must be in the forefront of your minds and any decisions that you 're about to make many of you may not know what our Maori nomas or even that we have one it 's to topple trtr kind of walk means to watch over protect people who stay or settle or live in a place and that 's why we are here today and have made our submission christchurch after the earthquakes more maneuver needs to know what home feels like it 's the basis on which you build the rest of your life from we 're not going to go into the detail of our submission I 'm sure you 've read it we want to say that the Christchurch be one of the most respected landlords in the country never forgetting what social housing means what it truly means what the change is going forward with the provision of housing by the council it 's essential that whatever pressures might come now or at any time in the future that housing assets held by the council and never given up that all of the aspirations within the long-term plan to continue to provide social housing and never let go the difference that the council has made by providing so many homes to so many people has a value that can never be quantified on a spreadsheet thank you for your work and your time and your commitment to the people of Christchurch will continue to hold to our Co pop out and will continue to hold you to yours thank you thank you questions Yanni thank you it 's obviously a number of issues that you 've raised I was just really interested and how we engage if just on page 128 you 've said that you know the consultation document wasn 't citizen friendly not so that the control in terms of housing because there is some quite big things we 're proposing to do but do you think there 's a different way going forward that we should engage around that those housing issues to try and I don 't_''_256.15 I help people understand what we 're trying to do but also talked to that the community about what the solutions are people need to be able to visualize in themselves actually in their housing and the future on what it means irrs and combination means nothing to somebody but if you start describing the paperwork they have to fill in the amount of time they have to talk to somebody will not talk to them they can imagine how there to fix them people need to visualize what their flex will look like they need to know if something will be different from them from the people that are next to them we 've asked people what they thought about the long-term plan they didn 't even know what it was but when you ask people how would you feel if you had to have a an opinion so you had to make it real for people we heard from the Human Rights Commission that one thing that 's often overlooked and housing and it was interesting a number of counters raises point was security and the detective of people 's basic right human right to have security of tenure do you think our proposals in terms of working with government or another other sectors private developers do you think that they raise any issues around security of tenure or control from countless point of view over the dead ability to provide housing to be honest you have a choice about what sort of tenure you provide you also have a choice about whether you give notices for people to move out and traditionally city housing has had the view that once you have that home that 's your home obviously housing new zealand 's are now introducing reviewable tendencies and some people who thought they had security of tenure may now have to leave and I would say that whatever housing arrangements you enter into to provide housing that security of tenure would be the I think we 've been pretty clear that we 're only interested in building communities not just houses though notice ask you the site around the house and of course there are a lot of people who use your other needs beside the actual counselor so what and when you understand in fact is no proposal in the opportunity to to reduce huge development but we are we that improve this year 's it has been reduced for number it 's been reduced so this matter as long as one of the NGOs do you see me or well Helen and I were here in support of sharing tool Stinson from Council of social services the day before yesterday I think it was and we certainly endorse their submission on on that and I know you heard from Sharon and I can certainly say as someone who works in an NGO the phone calls aren 't stopping or getting less in the time that it takes it 's more involved is certainly that needs not going to decrease we 've always been busy to be honest Phil it 's just were already there Thank You Rafe thanks um I know from your you 'll start that the TPI aims to promote advance the rights interests and welfare of tents and that that 's great and there 's some good stuff about housing but there 's also quite a lot of stuff which in your submission not related to housing which I was quite interested in one was around Orion which is a our electricity grid you said control of the electricity network is vital to ten and access to reasonable power charges and so must be retained by the council are you aware that the power price is regulated by the Commerce Commission I am what I 'm the reason that that is in there is because when we have talked to people about what 's important to them and the long to implant it as those basics like concerns around power supply who is going to be the inter fix things and how quickly is it going to get fixed and it was some feedback that we got from the people when we talked about the power charges are but it 's the retail I think well this is what your tenants are talking about other retail price which is which is not a Ryan yeah one can acquire what evidence and you say here the last paragraph your first page for example if council assets are sold or parcel to a shareholder or entity under a takeover arrangement then ninety percent can compulsorily acquire the remaining shares I 'm not quite sure what you mean by that I think the concerns are especially with the new housing trust that 's being developed is that you can have very good intentions to enable something but ultimately again people that we 've talked to want to know that there is no threat at all that control of companies are lost that especially the new housing trust very concerned that if a desire for the use of their asset changes that although there may be at the moment and aspiration to hold on to the social housing could change Glenn thank you thank you Lisa as you know we 've tried to promote EPA 's concept of a rental register it it we 've written 2mb haven 't heard back yet if you 've got a view over with a register as best run locally or nationally I 'm sure Helen would probably answer their question better but i think the registers acetal it 's great look thank you very much Lisa and do pass on our best wishes to Helen was sorry that she couldn 't make it but you

    "text": "um our Bruce Campbell I don 't know if you were here for the earlier submissions on on the subject oh okay no no no no just there 's been a lot of debate around thee well not debate but a lot of submissions on the subject so people are pretty familiar with the detail about um yeah okay thank you thank you thank you for the opportunity to make a submission yes I am Bruce Campbell from 54 to your this road and I 'm speaking on behalf of myself and also my adjacent neighbors I have I will not go through all that I 've written here at is there to be read but in principle I 'm objecting to the removal of the rural rebate and I based it on different points the first one being on the basis of that user pays and the National the natural fairness of it as you will be aware then that we receive very few services with counsel no surge no water supply no storm water system no footpath no street lighting and the council has not had to provide the ongoing maintenance and the capital cost was involved in these would exceed what the rebate would be on the rates and and I 'm sure that they work that the rebate was given because of these rural properties had to provide during services not because that they were farmers and on the second basis I received a letter from mr. Steve ballard when I inquired about this about the basis for changing this I rate rebate and was to do with ruler places being actively farmed or not and is rationale for a while the that policy that the rating policy was based on had to be the 25 cent discount on general rate it had to be actor fine well I do not believe that actor farming is dependent on land area it should be based on the the function that is happening there the land area has been proposed as a determinant of actor farming to avoid reliance on the judgment limit of individual rating staff ground area is no way irrelevant determinative act of farming the nature of the enterprise being carried out on that land left to the City Council individuals this judgment has already been carried out by the iid and may be made available to the Christchurch council thirdly the use of the property is designated by the City Council in the past they have always said that because it was in the airport influence zone the purpose was to port to continue as a primary production area and farming was the main stay there and so I 'd like to point out that in our area that actor farming is being carried out by the neighbors supporting the submission there is stud deer breeding there 's market gardening is cattle raising and each operation is carried out on less than five hectares our own property is an alignment with a stated City Council objective mentioned above our operations and intensively farmed organic export apple orchard and is a full-time occupation it 's certified by bio grow and assure equality for export to most countries in the world these certifications confirm that our highest standard of Environmental farming practices being complied with our orchard is only organic export apple orchard in Canterbury we used to continue to meet the CCC 's aspirations rural rebate should be maintained to encourage rural use of the land you remove the rebate would be disincentive to farming so I jektu the removal of the rural rebate on the principal size alone should not determine what is a rural property the fourth and more contentious one most probably is the limited use of the land in the area that hasn 't been known as our five but i think that is under chat undergoing a change to but the dominance of the christchurch international airport over rural fire zone limits the free use of the land for this reason the land has limited the long term potential and is only suited for rural use the airport has ultimate authority over the use of the land not the landowner the use of the land can be put the use of the land can be put to keeps getting further restricted by the airport and and keep seeing further restricted added to the Christchurch City Council long-term plan we had tenants on our own land and we do not have basis that this is really rural land should be rural land and we have not got the full use of land in the letter from the Christchurch City Council the they notified the proposal saying that the rate rebate this was not to increase or decrease the rates but I believe that the rate increases significantly increased by this rate rural rebate removal and my suggestion is that the council needs more income I think an upfront and honest approach with the council levies right across all ratepayers for a kept number of years for a fixed purpose say the earthquake recovery covery for a period of the long-term plan would be the way to go a levee that is transparent I 'm sure would be acceptable to the majority of ratepayers and I for one would be happy to contribute thank you thank you very much as I 've said to other submitters on the subject we are having a good look at the policy as part of our final deliberations on it but we 'll certainly be taking these measures into account I hope them really models thank eloquent and very very good thank you _"

    "text": "good afternoon um you 're not rosy Davidson I know just an instant clear but and thank you for the opportunity to talk to you my name is Steve lounge and I am currently chair of the Acura civic trust my association with banks peninsula goes back to the time of a Kuro County Council and then banks peninsula District Council I was a counselor at the time of abolition when the cost of water and wastewater compliance the cost of tourism of roading and the expectations of the 21st century finally caught up with us as you well know since then the communities of the peninsula have remained much the same populations are stable and growing slowly they are resilient they have a huge sense of place and they are very conscious of a collective history the peninsula is rich in every aspect of cultural heritage biodiversity and wild landscapes and rugged coastlines it is complementary to the city 's urban environment and yet there is a sense that this is not yet fully appreciated there are four thriving Runanga at coker errata rapaki wire eywa and on lucu recreation this year we are celebrating a hundred and seventy-five years of European settlement a Curragh was the first successful settlement of new zealand by europeans and as chance would have it they happened to be French so there is a strong French Connection and frequent contact with cultural attachés and ambassadors the Agora Civic trust was established 45 years ago with helped from the architect Peter Bevan it was the first and is now one of seven or eight active Civic trusts around the country it is charged with the protection of the built environment of a karora and its environs akharas extensive collection of intact colonial homes makes its town escapes unique as a consequence of this the trust has entered the resource consent process on many occasions and with considerable success at one hearing over twenty years ago it became clear that the use of the term historic precinct was legally meaningless unless it was backed up with lines on a map the trust worked with heritage New Zealand to establish an Acura historic area as part of the district plan and this is referenced in our submitted on long-term plans and played an active part in district plan formulation the trust has played a vital role on the acura design and appearance advisory committee since its establishment nearly 40 years ago we are hugely frustrated by the fact that nearly two years since the last election this subcommittee of council has still not been appointed and we 're also frustrated that or disappointed if you like that the council did not roll over the provisions of the existing Banks Peninsula district plan until the city plan was sorted thus alleviating some of the huge pressure on staff to meet unrealistic deadlines the trust was instrumental in the establishment of the Takapuna key reserve which encapsulates a history Maori and Pakeha which rivals Waitangi in its national significance this is a hugely unrecognized resource currently we are working with heritage New Zealand to stabilize and eventually preserve the French naval building at French farm it was constructed in 1843 and is one of the oldest in the South Island we have published books pamphlets guides and new less newsletters and last year we received a civic award board which comprises an eclectic mix of members who enjoy robust debate we have a subscription base of over 200 people many of whom live in Christchurch we hope that our corporate knowledge of issues pertinent to a Corot will be continued to be recognized and used as a resource by this council our submission is in three parts and I believe they have all been touched upon by previous submitters the first part of our submission with regard to the post office building the service center in information center is perhaps our strongest suit the level of tourism in accra demands that there should be a an adequate information centre the building is up to code the funding has been allocated and yet this building has been sitting empty and an I saw for four years and it 's about time that the services which were available in that building before the earthquake are restored the second item with regard to the Acura wharf this was a surprise to us when the figure of 11 million dollars appeared in the long-term plan we had no acknowledged that that this like the council to take note of is that the wharf is part of the historic area and therefore needs to be as such and of course there are many Worf 's around the harbor in a Corral which are of equal significance to residents and again I believe you 've received submissions on that the third item or in our submission is really a heads up to you and it is a very real one it 's an existential threat it has increased markedly over the last few years every year there has been a storm that has further degraded the sea walls which in time will threaten businesses along the foreshore so that is a serious heads up for you thank you very much I seem to have gone at the time I know you haven 't_''_446.889 gone over time so I 'll open that up for questions I 'm an issue for highlighted that a number of the issues have been raised by other submitters yes and I was aware of that it 's my long prologue yeah no no no but and thank you for that for the submission as well very thorough submission and thanks for raising the issues the second point that you make in the submission relating to the wharf are you suggesting in the last line of the first paragraph the repair of other wards and jetties around akaroa harbour may be of equal importance to the local community that maybe we need to interrogate that 11 million for the a corolla Wharf and see what exactly is intended there and were there to be a saving on the a Corot Wharf maybe some of that funding could be put into the community wharf such as Robinson 's Bay for example well that would mirror our thinking and the point has perhaps been made that the we presume that the work estimate is based on an opus report which is about four years old which predates the tonkin taylor report on sea level rise so I would imagine that that that exercise that you suggest would could be a very valid one if that figure were looked at again and part of that figure apportioned to the other Worf 's which are harbor thank you Steve so with that in mind would would you say on behalf your trust that fixing the damage sea walls is a higher priority xfit for echo our residents well the wharf is obviously of huge importance in terms of tourism specially as the cruise ships are coming into the harbor anecdotally we hear that the wharf isn 't in bad shape that 's just anecdotal and it 's from the current users of off the wharf the wharves around the harbour are a vital part of of the community and under are of equal importance yes the sea walls it 's something which is unfolding few weeks ago more holes opened up along the front of Beach Road the main tourist area of the town it 's it the incidence of damage is growing every year I so it 's a heads up somebody needs really to take this quite seriously because there 's a lot of reclaimed land there in the in a Curragh to thank you Steve pea merchants in the community board chairs as yes there too so thank you for that and thank you very much Steve good to see you and put your gradual ations again for all the work that you do and thank you for all that you do on our behalf thank you thank you _"

counselors i 'm ashley campbell cheer of green in the red zone and this is mark Huxtable who is struggling with your powerpoint presentation at the moment who is also a member of bringing the red zone and a landscape architect we just need to sort this out otherwise it 's not going to work here we go what 's wrong I 'm guessing how do you get that from it 's pretty close sorry about this folks okay okay looking through my attempt it you talk about reader we might have to do it from other handouts sorry it 's not cooking three we might have to just go ahead and do this hopefully if you can follow the handouts so anyway we can zoom out of this tri-state okay that 's what I always do yep it 's okay we 'll have to do it by the handles sorry about 's not ideal but we 'll do it by the handouts thank you for letting us speak to you today as you prepare your long-term plan we know you 've got accomplished clips task trying to balance your budget while meeting the needs of a rebuilding city so we 'd like to ease your task just a little we 're not here to ask you for money we can 't ask you for money because like you we don 't know what the future of the land that we hear about will be it may be owned by you it may be owned by Community Trust it may be owned by the government it may be owned privately it may be all or any of these and until we know the outcome of the ownership structure we can 't make financial requests but we are here to ask you for consideration influence and support the work you do every day touches on the red zone and influences what can happen within it your drainage roads in infrastructure your public musings about what you 'd like to happen in there all ask that everywhere that you touch the red zone you do so in a way that makes the very best outcome for Christchurch possible or at the very least doesn 't hinder it green in the red zone is a community group of people who want our red zone returned to nature we 've been going for about a year and in that time we 've made a difference and we have visuals we have with your officers blessing planted over 250 native plants and two red zone council-owned parks next week with the otaku Park scout group will plant more than 150 more native plants in another red zone council-owned park we 've engaged the new brighton Volunteer Fire Brigade to help nurture the plants in Harold Henry park as over so they emptied a fire truck full of water every week on those plants to ensure that they could survive their first year we worked with Sarah to identify patches of rich native bush the offense and protect them from clearance spraying and mowing and they do need that protection with our volunteers we 've weeded out the chance of surviving and there are many many seedlings his co-firing cabbage trees for Africa in one aven side section alone there are literally thousands of self seeded rubberwood seedlings like you we have a long-term plan which we believe will be of huge benefit to Christchurch like you our plane is still a work in progress when it 's complete with very much like an opportunity to come and present it to you and full but today we can give you a glimpse into what it could be in what we 're asking you to support over to you that things as you 're funny great working just this second so that 's quite handy as you can see the main thrust of our proposals mosaic of native habitat areas working with our colleges we 've come up with a habitat map that covers the main species this includes both forests and wetland habitats including bringing back the noble forest trees such as Totoro Matt I and kakatiya where appropriate and wetland in the lower lying areas people will be able to experience the forest to existing Road routes center close to the city could service the majority of activities in the park while providing a hub for information higher functions cafe and education center where our forest park can offer a living laboratory where visitors and residents and students can learn and contribute to the conservation of our native wildlife this to the site could be served by bus tram or low impact land train which could run from the site through cassine confirm Cathedral Square to New Brighton a wildlife sanctuary protects our vulnerable species community parks and the fringes of the forest have provide clearings for people to enjoy the forests in their local vicinity and provide opportunities for picnics natural play and a place to relax and unwind you can see the red zone boundary on the outside what 's exciting here is that we wouldn 't just be creating a forest park we 'd be creating a ribbon of green that would connect the other adjacent green spaces effectively doubling the size of the area great for residents wildlife and all that smoke in the winter there are many beloved species already retained to return an established Forest Park could see the likes of Kerry tui more pork kakoen our skies once more the noble native trees such as Totoro Matt I kakatiya in our forests and hair akechi rail po boy in our weapons of course the forest park wouldn 't be a proper part without the ability for everyone to enjoy it in our own way that respects the forest and other users we could choose to bike along cycle tracks walk through the forest along the river climb a tree amp or even stay in the tree house there are many ways the forest can generate income even save the city council money some of the many ideas for revenue generation include sustainable forestry concessions events boat and bike hire even horse riding concerts sponsorship and many more as well as generating revenue directly a forest park would also create huge savings of benefits for the City Council and local community through urban regeneration of surrounding areas flood protection of low-lying areas improved water quality reduce costs decrease crime increased community cohesion or maintained and planted by willing volunteer workforce this low cost low impact affordable solution for our red zone I think this slide does the talking for me so ladies and gentlemen before I hand you back to Ashley I 'd like to finish by showing you a vision of the future this is where we are today standing in a even side in 2015 now we travel forward a hundred years into the future and yes maybe that jumper will have gone out of fashion well maybe she was just going for a red trailer it already is we 'll never know what we do know is though this could be our legacy for future generations an exciting clean green native new zealand jewel in the midst of our city for everyone to enjoy I 'll hand you became faster you thank you thanks man you 've read errors and submission we hope you read our recent submission so you know the economic and social benefits that will flow from a large red zone native forest park flood protection carbon sequestration health promotion air quality improvement relay them all out and we provide the evidence we 've outlined he can to quantify the economic savings and use that information in your negotiations with government they I 'd like to paint a picture of the social environmental health and financial benefits that are red zone forest park come bring last week in this room dr. John Cook spoke of the need to create cost-free opportunities to be active close to home for the people of the East and Gary Moore spoke of the green rebuild of Christchurch well what about a Bixley wetland with a stop banks right back at Anzac drive where the people of the East and everyone else can fish kayak run jog and canoe where they can get in among nature and observe kotaku bittern hide and little shakes and many more a big Slee wetlands that gives the people of New Brighton confidence that they won 't be flooded at every high tide because the water from the sea has somewhere to go what about Psychopaths where families can safely cycle from New Brighton to even side and even into the city without having to spend a cent while in the other direction tourists down to New Brighton for the day spending their money there while getting a genuine new zealand natural experience what about the ability to jog through a forest in the middle of winter breathing clean air not smog while listening to the songs of TUI Kaka Bell boots khaki Ricky and more it 's working with nature not against it to create the best environment for our city and our people these are just some of the opportunities that Ava no totoro forest park offers us we won 't be offered them again help us to make the most of them thank you thank you very much I 'm not sure what we 've got the minutes ago so Paul i think is fantastic don 't think you 'd understand awesome and this one ask a question you would have heard about the Eden Project and you would have the desire to have a you know a little book style sort of that rowing like do you see that as being no we don 't see either of those two projects and this we do see many of the other champions and say can you see yourselves and part of us so we don 't really want to name them at the moment but we are going for low cost we are going for natural we are going for sustainable and we are going for not hugely engineered there 's we always spend those are money this is a cost-effective solution thank you very much much appreciated thank you ocurro 's civic trust _"

    "text": "next is heaven Tate and I wanted to talk to the council and I submitted on two separate points the first one is to edge the council to have the courage of your convictions as far as the the draft plan for the source of funding both increase in rates in some partial asset sales I know you 've had a huge number of submissions opposing both of those things and under normal circumstances I 'd certainly have joined people who are opposed to asset sales but these are not normal circumstances none of us wanted an earthquake to happen but given that it did it provides challenges and opportunities and we elected the council to make responsible and appropriate decisions about how funding should be done and as I say I know you 've had plenty of submissions opposing the draft proposal as far as fundings concerned and I felt it was appropriate for somebody to speak for me I hope majority of people who think that what is proposed as appropriate and as a sailor cheater to stick with the courage of your convictions I pay rates on I 'm happy to deal with an increase nobody 's happy to deal with increases but i believe it 's appropriate to provide the city that we all want to live in and i still think that even with the increases we get very good value for our rates so stick with it the second and specific thing that i wanted to make a submission on and i have submitted on this previously and written to both the council end to the ccd you about the and provision for the new Central Library you might even say magd on the subject I believe I was the project manager for the previous central library so I do have something of an interest in the the subject apart from the general residents interest but I do see the central library as being a project that really can be a jewel in the crown for the council stadiums are controversial convention centers a controversial but typically libraries are something that all citizens value and use heavily and something that can be an absolutely positive symbol of redevelopment for the city when I 've size that 's proposed for the new Central Library the previous central library was too small as soon as it opened even though it had been responsibly planned to meet the needs that we thought were appropriate but immediately after it opened we had to start planning for additions and extensions in the original way back long term plan prior to the earthquake when the replacement of the central library was well down the agenda discussion was about a new Central Library twice the size of the previous one each time proposals appear it 's got smaller and smaller and smaller there was a commitment at one stage to 12,000 square meters it 's now down to less than 10 which is not that much larger than the previous central library at over than over 7,000 square meters I suspect that given the stage of planning that concern about the size as perhaps too late to revise if it 's not possible to increase the size that I think it makes it doubly important that you look at spending to produce a quality building I 'm really impressed with what order to achieve the things they proposed with meeting spaces exhibition spaces and so on it 's important that on an ongoing basis the council is putting money into the staffing of making full use of those facilities the quality of exhibitions that can be mounted there the programs that can be run in public spaces and so on and given the size issue it 's also going to be important that you recognize there will be a custom providing off-site storage somewhere else in the city because the size that 's proposed is not going to do everything so there 's going to have to be other if it as well so I guess the bottom line of what I want to say to you recognizing that the clock 's ticking down is please don 't skimp on it it 's an opportunity to do something that can be a really exciting symbol of the redevelopment of the city or it can be just a boring box at minimal cost and not done well so please put the funding both in the capital development and the ongoing provision for thank you very much no much appreciated _"

    "text": "thank you welcome to no koto tena koutou tena koutou katoa you worship the mere counselors and thanks for your time today I appreciate this is an intense time of listening for you all at the moment and so I 'm here to talk about the enviros schools program head of an overview and virus calls is a program that 's came out of local government and it 's designed to develop more resilient and sustainable communities by working with children and young people and because we 're choosing to it with children young people we work through the school system it was designed in the late 1990s very intentionally to bring about sort of a community level change and it had some specific aspects which as it won 't go into here they 're on a screen and we 've also got a handout but well you know particularly thought about how it needed to work long-term and I guess one of the key points about it 's not a project it 's not it 's not a sort of community project in that sense it is a it goals and what we know is that long-term sustained involvement is really important from both funders and participants it was we 've got a particular organizational model which has been designed to be scalable and we can adapt locally and also been be work nationally so our organizational structure the organization I work for works of the initial liberal and partnership with another Mari organization we 're funded by the ministry for the environment at this present time up until the middle of next year we work with a network of about fifty two councils at the moment there is a regional coordinator in each region so in Andrea here and Canterbury and a network of facilitators so the way in viruses works with schools is a little bit different to a lot of other programs that go into schools it 's not an expert taking the class which was what often happens when when program goes into a school it is about long-term coaching and development of a culture change within the school or within the early childhood center working with teachers so and it 's definitely a strategic things that are important to be a wave and under what happening in the school in their communities so in Canterbury as I say there 's Andrea and the coordination Ron Floyd and funded through a can and there are network of three facilitators who work across the region with groups of schools 70 to embarrass schools and total broken down into some schools and some early childhood centers and funding partners enjoyed yourselves through the sustainable communities fund and three of your district councils as well as Environment Canterbury and doc this is a little bit of a look at where the money comes from and where the schools and centers themselves come from so the the graph on the left is in the 2014-15 year total funding for the enviro Schools program and Canterbury some vehicles Canterbury was two thousand two hundred and eighteen thousand dollars so the bulk of their server half of that coming from Environment Canterbury and then contributions from doc and ourselves so making up just about two-thirds sort of across the whole region and then contributions from various territorial authorities so yourselves the year was five thousand dollars which has gone up and down over time and it is included on page 2 of our written submission however forty three percent of the schools that are involved in a virus schools are in the city so we 've got forty-three percent of the schools in two percent of the overall funding which is why other partners are our submission and why it was included in the Environment Canterbury submission as I understand that was was addressed to you the other week so this is the kind of disconnect that we 're trying to work through at the moment so i 'll come back to some of that at the end what i wanted to share with you though is so many great news at the end of last year we ran what is the largest survey of what 's happening environmental education and new zealand schools that 's ever been run and here 's some just information about it but we had a really great participation across the country and as you can see higher than the national average participation here in canterbury going to busy school teacher is quite an achievement and speaks to the value that the two serpents place in this program the evaluation experts that we worked with on this were blown away by the quality of the data that we got back so what we found out is schools and centers involved are taking a huge variety of actions and this program is very much about not just one singular super encouraging people to take action across a range of issues that are important to them so you can see things around waist and food and biodiversity I 've done by just about every enviros school in the country some of the more challenging areas are still done so you know it 's hard to take action on buildings like two-thirds of schools are doing something around more ecologically friendly building switcher which is really encouraging for us as a territorial Authority obviously one of their shoes for ways to most landfill so what we know is that almost all enviros was doing something about waste and unfortunately they 're doing a lot of different things you know to do they 've got organic systems they 're reducing their thinking about their purchasing policies you know so that most of them are doing you know 3.4 so three to four activities so that was really heartening for us in terms of the depth of practice we also found that there was really great action and biodiversity and again across a range of areas and the important thing in this one as in terms of things like restoration planting a huge proportion of there is restoration planting with communities so this is one of the ways and virus schools is really getting into supporting relationships and communities food production so you know that this to us is about about resilience about community building and you know for example if you look on the graph in terms of food distribution you know more than half of the food grain has been eaten by the community and what we see is the longest schools are involved the more they 're thinking about where is their food going other people that are actually hungry in the community should they be growing a and and that 's really raising a much stronger community ethos and we 've seen some really good evidence of it and both these results and the statistics but also in the comment of the survey so water obviously a very big issue here in Canterbury and and we 've got about two thirds of the schools in the country are doing things in the water area and again in terms of resilience and looking at you know natural disaster and what you guys have been through here and Christchurch you know half the schools getting now into rainwater harvesting so just raising that consciousness of how to do that you can do that you can have a local source of water which if the tech doesn 't work you 've got a backup so this is where enviros schools is you know looking at a range of different issues and then weaving them all together so they might be using the rainwater harvesting to one of the orchard for example but it 's also the emergency use of needed all of us we 've seen really great eighty-two percent with the community as a direct result of enviros schools and the sort of parts of the community they are engaged with her up on the slide it 's obviously connection with council because it 's councils that are funding this program but also other things you can see community restoration groups which I mentioned earlier the Department of Conservation working with a we a range of other people learning and the community so this to us is really great a fine because it was the whole point of that program we were working with children young people to make change in communities and what we 've found from the surveyors that 's working because schools are more connected with the communities which as I say what we 've wanted really long a lot of information on here which I won 't go into and depth but because the approach is across a lot of issues because it 's taking time to empower young people and get their perspectives before just rushing off and doing a whole lot of actions and because its long-term year after year facilitators working with community connections you get a range of outcomes so you 're sure you 're getting outcomes for the physical environment like less waste going into the landfill and a healthier waterway which is great but you 're also getting people feeling more connected understanding what citizenship means understanding more about the cultural connections in this and even some economic things which is not at all a of our program but it 's a really useful side value that the participants are seeing coming through so really this program as an investment a long-term investment and community resilience and there are three things that I 'm here today to sort of asked for you to consider as council they 're not obviously very aware of the huge number of submissions the huge number of competing priorities however I do understand that investing in community is something that you 're really wanting to do and i would put to you that in virus schools is actually really cost effective way for Christchurch City Council to invest in its communities the things that we really need to make this partnership work and sort need from our Council partners consistency in the funding and you 'll see from paige Turner submission it 's gone thirty thousand year after year after year than 10,000 and then 20 and then five so that contestable grants process makes it really impossible to plan and it 's putting a lot of pressure back in the system because essentially the other council partners like how can we manage something when something 's going up and down like that and Mount closer to actual costs as important there are 31 Christchurch schools involved 39 more that want to be involved thirty thousand is not the cost of supporting those schools it 's higher than that it 's closer to 45,000 however the other council partners including the Regional Council recognize the funding pressure that you 're under so therefore the the contribution being asked for its 30,000 as a way of making a meaningful contribution to the costs of supporting schools and Christchurch City and potentially allowing some incremental growth of those 39 that are really came to be involved and the other thing we really need as a closer best out of this program to make it work strategically and I 'm pleased to say that 's starting to happen now so we 've made some progress on that I think there 's no point having money if you don 't have the relationship exactly exactly so but at the times up i 'm afraid so look thank you very much he can also submitted asking us to put that back on our budget so obviously that 's something that we will be considering and we presented very well and given us a lot of lot of food for thought right thank you much _"

    "text": "and the Donald foster from the DMP foster family trust I think you were here to here the previous submission on the subject so it might give you some comfort well thank you for hearing me I I understand there have been a number of submissions on this particular issue so if you 'll bear with me I have some points to make that weren 't made in the previous submission I just want to cover actually today that the claims made for proposed eligibility don 't stack up the proposal that i think is poorly thought out there are errors of principle and credibility and the current criteria may not be perfect but they 're generally acceptable workable more credible and given the claim of rate take neutrality it really makes no sense for the council to change just looking at that first point Steve ballads explanatory letter which I 've noted down below claimed the proposed changes were to clarify qualifying criteria improve transparency predictability and consistency our property is 4.3 hectares which is under the five hectare limit and it has a land to capital value ratio proposed limit of sixty-six percent the point I want to make is that this could easily toggle like many other properties at every rate or valuation between being eligible and not eligible I mean so the question I ask is how would you rate that for transparency predictability and consistency the next point I want to raise is I think the proposal is poor I think it 's flawed and low on credibility the leader I 've just prepared from steve Bello advisors eligibility currently depends on city 's zoning and ashamed economic use the proposed long-term plan on page 78 six down that the object of these differentials is to collect less from identified remote rural properties it 's bad enough that those statements not compatible on the rationale justifying the rates concession but worse neither acknowledges that the historic and fundamental reason relates to lower level of service to remote rural properties compared with urban properties and that lower level of service remains to be it remains the case and that service principal there 's nothing to do with property size one obvious reason neither document acknowledges this property size criterion we found productively but unlike our larger neighbors don 't qualify on proposed property size but we also suffer the same diminished level of services under the general rate though the proposed policy is arbitrary as a mere noted and under staff I ibly discriminates against us as and many others in our situation rate take neutrality the letter claims the proposed change and eligibility criteria is rape ninja if that is the case it can be no justifiable reason for the council to make a change when the proposed policy has little credibility and less integrity with it than the existing policy which is generally accepted by ratepayers so my conclusion is for those of you who remember the funeral that erupted when CCC last proposed to change the rule rate differential policy which in that case was a proposal to eliminate it it would seem foolish now to support a supposedly rate neutral change which lacks integrity and as full of absurd effects and inconsistencies as I 've demonstrated and fails to even acknowledge the basic reason for the concession the present policy may have and councillors should stick with it rather than hope open up a new can of worms it would be wrong and my view to support a proposed change unless you are also prepared to provide those smaller properties with a halt with the full suite of services available to every ratepayers thank you thank you I just think that pretty much sums it up given that it spreads neutral there is something that will take into account that one of the disadvantages of made never actually expecting that I would be the mirrors that I have absolutely no memory of the Ferrari that erupted the last time a council tried to do this because obviously I wasn 't living in a rural rate area so I certainly have we 've heard enough advice from from people who 've submitted to know that it was a Ferrari indeed size fours yeah so thank you very much and we 'll be taking it into account thank you that _"

    "text": "dorn Steve good morning good morning branstad and my submission regarding the proposed changes to the rural rating system as you probably know that initiative under the new proposal you have to have a property greater than five hectares or the rate land value is more than sixty percent of the rateable capital we are fruit growers at 754 marshland road and this is a commercial fruit growing business we have operated at this address for the past 40 years and my parents before that the site is 4.88 five hectares an area and the fruit growing businesses both productive and profitable as a rural property we 've traditionally been subject to rural rates with the change in the threshold to the property size and the percentage of capital value the proposed change will mean we are subject to the general and residential rate this will be a substantial increase in rates for Noah increase in demand or services somewhere about seven hundred thirty dollars a year it 's going to cost us extra for rates and the sim there 's no particular justification for the five-year threshold if our 't be having a problem that 's what this increase will add to our costs to our fruit growing business and make us less competitive one of the aims of the real rate must be to encourage the production of lame around the city and and make that more efficient someone needs to feed Christchurch the SEC do you think six percent threshold may seem generous but once you have a house like we have storage sheds implement shed and a cool store which we require for our operation we are over the threshold so I think we should look at a reduction on the size of the thresholds to 4.5 hectares that 'll suit me may not suit laughs but which will continue to capture the vast bulk of life of 4 hectare lifestyle block slits I understand seems to be the problem while encouraging production on the larger blocks such as ours or rebate process similar to that of a low income property owners with genuine rural land users of less than 48 days of summer five hectares can be made subject to the rule rates I yep are to the rural rates to make it easier to manage hmm well that may be so but it 's going to penalize us as producers that 's my submission think you look there 's been a lot of submissions on the subject and it you are quite right that the motivation is administrative ease we 've heard a lot of arguments about why that results in an unfair outcome in terms of the previous rule so we 'll certainly be taking those into account Ellie I 'm interesting that you mentioned as an alternative a different size of lens some of the submissions have talked about use of the land items on the land there was a dead one yesterday who listed a number farm buildings animals this is the way some other I think the free shape between lifestyle and working phone how do you feel about moving away from perhaps that sighs as she and look at components or parts of their land that suggests that it 's a working working farm as opposed to lifestyle block but might sound a good idea but how would you sort of a blanket sort of a cover otherwise if you look at each individual property it 's going to be a bit of a nightmare on that that 's actually the existing rule the existing rule is that as it is a it is a discount for farming so because otherwise and you know I mean otherwise the lifestyle blockers you know why should they pay you know lease or pay on a differential when they 're all they 've got as a larger property than other house owners and crash it why should I pay more rights when you ask my neighbor who has lived for four meters wide was very different right so and it is an arbitrary number and it is purely for the administrative ease so it 's easy to say you 're five you know so that that you 're quite right when you say that that 's the basis for the decision and that you are also right that it has produced perverse outcomes which administrative arbitrary decisions often do so we 're taking that into account when we make our final decision for coming _"

    "text": "good morning or good morning and welcome yes it 's great to see you all here I 'm thinking about all their problems and I know it 's a big job mine is it off the head off the top of the head submission I live in the central city I 've been involved in doing things with the city in the past and I want to be involved again I want the central city to be vibrant and full of people that way of course the city sustains itself now one of my things is artwork and I congratulate you all on getting artwork through the city it 's wonderful to bike round and see these wonderful walls and the scotland 's that are around the city then test it and I have friends all over the world who have been here and say this is great this is great and I encourage you to do more to do more honest I like personally and I think most of you will have traveled throughout the world and you see something vibrant and huge and it stays in your mind would think something near the airport we 've got a great new confluence of roads coming through and something in that area could be put up there 's many artists in New Zealand who would I I would say would welcome the opportunity to put something here and I 'm saying some of them would do it with their own volition I would put my house up for someone to live there and work on this they would do it for nothing i 'm sure i know many artists and i 'm sure you do and with a little bit of encouragement i know that people from overseas would like to come here and contribute to this city it 's going to be one of the best and new cities in the world isn 't it hmm yes it is so that 's one of the things I 'd like to say one thing I 've written here about the peacock fountain what other cats had it dropped in color it 's now drab and daddy the original colors were amazing and vibrant could we not I would be happy bring it back to its original colors as I 've said here city once again reinvents its heritage and vibrant color and that 's what we should be doing there 's artists out there who are willing to put their hands out but you know there 's all the politics involved with up so please let 's do something on that vein I have been contacted by some artists overseas and I wish to travel overseas shortly and I know some would come here and do some of this work but they need a council stamp of approval or something to put it could be put out there I would work on this myself lovely yep oh well I will excellent and the media attention you imagine it 'd be fantastic I 've got here movement cycleways I biked here today I 'm sure a lot of you do bike it 's wonderful what a great date is today it is we 've been here a long time I congratulate you silly 0 sold when I left for work this morning it was dark and you 'll go home in cold oh so more cycleways and one thing I noticed when I came here I couldn 't find a place to park my bike its all full so maybe we get some bike stands it sounds not much but it is something that would be great easy to do I 've had some business owners say to me you know you 've seen any bike stands laying around that we could put near air business and I 've seed years but it 's up to him now the bus system I think we should reintegrate the free bus maybe not quite yet because the city is not back and running but that free bus could run around the perimeter and people would park here and come into the city because parking as you know is such a huge problem that the wonderful people who are building these new buildings in the city are worried and if you did the free bus and it went round the outskirts pick people up drop people off it is a cost but I 'm sure we didn 't get it back sorry sale of as possible I understand we are pretty much dire straits and on a world scale it 's very difficult but the more we keep the better will be in the future going back just a second here with the buses someone previously said yes bring buses from the outer districts kaiapoi Rangi hora they only need to be say a once a day thing or maybe twice a day to get the people in and direct direct buses I 'm sorry I 'll see I 'm out of time but the one other thing I 'd said I 'm prepared to put myself up to help get community works going again and I see someone 's put on the paper recently you guys have said get our community Ward 's to rein in the volunteers and get volunteers retired people or people who may be on the benefit to get out there and do something in their suburbs reduce costs get people moving ahead and this of course will promote leaders as you saw with the the army that came in what a wonderful thing that guys near promoted and again yeah thank you for your time I just oh and just letting it go to started comment that one other submission recommended there in the meantime before we can get the bus up and running again the free bus that maybe all of the buses travelling and from the for revenues should be free from the four avenues which means that people could park on the for revenues and then take the bus on for free and thought that 's actually a really really sound idea because it gets it up we 've got to think what are we doing the transition because we can 't afford to put things back straightaway but what a smart idea that clever yes they are congratulations everyone for will you work here and congratulations that person these thoughts are coming out and isn 't able to get it in a forum it 's great that 's great so thankful to have such a positive submission as yours yeah really invigorated hey you start the pig hot fountain debate all over again it was all over it did it that 's right what it was easier to beg forgiveness than to ask for promotion it 's true hey _"

    "text": "a central Brooklyn residents association I understand that the name of the person who is coming up to us on a piece of paper that I can happen locate where is it time oh I put it in the rubbish next one sorry Margaret grace thank you good morning I 'm here it 's a resident of the essential recommend residents association to verbalize a submission the actual one was more detailed so I only cover parts of it this morning central vikatan basically area surrounding western wall has changed beyond recognition in recent some residents even remember fields and orchards in an area now probably the most densely populated in christchurch the second largest mall in new zealand and two of the busiest roads in and out of christchurch we were pleased by the long-term plan consultation document it seems to be frank complete and lists many options rather than saying this way or that way I hope everyone who had an opinion on the long-term plan sleds document from cover to cover there 's a feeling that people are currently in key positions to financial and executive officers than being in the past the vast majority of residents in central riccarton live in rental properties and so exhibit great examples of how low inflexible incomes have been affected by the earthquakes and their resulting problems as with most residents of the city we 've had to tighten our belt large rent increases have affected us as well as increased traffic and social changes caused by the influx of shoppers and evening patrons we think it 's also a time for the City Council to tighten its own belt and help those who make Christchurch what it is today and what it will be in the future rates cannot be allowed to rise by the amounts being considered we should not accept this as individuals or as a city my rates are currently eight-point-five percent of my net income and if proposals go through they would rise to me eleven percent I pay relatively more by living on my own the same as twenty-five percent of Christchurch household we totally endorse mr. Brown these comments about reducing fairly unnecessary expenditure quote a polite way of saying waste some examples by email most utilities do this let 's say under the 30,000 household late pays for bills a year 70 cents ago instantly 360 thousands on the same reducing unnecessary trips and courses and I 'll favorite but it 's what the rest of us are having to do let 's look at grants yes very important but is it the most of government 's job to sponsor individuals on trips supplying of excessive refreshments at council events very nice but is it necessary in-depth projects undertaken by staff that then disregard the input that 's been asked for for us a moot point bus stops but also Victoria Square printing the quality quantity of printed items produced by the council must be phenomenal there has to be some belt-tightening there just like all other families and companies there may be small ways to save that can add up to a substantial amount taken them all perhaps more controversially would be the introduction of business rates secondary housing rented out other than to family or fauna it happens a lot in our area or eight sometimes a dozen houses rented within those houses they that 's a business like any other we should be treated like one communities there an idea was monumental in looking to local communities to work together to make a greater whole Christchurch why waves this opportunity what there 's a quote there from Jane barren people want local facilities yes central facilities are important for those that work in the city and those visiting but most people 's lives do not happen in the center of Christchurch they need facilities that build communities like the previous speaker said libraries swimming pools parks community and service centres with a local focus families cannot drive to the central city at four o 'clock swimming lessons and netball matches traffic 's bad then well it 's bad all the time isn 't it they need smaller local facilities now central riccarton doesn 't have a library we had to start our own I know we cannot put everything off but huge central library metro facility and the stadium are luxuries at the moment let 's make Christchurch place where small is beautiful let 's think outside the square best attendance records for the New Zealand super fo rugby franchises that a smaller cozy venue is enjoyed by everyone Stadium in other cities of huge spending nightmares so save it put it into economic development let 's support that paper mill that 's going to recycle the whole country 's paper manufacturing brings life to a region a convention center supposedly will not cost anything for us to build but the maintenance could us and now appears the cost is going to be prohibitive so let 's look outside the square at other ways of having meetings in Christchurch hotels the University to name a few visitors are important but we are not an entertainment center it 's nice to have these events but not with a large price tag attached residents need to know that they 're not going to be underwater when it rains before they in the Saltine to amuse extras we agree that it may be prudent to consider adjusting the holding of shares the council owns to christchurch city holdings it is not selling the silver to do this in most cases it will would be a benefit to sell off some shares inland port company let 's widen the expertise sorely needed and introduce better working practices and improve the facilities the council 's talking common sense in removing some of the assets such as rebates from its list of strategic assets they 're nice but not necessary other projects which group with groups such as the New Zealand Transport Authority to develop a rail network which is just crying out to be done between rang gora ashburton da field and Christchurch it should be looked at with urgency combined with sensible solutions to traffic problems such as parking line let 's save money on the proposed wicket and load upgrade which is looking at traffic in a small part not the whole planting trees and reducing part parking will not help us let 's start the cycle ways why not build them alongside the existing rail tracks sorry that 's not going to cost 150 six million dollars people want to be encouraged on to their bikes but they want to feel safe everybody has a wish list of what they want build ourselves up christchurch has to be a city with the people who live here first and foremost we want practical achievable solutions and we want to be involved thank you very powerful submission is anyone got any questions Jimmy to smoke with the first one our after the tour at the paper to sunnyvale window are the earthquake predict when the camera Center has been the shuttle even still shut down for more than four years in your der summation particular emphasizes still show for the kind of temporary the community facility etc so far as your point of view how to make it a haven for those the original community group in use and we are talking with people in the council with that so I don 't really want to say too much but and it 's been discussed at length again things take time on money which you know couldn 't spend we don 't need to but we just need to get on and build something that there is space we just meet need to make decisions let 's say think outside the square service by collisions probably new one you know triple the same set will be another three years there 's knows yet there 's no space in central vikatan that 's the problem we can 't find another spot to build something on we 've only got what we 've got and you would like to talk to Wes feel more you know they they likely to hang and we need the council we need to keep talking to them they 're very powerful people but they they can make things happen if we if we talk to them and perhaps come to some agreement the council has learned there thank you either the second quiz you know I 'm afraid we 've run every time but look thank you very much as I say a very powerful submission number one will obviously be taking into account Mary Jennison _"

    "text": "hello thank you for the opportunity to speak you 'll no doubt be saying oh dear here 's another one of these new brighton residents well yes that is and Here I am mayor and councillors I 'd like to thank you for this opportunity to speak today on and give my personal thoughts on the council 's long-term plan firstly I would like to acknowledge the council 's unique and however invidious position that you found yourselves and post-earthquake with all the issues that this raises but in general terms i really do convene the council for the way that it responded initially to the quake and the subsequent progress in the rebuild of our city i 'm a third-generation you bright and resident i 'm sure you 've heard people say the sort of thing game and a small business owner in the area I 've raised my own children the area and now we have six grandchildren that live in the area so consequently there are represent five generations we live here and the eastern suburbs because we love love them and we 're committed to the a coastal city in fact forty percent of the world 's entire population live within 60 kilometres of the coast and considering the large subcontinent 's that we have in our on our planet of Europe Asia China the Americas this shows that as in terms of humanity we are inevitably linked to the ocean and the sea how many times have we heard visitors that come to our city and say why is it that the east side of town and New Brighton especially is so run down and it 's the cheap side of town most people regard and go ahead places around the world that seaside suburbs other ones that are valued and most desired now Bruce Ainsley in his book recalling his recollections on you brighten and some really beautiful way say he talks about walking over the pier and the cleanser from the Big Sky paints a great picture saves and his initial introduction that in his expert opinion the this is town the town he refers to as New Brighton as the best place in the world to live in and then he says most every other city in the world citizens of Christchurch do not seem to want to live beside the sea New Brighton I think this is a reflection of the uniqueness of New Brighton new brighton is not demographically is not a homogenous suburb like many other suburbs and the city are we are extremely diverse and eclectic group of people it includes lower socioeconomic groups business owners professional people 's artistic types all living side by side on this new unique suburb and in the past this is meant that we often do not speak as a United Group because we often have different values where other individual groups and in the suburbs and you bright and sorry not New Brighton in the city are often seen as speaking it as a united voice but however this is not a weakness or a failing that 's rather one of the strengths of our communities prior to the quakes and propriety of reasons I 'm sure which you 've had many of them here today you brighten a lot today so Jimmy submissions was rather neglected in this very sorry pictures here that would just take him over a few literally over just a day walking around you brighten and put not looking for things in particular which is taking photographs that 's Brighton as you see it that 's Brighton as it is today the council and asking for opportunities for people to speak to the long-term plan i think has woken a sleeping giant as it were and you are now getting submissions from a new brighton I don 't want to go over all the various practical one day to day things that people have talked about but I fully endorse the way that people express their opinions on the issues that affect us from south shore south brighton you brighten north why Mary 3 now that eastern suburbs were broken gosh time they were broken by the quakes and I 'd like the council can to consider looking at the allocation of its funding through using a triage type of model of funding now most of us are familiar with this concept which is commonly used in the medical field and disaster and excellent management it there are insufficient funds available quite simply you fix the things that need to be fixed and you prioritize them areas are bright and the still in bad need of repair is broken the damaged footpaths damaged roading elderly people I know for fact elderly people still fear to go out on the roads and the footpaths do you see mo people on mobility scooters in your Brighton no you can 't use them down there it 's just too dangerous and I think these are things that you bright that the council needs to consider so I 'm just out of time if I could just have a few more seconds on a wider scale I asked that the council make adequate provision for the future economic and social development and you brighten in terms of the master plan the purchase have been funds been set aside for the purchase of property the air which is great but I would like to c funding set aside for the total development of the area linking it in with a legacy project in fact why not to be bold and look parade from Hulk Street to be referred street and a total making it a total package that links the foreshore the enhancement of the business retail and entertainment area and also include the promenade I would suggest from you brighten to north beach making the whole thing a one big total plan finally your brighton is not dying people are not abandoning the area there is and the i don 't think there will be a managed retreat in fact i 've heard of a number of people who having left the area now wished to return we are rebuilding one of our own personal properties now New Brighton I 've had real estate agents I 've had local people who have moved out of the area since the quakes because of concerns about what was happening they now have come and say is this for sale we want to come back p I wanted to come back to New Brighton we are a coastal suburb and a coastal city in a world that was populated in a coastal manner do the right thing for New Brighton on the city let you bright and be the new vanguard for renewal for the east mm terms the whole city thank you exam thank you thanks imitations they do _"

    "text": "thank you I think sometimes we just leave leave the governance side out of butternut doesn 't have a report and link back here so I think that will help right the next one is Christopher Baker I 've been wondering who you are become a fan title future you hear ya a well compared yeah I 'll probably have a spike in public before so I don 't expect this speech be to polish six weeks ago I didn 't know very much about the counter at all and it will have written words can 't talk with the government I 've been a huge learning curve since then at the time of my submission my learning curve was not quite complete and I blamed the caps a few things like victoria square when effects era and the government was to blame for what should I apologize like many I did not understand the legally binding nature of the cost sharing agreement and I 've given the constraint that this some places on the council we cannot do anything about the stadium or collision see that within the premises can be decided here one thing is psycho ways which which are outside the cost sharing agreement at 162 million they seem extraordinarily expensive this is a big expense I think they will be main used for recreation and will have little effect on reducing traffic condition as such they are a nice to have but they 're not essential the council desperately needs us hundred thirty two million elsewhere even if only to offset asset sales therefore I think there should be deferred for least ten years the main thing really decided for this ten-year plan is to solve whether to adopt their council version or the People 's Choice contents plain to me this is no brainer the plane the the council plan one the council planners are truly financial true years of financial on you with enormous rate buzzers you include buying and selling out the assets if this goes through unchanged Christchurch is probably going to be financially stuff for decades if you really look at what 's going what 's going on those accounts on the very first day of submissions Peter suckling of the those members would adopt such a plan on the other hand the common sense plan saves order fear is nearly a billion dollars of spinning and that 's what I was breathing room it also bought sony assets it may be that aspects of this common-sense plan can send concern the eight of you who voted for the council plan but these are these are mostly down the track things are so fluid uncertain the moment that both plans like to be obsolete within two or three years or as formerly a great performer mayor gary moore said yesterday this long-term plan is just the base case it will need significant reviewing after first utilize the counter plan commits you to selling assets in the 2015-16 year whereas the common-sense plan does not so what up vote the common-sense plan is as a device to get you past the legal requirement to have a ten-year plan then you can review your options and two or three years time without having committed yourself to sue selling the assets you don 't want Julia Burlington windy okay could I refuse here the not aware of at top of my submission I 've had these figures confirmed by an accountant and I 've all something in the regionally senior minute of the council staff kissed after noon we are told that the family shortfall is 1.2 billion but in fact it does nothing like that it is in fact about 3.8 billion it would appear that the supposed funding shortfall of 1.2 billion is in fact just an additional amount identify the last year or two which is on top of an already large football so the real financial port is in fact that an enormous 3.8 billion this is a truth shop and figure this tells you the magnitude of financial crisis of the council finished potentially and this is a nightmare and it must be addressed yeah we now go to the back page of what I pinned it up you will see what really needs to it needs to happen the council is to have a viable answer to have viable finances in particular we simply cannot afford the big expensive projects so how do we get from page one to play ball and counselors should do everything humanly possible to bring us about the government must be made to sit to see sense about these big think big projects the cost sharing agreement must be entirely torn up I suggested wazers might be legally possible in my submission then in pretty well follow what I said in my solution I would also questioned the 60 40 split of costs forty percent is a high percentage to fund for a city that has suffered the biggest natural disaster Museum in history I will take a much fairer that would be 75 25 this would realize River 700 million from the cost sharing agreement to the council again this could be done by a GST transfer ok so what the council needs to do is the following one consult with Peter discipline of a new zealand manufacturers of the exporters association he will tell you what an awful plan the council when it 's none of us members would that would adopt it to once enlighten the council should then vote for the common-sense plan three this further cycle waves for other things for once the planet once the plants over tackle the government follow on to try and give them to see common sense and go with people what the P of across you actually got thank you thank you um that 's the the full amount of time that 's been allocated for you so there isn 't time for questions but thank you very much and you know I 've really appreciated the fact that you 've been here all the way through the hearings and you 've been I 've seen you nodding and shaking her head and it 's been great to feel that you haven 't been engaged for the first time ever so I don 't think you any worries about big nervous about making your presentation it was very well done so thank you very much survival interested in submission to the rest today so I will be around hanging around so if anybody does not to ask me Christian physically ok Tito more Hunterdon you 're welcome your debts fabulous thank you very much Kevin paja _"

    "text": "squawk entry Julian Falloon in sport New Zealand I think as well is that right you just submerging together and one of these probably down that during charity yeah dude in flu going everyone thank you what what way the way we 'll approach this we 've got 15 minutes is I 'll give a quick overview of our submission and then Dara 's going to take a couple of threads in a bit more more detail first of all really important for me as a sport Canterbury to acknowledge the council 's ongoing commitment to sport and Rec in the city both in terms of resourcing grassroots delivery and through strengthening communities as well as resource in the community recreation advisors on the ground absolutely and vitally important the second point is to endorse over the last four years our commitment to be aligning all our work around the sport recreation recovery program and is that some of the decisions that you guys are all making in terms of the rebuild is strong alignment and I 'll spend on it in a minute in terms of the recovery program participation and sport back to pre with quite levels and we 've achieved that and celebrate that but we 're not holding that is an ultimate success we want to move through that and push on I think from a spaces and places perspective the challenges around and the long-term need to bring forward the rebuild and obviously the Metro is something I 'll talk about in a minute but from a sport canaries perspective it 's about participation and first and foremost and community participation but we also call this an effect there 's got to be a pathway into the high performance and performance environment I think the other thing that I will lead to briefly as well as that the importance of sport and recreation events to both the recovery program but also the economic benefit of bringing events back to the city and I 'll talk briefly about that as well from a facilities perspective there 's a couple of comments that I 've made in my submission from a great decision around feast and recreation and sports facility more from the perspective of having colocation girls something that we 've been endorsing throughout the last four years around colocation partnership opportunities are beyond sport and recreation I think that 's it 's a fantastic opportunity for the city I think the other thing that I 've publicly celebrated as is your decision to commit to that pin away two years ago we we scratched away at this and this forum around the opportunity of a hub out in the southwest for Sport and Recreation rebuild you 've committed to that and I want to celebrate the knowledge your support to make that that project heaven and also through the LTP your ongoing commitment to allow our community to access your sport facilities at a at a reasonable cost so big thumbs up from that perspective in terms of the metro again with the philosophies of colocation partnership and having the endorsement of the metro the real challenge for for us as an organization that 's advocating for sport as I said before is 2020 before we actually get the doors open that is becoming a huge issue and I think that the focus on darren we going to do to support sports for that five-year transition between the Metro opening in 2020 and here and our challenges so I think I know you 've had netball but in the media and in front of you we 've got to start working as a group and I say a group as a sector to help sport transition through the next five years swimming is another example so they 're going to have to wait five more years for an indoor aquatic facility of a 50 metre pool what are we doing to help in transition excuse me I just have to say we haven 't decided that it 's delayed for five years I mean we got a notice just before it went in the media so you know i mean i think that the conversation you 're talking about having is one that has to engage central government because the decision was made absent you know that a collaborative decision with our staff that have been working with so they were notified our staff were notified that there was a potential delay they were never you know I 'm kind of putting it on the table and I 'm little but you know you might sense a degree of irritation and my voice but that 's simply because we haven 't really been you know we agree with you so there 's there 's there 's no point saying we want to transition through the next five years let 's see how we can get the opening of that SportsCenter brought forward to its rightful place and if that means we have to stage its development over a period of time instead of wanting bells and whistles and everything all at once then let 's do that so we can get it up and running toilet tone music why it isn 't I didn 't mean to cut into your time to give a speech but I 'm just you know so whatever the time frames are we 've got to have a conversation yeah transition that 's the point I 'm trying to make whether s 3 years 5 10 years I think there 's got to be an appetite for the clip of I some temporary solutions and some of the solutions we think quite easy and simple some of them but more complex well as support I 'm trying to we would like to respond to that I think that would be very simple to set up a small working party of our staff a couple of counselors and you know yourselves and but you know potentially I mean it 's difficult to know how to engage with ccd you on this but but if they wanted to be engaged in that to work through that together so I 'd be really happy to promote that yeah thank you very much yes I will talk about the agency of the metro enough i think the other the other comment moving forward to that the utilization of the red zone so I 'm I 've been quite proactive in terms of putting the sport and recreation lens and the opportunity of the future use of the red zone from a sporting right perspective monthly it 's been fundamentally about the potential of flat water lake but I see there 's other elements to use of of their area as well as an importance of sport and recreation that 's on the land in terms of connection to the city from the active transport perspective events cycling running walking so where we meet myself in sport New Zealand a proactive around putting sport and recreation voice over that wind decisions have been made i also want to endorse that the cycleway aspect to the LTP in terms of active transport cycling obviously hugely positive in terms of physical activity outcomes I guess the key message there is making sure that those cycleways are connected to other sport and recreation facilities and developments everything from the metro through to the cottage adventure park development on the port hills those connections between facility infrastructure and software ways is vitally important and also endorse the fact that we 've got an aging population as well as the younger population that will be using those are being open and innovative around how we provide connections through cycleways for skating in line scootering and those sort of things not just limited to a traditional psyching cycling method of transportation a huge benefit in boost to the city around cricket world cup after missing that the Raby world cup the comment i want to make there is that through the restructuring of counsel in the removal of the sport and recreation events resource into a wider events portfolio given collier 's role as making sure that the importance of sport and recreation events for our city is not diminished and a wider events conversation we 've got fifa coming up we 've got golden oldies which you 're fully committed to just bear in mind that sporting events have a huge positive impact in terms of our picture and our world from the sport and Rec perspective in terms of community sport and recreation on the ground obviously the council and again commend them for the youth for the ongoing commitment to open spaces it 's all very well to get hooked up into the major infrastructure developments fields and we just talked about with a limb with guys just before is that open spaces are just as important for sport and recreation I think the other fact that strengthening sport and a community level you invest heavily last four years we know that clubs struggling so that that investment is actually gold for the long-term viability of clubs and as I said before your community support your community recreation advisors working in partnership and the community level with my staff who are on the ground facilitating and connecting we talked about this before you head around the school connection to community sport there is an actually vital link to be not reliant just on young people getting experience of sport and a school setting but into the wider community so your people on the ground alongside my staff are absolutely vital and the fragment of a community development model that uses sport and recreation I 'll hand it over Darren now in terms of just taking some of those threads a bit further thanks Julian as government agency yes sport news elements charged with inspiring our kids to the lifelong love of sport protecting our pride and our sporting legacy and ensuring our elite talent as the best possible chance of success on a world stage sport is at trend sports transcends gender race and age teachers teamwork and bids lifelong values and creates regional pride broke realism and nationalism sport defines our culture who we are as kiwis cannery has a long and distinguished successful sporting heritage worn out of an environment of community and accessible open spaces and places for generations at grandparents and parents in ourselves have been ability to participate in achieving our sports we have had access to and ability to use facilities and communities and have invested in these facilities over these generations these facilities and spaces and places have enabled our sporting success and the success is our region has thrived off and enjoyed and enjoyed for many years however this has all changed our world has changed we can no longer rest on the laurels that we will always be successful the signs are clear our sport system is straining under the stress straining not only from the physical built form facility perspective but from the very fabric and foundations that run our sports in this region the sports system and the codes themselves across our region are fighting for survival rec participation due to a generational gap been created out of circumstance once created we know the generational gap is very hard to bridge as a proud supporting province we are facing unprecedented challenges we do not see these challenges if we do not face each other is now an act our children and their children may grow up without the red and black pride that we grew up with as kids as a regional barometer for our organization of it I 've identified two pending challenges to the sector that we look forward to working with council to proactively resolve and through our partners here on the ground the school canterbury Julian 's touched on the need for and for a longer transitional process transitional plan and I really like what Leah and said around bringing forward a staged approach to the Metro in particular to enable that facility be open as quickly as possible we also see a major challenge around Workforce Planning you know with all the investment by Brown and Council and the private sector we know we have a firm understanding of the future workforce operational our region and sector challenges the service quiet he means we know in the next two to five years may need three to five hundred new staff to come into that sector and work isn 't a there 's a need to create and develop programs with our tertiary partners that will have a workforce that is ready to meet this demand no easy task but i think the lessons learned from the from the current constructor construction sector constraints lessons we should take forward even we know we have effects timelines for delivery out of all of this comes regional opportunities I 've seen an increased cross agency collaboration certainly here on the ground with the likes of m.o.e and the rebuild program and also across council NZTA and private sector the Metro sport offers a fantastic opportunity be recognized as the home of sport for the region and also the establishment of the regional sports house now my fantastic outcome we congratulate council on making that happen Eastern sports and rec and the collaboration with m.o.e again a fantastic outcome and one that I 'm personally invested christchurch adventure park and outstanding economic boost up you know for the region and will offer a world-class facility and port christchurch and the global as a global destination for the sport residential redzone an incredible opportunity that offers a wide and diverse range of outcomes that we should make the most of the creation of the regional sports and rec leadership group has enabled some of those facility decisions to be made over the last three to four years and we see this is a the growing membership that will help lead and influence the outcomes for sport and Rec in the sector we foresee the creation of regional sport and lick recreational plans and facilities plans over that over the coming years as critical enabler that will provide guidance direction and leadership to councils and visitors and thunders without regional partnership with counsel and tour Canterbury we will continue to lead an enabled sport in Canterbury we acknowledge council are and always have been the principal provider for facility and spaces and places we acknowledge the extent of funding and resources currently allocated in the draft long term and Recreation spaces and places as more than just a provision fun and play sport in places and spaces are at the heart of who we are as can tips our families our communities our workplaces are much healthier and richer because of these we offer our ongoing support to counsel and welcome any opportunity to work with council officers to develop innovative cost efficient solutions to overcome the challenges that the sport and Rec sector faces over the coming years thank you look we 've come to time but I 'm because of my outburst I thought it was appropriate that I latum a question thank you guys we just heard from around eight schools and as an area christchurch riches are need saying that we 've got good support and skulls but then for whatever reason it falls off for a week in sport so you know my concern is a relevant of the facilities we have the real need is to get that length with those families and the further the needs support whether it 's boots or just support through clubs and what are your thoughts the facilities the families aren 't going to carriage the kids are unable to get them there for sport and I 'm just interested in it because ask our staff we 've moved them into a the community development group but it seems to me a likely a logical place because that 's we 're that helps need it but I 've been tricking your thoughts we know that various participation to key ones cost of access to sport and transportation so the linworth we 're investing cubist will resource funding into that lynnwood community and in the previous gentleman alluded to it and and a lot of our focus historically has been around the school environment so it 's a captured environment 93 we can influence the heart and nut to crack as that transition to community sport so sport means either in terms of their community sports strategy is looking at the whole sports system around the community and my staff strategically are moving away from that school environment not losing sight of it but actually looking at me development model to their work so the seamless transition development model effectively and we 're not going to be able to provide my organization is not going to reduce the cost barrier but actually having sport that 's a seamless transition or opportunities straight out into the community as something to focus now we 're moving forward thank you very much and thank you for all of the work that you do on behalf of sports and Canterbury and New Zealand and you know I 've really looked forward to the strengthening of the partnership between is just pushing around your previous offer how do I progress it well I think that will have a up up to Jane yeah chief operating officer will make a note of it so Jane to you through John Paul cell yeah thank you also a good thank you yeah but well we 're going to get a couple of councillors involved in that and I think probably Yanni and terminal be there the two so yeah thank you _"

    "text": "warning council my name is Lee Walker and I 'm a sister boat Giroud green and jury will speak first we speaking on behalf of well obviously speaking to a submission and try not to repeat what 's written down speaking on behalf of eight schools about two and a half thousand children in that Linwood Boston area who had direct be enrolled in those schools obvious it 's a lot of other children involved in early childhood centers and at home so a significant number of kids in our city citizens of our city the first thing that I wanted to acknowledge is the council 's commitment to maintaining the funding into community groups and we 're pleased about that we applaud that we would love you to consider increasing your resourcing of community groups who work with families and children in our part of town in particular we 'd also like you to have the presence of children and you 're thinking and in your decision making I 'll look at the piles of paper on your desk so I know you 've had days of hearings and your heads will be cluttered because you 're just like the rest of us with two arms and two legs but kids need to be in your thinking please as much as you can put them and in some discrete clear areas where you believe a difference can be made and you know we work and we engage with them we experience kids every day and one of the things that we would look for for your role is the way that you can support those who work with kids outside of school we 're not asking you to come and both to the curriculum or help us employ more teachers it 's about the way that you can support those agencies and groups who help children and families particularly those who are less advantaged in our communities children have been I 'm studying the bleeding obvious but children have been adversely affected negatively affected by what 's occurred in Christchurch with the period of earthquakes and how we as a community are responding to that how some of the adults and their life let them a whole lot of know that the research from the University of Canterbury can registered health board stats UNESCO research other people 's research tells us the impacts on children and the application for that for us as a city in a community and our future as those children run the risk of not performing as well in their lives as we want them to and there has impacts for them but also for us as a community and as a city and one step that often stands out is that forty percent increase in the number of mental health referrals and the queues for kids getting into at a house which is you know ten to twelve weeks for some of our kids who are we 're screaming out for support for and the systems aren 't coping Child Youth and Family and others are coping so yeah the need is undeniable and we 're not asking you to address that but we 're looking at okay what are some achievable steps and grassroots feet on the ground stuff having to encourage kids to be actively involved in sport culture cultural activities music their families aren 't able to do or aren 't doing and we have some great partnerships already in our communities in the limit of Austin area this group such as Tamar poor trust the woolston development project Salvation Army youth town sports clubs they do good stuff that 's not rocket science it 's encouraging kids involvement helping with transport uniforms being there at game time coaching mentoring role models you can 't_''_226.29 beat the stuff it 's it 's it 's so important in children 's life to have those positive adults and they don 't get it in other ways and you guys can help their access to that through that ongoing funding of some of the community groups or others that you might know of that I don 't know if that you you can support the last couple of things that I 'd want to say is that some of the cost of the involvement of those groups and their support both in school and out of school has been headed by the Red Cross funds that have gone into our schools and we use to three years and it 's coming to an end this year we 've employed counselors through Presbyterian support we 've got timarpur trusts and youth town working in our school salvation army does that without at that funding and they do some work in our schools and outside of the school and the Red Cross funds have been I think both central government and eps for you guys as well taken away some of the burden of cost that we might otherwise have looked for so i think i 'm knowing that that source of funding is coming to an end this year is important so my last point is it 's achievable stuff it 's doable keep supporting those groups it makes a difference not all the kids are the same model the families of the same in terms of me but there 's a big chunk of need there in leakin maybe comment look my man soda let the context for you so you know you 're we were talking about that 's with Lilith North school he moves down to Bromley school linwood avenue school the of these figures then it moves down into woolston school bamford school so it 's quite an art that comes through and whether the data can bet is very interesting because we 're all in a position that we don 't know what we don 't know so the schools were doing their thing and the council is doing their thing and so the council has got very very good or systems to set up for community groups applying to do to do sport and after-school activities for a weird reason we decided to survey the children to find out what the tool car actually doing and we were just blown out of the water that we assumed in New Zealand a green field which everybody 's out to do export on a Saturday morning it isn 't happening whether the east side is unique I honestly don 't know it might be other places that if surveyed I don 't know you can see those figures there I can tell you from the survey that came back and we 're talking all the children in the lynnwood area from play league out of about 200 that we 739 play soccer 30 play rugby we 've had serious conversations with the likes of lynnfield support what can be done we don 't have an answer to that we haven 't come today to say there is an answer now on the table what we 're coming is saying too that the council needs to keep funding funding because and then we have heard you know through context of the counselors that the counselors looking at these things and what it can be done so the schools are sort of saying look please remember us will be part of this conversation but if you don 't put the money there first you 're really going to miss out on an opportunity and it 's now all of these things go that a thing slowly gets that a cut-off will take five percent of this year five percent off next year it comes off and then people are starting have to prune oxxo the organization 's having to go back and prune off people that go away so we 're sort of your community funds that are going through then I can tell you more figures about X what after school activities are happening you know that they are fully subscribed by the children that can go there girls girls I think there 's about twenty percent of girls on a Saturday morning are involved in sport across the luminaria nearly all of those girls planned in plain nipple attached through a couple of clubs that are over there we we suspect that the more than want to do it and there are some very serious issues around cost okay some very serious issues about costs for them we 've got it and I had to say I mention one organization lindfield sport but very strong association with Linfield sport quite skillful use of money I 'm supported by Sports Canterbury that 's put together that funds the sport and the schools so in the school on a daily basis eighty or ninety percent of the children are doing sport in the school doesn 't go across to the weekend a number of organizations run after school programs for these children again the last point that I would make was we discovered purely by accident that we were taking dart and out of the census the mish blocks of the census with guiding us but most of those schools have had funding drops are we impact and research back to that and when we found out that what 's actually coming out in terms of the number of families with benefits single mothers with benefits in the schools is much higher than you see from the census so these are the woman that are living on about three hundred dollars a week trying to put a child school I 'm not going to quite a rugby boots and jackets and all that sort of stuff and in one school nameless reported thirty-eight percent of the people coming into that school where solar mother 's on a benefit census data would tell you it 's sittin right percent we 'll just see here today to sort of say thank you for the money that you 're putting it already please keep on doing it and if you can 't find it in your that shouldn 't happen of the schools to come and have a chat thank you for your time okay I 'm Tim oh thank you for this I was to see my old school to Maliki in there and um we were a single parent family so that and when I was at timidly he which was far too many years ago to worry about there was actually no Mitch should have support at all and there 's no program at all in it but can we really came to my children 's primary school and they ran an absolutely outstanding program I thought I went down there because it was both boys and girls and I was a bit worried about my daughter kind of tickling and they 've been an extremely good that tackle program the whole thing and then rent a primary school round robin type thing I 'm just want to let still kept me there so that 's it when it front painted these two pictures what 's actually happened in schools with the support of all of those clubs in that it 's great transfer that to the weekend and it just evaporates so that 's really my questions what what what is the the club 's coming into the primary schools do they come under you hear the primary schools have an on-site connection and you can clearly have something to have basketball with rugby regularly and sometimes you 'll get one off things from nipple or soccer will come in to add a sort of profile oh the sport and do some games with kids rugby and rugby league are probably the ones that hang in there a bit longer and they do try and faster and they 've support the foster involvement make connections with kids and families foster things like I think Linwood rugby the ship done some work around subsidizing uniforms and boots but the adults who need to make the decision to support that through the family aren 't doing it think you add that 's where the age of the community groups help out I 'm afraid that it 's come to the end of our time but the next submission is sport Canterbury you might like principal youth court judge saying you know kids and sport stays out of court so I think there 's a lot of sympathy for what you 've see it but you might like to have a conversation or sport can to break you before before you both them both leave so thank you very much

    "text": "grant McCullum DGM group good morning my submission concerns development contributions policy and activation of central city living and Christchurch firstly written submission I 'll Paterno was done reasonably quickly and looking back it 's a little bit rough and strident so please take meters of it you can soften it a little bit we 've being active apartment developers since the mid-90s and we 're steaming back into it again post-earthquake we 've got a couple underway with more coming up through now and teaching of our own it 's transpired that we 've ended up one of the most experienced apartment developers and Christchurch there was no aim to be that was just how it 's panned out but we have a good view on what works and doesn 't work I can start by the the council and crown currently have a name for 25,000 people within the central city by 2025 which is 10 years away previous to me is also had a name of 20 to 30,000 people living in the central city per year one of the things I always struggled with with it things I always struggled with that is that there was no action taken to follow that up it was all effectively hot a year it was great to be it I love the idea but there was nothing done to activate it now post-earthquake something is being has been done to activate it and has it has already helped and that 's the rebate policy just before I get into that if I can give you some numbers on hit on the state of the state of residential growth and the central city we estimate there is about 30 million dollars a year at the moment spent on new residents and the central city this is talking right in the core at an average of half a million each that 's about 60 apartments for townhouses units year at one and a half to two people that 's about a hundred people per year or two a week coming in so that 's a state of play at the moment to get the 25,000 it 's currently about 5,000 we need 20,000 more which is 2,000 per year or 40 quite a significant factor Twinkie fold it 's very significant there are a number of tools that can be done to it used to activate this for example amenity especially as crucial council does really good parts and things like that that 's that it 's one tall but the main toilet talked about of course is the rebate policy at the moment with the the rebate policy it works really well and if I can explain it by way of example we have a project at the moment the corner of kilmore street and cram the square that with that we 're currently selling building consent applications during yesterday it 's been yesterday for a few days the most of the apartments are a price for the 450 to 500 thousand each and we 're getting we 're getting good sales we 've got about half of them sold with the web sites that 's just yeah it 's the oldest young building as you go down kilmore street just before you hit chromeless square this two little old start cottages on the corner we 're not those but oh yeah yeah yeahs right here so we encompass a commercial zone and there is eventual zone and we 've got a three-stage apartment complex to go in with the first stage just about to start okay so earlier if we have an apartment we 've sold some at four hundred and ninety thousand dollars if development contributions were payable on that that puts them up to five hundred and twenty thousand dollars that happens because development contributions are a cost if they come up in it between 20 and 25 thousand dollars per unit by the time the other costs are added on and it goes out the door it goes out of 30 thousand dollars and that 's just a reality that 's inescapable selling them at 490 we 're doing well oh I suspect if we had to raising prices by six percent to 520 we wouldn 't have as many sales right now so it 's working well the problem with the recurrent rebate policy are the limits on it that the monetary limit and the time limit if we want to get to 25,000 people is get rid of those limits the time limit and the monetary limit until we reach 25,000 people or even if we reached 12 and a half thousand people or 10,000 10,000 would be enough of a momentum to start feeding on itself and growing itself it 's defectively the bulk of my submission one other point is in doing but a research on other areas around the world that worked in central cities one example Melbourne that sparked because of as my understanding is is because the people came first and residential and then all the other bits and pieces the cafes and the services and everything followed what I noticed and this is slightly off my submission is that council has focused on retail and business for various reasons and I strongly suggest if you want to drive this try and switch you focus more to the residential side rather than the retail and the business side there 's a few of us out the active and we keen to be involved and make the whole thing work but really we 've got to increase of 20 fold think we could double the current market pretty easily but to get up to 25 other thing is a big big ask that 's effectively my submission anyone else I wouldn 't mind taking a couple questions so brief in the ER knee thanks grant um it 's great submission and actually we 've been talking about incentives for the central city and once I 've made actually is just taking DC 's off completely which is what you 're suggesting it 's brilliant idea are there any other incentives in terms of the Great Sea well rates definitely are a big one and i just did about we did the gallery apartments building which was nixed the art gallery just before the earthquakes it 's gone there unfortunately we 're not bought that cited had an old building on it that we paid rates on it i think there 's about three and a half four thousand per say for argument 's sake 5,000 per annum when we finish we had 18 apartments paying five thousand dollars each so 90,000 per annum compared to 5,000 per annum that 's rebate can the development contributions are still a substantial increase in income that would come another tool would of course be shaving that ninety thousand dollar overall rates ball back to the original five no and that would significantly help because one of the complaints we get on some apartments and town people of paying would like the previous another very substantial rates and there does affect it 's definitely effective for people as the annual running costs when they add it up against the body corporate expenses becomes very high say that number again so 5,000 for the original property is in how much for how many apartments there were 18 apartments and each of them were paying rates of roughly about the same so about five thousand each but but the total was coming out of the building built 90 great gene x 5000 yeah 18 department I can do small rubbish yes it 's great yani doesn 't that um question about the scale of dc 's that we charge in the central city and how much we charge for the greenfield development do you think we 's no infrastructure to counterbalance charging this in the central city so that we can encourage that at center pondrom trying to understand how we are young straight the demand in the central city and possibly not provide too much incentive for people to keep building on green fields which seemed to be very expensive yeah hell it 's easy to paint something like this as a subsidy from one part the community to the others so how you actually structured I 'm not quite sure that 's something for the politicians i guess but effectively it does have a significant impact so if it means increase costs out from the green fields and lower costs and town that would work how you sell it to the public i 'm not quite i 'm not quite sure but if you want 25,000 people then this is a very significant taller but i can assure you that of help prices with 520 instead of 490 we wouldn 't have as many sales right now does that answer your question what usual and that 's another yet there 's yes I see with the development for me that asked and answered so look thank you very much really helpful summation thank you um then would Boston schools they walk _"

    "text": "Kurt pain is it looks case will be handed out pinky good morning madam chair and councillors the submission that I put in was very brief course it was done at the last minute I was having a few issues with your webpage so my apologies that it is so brief which is why and also because my voice is not particularly good I 've given you a copy of what I 'm going to talk about today I 'm here as a rural ratepayer to oppose the removal of the rural rating differential in the long-term plan I understand that the rural differential was established to assist those undertaking rural activities on their land but I fail to understand how an arbitrary figure of five hectares can be justified as a benchmark we 've lived in jasons road here would on our two point seven hectares for nearly 30 years we breed and milk pedigree silent and toggle Burt goats which I presume is classed as a rural farming activity living where we do on the boundary of the airport zone and within the 65 decibel nose contour there part we 're not permitted to put a granny flat up for my elderly mother when all we allowed to extend our house all of which subject to boarding restrictions we would be allowed to do on a residential site we also have no ability to oppose or complain about any other rural activity such as the dog boarding kennels that were established next to us as a non notified resource consent as we were told that as rural dwellers this was something we would have to put up with I presume that if we are going to be treated as residential and charge rates as such we will then have those rights as you 've no doubt been told by others the costs involved in living on a rural property with no access to water or sewage imposes much higher costs for example our power bill for pumping water from over 35 meters below ground costs over six hundred dollars a year let alone the costs of in replacing the pump from well and if we have no power we have no water so we also have to make have to pay for our own power poles we also have the cost of septic tank maintenance in emptying which is also far greater than the two hundred dollars a year paid by town residents for their sewage connection I also know on our rate demand that we pay extra fees to the Regional Council for animal and plant control and both I 'm TV works and these services are not paid for by residential ratepayers the removal of this differential resultant of forty percent increase in our rates and I considered this to be unjust especially considering the fact that we 're unable to do anything else with our land because of the restrictions imposed by the airport zoning if the zoning was changed then perhaps the changes could be justified I would suggest that the council look at reducing the amount of land required for the differential to two hectares with some clarification as to the amount of land around the residential unit we have less than many town properties around our house with the rest being used for grazing so it 's looking at the rates being perhaps it would be beneficial for the council to look at the resource consents granted for commercial activities in the area and to check where these activities are still being granted the raw a rating differential instead of the business differential I 'm sure this may help council funds I firmly believe that there should have been consultation with people affected as was suggested in the briefing paper to the mayor and cannot understand why this didn 't take place for those of us who are trying to maintain our land for farming activities and especially in areas where no other land use is permitted I consider this to be very short-sighted and unfair and on a personal note my husband is now 67 is retiring this year and we 've strived for the last 30 years to get our property so that we could retire and enjoy it and raise our animals on it we 've budgeted for an increase of perhaps eight to ten our rates each year but there 's no way that will be able to fund a forty percent increase this year and then I know what we 'll be able to do is selling out property is probably not something that will be very easy to do because being in the 65 decibels own we 're very restricted as what can be done and you know selling it may not be a possibility so thank you that really upsets me yeah no thank you to that we have received a number of submissions you may have seen the commentary and the paper this morning so we 're very alert to both the process and the proposal that 's on the table and will be certainly taking all those concerns that have been raised into account when we make our decision so it does anyone have a question that they want to ask Danny thank you you raised to to to kind of main issues um one was probably more relevant to our district plans I just wanted to check are you making submissions to a district plan about the notification requirements are you aware that that 's been considered family education fire just to run the dog boarding kennels the non notified resource can well ya need I 'd rather not have a discussion around the district plan review while we 're dealing with the long-term plan so I don 't know but I think it 'll really liked it votes of the Sigma we completed staff to follow up what yo man we go I 'm oh so fun times with Margaret if they were really good i would receive all that great thank you yeah thank you thanks very much _"

sorry but you are being live-streamed so just be aware that there it is going out and actually there is an audience so just be aware of it so the first person that we have is Marcus for me welcome Michael you just come here and you 've got five minutes and you can use it however you like but if you want us to ask you questions that needs to be with a net five minute period ok welcome thank you where did he meet you look he 's good Vicki I know you get the real thing there is sorry I apologize sorry I just hit a prime meeting a nut rent you are good you 're obviously taller than I am you keep putting the chair down sorry we 're off to a bad start here thank you very much for being here welcome thank you merely I readily is that there is no commitment to rework it once the figures the real figures are knowing what we will have is a plan that will see the present generation of ratepayers committed to even more exorbitant rate increases because the silver will have been sold and further borrowings will not be entertained not one of you would commence a repair rebuild of your own home without first knowing the true cost of the job the actual amount being received by from the insurance payout and where the balance of the funds are coming from you should not presume to do anything less for the ratepayers of Christchurch whom you represent I used one example in my submission the funding of the ami stadium repair rebuild the figures used in the plan show a total council cost of 253 million funded by insurance payout of 143 million and borrowings of 110 million however a short time after these figures were published there appeared an article on the front page of the Press said yet where where the insurance company suggested the payout may be as low as 50 million yes models be suggested or settled upon when the base data is so incomplete you are proposing a rate increase of more than eight point five percent which is totally unacceptable given the rate of inflation if the insurance payout for the stadium is only 50 million then the initial rate rises will be the thin end of the wedge you have stated in the plan that further borrowings will not be entertained the assets will have been sold by then and so this means the shortfall will require further rate increases it is not fear that the present generation of ratepayers be the full brunt of the repair rebuild the proposed sale of assets designed to produce a certain realizable figure is putting the cart before the horse the earthquakes were a national disaster requiring a national response it is not good enough for central government to set arbitrary time frames or monetary limits on its involvement in the repair rebuild the plan states that the repair rebuild needs a new approach and pull Christchurch to think creatively but there are no such matters contained in the plan one way assistance a priority if the true costs and true levels of recoveries with a baseline of the plan then this would be an achievable objective the true figures must be arrived at as quickly as possible and then the sale of city assets should should form part of the discussion for greater central government assistance once the assets are sold then this door is closed to any further discussion the sale of assets is a step that must be taken only as a last resort the plan is not the last resort it is only a very loosely put together beginning if the costs and the recoveries are set out on the plan are relied upon then these will come back to haunt the council into the future like your own home repair rebuild you must know the full picture before implementing the program for I go to the last page with the last couple of puts I wonder merely if I could just clarify on page 47 of the consultation document it 's the anchor projects and I was just trying to understand the central library for example what million what is the total cost to rebuild the library so the total cost of the lobby is 85 million the government are not putting any money into this you know what they 're providing the land but I mean the trivalent it excludes the land but of course they took our land where the central library use anyway anyway yeah you owned it yeah and and and watch the improvement allowance we don 't now but we don 't know no but as I told out of the room that we didn 't were we fundraise but we did we weren 't compensated for that though were we yeah and and and the insurance payout of 8.2 is that set in stone is that an amount that you 're actually guaranteed to get no well 8.2 what that 's what it says the insurance it says 8.2 million is coming from insurance your funding your 75 million by 8.2 insurance 27 land and 15 improvement allowance know that insurance Ashin insurance hasn 't been settled in the library is one of the disputed claims it is as as Jade phenomenally low figure meal en isn 't it what for but for insurance payout on a library that I mean the print the previous library would have would have been in the vicinity of what 30 million 40 million to build not then it 's been around for a long time it didn 't cost that much to build you see I mean the convention center cost 20 million dollars in the in the day look how much we 're spending today it was that not replacement insurance Lee on the library but look there I really don 't want you to know I focus your time I mean there is clearly it hasn 't been helped our our situation has not been helped by two factors one is the discovery that the previous chief executive signed a clarification on the cost sharing agreement saying that our counsel would meet our obligations on the anchor projects regardless of the insurance recoveries on the individual projects regardless amelie your point about actually doing that that is actually the that you should know the actual amount received from your insurance before you and my encouragement unfortunately we inherited an agreement that had already been signed which said that we would meet our responsibilities under the cost year for the anchor projects regardless of the insurance recoveries for each and every one of those items and merely an I 'm suggesting that you and this council have the ability to be able to go back and renegotiate that because of what we 're seeing already from central government regarding the delays regarding the amount of contributions that my encouragement is that you do just that we have we have certainly indicated to central government that there is much that we wish to talk about it 's not a local problem it 's an it was a national disaster requiring a national response yes but it wasn 't it was it it was a national disaster but it occurred locally and we have to make a contribution the question is how do we fund our contribution and waters a fair share for Christchurch I 've recently I 'll go to the second page yep the council could think creatively by erecting the central library of at least 12 hours per day and providing for a free library brushed brass to bring people to the facility this would result of the facility being fully utilised I suggest although at prison are underutilized I don 't think that 's I don 't think that 's correct I mean the the measure of success in terms of council facilities would be our libraries there for all the time people people complain every time we look at the hours but but but I mean I think the answer there is is that if they were open longer the ones that you 've got then you may be able to replace or at least hold the costs on having to build further ones immediately while you do something like that by opening up for a longer hours I 'm just saying think creatively oh yeah at a hundred million driving and I 'm meeting rooms in the library could be allocated by dividing the city into community areas and providing specified days for each area to utilize the community room for community meetings the Community Law Center could be of central city yeah we 've also had submissions from the Citizens Advice Bureau who want to co-locate the plan Convention Center will front on to Cathedral Square but there is no discussion taking place as to the revamp of Cathedral Square I say leave victoria square alone and direct these efforts and funds in the cathedral square the new plan colleges the planned new colleges at qe2 should include the swimming complex within them and then an agreement reached us to school and community use the city simply cannot afford every facility its citizens would like in the next decade it must be some creative solutions but the plan as presented off is none my hope is that an amended plan will be produced providing realistic costs and recoveries based on actual data and not best guess calculations which will of themselves drive the need to be creative and to insist on further central government assistance thank you very much and seasonally at some as it was stated in the consultation document it 's a base case I 'm sure after hearing all of the submissions you know councillors been expressed and will be certainly that the long-term plan will be changed as a result really in it it 's been lovely for me to have the time to be able to come here and share these thoughts with you over the last few years I 've had thoughts but I only been a time to share them there it 's been it 'll like to be here thanks for listening thank you for coming thank you I 'm Kate boo _"

    "text": "nearly an hour Nicholas thank you okay copy you 'll just have to listen to me it 's privileged to be here today to present to the present and speak to the long-term plan for Christchurch I 'm committed to Christchurch it has been my home for 65 years I 'm committed to the arts and all their forms they are what I believe one of the fundamental tenants of a healthy vibrant city the city council has supported the arts for many years and I believe that it is time that this support becomes enshrined in our city 's future is one of the foundations that make our city special I speak as someone who like hundreds have served as voluntary governors trustees and directors of arts organisations i 'm currently a director of new zealand opera which is Christ church 's opera I speak as someone who like thousands of our citizens have privately financially supported court theatre the Opera the orchestra World Festival crushed Jazz Festival Isaac Theatre Royal you know me Christ art gallery and other organizations but most importantly I speak as one of the the concerts the exhibition 's the festivals and performances in our city every year I take great heart from seeing Michael pata Ko phase bull and place makers and now a new Regent Street and from hearing the Christchurch leader Tahoe male voice choir at the ends at dawn service I 've admired the elephants painted on the wall on the building down Manchester Street and I 've seen my young grandson and joy spectrum at the YMCA I 've laughed out loud at the buskers and I 've enjoyed Shakespeare in the open air at mona vale even more do I feel invigorated by the smiles on the faces of the people as they leave a lunchtime concert at st. Augustine 's a jazz fest will show and the art center all they spill out into the gloucester street after Chavez 's amazing Phantom of the Opera and I eagerly await in anticipate the audience response to new zealand operas Madame Butterfly in July I 'm encouraged and excited when young talented Christchurch artists can use the opportunity this city offers to springboard their professional careers in their Trojan perform for us they 're going to do that and share the dream and july at the Isaac Theatre Royal I man or because I 'm an audience not a participant I 'm an or of those who perform entertain and inspire and the professionals practitioners who make it happen the curators the directors the stage managers the conductors the accompanist costume designers archivists lighting directors sent makers and all those behind the scenes but i 'd like to share the greatest delight that I 've had and it 's a story of the three tenors from sir James 's school and are renewing its a decile once cooled with over sixty percent marion polynesian students in october 2011 when cocido domingo was coming to christ church for his amazing concert i had a ring from the principal she said I 've got three tenors there are three tenors they 'd like to meet mr. Domingo I couldn 't not even I could not help her but last year two of those dinners in four friends came to the dress rehearsal of love Wayne and the horn catharina first time they meet Phillip roads a stunning young international performer I marry a marry young Mary man from flex fear in the East from the east coast of the North Island was probably a similar background to some of those students earlier this year they meet they came to 50 of those students 50th from sir James 's came to New Zealand operas opera and schools they did The Barber of Seville renamed a close shave and they meet amongst other Philippe Manu a young time singer who was one of our rising at us Judy Perry the principal said I want my children to know what 's possible who knows we might have the future ania tyr tyr we might hear the next solo mio from Christchurch acts changes lives the Christchurch City Council port support gives confident and encouragement to all those who support participate and make a pre-professional don 't stumble now it 's time to ensure that the arts at the heart miss Oliver city in enshrined in the long term plane any questions is there Jemaine well question because in the last week several summation regarding adverts strategy and also integrate older ask the funding including the culture event activity arts etc in the one long term blender activity planned what is your point of view it 's up to the City Council but I do think in all its forms and we all know arts are so broad that it has to be enshrined and Academy as I said gives the City Council has supported the arts they 're huge sports of the Arts you have fabulous events performances you financially supported it but at her and your ongoing support gives everybody confidence so you have to make it not a priority because we all know that clean water housing and other things are absolute priorities but we then know that after education arts changes lives and that you can education is not the responsibility of local government arts can be and it can influence hugely and it 's not right up there it 's right down there and it 's also here so I do believe that what you 're the proposals are good those are more details that I just want to give love those cats and James called a friend mr. ah this money and so do you Harry yeah _"

    "text": "yep thank you thank you will see you at the party and it 's hamish hamish prague by Glavine I 'm lucky last yep then we can all go homes all right I 'd like to talk about rates and I put a submission in the other day and I was i just got a comment out of the paper recently like Peter Alexander and if I 'm a counter from town here and as heading was a balanced budget and the budget should be balanced the Treasury should be refilled public debt should be reduced the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and controlled the assistance to foreign land shall be curtailed list home become bankrupt people must learn to work instead of living on public assistance that was a quote by Cicero who was around of julius caesar 's time two thousand seventy years ago okay so he goes on about farming but Israel it 's about a balanced budget Margaret Thatcher said a few years ago that if you haven 't got the money put it back on the shelf so my thinking is appreciate the efforts hints of that since you 've brothers have been elected a year or two ago that 's great but i 'd like to see I 'm on a wage I see rates going up every time and I can 't pass it on and it 's he really so I 'm pleading with you not to put up rates I 'd like you to achieve a zero increasing rates if you can 't afford it things defer postponed leave it to later we just can 't afford we can manage without some things for a bit longer so it seems to be that every time rates go up and up and up and I don 't think it 's a matter of bar bring more or selling assets or increasing rates rather stay within your means i have to work within my budget my income and and I just can 't sell off stuff or borrow more money because one day ever catch me so we 've paid for the rates I mean for the assets please don 't sell them we can 't afford more rates increases and we this is my family I 'm speaking I was just thinking of that skip does anybody know Monty Python go to the ear okay so the man went and and he said hello my name 's smoke too much and the answer was will you be able to cut down a little and I said I 'm sorry you bet I can tell them I see smoke too much so better countdown little yes yes people must say to you every day I 've never really noticed so I 'm suggesting hi my name 's spin too much well you better cut down a little I 'm sorry you better cut down a little that 's a phrase and our family cut down a little yeah that 's what I 'm asking for work you know I 'm gonna it 's pretty crystal clear the challenge that we 've got is that we are in a situation where we 're not in the business as usual environment and and we all got elected after not knowing that vast sums of money were absent from our budget because it wasn 't look at everything on the plan and we found out that there was money put on the budget of four hundred million dollars give or take and and that was savings to be found but it was never intended to be savings to be found so there was an expectation built up that a lot of money would be made available for repairing our infrastructure and it turns out that we 're not entitled to as much as we thought we were so we want to draw the line we are going to read for the our capital program and we 're going to it will be less then then what it was on at the beginning of this process absolutely everyone 's commercial to taking money off the capital program in terms of the chief executive he rolls been to get the operational spin down and yes it will be more than that two percent that we sit last year but you know yeah balancing the budget making hard choices you know the east is so damaged and there is so much that they need to get back on hasn 't been so great over there so you know I mean we are going to try and get the rates down but you can see that we 're trying to balance everything at the moment and it 's hard I 'm stead and I if it 's the rates got five percent can 't_''_311.28 well it 's only five to see it but can 't_''_313.23 we just cut focus it here or there or something rather and bring a bit beneath no I 'm doing a good job that it 's just the hurts and every time the rates come out at their up and up and up and I can 't pass it on and we need your voice you know it 's really important that we hear that voice because you know I would have to say that you 're probably the silent majority and living on that side of the town with a wage then you 're probably you know sort of in a same position as somebody 's on a fixed income with a high capital value for their property and thus they can 't yeah really important message to end on thank you very much you will go home there thank you alright everyone now you would have got the good news that just a plan review is canceled for the morning and that means that we 'll see you back here at nine-thirty thank you _"

    "text": "it 's me with a different head home I was gonna say that you 've got a different address not very conveniently I gave me a slot into and so company how would you end up with a different address cuz I actually looked to see if you 're the same person but you hit a different address uh yes but one is the work address yes oh I see okay okay and my my colleague who should be here had to go to a funeral I think the wake must be funny be more exciting than that pieces haha uh he hasn 't shown all right nothing on TV one of those um I 'm not even even a funeral i 'm just gonna have awake that 's going to be able to say that both of us are a product of the 1950 's apprenticeship scheme in that botanic gardens and that this gives us a full right to be commodians definitely be able to say yeah things out what they used to be and well they 're not but there 's so much that there 's the is really little in the gardens that wasn 't the same isn 't the same as it was when we were there like 60 years ago and I mean the beautiful structure of the gardens is unchanged in that neither should be changed this the trees and the spaces are wonderful assets to have and but in the current master guards a master plan there 's a quite a number of very visionary and aspirational projects that the late David given had put into that plan and of course because they 're all capital items they don 't show up in this long-term plan and I can understand that given the constraints with God but we recently as is actually one of the things that 's in the master plan is that a trust should be formed and it was really up to the friends to do that and which that we have done and we have recruited some very fine energetic business people none of whom were see themselves as being that you know in the friends group but they 're all business and professional people who see the really like to take it further and put into the next stage based on that master plan in fact when we were forming it we we hit everybody we asked wanted to be on board until we we have a meeting one day and we looked around we thought we 've got nine here and we need only eight and that leads only calls for eight so we thought you know that we haven 't registered the deed yet so we can quickly change it to ten and so we can accommodate all the people who want to become on board and that 's that 's great the problem we have I have because I was possible for really look really most these people is it while we 're busy giving the infrastructure sorted out and getting charitable status and all that stuff we 're rapidly covering the point where they 're going to say well what are we going to start raising money for and frankly the Botanic Gardens is not ready for us fact this has been galloping up for the last eight years since we 've been that we can go to the public go to the big donors that we hope to tap and say this is what we want to do so I have a problem with the decision-making processes that seem to be in place they don 't seem to be in place in the gardens and their capacity to make decisions and to be able to present us with viable options to raise money on except one that is the pedestrian bridge which I see as in your long-term plan but as an unfunded item we could do that and we 've suggested with the consulate with all those leave the garden stuff that we do that but we meet with the certain amount of well not exactly brick walls and more like a wet blanket saying that you know we have resource consent because we don 't how much is on the budget for that even those unfunded I 'm sure what it cost something like 300,000 possibly more like 500 tells me you 'd fundraise for well whole town so we haven 't fun we haven 't started fundraising it but launch a trust in fact you know me right now we 've got a an mou to sign with you someday we have to have a little party with that but that 's not when we want to launch it to the public until we got a native rate you 'll need for the reality is that the trust does not want to get into the position of actually commissioning designs or holding contracts or making design decisions our role is to say there 's a project we will try to raise the money for it and so this is where we have we need to counsel to step up and say yes we 're prepared to Commission the design and we 're prepared to get the resource consent and we will have the contract and we hopefully be able to say well we will provide the money they were done asking for money but we do ask I guess we do need something if as a design needed within the council cost money to hire their own landscape architects to get these projects and we are really stable though to say that you want a fundraise for projects that we need done and haven 't got money on our budget for this is awesome yeah everyone and because it 's a lot of them I 'm going to invite Vicki back to that 's the whole concept we didn 't_''_365.11 we know mou requires that we only raised money for capital projects right a capital projects take decisions these decisions to say this is what we want to do okay Alan the children 's garden that you mention here which sounds lovely and how much is it do you have any concept of what it costs no idea is it do you know where it goes or do is there anything inside your heat that tell us about children 's garden well it 's it 's going to go in the area with the the playground is yeah and that situation to where where the gondwana garden is I have a problem with sort of all these these different titles and it I think we should start from scratch and have a whole children 's experience well not play experience and I think that we 've got so many wonderful features an hour Oh God okay so every if you wanted to create this amazing children 's experience and the Botanic Gardens which is an already amazing place for children and others what kind of number if you were thinking of one randomly and would you need to have and what sort of funding would you need from the council in order to create that actually I see that there 's a figure in the budget for maintenance of the playground somehow 2.6 million or something is it it 's it 's it 's ridiculously huge but it 's a wonderful wonderful figure that if you can get away from some you know the concept of using it to fix the payer of the Saltine I see something more is that a renewal well off the playground hmm ok but if you were going to start this project of something amazing for children in the botanic gardens near playground and you 're going to have a whole heap of ideas what 's a reasonable figure for us to think one of dads costing time but I think we could do a wonderful job with three million three million for with you well no no no no no he 's a gun fear isn 't that you 're talking about an MoU between the council and the Friends of the tanika are you right so do you think that a proper you know discussion around the projects that the friends could be fundraising for an actively involved in delivering would be best dealt with in their environment yeah we could do it at the party when we signed the because we 'll have all the trustees there yep Tim if I understand you right so it 's kinda the opposite to what we 're saying you 've identified a fantastic opportunity if the gardens put it to the project together is in the concept can work out the finance friends of the botanic gardens will then take will take the nozzle often you 'll go off and try and find the funds is it correct it 's exactly that 's the opposite so wish you 're not asking you 're the potato garden staffers ahead here 's the concert this is probably what we need and you don 't find us yep due to sit this is the great submission thank you yeah I think thank you very much and we 've got one more submission for the evening _"

partner could be careful about it business partner roger pilot and nothing neighbor jiff Denny have been a two directors of cockroach delivered limited and I 'm going to pass on to them tell the story if we want to put across thank you thank you I 've been involved in this saga since 1994 when the problem of the go-kart noise come up to the fourth in the area and the council wanted one entity to deal with so the OTO residents association was formed and I wound up as chairman the council also suggested that a zoning change what could be on the way I could be the way forward and Davis over we were employed by the Association to prepare planes funded by the residents in 1998 the council generously offered to take over this process and save residents further costs but it turned out to be a stalling tactic in 2001 was to pave the way for further zoning decisions five years went by in 2007 the council produced five planning scenarios three were four residential with the go carts removed and two with a light industrial with the go-go cat club re remaining another five years in 2011 plan change 5 was adopted as a residential d zoning but included a buffer of 150 metres with other noise mitigation provisions until the go kart club was relocated there were three point four million does committed by the council for this in the 2014-16 period our decision to protest had to proceed with a consent application was based on that commitment from that date most the properties in the zone were affect how were effectively on the market some with more bigger than others our particular land had no takers the go-cart would be the significant problem to stop us developing the gaps between the dates given an appearance of an activity by the Raa by the residents association but we were constantly dealing with the council and these and other matters in fact hundreds possibly thousands of hours were spent after the earthquakes it was obvious that the land in our area will be needed for housing and we had the zoning most of your neighbors are elderly and we 're in no position to go through a consent process so we adjoining property owners decided to join forces and in a joint venture company called copper ridge and get the consent on our land the city up had this set up the layout and infrastructure designing for the whole area does everybody know we are we talking about cars road yep we 've already had some machines on us all right yeah okay planning started in November 2011 with a consent application lodged in 2000 jun 2013 through this this stage regular meetings of the council planners ticked off most of the design decisions and so if I have the time the application was lodged most of the issues was supposedly sorted been sent was finally issued in april 2014 that is 20 months of planning and ten months of to issue the consent the cost to us for 650,000 nearly twice what we had estimated but for professional was for eighty two sections but with 150 meter radius buffer zone where the houses could not be built until the go cats were relocated that is almost half of the development jun 2014 baileys were engaged to market the copper ridge let 's the name be a sub-divisional both nationally and internationally so far with that success in fact the last serious prospect a substantial and well respected local developer drop down only a week ago saying the go-kart restriction made it have made the developed an economic part forms of the council 's wrote and reliability and fulfilling its undertakings is also a significant nificant factor he also said he doesn 't want any more developed due to any more development in the city as it and he 'll stick to the so on and Waimakariri district and future so we are stuck with land or ready to go and no developer willing to take the risk without the relocation of the go pass if it was moved with certainty within two years work could could resume on the copper ridge with confidence the copper copper edges the budget for 2014 15 16 I ask that you please show some leadership and carry out what the council has proposed for years Jeff carry on why do we know okay we know that the kart club would like to move they do have an inferior track which is well fallow international standards and we don 't believe its realistic for the council to you retain and motor sport facilities surrounded by residential properties there is a proposed location for the cart cub we are advised and which would be available in approximately 12 to 18 months and this is a Pettit cleans Island I don 't know how far the negotiations aguanto do believe as a heads of agreement has been signed and there is I believe some sort of assistance financially for the go-karts to pay off the value of the land over a period of time but only what I hear and obviously if you don 't now of course is the cheapest time to do it right now was always that she was time to do any building project of any size one of the problems track which is our selves and other owners has devalued severely we 're down probably thirty percent from our 213 valuations so currently we have a negative value cost us money to buy we have worked out that the council contributions for the whole subdivision 360 plus sections would be over 11 million income contributions your rates would probably bring in in excess of another million per annum so while will it pay some money to locate the go-carts the reality is that it 's a win-win for the council as far as we 're concerned this whole exercise has been a huge emotional and financial stress and is still ongoing many of us had to mortgage our land in the toll on us as well so I 'm going we also believe your present past staff have placed us in this nvidia spizz ition as we would never have started down the road without the belief that the council would honor its stated intentions all we ask is that the council observes its own past and present recommendations and formalize a date within the 2014-16 budgeted period for relay one was a check is the existing infrastructure in place there or does it need to be upgraded as well the coke out no I 'm just trying to understand because you said it was uh nicon ohmic for because I can only do half fun so but if you can do half I still 150 houses I still presume that 's a no because of the 150 meter so I 'm just ripping just a nice then work hard I 'll stances it i made an island at the moment only 20 acres of 20 acres of the whole block as i could have a content you know I understand that I 'm just trying to understand what that 's an economic when you look at the current activity that well for when the sewers got to come through from the corner of Wigan road which is across the road now and really for us to hook into but we 're going to come through two properties that is quite a long straights to go and so that the overall in going costs to get the first 40 sections us to carry on I think council Jensen 's really talking about the whole how many sections can we actually develop as of now it 's a memory 65 beginning head of the 360 about 120 so why is that I 'm economic now is it the cost of the infrastructure is that what a what about that amount because it still seems got an intense of development compared to only in the only sections we can actually develop now 42 without going through the the rest of the owners of the blocks had not got consent and not part of us our consent so we can at this point in time we can only develop 42 sections okay it 's caught a rich okay so if all the neighbors are Taylor the whole block we can still only do 120 instead of 360 so any developer will tell you that they leaving in a week because the cost of infrastructure is so huge the economics just don 't add up all right a lot to thank you very much for coming on as I say we 've had other clear advice to be taking on the matter and will be considering it as part of the LTP closes thank you friends of the Christchurch Botanic Gardens also Ellen muth _"

    "text": "keeping you waiting cool thank you hello councils they wear um sorry I wasn 't able to attend on the day that the the arts were largely here so thank you for fitting me in today I just like to say that makes 22 points in general one is about the necessity and endorse the submissions have been made you bye-bye other arts bodies and by the Arts Council creative new zealand that I think the there is a need for the council to it to address and composer a strategic plan for the Arts and secondly to suggest that they there are various streams of funding within council that could be rationalized into a single area for operational funding but largely I just I 'd like to talk about they performing arts precinct and the corpse roll there and we 're very honored to be part of that and it 's been a very frustrating process so far but I 'm delighted at last week we seem to have made some significant progress and council are commissioning a feasibility study that will precede the master planning of that and a lot of very exciting work actually which is quite the opposite of of big project stuff so we 're looking at developing a granular area of the city that responds to the investment that the city will be making in the in the arts facilities but one thing I 'd like to draw to your attention is is the the dichotomy that exists in on the one hand making major capital commitments not as major of some but for us very major and on the other having to balance that with the need to be cutting operational funding and in terms of what that means for the court we the court is this by far the largest theater company in the country the next largest one is about half the size and receives funding from their City Council of 1 million dollars a year we get 150,000 from from you which we 're very grateful for but it 's a small miracle what 's achieved on the sort of funding that we get over with the last time it was measured in terms of attendances in 2007 the court in the pub in the subsidized sector in the country we 're now doing much much more than that last year was another record year of attendances Addington 's been a great success but it is only part of what we do and it 's it 's a very limited facility and it is a temporary facility we 're totally committed to bringing that energy and those attendances back into the inner city so we 've got about 150,000 a year who attend including 30,000 attendances during the day at kid shows so that 's a really important part of enriching and vitalizing that that precinct and of course the reason we are subsidised is because it 's it 's a democratization of the Arts and so with those sorts of attendances it really is a democratic institution that we want ticket pricing that makes it available to large proportions of of the of the population so the sort of equivalent show you might see where they the performers are not paid their charging twice the amount for tickets so we I just want to make that that point about your commitment express some concern that might be looking at cuts understand exactly the financial situation the cities in but we believe we 're poised to bring a huge amount back into the inner city with your help and I hope that 's a short submission well that 's great because there 'll be questions and I know that some counselors will be a little bit bewildered by references to progress on the performing arts precinct as they won 't have had a briefing on there so perhaps you could just enlighten us further well the at our own initiative and our costs we 've brought out what we believe it the leading theater architects in the world from London and the reason we 've done that is because we 've never built a facility for a performing arts company for a producing theater company in New Zealand it 's a very specialized area and some research that came out of Cambridge University in the UK identify the three most complex buildings you can make as one is a nuclear facility the other is a hospital and the third is expertise which we 're married hey it 's multi-use we 're marrying with local local expertise and and the proposal has been put up to 22 council funding the as you know the the Performing Arts precinct with the land coming from government and that was some indoor sermon and embraced by the council offices last last week and we 've moved on to the next next stage which is a huge success oh I 'm sure that capsule officers will be briefing us shortly I 'm Ally one of the most clearly enunciated and well predicted submissions at the joy information to an occlusion eliciting um I just all you talked about the temporary nature of Eddington ya li giasses Leanne 's suggestions concerning and obviously it 's frustrating for you as well to now feel as though you making some progress up so long can the theatre stay in Eddington for however long it 's going to take to I do hope so we 've got to find some mechanism of passing this to the community it 's only temporary in terms we got we 've got a 'm sure that could be negotiated and extended but it 'll be a tragedy if we move into the inner city and we have to put that in the bin and return it to the owners in the state that we received it so there is work going on on that but I don 't know quite how that 's going to be unbrella I mean these things are not assets their liabilities but I do hope so i 'm not having a combination of several amateur companies receiving it 's a size of auditorium that we haven 't had in the city before the earthquakes and we need it the one in addington yeah we 're doing it with one one arm tied behind our back when the current circumstances that 's fine yep yeah yeah but I think that yes we can and if we were going to go into the inner city we would reinvest we 'd raise more money and we try and make that work in the long term for the company it works but bring bringing wherever we go you know the restaurant and got to come back and see in a city too it 's our duty to do so you 're someone said to me the other day do they really want to come back and I said all yes they do and and we want you to come back because they as you say it 's the foot traffic and it 's the vibrancy what we 've got to do is to protect the company in terms of we 've got to make sure it 's sustainable yeah I mean all over the world provinces and cities the government 's build sparkling arts facilities and then the company folds because they can 't afford to be in it so we 've got to find a mechanism to do that that 's a major hurdle so it 's there 's lots to play for yet it 's not sure that we this will be the only purpose built theatre everything else has been retrofitted Noah for a producing theatre cover so that lots of auditoria but not a producing theatre company on us and the scale so the whole thing yes because we are employing 130 people a week and you need to theaters again yeah yeah yeah and it 's a smaller one for ya with a sort of to Papa of theaters in New Zealand it 's part of part of our mission is is to express the New Zealand voice on stage and and a lot of that is new writing and we do that in our second space right we do it on the main stage as well but you know when we have the second space it 's entirely new zealand work and you do children 's stuff too don 't you during the holidays that is it so that 's what 's making it accessible honor yeah all genius but for adults as well attend honors for that so yes it 's and that 's why we get 30,000 that 's Bowman that audience is going to come back into the inner city yeah get the kids it yeah I think I think mart agree with you or me yeah are there any other questions that people here at yani clear who 's who 's leading parking yes you 're absolutely right Yaya one of the things we 're suggesting through this plan is to remove council car parking from a strategic guest list we assign we don 't think its strategic anymore what 's your view on well I think it 's a critical issue it 's the weather is in public or private private ownership it just needs to be there are part of the resistance from our audience is that they love it because they can park at the door and we 've got we 've got to find a way of giving that back to them because they will not want to leave Adam and there are you saying it do you think someone 's actually worked out that having everyone disgorging from the Theatre Royal the court theatre or and anything else all at the same time there are some sort of the plan but there are there are things that we 're working on I hope you 'll see soon that might provide some solutions to that brilliant well thank you very much as Ellie said it 's always a we 'll certainly take those thoughts on thank you very much good luck is good way to thank you okay _"

    "text": "oh yeah thank you so thank you for the opportunity to speak here today and knowledge meant to the mere and the counselors and no doubt you 're all thinking not another submission about New Brighton never I can tell you though that I don 't means in the camping ground and I don 't mention the golf course I 'm supported by my daughter Celeste list is going to help you with the big words and the Alzheimer 's which is a big word and of course you 'll be addressing you tomorrow so you be prepared excellent I 'm a cynic ratepayer and I speak in that capacity I 'm not aware of the intricacies of how the City Council works around budgets and policy apart from how it affects me as a ratepayer I fully endorsed the comments by one of your own christchurch city council finance bikes on Ralph mangi who suggested Gerry Brownlee should let people like me and the City Council decide the future of the city and have some control over the decision-making and it is clear we don 't share the same eighty frustrated New Brighton residents bared their bums to get the christchurch city council 's attention upset about the neglect of their suburb mirror at the time Bob Parker stated and reply the City Council is dedicated to creating a new vision for the area and went on to say will prove to them and the months ahead in fact they 're wrong that statement was street made three years ago now let us talk about the master plan for New Brighton setting the vision and setting goals for the redevelopment and recovery of the New Brighton commercial center the implementation of which according to its blurb will bring new optimism and investment into New Brighton and create a more resilient community the master plan talks about getting participation from all sectors of the community including business owners and community groups and above all us the residents the master plan highlights the need for a strong positive identity for the center-to-center to improve people 's perceptions of the eastern suburbs the master plan also states the plan is achievable and goes on to say people 's ideas and aspirations are by a staged implementation schedule in other words the master plan is not a wish list so let us go back some years to 2002 when the infamous revitalization plan for New Brighton was born and trumpeted in a similar fashion to its present-day successor and then lay gathering dust for 13 years some of its ideas have been made or incorporated into the master plan and a new lease of life so what will be the difference how would one get off the drawing board and not the other the master plan acknowledges it is important therefore the latest master plan sets realistic goals to ensure that the projects can be delivered within set time frames so what does this master plan say about set time frames and to be honest I could not find any set time frames let us take the example of the foreshore and mean of Marine Parade upgrades what does the master plan say the place of implementation will be influenced by a range of factors many of which are yet to be fully determined which will is not really very reassuring the master is easier to provide time frames on the development of public land however much of the funding is yet to be secured which is not very reassuring either the master plan goes on to say development on private space as much less certain others may require regulatory processes EG resource of building consent the closest the master plan comes to time frames is by organizing the actions into four streams and these are just starting time frames and not completion dates the priority is nought to two years short term is three to six years and that includes a for short medium is six to ten years and then includes the immediate surrounding road that 's the Ring Road around the mall and then there 's the ongoing which covers 10 years or more and that is the revamp of the main mall itself as uncertain as all that sounds there is then the question of how will all be funded and that of course requires money according to the master plan the capital costs which relate to the physical work such as Street upgrades open space enhancements or development 's and your plan process that happens every year and herein lies the black hole particularly if we consider this statement from the council in the master plan council activities and priorities change over time and therefore the projects will be contestable as part of the review of the long-term plan undertaken every three years this review involves the identification and prioritization of projects across the city but wait there is more all decisions as to whether or not the council funded action will commence remain with the council and there is no binding commitment on the council to proceed with any actions identified in the master plan and that is not reassuring so what is the future road new brighton well the current situation is very very bleak the new brighton the economic assessment summary document offers somber meaning the new brighton has been in a downward spiral in terms of attractiveness environment and retail store activity a retail order showed a fifth of stores in the suburb and that 's 22 stores were vacant this is one of the highest vacancy percentages ever recorded and the last ten at a meeting on the eleventh of May said he was in the seaside suburb the previous week and he could not believe the state of the place let 's summarize the appears to be no money for the master plan at this point of time and every year the capital works will have to vote money towards some part of the plan therefore to ever get to completion will beyond will be beyond the 10 years of most counselors here today and has already eaten up three years up to the stage and according to best guarantees by the council it may be 20 10 to 15 years plus before you get anywhere near a possible start date for the bulk of it and this is not talking taking into account changes and council personnel and political agendas which may be far less enthusiastic about voting more money towards New Brighton and the capital works money may be voted elsewhere while New Zealand a while New Brighton and I 'm not saying New Zealand continues to languish but New Brighton certainly will the master plan 2015 is looking as it may be or may not be but sadly it looks like the master plan so no dot finding a March 2015 it 's beginning to look like the wish list at promised it would not be and going all the way back to the protest in 2002 it would appear to me the bum 's are going to be proved right which leaves two questions what has happened to the Legacy Project and the hot salt water twenty thousand people indicated they wanted on the new brighton for sure and number two what is Christchurch City Council doing for the state of New Brighton as it is now to go back to ralph mandy who suggested on televisions cable live current affairs programme on the fifteenth of may the shrinking budget and the likelihood of the blowout requires an immediate rethink on the jury brownie big-ticket projects like the convention center and we don 't buy the spin doctor stuff that the taxpayer gets a free ride on this because we the RET rate of their taxpayer or the ratepayer get a free ride the taxpayer pays and you the land that the convention center is going to be built on and there 's a lot of secrecy around the wheeling and dealing as a cynic ratepayer last night oh excuse me I 've let you run long over time because I you know you 've got an important message to give but would you like to just kind of wrap it up I thought you might sure are the argument I guess is that why would we spend money with a put where the population like crucial i guess you can ask me is why would just be money on a an area with a population that appears to have decreased and we are going to spend money there and the answer will be in the ltp but yeah yeah so what I 'm saying it 's like saying throw a break at the drowning East and a lifesaver to the Christchurch inner city I think that you brightened with the new high schools and also the new housing that 's going to be created as a result of the new schools there will be growth yeah and of our malls remains the same I mean it 's a Christchurch are so unique in the world it seems just a shame that it 's not a flagship for any of the tourists that come to the city we seem to be unique where it 's a neglected an attractive part of the city and I guess there 's a select ratepayer I just don 't have any sort of really confidence that we 're going to do anything anexo that anytime soon just once I God do you really need to wait a few more about two months less than two months by the 30th of junior will know the answer to your questions right person to council as those I just want to know who is red 2 2015 master plan I 've got it well that 's on my desk is bomb is not for me yes we 've all got a copy what we 've all seen at we passed at it and canceled so I mean that look I understand where you 're coming from and the the one comment that I 'll make area when that 2002 plan came out and I said it wouldn 't work if everyone thought that the whole suburb would be fixed by a slow road the idea of a single silver bullet to fix new brighton that used to have saturday trading as a monopoly just as cloud cuckoo-land the master plan that we passed the other day it can only work where the landowners and the business owners work in collaboration with the council or that we have powers of compulsory acquisition because as you quite rightly identified from the plan we can we can progress public spaces we cannot require private entities to do anything unless it 's for a public works so we are taking all of us into account we are acknowledging that the new brighton business association as it was has become the new brighton business and land holders association so to the first time one representative for the combined group and there seems to be real progress we have heard that the pleas from the brighton area the wider brighton area and i am sure that we will make progress as 've got to say really and thanks lately and I appreciate what you 're saying is is you know what 's happening now yeah I think that 's the nothing has seemed to be happening now that 's that 's our biggest issue yeah but we will be responding as we will do and all of the areas in relation to the submissions that we 've received all right thank you thank you thank you Phillip Aldridge from the court theatre apology _"

John 's they might take another year or two years to set up we I said it part of the team that set up rodeo and mandeville we 're part of 40 40 people we get 6,000 people through I 've been loaned I took Christmas parades for eight years and I loaned escrow school two thousand dollars worth of stock they made eight thousand the first year eight thousand the second year eight thousand the third year we 've got 30 sponsors we 've got sixty thousand dollars River stock we had 7,000 people through the door the Baptist Church thats different stories I 've been going 14 years get 37,000 people through the door rhizome needs looking also in Mount Pleasant the long-term vision in four years we 're going to do Christmas trees over that side okay I 'm writing a children 's play which is to 18 which is very much like big bird that 's the best way I can describe it you got sesame street and got big food I 've got I 've got um 80 which is a blue mower and we 've gotten your Regent Street flying cheer chalice is about having fun okay a percentage of the money raised will go to the curative site so I 'm not interested about making the money from it but we will run and will be incentive that we turn it into a festival and that 's the idea row which he domain is actually just it 's just really lovely and you 've got all these little huts and so we 're going to make that Santa 's workshop the area for development of their cuates Center at kure to must be able to service free high schools everybody keeps talking about to icicles essentially free high schools in the or Minister of Education the old the old trotting club must be saved and restored at the fury suicide to run as an event center and must not be owned or run by the education department or ministry of education whatever the area set aside for the Aquatic Center an old trotting club must have land area space around its boundary I 'm really concerned you 're going to have to schools coming and you 're going to sell too much off and then when you need to develop that facility you 're not going to have the land so are really really concerned about that must have future development but also includes the area for the credit which must not be sold or run by the ministry of education or education department lovers have beef with the Education Department now the reason why of unless its first of all we fundraise for Terry too and also too I was part of the team that we had six years of arguing community group of 40 at a committee meeting set up a committee eight years of committee work and they services one high school in the community hi koi pool same size service one high school and the community happen Ellie pool services to schools services pepper Mellie and a lot of people don 't know st. Andrews so the thing is you might be building the big facility over here with some of that money actually went out of the economy of New Brighton the thing is you 're going to need a facility like that over there and the key shouldn 't be the money is should be making sure that there 's enough land there for future development the money will come if the plan is right and the community will get behind it okay and that 's bits one thing I 'm concerned now the next thing is the mission statement the reason why I 'm going about the mission statement is presented this to Bob Parker laughs when he was in his last to him and I 've worked on it since and it takes it 's just my vision for the city I presented a cap and pens I 'm sitting on up and will follow like photos we found that could come BTW t-shirts there 's things like that we will try and source crowdfunding but it 's one of these things at the moment it 's part of our mission statement it 's suddenly Brie think and I 'm going to focus on it and it 's really what I 'm doing today is mainly just to keep you informed who we are the maid Mary lady who 's making a movie Ursula I think there 's some time now but and I mean that 's seems unfortunate about to end on but you know we really appreciate you coming along and presenting these ideas obviously all of these things have to be taken into account when we consider the long-term plan and all comments are valuable so we really appreciate you taking the time and submitting to us this afternoon good just one thing there was a thing on Jade Stadium so you 'll have to read it we have honestly bridges the Russian problem okay very much thank you very much is Brian Donovan _"

    "text": "welcome thank you madam chair I feel that glass it 's importantly glass not to drink but to talk about with that what I 'm about to talk about is a glass half full a glass half empty or what I want to do a bar for my organization is fill the glass up I know some of you who have been in the elbow club for reasons other than what the own will travel operating that and we even have a smart smart choice consultation there which is probably one of the reasons why I 'm here but never one I 've got five what 's here which I go through hopefully very quickly and a few but from Christians that 's fine so what is Elmer club it 's an umbrella club that was established before the earthquakes but I have two of now seven sporting clubs were based at Elmwood Park I have to say that was catalyzed in its development by the earthquakes because all of a sudden we in the area apart from everybody else in Christchurch found there was a very great lack of sudden became home to a whole lot of other organizations that needed somewhere to meet for funerals 20 fears weddings you name it we 've had it so that 's what we do we 've got seven sporting clubs involved a mix of Ages and sporting codes summer and winter sports and we 're providing social and administrative services to those clubs the handout I 've passed around you 'll find out there that 's more information go through the clubs are and what they are you can rock those at your leisure so what have we been doing second what well we 've been concentrating on supplying services the M word Bowling Club pavilion is not fit for purpose the insurance company have written it off so we 've rather it 's safe but not for procurements so what we 've been doing is learning how to effectively manage the competing demands of a whole number of organizations sporting an otherwise some of which are complimentary some of which are competitive and that building is now operating basically from eight o 'clock in the morning to eight or nine think we 've got to handle on that we 've been developing relationships with local schools and other community groups and we 've been exploring the use of other facilities those of you have been there will know that the number one Green was munted and on the basis of wagang theme the settle down we put eight hundred and fifty tons of sand dollar intended them to the urban beach which is used by volleyball and all sorts of other organizations so that 's what we 've been doing what have we just done well that 's probably the main reason I 'm here and that is that we have secured agreement with the board of trustees of hittin intermediate and the minister of education that we can take over the use of some of their green space to expand the facilities and replace our existing pavilion and that would be a shared cooperative space between the school and the onboard club and the community so if you like to go to the back there 's a schematic of what we might finish up with in the fullness of replacing the existing balls pavilion with a new fit-for-purpose building it involves replacing the mountain number one green where the urban beaches at the present moment with an artificial green and hopefully in the fullness of time putting a roof favorite so Christchurch would finally have an indoor first class bowling center to come alongside the other bowling facilities in Christchurch so we 're needs pacifica here and the world bowls and that sort of thing they 've got about our position and it 's ideally located for that because we 're central were on bus routes all those sorts of things and we want to build a multi-purpose Sports Hall because we need that for training facilities for our constituent Cubs we 're in the situation where some of our clubs based it on word park and play their sport there and practice there there others like hockey for example may need an artificial a genuine artificial turf they use us but they practice and play somewhere else so that 's it 's a multi-sport facility under cover there 's a lot of appeal to just about every club last winter where they couldn 't use the egg sports ground for four months because of earthquake damage that is the only have to be repaired one way or another we put the suggestion to them that if perhaps I we should be thinking about putting an artificial football turf in there which is available to the school during the day and in that sense other teams other sports can use our sports out alright so that 's part of it and the other thing we want to do is to continue to grow sustainably and organic have to say that in relation to sporting hubs nobody has yet designed the ideal model there are some that are more successful than others around the country we think we 're doing pretty well we think we can do better and we can their intention is to be here and another 100 years time the volume terms have been there for about a hundred years so we just went from another hundred years on it so that gets to me to why I 'm here really which is to put a stake because that 's what we are this has come about because a group of clubs have got together and done it we 've had advice from other people like sport Canterbury and so on but the reality is it 's been generated from the local area amita genuine need and we 're aware of Westminster and where we 're of Rafferty and so on so I 'm not quite sure where they going to appear I haven 't talked to them but if they don 't appear I 'm just putting a stake in the ground for them as well in terms of saying from it seems to me from a council point of view what we 're looking for as we read the in year plan things and so on is a council and its staff which are sympathetic and enabling now what do i say that i say that because we 're we are at the present moment we 're operating and what is now called open space to and where i was a potentially operating on cultural three and that seems to me that and i also the same designation is about to change and so on and people are changing things around i just want to be assured that in that sense all the new legislation will be involved it will be enabling rather than restricting because I don 't know where the elmwood tub is going to evolve y know it 's been evolving since I got involved with the idea 20 years ago and it 's a lot different than what we talked about 20 years ago and it will be a lot different probably in five years time and I 'd hate to think that we didn 't take the opportunity now to leave enough flexibility and the regulations to say this can grow because in my view it can grow to a club which is going to have two thousand plus members even more and that there are three schools which are now using it then we 'll probably use it more in the future all right so I think that 's the important thing is just looking for your support in all sorts of ways if you 've got some money terms of council and everything else at the present moment and I think to suggest that the need of grassroots organizations should be taken into account in terms of the big picture that we 're not as important as the anchor projects all the rest of it right but in reality we might be do more exactly for the sanity the city than some of the anchor projects thank you me we 're not allowed to say here here I think we do I 'm just so I 've got the direction right that that 's what this is elmwood park on the side no no no this is looking we drew this for the school well this is looking for the school towards Elmwood pack so the building is on the school on the back now Jose at the moment that the building runs down the side now that the building their original building is when you 're looking the air is on this that corner this corner here yeah all right right and now running along yet tuck towards the San Andrews boundary the trees behind of the 10 driving by that again right I looking the wrong way on we 'll get across it Freddie all right Fred an excellent what would believe earth Haven got David yani cook if the tenant stop involved the Tennis Club and I haven 't_''_654.98 been involved up to now we went to them from the start and they said no they would sit back and peddle their own canoe however we had a meeting with them last night which I think will mean though they 've been watching they weren 't convinced that we can pull it off in my view though now but they 've seen that 's like now realized that we are there for good so I would I 'm reasonably confident you can never tell with sporting clubs but I 'm reasonably confident that they have now got time to get their heads around what we 're doing and saying well okay I mean I think they realize that in terms of what we 're doing now it 's a it 's a once and for all decision as far as they can see the vendor have to think about whether they want to come in or stay out of it the sensible decision has come in but I 'm not my tears flow

    "text": "makara i 'ma try my Historical Society so I 've known everybody thank you very much indeed for this opportunity to speak to the train way Historical Society 's submission have you all got the visual material the map and the photographs as well they 're just coming around now okay because I 'll need to refer to that over the years the Christchurch City can 't solve the society and the Christchurch tramway limited have turned the city way I think would all agree into a heritage icon in the city citizens visitors and the business community all hold what this council at our society have achieved together in in considerably high esteem now the lower map on page one of your handout shows the present situation stage 1 a of the extension to the original central city loop has been completed and this is great however the true potential of the tramway to bring new life under the fully accessible City concept in the Litchfield Street poplar lane and Jim Street area cannot yet be realized until the completion of stage 1 as a whole if you 'd you 'll see what the complete stage one originally was intend to look at few modifications we 've made now if you look at the following photographs after the map if you can turn over and look at the photographs you can see just how much track has already been laid towards the completing of stage 1 only a very short gap only a few metres remains where the lime turns into poplar lane from Litchfield street the track is in place in poplar lane as you 'll see when the Fed agree but it stops short of 2m street if you look also at the complex drawing on page six can you find page six with that very complicated looking drawing you can see the original stage one intention of exiting poplar lane into germ Street briefly heading west and then swinging round past the Heritage High Street post office the chalices on the cafe see one building that money now that arrangement is no longer viable because of the proposed change of germ Street into a one-way street heading east the tram and other traffic would meet head-on the mbie spatial framework for Christchurch 's innovation precinct and also the accessible City consultation document these documents were so i have here as reproduced on pages 7 and 8 and what you have in front of you pages 7 and 8 now this provides a much simpler arrangement for crossing the busy to M Street there 's now one way to M Street and should also prove much less expensive by obviating extra point work and laying all that curved track that you can see the occur tracks pretty expensive instead the line would turn left from poplar lane into high street and proceed to the stage one terminus the complete stage one terminus further to the south down that 's down high street from there the would be able to reverse to return directly all the way up high street to the square as you can see on page one again going back to page one you 'll see that how that would return to the square from down the bottom end if you like of high street now that length of double track and lower high street two now that that 's considerably further up but it 's shown in light blue on the upper map on page one you can see it going down towards and round the polytek there that 's the ultimate dream of course and we still want to push for that the highly desirable completion of that stage would take you indeed by tram between the two christchurch cathedral sites such as they are and also to the politic but the riders on that trailer on that stage two would be able to see the regrowth of those two cathedrals the politic reversing loop would enable trams to pull trailers you 've got a reversing loop going right round the politic you can just have the the leading tram pulling its trailer all the way around at the moment we can 't run any trailers on the present extension nor would we be able to if we stop at stage one but that can be put off till later of course but anyway over the whole extension it 'd be good to be able to run trailers and as we do of and are still doing now on the central city loop members of the City Council from our study of the long-term plan there appears to be no funding available at all for the next ten years for any of this further development either the completion of stage one or taking things right through ultimately to the completion of stage two we in the society would recommend most strongly that while roadworks are underway and the innovation innovation precinct and they 're starting soon as I understand in that when they 're underway in that area that the rails for the completion of stage one could be put into place and thus saving money and the long run digging up the road later and putting in tram rails in and we do understand that the rails have already been purchased to do that to complete the stage one we would especially recommend honoring the promises made in previous years to businesses in the area and the precinct area and that the nodes of new Regent Street with Walt 's vitality and the innovation precinct with its future vitality can be connected of the tram we know from the past how well the trend has been able to do that in certain areas of the tower trams have a habit of enlivening areas and of opening up new enterprises and that 's really part and parcel of the history of tramps not only a Christchurch that around the world our submission also points out the lead for funds to maintain existing tramway Trek and the overhead wires but above all we believe the planning for continuing the extension to the innovation precinct and towards the cpit needs to get underway now funding to complete stage 2 should follow in the next year or two perhaps but not ten years house or more that 's a long way way we do acknowledge the troll Treme society and people connected with it acknowledge the financial pressure that the council is under at the present time but we want to ensure that christ church takes full vantage of what as H has actually been saved from the quakes and that we use the completed tramway as a tool to ensure that this city is the of the new city will not have lost all of its feathers when it is reborn thank you very much for your time oh thank you do I 'm and thank for you we could do with the tram right look this just a quick question on cost what is the cost to complete page 122 files are still being investigated for its we can 't put any particular figures in front of you at the moment but as soon as we have have them we certainly put them out I 'm sorry we can 't help you at the moment of this there any year capacity for like philanthropic funding to me she fund some of the stuff not very likely I 'm afraid here so although we are a charitable society at we have a whole lot of projects ourselves at the moment we have to house buses for example i 'm thinking more of the the innovation precinct is you can talk now if you ever by moving it it is a potential we can press look at some there is possibly a potential dia of going to build it absolutely yeah well of course they 'll have their own problems to find their own money to do the building might they purposely yes it is yes I mean sometimes you know it is actually worth asking cuz i do it I mean we are in a post disaster environment do the decision to complete the tricks last year has that she come under criticism you know we 've come under criticism for proceeding with that because there are other priorities we didn 't know the true extent of our financial woes in unfortunately but you know so all of these things have to be balanced it as a question of balance and if businesses that are building in that precinct who will benefit from them coming there you know if the politic for example can see a benefit of having the trim go down to the politic which I can see instantly there would be a benefit you know if the that 's the companies that are building the innovation precinct you know felt like that they would like to leave a permanent mark you know of Christchurch you know there are a lot of people that might consider that a contribution to that and a named part of one of the trends as a as a permanent memorial of their gift to the city I I don 't see any harm and looking for alternative sources of funding at the same time if I certainly agree with you Mia that we 're certainly worthwhile giving it a try hmm but what I 'm most of all concerned about of course was we 're so nearly there as far as the the rails are concerned and as far as we may not be able to approach these people in time and get in get promises of money from them but we will investigate whether the rails have been purchased we will also investigate whether in fact we are putting roads done and in the time frame and we will look at what we whether we can put anything on budget but I 'm not making it a promise I 'm just saying we need to know some facts before we make our final decision who achieve innovation precinct that a part of economic development this is because could be something they could actually look into being in the area down and iweb shall detect them for a few other funds at least there but day thank you very much for you for your time and for making the effort that certainly paid off last time so let 's hope for a list of subway thank you very much thank you very much for your time now the Knicks is the L mud club Neal cow i don 't know if i pronounce that correctly you _"

    "text": "both security and safety association James in sir yeah counselors and their local council from littleton entertainer i would like to take this opportunity to thank the boat safety professional team especially paula smith and n jolliffe they 've been a huge help to our group also into a wild and Amy heart from the littleton service center and surely for the communications link which has been really vital I 'm James interim and Roger Allam beside me here are working on behalf of boat safety and we support our submission and and we 'd like to make the following comments and Roger Ellen 's got some background information he 's going to give you in regards to supporting our summation it 's on the screen up there but since the formation of noble point club in 2001 its activities that become more increasingly diverse safety improvements have not been a major focus in response to this about safety group was formed in partnership with the littleton mentor the community board of the CCC many of the members of this group are highly qualified professionals one of the members did the city council planning team when the safety proposals are completed the births at magazine Bay could be restored and revenue from them could be used to fund operational expenses of the improvements break work waters are the first safety priority the cruise ship at naval point has identified now submission is not a viable proposition he can also opposes this site now our theme is safety concerns at naval point i 'm voting with Sophie and we 're just going to put a few slice through and show you and some of the activities that happen here this is a event which we would have lot more of the low juniors and you can see the area 's really will used the club ramp is used a lot more than what the public grampers because it 's much more user-friendly and safer now the issues we have as small types of boats in big boats and this little boat is a hand winch type operation and then we 've also got the trailer launch ones which are very heavy and we are really concerned about the safety issues with issues this last year we just going to quickly flux through oh this is the support we 're giving to the little community board for the submissions and we think this is a real priority to keep this ongoing program going we 've got the funding which we think the council very much from last year for 15,000 we got the Gary tier 0 cell report a hundred-thousand-dollar report which he put together for 15,000 which was the money allocated from the council to fund it and we 're really thrilled with it identifies all the safety issues unifies methods are fixing it and the costings of things for it as well we think it 's a very world and reporter we appreciate the work Garrity is done for that a lot of it long trees to make it work now we 're just going to quickly flip through why the safety issues are real concern this just to give you a bit of an idea what it 's like just giving here this is the sort of conditions we encounter on a quite a regular basis just damage created here try to retrieve boats a day can be starting off really nice the weather predictions good and at the end of the day it ends up far worse than what we expect we 've got the west facilities in Australia New Zealand or UK anywhere in the world and Christchurch these are recent photos that have been taken just to give you a bit of a background on why we are so concerned I 've been sailing since nineteen fifty-eight and Roger Alan 's been sailing the SF 1948 this one 's just showing you the difference a keelboat with a kill and this one 's out getting work done on it and that 's why we want to see the haul out facilities retained at the club for a lady internal or 40 feet because the members can do their own work or if it goes into the inner harbor which is we support the Debbie of a development but they won 't be able to do workers and the port confined area where this they can do their own maintenance of work I left the motor out to keep it there for a few days to get fixed this one as well to do any work on you 're going to get a crane to lift the masculine it 's quite a major cost so being able to keep it in a confined area near the ramp is actually absolutely vital and as you can see you can 't just take it away it 's got a rudder on a kill and over and the palliative drive it so you know it 's a fixture we are going to have a look at a second the trailer yachts on a trailer you can want to kill up and you can just take it beyond the road and it 's easy to take it for servicing and things we 've got a lot more trailer yachts and Canterbury than what we have keel boats and there 's the keel you can see underneath you can just hear it in the middle ear that I just winds up and it 'll go down 2.1 meters when it 's right down and the mass just fold still it 's easily to show you what they 're sort of conditions like absolutely impossible tutorial do now we just got a few other little bits here we just want to very quickly flip through the plan done by the City Council this is a discussion document it 's not a public document yet it 's under discussion with the banks and the team to look at what they think is ideal for the facilities we 've got some plans as well which there 's about four plans here which will just very quickly look through to give you an idea there 's a lot of work going on to try and make a good outcome for the community this is part of Gary tears report showing some protection the small beach in the middle area Virginia 's to be older access to and from and the protection for that area without the read and the black breakwaters and the breakwater would fund that about 750,000 if there 's 100 bits were real estate and done like they 've got it watch our a year so 750,000 you could borrow seven and a so you know that sort of magnitude there 's good money in it to be made out of this that we get the gear and get it sorted out and this is a pond team down the middle that red scrub it just goes we 've it to the right place and you 'll see okay go wake up with a picture take that pontoon beyond the middle layer which means it 's really really safe and easy for the teen years to get on and off the water and that we piece at the bottom is actually concrete slabs I 've got nylon right through the middle of them and it feels for saying so it 's going to be in an area where it 's protected from the waves and things other ways to see it will get washed out and this is the sort of beach they do in the and the areas where the waves can be up to half a meter which would be what we 'd expect here but it is really really manageable car back plan sorry this one we couldn 't get a bit of a turn in and so excellently and these are the sort of discussion documents we 've had looking at all of the options and indus little bit higher you can see it 's got a up the couple you wake up and this escada beats the community board asked for a beach front access for the walkway which joins up the toilet said right along the front and it would have car parking so all of the business along the waterfront can see what 's going on including our start box at the end this is one of the issues with the crew space once you do less obscure all of the view from there and also make up very very unsafe for the start box and people controlling races this is the cruise boat choices which we looked at the one on me and a harbor we looked at that and to trouble us a cruise boats are getting bigger and a 350 feet alter them there now and they need to cut off that but from the back up we were said boat safety suggest cut off it 's the only local ways into the inner harbor which is going to cause a lot of issues with the debu bay but we 've got the wearing so we feel that 's not a good option we then look at the option whether poor company would like to have it at naval point and the 200-meter exclusion zone around the boat is a real issue because it means that whole areas under sign and it 's like air traffic control zone the whole of that fort area would probably come under the same category and it would restrict access and virtually take away all our seat operations at the moment our start line access to boats down the harbor is an excellent so we feel that that 's not good 30 buses plus it will support vehicles would cause absolute congestion in that area which is not good from we 've suggested go over on cashing key where they used to have it about railway lines here last year they put one through after my suggestion through the tunnel and they talk a pest meters away really well so rail tracks are already at me and a harbor there and they could cope with that and they 've organized it before in a work really really well we think it 's no good criticizing they always said the best option is to make some suggestions what we thinks the best option and we would hope that the question city council take it on seriously as well this also major concern about that one narrow road with X 's term which we 've actually attached on so that the other information we 've got which the submission to theirs and little from port recovery plan which has got all the details while we don 't support thank you very much you don 't really good girl great so you 've been submitted on the little turn recovery plane yes yeah so um I mean there are issues obviously in the two different processes the long-term plan isn 't focused on the district plan component which the Littleton recovery plan has taken over from and I think I think we 've I mean we 've heard not only as you said and I think we 've got a very clear understanding of what the issues are saying what I 've been a launch boredom for Environment Canterbury for over 20 years and safety concerns around the harbor is a real concern you 've got kites you 've got all sorts of things unless you extend that exclusive zone right up to the year it 's going to make it impossible for community but we 're not we 're not imposing in his own you know that that 's what I 'm saying is that there is a different process that 's going on we know that we know that but we wanted to make you weird because Christchurch City Council is also tied up with question City whole grains and we just need to make sure that everybody is aware that we are concerned because that affects all of the things I know we hear you absolutely we do understand the issues and just to say from the other perspective that when I was running for mere I went down there with the head of the port of and he said you know here is a potential jewel in the crown of the city and it 's going to it 's been made to waste so I 'm the head of our port company is absolutely understanding where you 're coming from as well and we 've got support from e care as well yet as well yeah no II came doesn 't want the same thing no but it won 't point nine million that was put aside from when the bank 's weren 't around question City Council took over the seems to have got lost some advanced if you a question that hasn 't been able to be found do you know what 's even today no I 've been looking for a lot of money that we thought was on the budget as well and there 's a missing 400 million from the last long-term plan which was only three years and unaudited and we 'll never find there so I mean I take on board what you 're saying and peps if he could make a note it was in the 24th of a lot of fun promises made between banks peninsula and crushes city over that amalgamation which I 'm finding out about but though thank you for that and we certainly take those thoughts on board thank you figure about okay now could we _"

    "text": "hello hi I 'm I 'm neck and West mail got resposible and we don 't have a presentation and nor do I wish to take a considerable amount of your time we just like to outline that we 're generally supportive of the council 's long-term plan but we seek to place emphasis on five main areas but the first one is the role of the visitor economy and the role of all players at key driver win the city rebuilt as well as the strong link between the city 's physical recovery and visitor economy that 's been outlined in the submission prior to us the third element is the provision and maintenance of storm water and wastewater infrastructure and northwest Christchurch and in the general area of the airport and the next area is the maintenance long-term maintenance of historical monuments along memorial revenue and the last area that we wish to place further emphasis on as roading and intersection upgrades adjacent to the airport we have provided further information in its omission which um yeah and we would like to provide a time for you to have anything else to say great look um this wastewater and stormwater infrastructure Widow submission earlier on today saying but put a line in the sand and fix the East you know you know we 've had an earthquake and you say that you know that you 've had these demands will not demands the requirements of the airport on the table for a long time but you know how what tell us what the constraint is on your business too planes in terms of these particular ones because they 're hugely expensive items but not only expensive disruptive in terms of the road weeks that they entail as well and there is just such a need to get our infrastructure corrected in the east I certainly madam chair we understand that the pressures of the council is under and the decisions that you let 's rethink this is like the city 's under a lot of pressure that 's right so so the airport is served by a line that runs from from the airport down where a key road at present there 's only one connection in terms is that worry kero line and we understand we also understand that that line is being upgraded but it has capacity issues so we have had long-term plans and we understand the council has at long term plans to provide for reasons of additional capacity redundancy resilience etc a second connection to the airport and that that connection is to be provided by way of the the Avon he drove saw line so we what we 're saying is we 've been told for a long time now that the that the connection will be made we understand that the earthquake is disrupted that timetable significantly we just in the decisions that need to be made by counsel about that line and about the airport 's feature connection we wanted to emphasize that it 's important for that it what 's long-term medium to long-term growth for that connection is provided but I mean in terms of timetabling yes you know that I mean you haven 't really so we have no immediate constraint of this the quiz okay it is the questions so I 'd say in a zero beyond five years a little harder to so we could we could review it at the time of the next long term plan which was three years time yes I can 't think I but I would also like to say sorry I 'm there are there are smaller components of that as well that could be addressed and simple things such as maintenance of current storm water facilities livestock pets over the last two years in in the middle of winter there has been flooding quite evident on memorial avenue which is as you know a gateway to a city and we think it 's important that there 's the infrastructure that 's in the ground currently is well maintained yeah I don 't think enough people realized why it is Memorial f you know I would agree mmhmm yeah who had their hand up here item just threw out the promise or the assurance of a sinking line this is it specifically for your commercial expansion or because I mean the airport is the gateway is functioning now and it here 's a functioning solar storm water etc five years as you increase the commercial areas that that will obviously have to increase so I 'm just trying to establish as if I know so it 's not it 's not a it 's not a product of what you 're calling commercial development I just like to say the commercial development is intrinsically linked with what you might consider to be traditional core functions of the airport they go hand in hand but but no they 're really the discussions would have counseled have date back many years over well over ten years well before the development of Dakota park and that southeast precinct they 're really most of the trade waste or sewer that 's produced from the airport is passenger terminal related the more commercial activities that are now being developed at the airport don 't produce much trade waste at all there 's not a lot of they 're typically big sheds with a lot of stuff stored in them and a handful of staff that manage their stuff there 's not a lot of trade waste component all right thank you Oh yani around the flow you say free from health and safety issues associate with flowing and I was just wondering if you could just help me understand is this thing kind of a post-earthquake recent thing or was this happening for many years and when you say health and safety what are the issues that you 're actually talking about when the flooding becomes a problem on memorial avenue and traffic has to divert or whatever um puddles or flooding close to Orchard Road and around memorial avenue and there 's a pedestrian impact as well so that that there are a couple of in you probably all have at times skirted those those particles yourselves and wet conditions that immediately adjacent memorial avenue state highway one round about which is being probably being addressed in part as it and part of the state holy one project but the next intersection two or three somes allah memorial avenue typically on the on the left-hand side as you 're approaching that the terminal precinct and they they they flood they cause ponding vehicle swerve and equally they cause damage to the city well so is there a result of like earthquakes and a lot of recent development or is that something that 's been historic i look i would i would say it 's not directly earthquake-related that they 're there Sok Pich that need to be refreshed from time to time that 's that the nature of them they sediment builds up they need to be cleared out and allow for free a drainage I don 't think they 're necessarily a product of the earthquake I me no no at the surface area that the sumps are caring for is exactly the same it 's maroon if they just just raining or more 11 you yeah I think we might have to put a week notice through on cowlings been taking notes of these buns but yeah that 's that 's very good um after sorry a lot of mr. I wasn 't quite sure what frequency of the flooding likely a year ago we had mess of rangeland us help so he 'll frequent is that issue ever happening awesome ah it 's been it 's been um certainly couldn 't say I 've driven through I 'm coming back from Wellington as I used too frequently it has been happening for a month yes so certainly home last year everywhere was flooded but but no it 's much more frequent than just just those sort of one every ten year events Oh something yes yeah yeah but I think that will just make a note of that because I think that 's probably something that can just go on the work program without bothering the LTP sure great thank you very much thank you I 'm thank you for doing the Spitfire to love bears but far _"

them to go now they don 't have to go and put more money in the car and move it yeah but we come back hey shall we come back well I don 't how long are you gonna be away for oh you know well it 's not gonna make any different it 's okay yeah that they will definitely watch it online so but for people who are concerned about my absence earlier on because I am NOT well so it 's genuine that and that I will I will certainly all councillors have committed to watching the submissions that they must yeah yeah thank you well thank you we 're well aware through reading the newspapers and so forth that you 've had a deluge of input from all parts of the cup I don 't hurry up and therefore we 're not going to try to do is suggest and indeed promote a process which wouldn 't avoid having to be too explicit in the long-term plan because there is so much uncertainty indeed indeterminacy in the current situation that to attempt to lock down a particular policy while it may be highly desirable in terms of the requirements of the Act or or whatever is actually in any scientific sense completely impossible what you may have to do is simply put some numbers down and hope they come out or hope you can wriggle your way out of them when we discover that some of them may be wrong some of them may be right okay that 's government that 's politics but our point is that we should acknowledge the existence of unknowns including unknown unknowns in the situation the environment with which we find ourselves which is absolutely unique for apart from Napier 70 years ago any Christchurch City here and aim to seek a direction forward that actually gives us some wriggle room we understand from informal quarters because we are not lawyers that the local government act actually has some resilience in policymaking we don 't know exactly what it means but we are informed reasonably reliably that it exists I we invite you to investigate this or use it if you already know about it so those exceptional circumstances are what we want you to look into that possibility which evidently is there but we can 't find it so if you could please look into those because this process that we 've tried to highlight is because we think that there is an issue of purpose here which is being missed and the way we 've tried to identify that alongside this question about process is that the purpose needs to be to achieve the people of Christchurch 's dream not their nightmare and the the dream was summarized very eloquently by one of the NGOs 350.org recently where they said we want a stable livable climate renewable a clean energy enough food for everyone 's needs green jobs governments that listen to the hearts of the people New Zealand leading the way again being part of the solution we do not want the nightmare of more storms some people 's greed jobs tying up the mess tidying up the mess only government that 's only answerable to the banks New Zealand as a reluctant follower and international policy and then leave your part of the problem so that 's just one voice from young people and to put in front of you as identifying the purpose of this long-term plan and we 're just appealing to you to use those exceptional circumstances I 've already submitted today about the value of the NGO sector in labeling that conversation to continue and I think it 's important to note that the processes of engagement with the with people in the in the community through NGOs are quite different from the process of engagement with individual citizens so I think it 's a complementary process which really could be very fruitful for the council to develop and I must compliment you LeAnn and others in the in the council that I think we 've actually felt a great greater voice in the term of this council so more power to your elbow on that front but it does need 're wanting to say please take some way of dealing with the proceeds to achieve this wider purpose and I 'll just pass back to John to say the particular solution that we we just want to suggest basically that the process be taken seriously that we 've suggested the purpose that we 've outlined is clear and if you 'll forgive me the the long term not the long term plan but the long-term purpose and vision of Christchurch that we 've had before us for some time is too wet and a wooly to be very helpful and we are asking that if it actually is looked at and constructive rather more carefully with the wisdom of NGOs i 'm a member of a statutory forum which has been receiving information about what 's been going on all over the place we 've had a deluge of information from government and the commercial sector and virtually nothing from the NGO sector it 's been virtually invisible and we are asking that a major produce project be made available a public space to do it and only the City drive it but if it makes up make it available I think it could be incredibly useful and that 's precisely our time it is precisely your time but the number of submitters have come here to say that they want to form a partnership with the council rather than have us provide you know he 's been overwhelming and it 's been quite heartening actually because there really is a desire amongst communities to do things for themselves with support then just come along and say this is what we want yeah good and respect to you know and it 's so like respect as well as it 's like good yep yeah I know exactly what you mean we are pleased thank you I hope you don 't get a packing ticket right _"

updated it can can you circulate the update to people because it 's got her submission honor did you not get one no I thought it was put out yesterday anyone come and make yourself at home I 'm sorry that with the piles of papers that we have in front of us we we haven 't all seen this one but I have certainly seen it and I 've certainly read it so welcome good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity of presenting this is a pretty short presentation and just to make the initial point that I 'm making the submission as an individual I have I 'm not making any requests but making the odds suggestion my focus is on the shortfall of projected shortfall of 750 million dollars over the 2015 25 period the supposed rate increases and considered to be the local government set limit is not possible and other four scenarios listed in the consultation document only the sale of CCC assets appears as a practical means of meeting CCC 's capital needs a fundamental question relative to CCC 's predicament as can CCC 's capital shortfall over those 10 years be reduced by renegotiating the agreement between government and the previous council I possibly reducing the scale and cost of proposed new zealand government finance convention center till our government to perhaps increase its contribution to the cost of underground infrastructure repairs priests coping and or delaying the proposed sports authority agreeing that any cost increases on a share on shared projects are shared in proportion to those initially agreed upon as of now ccc estimates it needs to raise 750 million two meters capital shortfall resulting from the current agreement with government i do not have the knowledge to comment on the levels of normal expenditure capital or operating or the income projections hence the assumptions of 750 is needed from the asset sales source sources of the 750 million shortfall placed on the profit and profitability to fourteen appendix for none of CCC 's owned or partly owned companies have exciting profitability on a basis of profit to net assets Orien six point nine percent the airport 2.1 percent LPC is unknown because they have included an insurance payment as a profit which is somewhat unusual to kill city care 2.5% to Red Bus a negative one point one of the above only around the airport and fpl PC a pop it up here to offer our significant capital raising opportunities if the present Fiasco governing bus operation in and around christchurch could be sorted and the four or five bus companies merged then red box could present a limited capital raising opportunity just objectives of asset sales one ccc retained a significant portion of its subsidiaries equity after sale to the purchaser of the asset should have a successful and profitable record of operation within the relevant business the reasons the ejectors each of CCC subsidiaries listed above has an important role in the future development of Christchurch CCC must retain or should retain a significant say in the management and growth of these companies direction until the direction of these services subsidiaries is not strong and they operate as essentially independent entities with little regard to the owners interest I refer to City cares intent to enter the house building and its operation from Wilmington also L species apparent slow response the series of serious accidents apart from Orion which operates in a largely non competitive market none of us of series generates a satisfactory profit for ccc my further impression is that each of ccc subsidiaries has the potential for increased profitability where to from here each of the businesses ccc has to sell is infrastructure related I suggest the ccc identifies a company which has a strong involvement in infrastructure businesses and which considers has the potential to become an equity partner in and contribute to the upgrading of CCC 's infrastructure enterprises such a partner should have a proven business record in such as in such areas we experience as a partner and joint venture operation and have the necessary financial resources to enter into and to support growth in the joint venture companies worthless suggestion is to consider consolidating CCC care and red bus as mentioned before the inclusion of red bastards contingent on CCTV being able to own and control bus service operations within the Christchurch metropolitan area consent from the Sicilian and why Mac councils will be needed also a cause environment category at present ccc is balancing the gain of a potential gain of 750 million funds from the sale of some of the assets against the resulting increase in income from those assets however i am convinced there a significant potential to improve the quality of its subsidiaries and its own operations and if so the loss of income from the sale of equity could be appreciate it could be appreciably less than the shoe possible partner there will be a few possible candidates will be few possible candidates for a joint venture partner the one company stands out infertility here 's a joint venture partner and companies in each of the above business businesses Airport port electricity and gas and City passenger services I do not know if has an interest in two companies such as City care infant or in features annual reports to activities competence profitability and financial resources it speaks for itself in conclusion the parts i love CCC 's interests in its infrastructure Cecilia 's can produce substantial benefits for ccc by releasing capital and increasing the increasing the quality of those business I trust the above may be of some help no thank you to the opportunity to present our last comment is that I have no financial or commercial interest in fredonia I did read that nice so look thank you very much and of course we 're looking at the range of options including you know the idea that the overarching company CC HL is you know becomes the basis for a component of so down if that we if that 's the decision we need to make but thank you very much it 's a extremely helpful submission getting us to focus on on what the issues are and to draw attention to the return on our assets that we 're getting at the moment and the potential for greater returns so thank you very much thank you thank you now

    "text": "clear villains thank you sorry we 're running a wee bit behind schedule button I hope you found the other submissions interesting yes I did good thank you for having me everybody is so I 've been working at the bomb Lee community center for over 10 years now so I know the area very very well you may know it 's quite a low socio-economic area and you won 't probably find many ordinary people from bromley coming in here and making submissions so I consider myself a voice on their behalf I have consorted with quite a few of our groups we have all sorts in a play group all sorts of groups come in every week and a lot of them are either they 're just struggling with your own issues are not able to think big or they haven 't got the skills and so on to make a submission so I facilitated am sort of joint submissions and I have given out forms for them to do their own but I know that having anyone will help so yeah that 's why I 'm here I 'm just here to remind you of the the people the vulnerable people of Christchurch because i feel that a place is always about people first and not building us i have been a school teacher for many years and I know when I 'm looking at a school you know I 'm not looking at the how many computers they 've got I 'm looking at the staff and if they get on and if there 's a nice seats are well being this but I look for in a place and so sometimes you know a fancy boarding all our facilities in the world don 't make out for that and also want to come from the perspective just for a different perspective is like I know you 've got a big issue of the funding shortfall 1.2 billion i think i believe it is and you had to address it and I understand that and I 've had a look through all the staff and everything but I just want to sort of make a bit of an analogy with a family so say family was of those things you 're going to preserve one of those things that are going to go what 's important to you what 's you know and of course your children and people you know you 're going to keep things about tighter aren 't you and maybe not go out you know to dinner or whatever so I 'm just kind of thinking from that analogy and I thinking when I see some of the big projects they 're all very nice you know but some of the big projects I think well do we do we need them and I know you want to get tourists money and and so on but for me that ordinary people that love here in Christchurch come first and we 've got you know child poverty we 've got people without a roof over their head we 've got people every night trying to sleep in our car park and cars and things and a lot of them are going to the beach to sleep I know they celebrate New Brighton it 's always been a problem now there 's just absolutely beach don 't worry I won 't be here at night because I see this is not safe at night no I 'll go to the beach so I 'm seeing you know we see you know these people and I 'm very very concerned and then there 's people I know of who are worried sick because they 've got nowhere to go you know their house is going to the rental properties going to have to be fixed up through through earthquake damage they don 't know where they 're going to go they 're not but don 't know what they 're going to forward you know be able to afford so huge worries for people you know and for me the people come first because that 's what that 's what the city should be about and I 'm very proud of the Christchurch City Council for the past sort of community development you know Manny they 've put into Community Development and now under strengthening communities I think it 's wonderful and we appreciate the funding that we give from the council to run a soil it 's slowly perhaps being eroded even perhaps before the earthquakes and from about 2019 it 's slowly starting to be eroded the community development sort of funding and I would for me now is more important than ever we 're seeing so many people in need coming through the doors you know hungry so on and so on and some people don 't realize there are people in the city who don 't have two dollars you know two dollars a lot of money for a lot of people just to just to remind you of those people in they haven 't got a care or the haven 't_''_284.02 got a car that goes and so on and so it 's no good having a fancy facility over here oh they can go to that but they can 't they can 't get to it and they won 't go because it 's too expensive transport and so on it 's too hard when you 've got children for example qe2 was supposed to be the pool for the Longwood area that was too hard if you 've to qe2 and you 've got no chance for its not very you know to get on a bus and everything but it 's too hard right so it 's taken me probably about eight years to gain the trust of the people in the community so they 'll come into we we are so I 'm all for a little local grassroots community kind of jumped is not one big flash one down you know in the city or worry about so I 'm all for keeping these little nice little communities where we are supporting a lot of people mentally old people people with disabilities we 're supporting them if we go well they 'll be in the system you know they 'll be adding to the pressures of what the system and we are supported them to make their own decisions to learn some new skills and so on and a lot of them are getting into some paperwork now so we often hear volunteers and then they move through which is wonderful so I just and specifically for Bromley we consumed your concern about cuts to pool for the we were we 've been talking about school for many years along with Paul Wilson lemon pole and so we 've got a lot of fear a lot of young families with children and the area and I think they deserve a pole and they 're not pips going to be as as I see if they 're not going to make these submissions some things but that I mean this pulls over the north side and everything I feel like that we 've been must the Bromley community Linwood Braun the area has been must and I know it 's in the long term plan but I feel I would like to see it come forward I think it 's urgent because the cheap place where people can go you know three daughters or something for the kids and I know that council has made available some of the little local pools for Donna a swim and that 's been so popular and everyone 's been talking about it Doris well you know because that 's about all they can afford yeah so the pool would forward the little local parks and that when you haven 't got a lot of money those are the places you go and take your kids little parks and things and they are really well used in our area because we 've got a little playground near the center and its really well used and it 's free so that what impactful for example apparently is it sneering at some the end of its life and maybe is going to go after that I would like that 's a lovely little part I don 't know we wouldn 't Parkers and what I 'm row but it 's a lovely little park with a an Avery and just lovely trees it 's very special place and I would like to see that pull stay we sometimes would have our play group go down there from it 's a free trip you know the kids have a lovely time so I would like to see that saved yeah there 's a lot of stuff here but is it a peddling pool there yes yes I 'm talking about to solve hating _''_480.21 no no no no there 's not a lot in Bromley yeah we and we the brahmin community center is the only kind of social service sort of place on an IBM island before they change the bone yeah yeah and Bromley yeah it 's not a lot and when you actually look up the area of Romney there it 's not a lot just probably about you probably talked about maybe 18 and where we deliver our bulletins to about 1,800 households but there 's a lot of fam children and there are a lot of children a lot of young children and a lot of a lot of there 's a lot of young parents who have no support no Manny and and they 've got no family either and that 's hard that 's really hard when you 're young and you 've got little kids so that playgroup is very very popular after me groups are we supporting them yeah so just yeah just a voice for them or the other thing as the housing is very concerning to me too I believe people have a said to you know that people in Christchurch have not got a warm you know a shelter in a warm place love because i believe it 's probably a World Health Organization you know it 's a basic requirement and I think that we need to I 'm not saying it 's all the council 's thing but I think the council need to do what they can and we need emergency housing and we need it right now and I 've been going to a lot of housing forums the tenets Protection Association have been holding and things because I have an interest in it and to me that 's not enough being down that some things being done but not enough right now for the winter for these people because once they get out of that you know that they 're in a garage and there 's cuts in the garage thing it 's very hard kids maybe don 't go to school you know they 're you know they don 't get to score than anything you 've got this you know it just goes on and 're not going to go to school and there out there out of such mainstream society and that can happen quite quickly when they 've got no housing yeah so I think that 's a huge consumed for me because I think that is basic yes oh just that 's where I 'm coming from yeah I think that 's about it I thought I would really haven 't got time for questions because it 's but Andrew i 'll let you ask one I just there are other people waiting issue here yeah thank you and I 'll keep it brief you you opened your presentation by suggesting that you know Bromley 's a low socio-economic area and you wouldn 't expect that we 've heard too many people making submissions from bromley yes and so thank you for you know bringing the messages and concerns from that frequency to as today what do you think we could do to make of the process more user-friendly to a wider range of people so that people were more able to engage with it yes because you mentioned the way of so you know just getting out and going along and actually meeting them on their own tooth probably he is and you know just I don 't know like the mall and everything if you go to escape more you 'll find it 's quite different from other moves quite different you just gon visit a skate mall and walk around the area for long you 'll feel you you 'll see it yeah yeah answer as well injury I 'm solving thinking about this a lot and thank you we should have a year-round process it should be a continuous process of engagement so when they have the awesome wrongly carnival or fear they get you know hundreds of people going and yet we don 't take that opportunity so rather than ice doing it do you mean I 've sign up there karaoke oh just in terms about long term plan any plan because we don 't even taste I 'm sure they 'd love to do that a defective no but I I agreed that we need a better way of doing this engagement so there we including a skate during the period of the lead-up to the long term plane but it 's not an ideal process because it just about it really now that does need to be improved so but thank you very much for representing me and places everybody of Bromley _"

    "text": "360 trail Jeremy Taylor so you wanna use the oil use so I 've got along with me as well Colin Luke familiar face from minutes ago via papers even have a change of shirt actually but notice it is of course being another one of columns projects and wanted to give you an update on this in first of all met Amir and councillors we want to thank you for your support last year the project that you established to can establish the signs for the Christchurch 360 trail is almost complete and the work is progressing well Theus and we thank you very much for your support particularly one to recognize the hard work of the ccc staff here at banks and Linda Bean 's but also it 's really to note in this relates to something later in the in my submission about the notebook sport that we 're getting from the community Rotary clubs across the city joining up to support this and besides lanky research I mean to actually heaven the the Canterbury horticultural society as as a group is also a notable support from going to get we 're going to have a hundred and thirty something kilometer trail around christchurch and promote a healthy lifestyle and it will be an asset in the communities that it goes through and around it will promote the sorts of things that Colin 's been talking to you and deserve a couple of presentations ecology diversity heritage and the city 's brand it should be a attraction to visitors much like other established ones things such as the central tiger rail trail and overseas examples such as London 's kettle rain walk which is a similar sort of type of size as well as the much longer things such as the pennine way and epilation trail of course we 've got department constellations great walks as well which attract a large number of visitors each year but those are way out on the back blocks we 're talking here about something that 's right on your doorstep the goals of the Christchurch 360 trail lined very much with the sorts of things that you as counsel have identified as community outcomes in the long-term plan my they lovable city enhanced by its public spaces enhancing and building on the Garden City image to really sort of like enhancer to be the sort of eco-city that Canton has previously mentioned and hunts a unique bringing in our unique landscapes and biodiversity protecting them enhancing them and encouraging attractive environment in the city encouraging active travel walking and cycling and people actively been involved in their communities and this is where I 'll hark back to or really the involvement of the rotary end came to record cultural societies of course the authority with the parks and things intended access to places of scenic natural heritage culture and educational interest about one of the things that as a council you have got as community outcomes you want as a prosperous economy having Christchurch being a good place to do business and while it might not seen it necessarily off the right away the Christchurch 360 trail should be a catalyst for business and economy certainly if we can attract visitors into the city and things can be set up around that such as has happened with the Central Otago of the trails needs already right now under the activities and services that you have planned over the long term plan and a garden heritage and neighborhood parks you are of course caring for all of the things that are going to be real key attractions and they walk perhaps a addition a to z that would benefit the Christ 360 trail would be things such as the sign and marker maintenance and new supplementary signs that may be worth putting in with other trail so these things are currently not something which is allowed for and those signs are being handed over to us to look after and you know basically that we as project finishes but maybe they 're going to be right there in the parks maybe it 's something that the park people can look after but that would only be with your direction add some culture including heritage protection as one of the things that you 're already caring for and you 're already carrying for animal management including dog control which is certainly very important in areas in the reserves and things we certainly 's going in there but there are additional activities that could include the Christchurch 360 trail and the existing business as usual programs so things such as under the roads and footpaths you are wanting to have a walking friendly City and so it would be a good idea when these things come up to consider the Christchurch 360 trail when you 're painting with rope and such as NZTA take advantage of christchurch 360 as an asset to promote cycling for health and active travel when these topics come up you have events and festivals happening as this October and we 're going to be part of the 2015 walking festival which was a success last year and this year it 's going to be our unveiling we would like to be part of an annual event where we have a city city wide community event joining hands around the city and enjoying this natural asset you 've got an asset here for involving in education utilizing the Christchurch 360 in educational programs and you can take advantage of user and city promotion study promotional material on print web the city as an eco destination and use the cruise ships 360 is an example of that and collaborate with tourism businesses to take advantage of the opportunities around about the things like this at ringing tourism into the city certainly brings dollars into the local economy for each 100,000 mean we only need to convince 60 visitors a month to stay in each tonight to get that back and money back into the community of course it 's money back into the Christchurch economy not into the city council 's coffers we 've quite appreciate that at times so whereas the Christchurch 360 trail we 're not asking for any additional funding we just ask that the Christchurch 360 trail is used by you when your promotion the city and that you include it in business as usual programs so that it is just a thing a part of the city that you 're looking after because this essentially is no longer a project we want a an ongoing commitment by the city as needed for the sale a third of trail to do will please make this trail an asset and your promotions of the city and let 's see if we can find a way to include it within existing long-term plan activities it 's a an asset that you have to employ that 's going to be able to benefit from you know we leverage it for you know essentially a very existent it 's an existing asset to leverage and low cost in hopefully for some benefits to the city coming to the officials that you would like to hear for questions yeah he 'll thank you it was excellent I 'm just what I commend you for including sign and marker and maintenance but also new signs because our index one of the things for walkers and tramples knowing where to go and taking the right to net kind of thing so it 's a really good presentation thank you thank you at clean thank you I is a vmail pollen over this i think it obviously some tremendous opportunity unless even from a multi-sport perspective you 've talked about leverage we could work off that to help promote it and that respect I no questions but just you know information how long does it take to walk around it if you if you took it in about eight one day chunks take your eight days unless you spread those eight days with a bit a few gaps in between but you could probably if you want to do in smaller chunks do it and maybe 15 smaller chunks over a couple of weeks what if you but if you were doing it is a round trip mutate eight days if you including your overnight so if you 're going to try doing it in one go if you 're an ultramarathon runner you 'd certainly be able to do it in a day oh really but I mean not the diet sorry i just realized how silly that sounded have an ultramarathon amount of fitness to do it in here late but you okay see ya Paul haha well I think it 's a great project that the question I 'm going to ask is that I know it looks like connected to the coast of pathway uses a payment as you 're it 's not going to be completed by October so obviously it 's not continued on those things it 's a pathway and some of those pathways will be announced as the years go past this right it 's just using the existing trails in walk places I currently exist they 're using linking them up with existing Road reit working and end so all the things that are currently existing trying to and give to use without having sort of like cut new trails and things like that and over time we will improve it as we 're able to look as I supposes projects come online like the coast pathway this chances to enhance the experience we have for instance we were unable to at the moment go into the groins and then back out to the stop banks because the trails don 't exist we would love to do that one day we 'd love to have a better route through the story of the settlement points through the Nature Reserve what we 've been offered Robert overlong you brighter would be great so it would be changes were able to in the future that 's great look thank you very much um the drive is fried and thank you colin you 're contributing so much to our city thank you very much um bromley community center _"

    "text": "actually got one of my photographs from the pier I 've got beautiful sunrise photos I know we 're there April Mia Council thank you for your time today and my name is Blake whose and obviously you 're all aware of Paul 's and from the new Brian Business Association hopefully you are and i am the owner or co-owner of paper place near Brighton which includes the operations of paper plus Kiwibank and New Zealand posts I speak to you today is whether leading businesses of New Brighton and certainly one of the leading businesses to reinvest greatly in the area for the future I engaged daily with a large number of people who come to New Brighton and my brooch you considered a hub of the community firstly i 'm aware that some of what I 'm discuss will already have been covered and may have already had been answered unfortunately I was at work so you know I apologize for this and so give me a bit of leniency however all my points are vitally important and I 'm sure you would agree in light of an area that many feel the same first off in regards to the long-term plan I 'm greatly concerned at the lack of planning and resources placed for the areas known as South Shore cfd Brian north New Brighton and especially the key activity center of New Brighton these areas have long been undervalued and under-resourced and no true future planning has been put in place and enacted upon within the last 18 years to truly realize the ACA that this coastal community is the council must correctly invest lead and encourage others to invest as is your position as leaders of the city having visited other cities and seen the work and commitment that these councils have placed in similar areas to ours and the results from that commitment I 've always been disappointed with the efforts and resources placed towards hours now is the time to reverse that situation given that the LTP is a document planning for the next ten years of funding and resource allocation now is the time for the count show that truly cares for all of its population within its boundary firstly I and I appreciate this may already mean discuss darling this is an important link across the river and must be returned to full usability and enhance in this instance I suggest you have the perfect opportunity given the red zone available to place a new bridge slightly north as had been planned to deny the community the 14 of its assets in my opinion would consider broken promise given the assurances previously now to the lack of investment in public spaces in New Brighton as the council is one of the largest property owners it is your responsibility to lead others and invest wisely I appreciate that it is difficult with the fractured ownership of the properties in the area however true planning and resources were place if true planning and resources a place in the area then others would invest and follow in this case true planning is one of the real wishes here and reference this an example with the recent replacement of asphalt on two different occasions recently thus destroying the ground artwork costing thirty thousand dollars which was completed earlier this year this was not a has created a patchwork appearance this shows a true lack of care for the area another example is the need for replacement of convenience items such as rubbish bins and water fountains these issues relating to the road friends as well known and that 's how running aired that this is well overdue as to the water fountains some have been replaced but I wish to point out the lack of foresight given the choice of installation this lacks the commitment and the planning of the area with the resources and true careful consider planning in this area we could come alive as suggested in new brighton master plan i will point out the one on the left is the rubbish bin in new brighton the one on the right is certainly nowhere near us if it makes feel better that session in australian installation now this leads to my last point that there is essentially no funding allocated to the new brighton master plan I appreciate that this document has only recently been finalized however the lack of consideration of funding for this is of grave concern given that should have been placed into the ltb as has been allocated other mass plans for other suburbs around the city that 's full funding for this must be placed in the LTP this plan as well as the great work that has been done by the New Brighton business of land owners association gives a road map to a long overdue stage redevelopment of the new brighton area my passion for this area knows no bounds and there are many more points I could raise but i know many others who have spoken performing and others to come who are far better at discussing these points i can only hope that you at last hear the voice of the people of this area for the community spirit and feeling is so great in syria and specially feeling that it 's time for the council to value of these suburbs and its people 's this is your time to acknowledge the rights for the people of these areas to the same resources and care as the rest of the city don 't continue to penalize us from living and working exhalation like to open the floor to our two councillors of the ward to hear the efforts on how they feel about our resource level in the past 15 years no I think that that 's inappropriate and the reason is that actually right at the very beginning of the process I asked all councillors to confirm that they were here to represent the interests of the city as a whole they actually have to set aside the award interest that 's what the community boards come and submit on so I think it 's probably a bit unfair to ask people that haven 't been around for 15 years and their council positions to comment on previous councils as well so it 's the eyes dear family yeah and if anybody I 'm more than happy as the former MP for the area 's to tell you what my views that 's all hype hold tight to those as well I think that there is no question that the council has heard the the new brighton voice and we commended paul for doing something that had never been done before landowners and that has never happened before and the the disconnect between the land ownership and the building of the business owners has been problematic for a very very long time so we I think we see an opportunity to partner with new brighton and the way that hasn 't been possible before that and it 's certainly something we 'll be taking into account but do we have questions for yes David thanks Blair for your passion and interest in the area certainly share that with you with regards to the new brighton master plan although it 's only recently been adopted finalized do you have any ideas of how you would like to prioritize some of the works that are in the master plan what things do you think may or should be recognized before us I think that 's probably a bit of a difficult question of our answer because there with the lack of resources over the last 18 years it 's the same as Lewis Hamilton going into the pit stop you 're asking me which wheel would not like to change unfortunately the requirement 's fine and that we need everything unfortunately what if you had to select one of them first would you be looking at with the extension of warm air over the head of the public transport infrastructure or you towards or mind if I jump in here as well um Blair also sets on the executive of the new brighton business and landowners association and so what we talked about in the stage for the element platform is also starting with the STX and unity values and which I think we 've sort of discussed today and we did pitch in there as well without that stage development year by year which projects we saw coming out I 'm starting without their starting with starting with RM Avenue is the first one that the business landowners association touch and then moving on to marine parade then the pedestrian mall and then production of the Legacy Project I 'd agree that RM Avenue is a definite and also knit you know we need to have a road map we need to know that there 's going to be a next step going to be is it thus otherwise we get a situation where we put a peer in and there 's nothing to follow so previous master plans have always talked about starting at the beach and working in land what 's your response to that philosophy um i would start near the beach as the i see anything there 's a possibility for a possible Market Square and needs we need to include it we need to celebrate the fact they were right next to it that whole area needs to be developed and worth it respect to the regeneration is why are you talking about public or private spaces because private space is certainly from the for sure but public spaces and leave us a lot broader than starting from one end and working through I 'm sorry did you catch in here the head sorry most of it ok cool yeah I mean for the the private spaces is obviously vacant sections on the foreshore it makes logical sense to start on that end also bear in mind the floodplain to the west of us but for public side moving through to the other in my opinion thanks i think the the weight of submissions that have come in have certainly given them councillor clear direction and opportunity to go for i will give you a piece of feedback that we did give one of the other submitters in relation to the pages road bridge is that the reason that it 's being repaired rather than replaced now is that a repair will keep it safe and it will be monitored so it 's not going to be at risk but the advice that we have received is that replacing it now before we 've made decisions around the future use of the residential red zone land and also the crash yet city council roading network that 's going to apply in their area I mean if we move the stop banks further back that makes a huge difference as to where that bridges best located and how it serves as the entranceway so there 's no it 's not a question of I 'm not putting it on the budget because we don 't care about New actually this isn 't the right time to make decisions about it until we 've actually got that so we 've got on budget the money to repair it and that will be done under the school program the decision to rebuild it will be done under normal NZTA processes at the time that all of those decisions are able to be made oh absolutely I agree with it I just feel that the community needs to know that that 's here yeah and unfortunately I think that message may have been clouded you know there 's possibly not your fault I think it was clouded and I know it wasn 't my fault so thank you very much now I speak from my experience in Littleton which has suffered from some of the redevelopment issues that new brighton as suffered from perhaps in a slightly different way and i refer to the paragraph on page two of your submission where you say I appreciate that it 's difficult with the fractured ownership of the properties in the area however if true planning and resources were placed into the area approach there are some of us would say that we need to go beyond that and I think of what I 'm going to say in the context of the new development Christchurch there are some of us that would say that we need to go further by putting in place a framework to encourage amalgamation of titles mechanisms to incentivize developments and a more hands-on type approach what 's your view of that I would probably agree with that and is it there are some landowners in that area which I try to develop the area and we need to support them there is unfortunately some others that we know we prefer and that they need to be out unfortunately that 's one of those things and we need everybody working towards a the right goal if we need to amalgamate some of the titles down then that 's what it 's not strongly support those statements as well yeah I think that 's the way to go look thank you very much Blair for coming in and good to see you again I 've spent a lot of you say I 'm sure I will continue to do so but um _"

    "text": "thank you very much for what you 're doing with much appreciated to eat out here I 'll try not to me well I can imagine you 're all exhausted probably it was in it I think a number of us are coming down with something and it all started with Jamie I thank him oh really um yeah he 's infected all of us so no this it 's not sure I 'm being mean to do that but Charlie 's fine he he actually here she struggled to coming out of us my work here is done but anyways yes so it 's not a it 's not a lack of interest or wearing us with the submergence these are fantastic I mean this this is what we 're here for actually this this makes me want to get out of bed in the morning us hmm go for it I wondered whether a run you know and benefit the help of a certain team or if I 18 spent my 10 minutes doing an exercise routine with a moving along so I 'm here representing the Christchurch are we umbrella group for lots of groups hundreds of volunteers involved and conservation environment work and importantly 54 ASM depending on which kind of surveys use of citizens from the city council 's own citizens surveys want more native plants and wildlife in the neighborhoods this is not necessarily reflected in decision making and you know policies or the sort of conflict in policies in the sea this group is loosely existed for a couple of decades you know we did support and the council achievements by debussy strategy and also importantly to save a lot of money being wasted which I see all the time we 're the eyes and ears for weed and pest surveillance and importantly we support a balance of cultural and heritage layers we 're not zealots wanting to hella Blake eliminate all the colonial heritage we 're there to kind of see that all of those layers are fully represented and celebrated in the city and this will serve you know the city 's image and its marketability internationally much better than believe so there 's an army of people out there who weeding and really again and there 's in the previous presentation wanting sums of recognition and a voice to be able to debate and have dialogue with the relevant council staff to actually work together and problem solving together and you know this press suggest some and promotes a bit of a culture shift to one that is very Pro are terror or Cantabria Lakota and all its dimensions and projects that brand locally and internationally and importantly Christchurch is a reservoir of lost heritage from the plains fortuitously so having some sort of input into problem solving and you know working through some sort of formal channels that gives some status to these discussions and you know just highlight a few particular examples here things that one sees traveling around the city which represent enormous waste of of city resources you know unprofessional maintenance regimes where trees rather dies we lack of water or their ring back through core application of weed eating techniques you know the whole safer parks thing is a very simplistic policy that needs to be reviewed because it looks all very nice and pretty a whole lot of ended outcomes including increased wenis such as as occurs here that stinking IRS and an IV and stuff will kind of close those areas and then that will create another sort of management problem which costs a lot of money and you know weeds are a significant problem for the country and Canterbury and Christchurch you know we love to watch The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings seeing those armies sort of sweeping across the Mackenzie country but actually behind there is a sinister another sort of effect not just the orcs or whoever it is but the but the march of the wild in conifer pines and you know within the city with advanced potential that 's happening with conifers but right across the city in the country you know Sycamore there 's a significant time bomb and the landscape and you know the science shows that graph there on the bottom right that there 's an exponential growth of these weed problems and if we don 't knock these on the head and maintain funding for biosecurity you know we 're in something unrecognizable something that 's more recognizable in the northern hemisphere and we also need again you know this requires some dialogue can 't kind of deal with all the issues here but we needed to sell some of the myths that I know that you hear about the use of native trees for streets you know we just need to plan and supply for you know bigger trees being supplied by the nursery and and then apply a knowledge of ecology for the placement and maintenance of these things and you know Auckland which has a you know more bit um beneficence sort of environment in which to grow a greater range of native trees shows that this can be as widely accepted in other parts of the country and there 's a whole range of species in museum christchurch and Cantebury you know which quite suitable for streets and public places not just that what I call the green fluff you know little testicles and sedges you know which have a very short life and make Harvey in any impact but our noble trees and shrubs and here would monitor ribbon would hotter where clouds would put a wet of the the marble lead and he now oh by and hoe heavy and there 's of course lady Isaac so proudly stand in front of one of her natural cocoa trees out on the Canterbury Plains and then there 's a whole range of other things matter kakatiya money to poor kaka raw who do all of these things are large trees or tall shrubs very suitable for you know a Canterbury and Christchurch environment in which would make an enormous difference to the visibility of of nature and bringing up the balance of indigenous heritage alongside our colonial and important heritage and for those of you who say there 's no color and our native flora give me a break there 's a wonderful color in and not perhaps so much in the flowers but and the fruits and in the general textures and song of our environment and importantly those fruits are vital and nectar a vital to the viability of our natural wildlife and particularly our bush birds are honey eaten and fruit eating bush graph shows that all of the places where Bell birds are found in ER and a sample around South Christchurch are in the bushy parks and reserves and none at all in the kind of conventional parks which you know just got quite steer our rows of deciduous trees with none of those food resources necessary to support those native wildlife so again requires joined up thinking and partnership with unity to produce some of the result and don 't forget you know all those little things to the funghi and the insects and there 's some wonderful creatures out there in the city I often point out and people never realize this in Christ juices as many native plants growing wild as there are in our national parks and you know we 're hugely under represent and under market this as an important feature of the city and you know this also fits within that sort of broader landscape that 's of spatial dynamics needed to support wildlife that moves from one stepping stone to another across the across the landscape and feeds in different parts of the city sort of regular intervals and we know the kind of exec don 't dimensions of what those patches need to be and how far apart they need to be in order to achieve that ecological integrity but importantly it also interacts with people that provides the right level of visibility and legibility being able to see the stories in the land and of course it also feeds into the health and well-being and placemaking of our communities and I can 't go past without mentioning the important component towards one of these pages as the proposed even otro carro eco century or by tucka d as it 's been coined now in conjunction with the night ahoo which is really one of the linchpins to achieving these kind of viable presence of nature in the city but importantly adding value to divide abuse the m to the nature experience in the city category is the largest population center in the country that doesn 't have the human experience of our rare and endangered iconic native species as illustrated there and and you know we desperately need this not only for raise awareness and in our own own community and also to market this is part of an eco city brand for the city and so this is really what adds real value to the city and also to the red zone of the city in the future well I can 't I 'd like to just also mention an example of how you know these components can fit within you know our conventional city around quite small space as some of you who may have been to the LFE flower show a couple of years ago may have seen this exhibit which I was involved in designing the pocket park that was that concept was originally conceived by staff at the City Council here and part of their initial effort and visioning for the city providing you know green lungs small spaces and health and well-being with all these of different elements all in this case crammed with in the you know a small space team by 10 meter square so there 's lots of opportunities not only the big spatial landscape scale but also write down to the fine recommendations that come from this is to give it fit to the formal recognition of the crisis spider this partnership and this isn 't the first time I 've asked for this but I really like to happen this time and I should meet you at this gas and had established an initial step towards doing this and I look forward to that being sort of taken in the future with regular engagement meetings with relevant staff and to provide an exemplar for other species partnerships as was referred to in the previous presentation thank you very much thank you I think it 's probably at the two minutes I can 't see but look so there isn 't time for questions on this one but I think actually seeing that the photographs and and hearing your presentation linking up one before I think we 've got all but a pretty clear message of where we are the submission lies and sneaking feeling that there might be a very strong support the people waiting on you know it 's just but think you Collin I 'm sure that there will you can thank you very much and could invite simply a hughes from paper plus new brighton to come forward _"

    "text": "and christchurch creative networks professor kins drama and column mute I think you 're a doctor aren 't you Khan sorry you 're a doctor aren 't you Oh am I giving you a doctorate yeah yeah yeahs it one of those it 's just that if kids gonna be a professor are you better be what you are here on the common the common person a common facing presenting the the full spectrum I 'm technically allowed to use the title honorable and doesn 't seem to fit me either right welcome thanks for the opportunity we represent the Christchurch creative network we were established to begin with to engage with your resilience management team we 've got a much broader aim though as a catalyst for the future of Christchurch in all manner of different ways we represent a very broad range of expertise there are 15 50 of us and we 're all very well-established people some of us beyond established are to me and so we bring together a great range of abilities and interest but our and all manner of different political persuasions but our I chair this group but the guiding force is Colin so he will speak from now on thank you ok so we 've got two broad recommendations which are outlined in our paper first relates the community engagement in the second to integrated decision making in order set up systems to future-proof the city so um as the first slide there shows or should do yeah we also familiar with the issues facing the city some really sore wicked problems there but despite this of shock and and donor fatigue represented by the community and we 're all feeling that there 's a huge ground swell of goodwill that to be tapped into and people that weren 't wanting to contribute to the future solutions there 's a whole range of modern approaches to engaging people and this first recommendation relates to how we can best achieve participatory democracy empowerment reciprocity and inclusiveness within the city to project to co-create solutions to many of the problems that we 're sort of placing and I guess the point here is that ten minutes is not long enough to deal with the mediated you know working groups that produce results co-produced results we 're not going to satisfy a large success of the of the community and it 's pretty soul-destroying turning up year after year you know making submissions representing you know you know a large body of people without knowing where it goes or housing process and decisions you know poor decisions tools sort of appearing before so getting you know those interested groups inside the tent to have ongoing discussions I think there 's a critical message here so you know building this with people there 's over a dozen centers of higher learning or one honor in the city and around the city there 's large numbers of community groups dealing with all matters of kinds of activities and interests I kind of highlight some of the the broad sort of categories of those umbrella groups if you like and so our proposal it 's really about establishing what I called a partnership Accord which is to apply these best practice mediation facilitation methods for an inclusive problem solving and co-creation of solutions rather than czar problem finding you know it 's a multidisciplinary way and this would requires a you know a mutual relationship between the City Council and interest groups and of course building on some of the successful models that already exist out there you know like some that I 've involved with a travers with and Trust and so on and also our own engagement with the resilience management team way they 're sorry and by doing this I think the city not only can provide leadership to its own people but also nationally and internationally you know we do have some cred with the New York Times rating the city you will familiar with that and you know it 's a lot of the sphere out there in the greater world I think you know we 've got an opportunity here to kind of show some ways forward and how we can move the city forward and therefore provide a model to other people facing similar sorts of problems so our first recommendation then is to review established policy and international best practice regarding the rules of engagement and to support us a of approach and establish sure that 's a partnerships accord and I 'll mention some examples of that in the next presentation such as the Christchurch creative Network relationship with it his management team so I 'm just to give an example of the kinds of issues you know one of the important thing about cohesion is having some unity of purpose and unity of attitude and and mission if you like for the city and to achieve some sort of joined up decision-making that can be you know to which if we don 't do that precludes opportunities for example you know going full steam ahead rebuilding the city precludes the opportunity to create what we call here these sight lines of life and unity to reconnect all the different faiths and cultures and interest groups and tongue of the city you know the media loves to kick us in the guts the beings of conservative and bigoted we need to Carlos make a very firm stand against that kind of thing you know for example that recent viral attempt that sort of putting down an Indian with his know the Facebook kind of went crazy with all sorts of hate messages and it was ur this was associated with Christ Church and the media around the world you know pick this up we 've somehow got to turn that around and be a much more sort of cohesive city okay so the second main point is about joined-up transdisciplinary problem-solving which also touched on but you know it 's even for you know science institutions like the one that I represent all belong to have difficulty in grappling with integrated research because we tend to be much you know the whole society is geared towards you know fragmented and disparate kind of decision making and it 's more in some ways it 's more costly to bring a lot of people together to do more integrated decision making but in the end the results are going to be better and will generate sort of cheaper outcomes so you 've all probably heard about triple bottom line and the various sort of subsequent manifestations of that and yet it was never really implemented you know triple bottom line stood issues and also the environmental issues but generally you know those last two things tend to get kind of like secondary and only could have come into the picture after the real decisions of be made so it 's important to cull reestablish that sort of principle so the recommendation here is to adopt and develop the partnerships Accord which I mentioned which is the sort of means by which to achieve this joined up thinking and to achieve formal recognition for those umbrella groups and to have regular standing meetings or Hui to work through these complex problems and partnership between the council and the and those individual interest groups and the interest of implementers have joined up triple bottom-line thinking as a kind of a major culture shift it 's got to be kind of like lead from the top and and allowed to allow the sort of grassroots to build these ideas up from the bottom as well and sort of meet somewhere in the middle with some sort of create a constructive outcome and one of the means of achieving this is going to be two to more affordable runs on the board lots of some creative little solutions to how to move the city forward to make it more sustainable and to make it more commercially viable to sort of build from small beginnings well we have some big elephants in the room like climate change and sea level rise and you know some of these complex issues that need you know this have joined up thinking but we do have some successful runs on the board or at least tires on the on the track which are about to be launched in the new spring the christchurch 360 trail previously known as the perimeter trail so this has been you know a reasonably successful interaction between the the the people promoting the sort of concept as a way of lifting the city spirits and generating some sort of service economy and and the city council planning staff pulling together mmm it does also highlight however the sometimes the different departments of council not working together and you know how much better it would have been if all of the relevant counts of staff and and spent some time problem-solving rather than problem creating so there is an opportunity for improvement there so finally the christchurch created network has been working with council as i mentioned with the resilience management team and we seem to be so quite well engaged there we 're providing critique on the resilience plan putting up innovative ideas and network synthesis we have expertise and this collaborative learning and co-creation i think that needs to be sort of brought into the picture how to actually go about implementing those recommendations and recognizing that a resilient city of the future has got all of these different elements cohesion sustainability sense of place according to the st respect to hospitality hilton inclusiveness and all of these things need to be sort of brought together in a much more integrated fashion in order to produce that transformation in the city of the future so that 's some all I 've got to say I can 't see the time so I don 't know what I think you 're pretty much there but gosh I 've just agreed with absolutely everything that you have so my question is how can we make this work with you in like we had a witness emotion from a smaller pacifica group we were saying the same thing and this is obviously a much broader level so i guess here well well it 's matter of your time like this as experts in the field too and I guess our time at a guess what the government 's royal representing Kelly Kelly duty hmm well that my needs presentation is about crisis vitamin C partnership which is one example these umbrella groups that represents you know a particular interest group I think it 's a matter of identifying all those different interest groups we 've highlighted some of those in the presentation and then looking at means of engagement and some sort of formal process that has some regular ongoing dialogue between you know the relevant council staff and those groups I think the point is we we 're very keen to make contribution along the lines that colin has suggested we prepared to make the time we just need to have depth at to be facilitated know what 's happening otherwise thank you yeah look yanny even um there 's a wonderful picture on page two of your life I kind of was just wondering where you where you got it from and you know how much you 've talked to the government and Sarah about some of those aspirations because clearly when you look at that central city it 's quite different to what we 're actually getting yeah well originally I hear this idea that would be done ground me but as the kind of city gets blocked in and you know all sorts of problems with property ownership and so on we one has to kind of look at an elevator sort of position you know so it takes you to a view of you know the Basilica I mean there 's been so much focus on Christ Church Cathedral which is fine right in the center of the city there but you know there 's so many other significant polymer of the city that all need to be brought into their fold and to and to show that the city is unified we value all of these contributions and to me this is covered one way you know of perhaps achieving there but to answer your question we haven 't spoke all this I 'm sorry oh yes government there 's been no mechanism to you might you might look up google that burnt good among who 's actually in Aucklander from germany and he 's with me jovial books one resistance resistance to resilience and the other one bout transitional cities he 's someone that actually the council should bring down his part of our network you know a forum you know involving him he 's got some great ideas he 's a he 's a very well connected guy he was an independent review of the IPCC report for example so he 's internationally well-connected and got some some great ideas is an architect oh we mean we 're obviously got a wicked problem because we 're located where we 're located we 're on a coastline we 're facing the same issues that the rest of the countries facing the rest world 's facing that live on cosine so we deal with natural hazards how we adapt how we you know sort of live with nature given that we can 't actually stand on the beach and hold back the tide I think someone tried that before and door yeah so is that the sort of wicked problem that you would see us elaborating on and I 'm you know it 's a matter of you know I was drawing some deep breaths here you know because so many people affected and you more familiar than I am of all of the problems associated with those eastern suburbs and you know nothing one can 't_''_1021.199 be precipitate in action and one needs to have you know short medium and long term plan and that for example any significant infrastructure that 's built you know represents you know the expected lifetime of that environment and you know it 's a matter of than monitoring the environmental change to see which trajectory we 're on because all this uncertainty about furniture so all of all of these things but I mean that 's that 's very heartening actually because I 'm beginning a consultation on the natural hazard strategy we had a submission from he can yesterday who said that they could work with us to slow that down a bit that there isn 't a rush to deal with these things we 've got the district plan chapter being notified the final element of it at the end of june and i just feel that there 's just too much for people to take on board all at once the district plan review will deal with the immediate issues in terms of the natural hazards chapter but that burger long term but a work I think it doesn 't have to start immediately I think it could create more distress in the community than actually serve our interests as a as a whole community because we 've had the odd person come before the committee of you said you know my personal interest is more important than how that reflects on the rest of the society but you know when you 've been through a disaster and you know that actually the price for poor planning decisions is that everyone shouldn 't ignore put it their way so not thank you both very much and and I don 't know buddy to stay for Collins present at collin you 're up next aren 't you damn yeah oh no it 's okay thank you very much _"

    "text": "Adam welcome Adam hayward from dancing physical theatre trust welcome Adam thank you go two minutes you pretty much know the rules i 'm thinking say no clapping you can do it my brothers I thought about getting water to a dance routine to kind of know okay as I must just say congratulations on making it this far actually I won 't TT you over the edge and just to send things into that a chaos and you can have had me please chance with a blank check to be preferable and deputy mayor councillors thank you for the chance to talk to our submission and I 'll spend about five minutes if I can just going through it and then take some questions if there are any I 'll just leave and it gracefully sashayed out of the room and we we undertook a bit of a SWOT analysis and the kind of identified three areas that came out about SWOT analysis so the summary of that was looking at the strength from a dance and performance perspective so the strengths we saw is that there were more well as attending performances Christchurch is now home to what is arguably the largest dance vessel in the world of half the club we just said it per capita bit really quietly we have a unified sector which seems from the same hymn sheet when it comes to lobbying for the role of dance community professional educational have an equal footing which is really important partnerships outside the centre know to be in health and recreation fields in collaboration with other arts disciplines and a new building the performance move from centre is planned as part of the Metro sports facility the weaknesses our new building if it doesn 't get built or if it does go ahead will it be large enough if it doesn 't go ahead there 'll be an off almost a total lack of purpose built space for the art form outside for a few high schools and private dance studios the retention of our young artists and how the use of temporary transitional space for creative imagination continues to be possible once the permanent is back the opportunity to a world first partnership between center the Christchurch is use a significant centre for dance activities across education community professional disciplines the continued pioneering of new approaches to multi-district partnerships and even more collaboration between arts organizations both at a practical and a project level I must apologize I was due to be at both the Christ child so audience development and the arts voice submissions but wasn 't able to make both either I 've of them due to time table those are two perfect examples of the partnerships and collaborations that have resulted post-quake threats art of the performance we 've been sense doesn 't get built danza sleep research organizations disappear due to the lack of venues and poor significant decrease in revenue or available funding you only have to look at the announcement from created new zealand yesterday around their funding curtains due next year to sort of know where some of that is going to come from that there 's no suitable performance space for dance included either an IE a black box space either as part of the performance movement center as part of the performing arts precinct or in-kind level in three areas we kind of see are looking at the community grants as outlined in your activity management plan on page six you cried the answer vital to a thriving Christchurch as he 's increased to partition eight participating recreational activity so we see dance activities as a crucial means of delivering leads and they should be continued to supported the way you currently do both through strengthening communities and through the creative community scheme as well as other resources are available but for the last few years funding for those organizations has been on a year-to-year basis and in terms of development and delivery of large-scale projects that take months to plan the ability and this is proved a stumbling block however the ability to leverage the resources available has resulted in a large turn return on relatively small investment and seeing many organizations I was included thrive in difficult times we encourage the return of contestable multi-year funding for community organizations as part of the current funding streams that exist and we also urge the retention of those funding streams we won 't however encourage the draft where it says the sports and recreational organizations provide opportunities for participation we encourage without being menu to say sports recreation and arts organizations provide opportunities are tissy patient reason for this amendment being that the 60,000 people who came across our organization last year nearly fifty percent were active participants in events and all opportunities that we ran through workshops programs master classes community projects this with the many professional dance groups who teach community dance classes on a weekly basis is a vital delivery mechanism for increased participation of physical activity within our community with dance recognized that a recreational level by sport Kent bye-bye support New Zealand and in fact John fazail actually admitted that with the performance or even Center being built as part of the Metro sports it would actually increase participation across both are both both forms in relation to events and festivals we acknowledge the tireless whether the team do in delivering and development within the City Council and it 's very encouraging to see that and the fact that quote events have an impact on the community an economy that need to undertake work needed to understand the quote worth of the event sector to the Christchurch both economic and social as echoed by the arts voice presentation we made to council last year of which I would just like to quote from that meeting on the minutes of that meeting on the fourth of December and because I know woman forgot to quote this at the arts voice but I think it 's relevant to this as well so point-to-point 1.1 the council recommends to ensure that the IELTS continue to proactively contribute to the rebuild of Christchurch you can 't meaningfully with our communities accepting the Arts voice offer to work with the council central government and others to make these in things happen in a proactive way that combines strategy advocacy funding and continued support to action Thank You counselor but that wording and we look forward to the meeting that we have to develop that with you and we also highly do support the development of annual event strategies that one on page 2 of that activity management plan and coupled with this specific to our be viewed as living documents not first we strongly endorse the key change laid out on the table 2.1 on page 5 stats of the draft around quota long-term commitments to event organizers and them o vents so whilst to acknowledge the need over the last few years that events have had to sistent difficult times on a year-to-year basis this doesn 't allow for long-term planning of major activities within events if I give you example the 2012 body festival when we launch that festival withered while the disco and new brighton pier two and a half thousand people turned up that was the last year of a three-year funding agreement that we had with the city council we haven 't been able to replicate an event of that scale because the timing of our event and the announcement of funding decisions results in the fact that we here the first week of august for a festival that 's due to start in the third week of September so we encourage the notion of a multi-year funding agreements both for both festivals events as well as her to commit know is some concern although i did find out this morning that one of the reasons for the inflated figures on the last page of the activity management plan for 2014 and 2015 is due in the budgets for festivals and events is due to quickly world cup and fifa but we do know the decrease in funding available for festivals and events as outlined in the activity management plan and yeah i still think there is a decrease there even though we are those two major sporting events have taken some of that money into account the final issue is around facilities and in the viewer of us that performance movement center as part of the metro sports facility is still vital the argument the sauce itself since share an idea it led to the inclusion of it into the city council 's plan with a tagline budget of 17 million it included the performance movement center in 100 day blueprint server developed and it continues to be included as part of the facility as negotiations between council and crown continue we wish made the following submitting relating to metro sports as a purpose-built structure of a dance circus and physical theatre as usage demand evidence is the need for it is an art space within the facility not a shared space facility that needs are vastly different between the sporting codes and between the arts codes that would use that space if the blackboard components them as part of that original proposal is not to be realized as part of the construction and planning then the need for a black bowl performance space within the central city is not diminished this black box performance space was highlighted in the ministry of culture and heritage report that Craig Cooper prepared as an essential lacking venue within the central city and it 's actually provided for by the performance movement center we also submitted the management structure for the performance movement center is developed in consultation with the sector to ensure the needs identified in the first hearings that education professional education or education professional community all have an equal or have an equal voice it 's also we also encourage that it 's celebrated as a rare opportunity of collaborate on mon ously if you look at the performing arts precinct is currently explained in the public domain the smallest facility available for community high reaches of theater space will be the James hey a thousand seats you 'd have the town hall auditorium at two and a half the James say a thousand and three as it was sure where the three teams came from third order 1300 called theater with limited public access rehearsal rooms for the CSO and a recital room within the Music Center which would not be usage suitable for art forms mainly other than classical music so that 's kind of about it in terms of our submission and I 'm happy to answer any questions to that and thanks a lot of time thanks hear them and I do apologize for not being here at the outset I 'm I figured you were just avoiding i 'm actually not remember i 'm not actually a hundred percent today and i 've been taking my time so red quick on adams he left for second floor done in terms of the James have say about a 700cc that would be suitable for dance there is a large contingent of voices in this city that encouraged retention of the auditorium and the gutting of everything else including the remodeling of the James I to a five to seven hundred seen theater when this document was presented to the community last December by woman Marnie at a council meeting the comment the response to the question it 's too big was what we could just not open the sir that 's not the solution this farm is going soon so yeah absolutely a five to seven hundred seat theater would be absolutely essential whether that could be a black box flexi forum space would be amazing if that black box wasn 't built as part of the movement center however also the need for a fixed and but there are remote control retractable seating units now that can go from a dark space to precise for 4 15 12 minutes so the historic tradition of retractable seating being financially in time restrictive ever thing of the past there are examples as a company in Switzerland go to any configuration within a very short period of time and so it becomes a much more cost-effective thing tonight thank you well thank you very much and even though I didn 't hear the whole of your submission it 's good to see you thanks very much _"

    "text": "it would clap you hi Edward sorry ed is it sorry we spent Stu sports inc welcome thank you deputy mayor and councillors for giving me the opportunity to speak today we 've submitted Arab submitted and what we 're wanting to speak about is one the submission we 've stated that there is a lack of lack of suitable fit for purpose facilities around sport particularly in the communities where they are needed and the lack of facilities is an inhabitant Sport and Recreation growth it impacts on their multiple organizations from regional sports organizations to clubs on the air capability to deliver appropriate service levels to the members into the wider community Westminster sports has been working over the last few years preview earthquake and post-earthquake on building facilities or planning to build facilities and various scenarios and various locations and I think given the that there are some possible solutions to the environment of the errand at the moment we had time and many other major constraints we would dedicate for and and think that it would be wise to plan and construct smaller maybe four core that Council and others should be considering sprung design prefabricated type facilities as these also provide potential for economies of scope and barrels are innovative they are cheaper to build and the construction time frames are much shorter than the conventional bill and you built three to six months and with reduced costs it is more likely to be able to be sustained and managed through public and private partnerships it was less risk with lower capital investment needed I mean that 's what we 're talking about an hour proposal or in our submission as an organization where our sport club partnership which is a multi sport club a collaboration we have twenty six hundred members across 8 sports and apart from supporting those sports and those members in the club environments we also provide Cuba support services to a cluster of local schools we provide sport based holiday in community programs our motivator is to get young people engaged in sport and obviously facilities would enable us to achieve those goals thank you very much indeed any questions Colin cute and you showed us the sprung designs before over a pool or something would you be able to take it down and summer and feedback in the winter those the beauty of the spring design and I 'm not an expert that we 've spent a fair bit of time researching it is that they are practical when relocatable so in an example of a particular facility was developed and built and put in place and over time it didn 't work it could be essentially packed up put on a truck and moved to another side it 's a prefabricated design and essentially locks into a concrete pad do they come in like various sizes I do thank you sir does it say canadian-based company has been going for over 100 years there 's a 135,000 installations around the camp around the world at the moment and they provide whether it be casinos military installations mining facility sports facilities school facilities church facilities they cover the whole gamut it 's a practical solution to covering large basis another question if I made see how many courts would you get inside a large one well that at the would be approximately a hundred to 110 to 120 meters long by 42 meters which enables you to put for international size courts and in a building and a plus it also gives you opportunity to have officers fitness centers auditoriums if you build it big enough and long enough et cetera so a lot with the girls they 're flexible when they can be built to to speak then what was the cost of that it and the research we 've done and in our plans we 're looking at a five-million-dollar cost for a 4-quart plus facility thank you very much clean and then Dave well thank you mine we should probably looks quite silly now ed having you just said that I was just going to ask around kind of comparative 2 square meter costings with you know with what say council may build it you got any dizzy again the per square meter cost comes down to how you speak that facility I guess the beauty of the spring design is that the operational costs are a lot less in terms of it was the next the materials used don 't require the maintenance that conventional builds do so there 's a lot of means of scale using the technology again you can speak it out as high spec or as low spec as you require so I think that you know that has appealed to community-based organizations they don 't want to build a you know a fever international basketball stadium I want to build some courts either your kids can play sorry thank you Dave sorry so thank you look I 'm very familiar with the sprung concept I 've actually met with people from Canada as well but Westminster sports were not sure whether you still out looking at a development in conjunction with the marshland school route is that still going here yes we 're still working with the Ministry on plaintiff is that have you actually committed to sprung edge yet for that we haven 't no I mean what we were still working as I said mr. working through details with the ministry and we need to throw some of those matters first before we can commit to a bill this may eventuate if again if things progress in a positive way we 'd like to be building or have a bill have a facility in place next year because I think there is some huge potential for that sprung facility for a number of other sporting complexes around the city so it 'll be great to see one actually up and running she 's thank you thank you there 's no more questions thank you feeling about to date come in for you Tom _"

    "text": "Williams sorry no we got equi jam here and any sorry if it 's you guys sorry have I got the wrong man oh I 'm short notice on behalf of three and Colleen nine it 's so good yes welcome to deputy mayor and councillors brick night is out of the country at the moment my association vacuole and as owner and director of armitage williams we built ecuador at least 1988 it 's operator there 's a very successful private indoor pool development and Brett and Colleen are still inherently involved of senior submission and I 'll just keep my summary quite brief they the proposed new pool the limit Parker 's the mr. point that they are opposed to one the direct competition with their own pool that 's within two kilometres of aqua gem which is situated met Catherine Street and the wood and Brett makes the point that they 've provided learn too strong and casual Lane swimming for 27 years I met that environment and serving East Christchurch I think Britt sphere and I know he 's talking for City Council for some time developments built throughout the city that the general commenter Brits he 's probably in a pretty strong position to make this comment having been associated with swimming in Christ route for 30 years and also as a national coach the financial impact he discusses of the second page of his submission I notice he refers to the decision to build a Pullman number day I appreciate its only a proposal at the stage give you some idea the nailers are proposing to extend the existing pool and have a resource consent to do so to place a another learn to swim pulled on the existing site in casual street construction costs for that would be about 2 million dollars and that would then give them the capacity to offer Lane swimming to the public and that is what the naylors proposed when they talk about a collaboration or my view public-private partnership of private facilities linking into a community need I 'm happy to field any questions can I just have the first one witness that was also consent being sought yeah that was granted i think in the last community board as part of that process i think it was 2013 so is it going ahead you 've exeunt into thank you no thank you all the other people so Paul Klee and Ellie thanks for the submission and realize you 're not the person who is you have the submission here but the question that you talked about lane swing for the public yes would you be capacity sort of been here 24 this normal swing the kids can come along jumping pool and play around out of the line I don 't think so no but often we get told by the committee they want to pull for the community we and we talked about the other supplier idiot but we have told by autumn use about their opal in their own area yes and now it 's never been a play pool and I think their focus is on learn to swim and fitness swimming but would exclude free public sessions where people like jumping in and generally having fun which of course it 's a media company has built foreigner a pool and jelly Park know grand condom center this facility for all of that but you 're talking about a probably a 20 million dollar development a lot of 2 million dollar pressure thank you yes yeah thanks we 're just looking at pause so I guess we 're going to read by the two million billion yeah let me to say the metro facility what facility didn 't go he would you still conclude that there is an oversupply of pools or balls proposed in the cities for instance we will stir the Citra there 's the YMCA building just here yes if you are these these are different pools know without the metro support to a do yep still conclude there 's an oversupply I would think that it would be approaching an oversupply yeah Ellie I 'm intrigued by that comment about oversupply and I think it 's really important to that you differentiate between that point that you 've just made the deal with regards to swimming and space because the submission talks about an oversupply of water space and I 'd question it but my question for you is Centennial edge we 're pull dozens of school pools I mean what is that based on yeah well i think i know the nailers in particular service the schools primary schools i would you say i think in the East Christchurch at the moment as far as I 'm aware the learn to swim programs would be serviced by the existing problems near you talking about an oversupply of paul space for lane swimming and learning to swim programs right that 's really important thank you okay Andrew one thing that 's often said about the private market delivering facilities from such as swimming pools is that the the cost of a swim for example when the facilities provided by the private market would be more than the cost of a swim for example when that facility is provided by an organization such as the council in terms of accessibility for all that 's something that I certainly would consider to be important have you got any comment around the the cost of entry or barriers to entry for the you know all people in our setting i 'm aware be that swimming at a council pullers cheaper entry fee but overall for the learn to swim program i I think the success of awkward gym is proven and 27 years of consistently providing a debt-free bearing in mind they built that pool when interest rate at twenty-eight percent and borrowed all the money to build it was the first successful private Paul New Zealand to run as a business and so I I think it 's about the quality of their product and I 'm not just selling on their behalf this is my reflection having been associated with the pool and I swim it both so just a supplementary question if i count if I was to walk into pioneer as a casual swimmer if do you know how much i would pay and if I was to walk into equity maz a casual swimmer do you know I couldn 't and for that I 'm sorry yeah Tim I mean I can attest to the quality my both my children now we 're doing it someone got to a point relocate then one of them is now other sighs but I think Ellie 's point is really important that as a line and learn to swim and a fitness Hall not a pleasure Paul so to speak thank you it 's really important thank you anymore to me a moment in the you know the high density population area southwestern no kind of Endora as women possible to whether the summer school kids oh you 're a customer they from the waist or Southwest aside to Yoda facility they further honor the bus transport serves the schools and the school school said the children but buses generally be very few the dead you walk to equity oh yeah yeah yep okay that 's it are you very much indeed for going in and coming making the submission thank you _"

here and next one is Brendan and I think you 're a Latino that 's Brendan yeah yay welcome I think they 've told you five minutes about your lab team because you 're a you a group emails all right okay okay so deputy Emir back and counselors and thank you for the opportunity to speak to my submission on the draft long to him plain bringing chase on a commercial real estate agent based in the central city my other credentials are on the notes I 've handed out now with my comments and suggestions to you today and my personal opinions so as we recover from the earthquake events of 2010-2011 central city as in it as in transition this will likely be so for the next decade or more Christchurch City Council is able to and inevitably must play a vital role and stimulating commercial activity in the central commercial and social activity in the central city is enabling convenient and efficient access to it from all parts of Christchurch of Canterbury and beyond I concur with the counselors vision of a pedestrian and cyclist friendly central city I concur with your public transport and environmental objectives I believe though that we must evolve towards achievement of that vision our present culture is rooted in car travel and this has evolved progressively since the 1950s with the ongoing development of Greenfield suburbs ear city continues to sprawl ever outwards a tree and we seek to diminish with the estate front of a greater innocent population the central city needs to be accessible to the greater Christchurch population now as a destination for work shopping and recreation in this regard car travel is presently vitally important for ease and convenience of access cars require parking at the destination of the journey to the central city council seeks to reduce on street parking to enhance the pedestrian environment off street short stay and long-stay parking is therefore required that 's probably the main tenant of what I have to say I so 15 to 20 years hints instead about establishing now the car parking facilities that are visitors will be required at that later time and allow our central city to grow into them doing so will provide a level playing field along the way in terms of Central City competing with the suburbs for workers visitors and residents central government has stimulated the development of the first major office and retail buildings in the CBD core through the instrument of leases its leasing of large amounts of office space and these developments has been the catalyst for their construction in further large-scale developments alongside so it 's my contention that council can have an even greater effect by using leases to stimulate the development of parking facilities in an ideal scale and an ideal locations and in complexes that deliver the Beast street-level environment both shops hospitality establishments and other commercial businesses council provides all on street parking in the central city it 's a core business activity of council so the opportunity exists for council to shape the nature extent of off street parking in the central city through is a really important lever barking as a business that produces revenue council can trade at the margin of this enterprise casual council can exert a huge influence on the parking market to achieve its objective of establishing a visioning central city population and economy the potential economic and social benefits are disproportionate to the costs and lie opinion as the population increases during the transitional period price is still your lever just as it will be early in the transitional period when the market will find it difficult to compete because price is the lever a choice to exit the park and business later if exercise should be a profitable one as the crown understands leases are powerful legal and commercial instruments and when they are structured correctly benefit both parties to them it 's my contention and embracing such an approach will propel us towards a pedestrian and cycle friendly city with greater use of public transport much more rapidly in by restricting car access today provision of parking facilities by council will stimulate the private sector development of commercial and residential property across a broad scale not and it would be good to see such development not dominated and compromised by the provision of parking within it our modes of movement and an around our city need to evolve that it is vitally important that growth and development is not restricted as we recover from the events which had devastated our central city so I encourage council to be proactive and take a strong and positive stance and respect of car parking in the central city for at least the duration of this long-term plan swindon Jamie did you have question yep a face that I 'm thanks Brendan Brendan you 're at the coalface of leasing in Christchurch you know ultimately at the coalface of people either backing this intra-city investing it or not and your experience is the lack of off street parking a deal breaker for people investing and the central city it is but more directly than that it 's a deal breaker for potential tenants and the central city I mean I that 's hard to get the corporations to cross the river in into the court the objection that I come access is difficult so the business decision of whether or not they put the ax dollar near business until the CBD Israel you 've actually seen them say yeah the parking is now summarize ago that will go somewhere else yeah and it 's surprising how direct that is in and who it 's from you 'd think that maybe heaven more benevolent view but they see it as a real obstacle Caitlin please call you a next it 's an interesting observation about the tenants and one of the most critical for the rebuild my question is all around with our limited budget for re-establishing car parking in the central city either view around other organizations perhaps building and operating car parks with the assistance of counsel yes like even now we 're seeing car parking is being prohibitively expensive and this is on gravel you know undeveloped sites i think that price is a really important factor in terms of getting people into the central city if the if it 's just the market that 's left to work it out that 'll always think it 'll always without necessarily encouraging you know more people and I guess I 'm my viewers that if we could create that capacity now as the population builds up in here pedestrian travel cycling in certainly bus travel will become a more attractive option rather than through restriction that are just evil convenient okay thanks yummy I 'm thank you for submission and I mean thank you for that that solution I just want to check but what you say you 're basically saying the government 's propped up a whole bunch of private development in the central city for the commercial buildings through the government departments coming in and you think that they 've admitted it pop up a couple more know will help develop our car parking buildings if they took Mises on those for the car parks that they need for their office developments I 'm not suggesting you even need to develop them I 'm saying you could lease the car packs I 'm suggesting you you could be the operator bro you operate on street parking you know no one else does it you 're in the restricted on street and it doesn 't have the capacity that 's needed for the more densely populated city but trying to build you know if it 's the market that 's left to it it would be more likely the price prohibitive yeah no I understand that I 'm just trying to understand the funding mechanism if you were suggesting a funding mechanism like what 's happened for the commercial developments and that for our off street parking buildings one of the concerns maybe council has is the capital costs if we got say government to do what they 've done with those commercial buildings and say we 'll take a hundred car parks for the next ten years for the visitors to the justice and emergency precinct yes that starts to become a funding solution to a funding problem it becomes back in solution yeah that 's really cool thank you very much indeed Brendan thank you and brit brit para la Brittnay look

    "text": "just in case you 're wondering about the fairness of things individuals tend to get five minutes and groups get ten minutes gather that um yes some over just to hear on behalf of my wife and myself my wife 's child accountant she made a submission can 't_''_18.66 be here today that happy to take some questions pep so I just touch off on the highlighted items in terms about the submission we made that the long term plan correctly identified it as deep level initial balance sheet crisis for the council that 's well publicized in signaled I guess our concern with it was about narrow framing of the solutions in terms of how how it 's being presented and the options were available so we 've put forward a couple of thoughts that council might like sue in terms of addressing for broadening its options providing more flexibility so what the really around like one of the solutions to sort of debt leverage crisis is about addressing cash flow and your ability to fund sustainable debt we 're one of the solutions we felt council should look your folks take things back to what legislate required what is actually required and then build up from that rather than taking an incremental approach of what happened before as the baseline so it 's about resetting the baseline in because it 's pretty important in the situation here any savings that are created out of out of operational budgets were enabled more sustainable dip which gives the council more options in terms of what can and can 't_''_109.979 do and that 's the fundamental challenge that the council 's believe is facing in terms as long to implant their lead Center something up the options that presented by the council in terms of sale of assets and I guess is a challenge there around sell the easily saleable ones and the natural monopolies you answer there 's plenty of buyers for but perhaps the council should really be looking at assets that are non performing I aren 't providing any any return or businesses bears advantaged by other other agencies surface assets I think casino pretty significantly example of that just that overnight ready with the council suit does I 'm sure if the council made the same review of its own land holdings assets and that since there would be opportunities there particularly is that should city changes shape and how the red zones used and comes back the other other one is in terms of assets is that holding it seems to be proposal to hold onto assets that are consuming cash in terms of where they are in the investment cycle enable comes to my dear according to last year 's a financial accounts requires another three hundred and thirty-seven million it 's hard to roll out complete the rollout of the fiber network and that 's over the next eight years so while it 's not a great a bit you know large investment now will be over this period of time the outcomes are uncertain from that might be a great investment but it 's perhaps one that this council kind of forward and its current circumstances and then I guess we 're really set as counselors rollers to all everything we where resources get put but if we felt there needed to be getting City back on its feet and particularly round leveraging off what 's already here in terms of enabling growth within the city limits rather than and its peripheral let 's really the last point there hopefully oddly huh but a type of questions but not go ahead hey there 's two quick questions with regards to areas what do you think about a leasing option so do organizations like New Zealand retirement fund or ACC rather than a cell you 're not realizing cash say that that 's really what you 're trying to do is is it disposed on you 're trying to if you 're leasing them then it doesn 't really change your position you could pay interest or you could pay at least fee it 's not going to make any difference either need to sell them on or or I 'm hold on to them and make them work boots not this thank you it 's going to be really quick Andrew um a contrast I guess between what you 're saying in your submission and councils own consultation document the spending program the is described as bold and aspirational your subject and obviously to be funded by rate increases and sale of assets mainly you 're suggesting that the sale of assets means that future generations will simply pay for today 's weak leadership so are you suggesting that that bold aspirational program to be funded by asset sales actually is a sign of weakness because we 're taking an easy way out no what I see is you 're not making operational changes just selling family silver not changing a lifestyle of the wave council 's working say all the little does by time or be in the same position ten years and we have the same outcome would you we won 't we won 't_''_362.259 of leverage their if you realize the cash available if we like leverage the opportunity at okay okay thank you very much indeed me it would be very proud of you thank you to them based on _"

sort of things so Katherine we 're going to start with you from one voice to Rio guitar is it is it you Catherine or however many people you want is absolutely fine welcome and you 'll be aware of the time then cuz you 've done this a few times so you got Oh haven 't you really I 'm amazed really I 'm amazed okay sorry Catherine I 'm making wrong assumptions my apologies okay so you 've got 10 minutes and that includes the questions so if you want to leave time for questions then I 'm just going to ask the Mariana to me to wait our almighty pernah satu ET aki tattooing my nike and our cards were t hey Rodie order so Mabel warm made the warm heavily heavenly twins and the spirit of our tea pune guide us and support us always and you have in front of you the picture of our for the the graphic of our co papa which has got the worker at the top and that 's what we 're trying to be a worker onto which the NGOs can jump in and pedal together and we do pedal rather than row because we recognize tick hangar at the basis of the work that we do and the just very briefly to pick the eyes out of the written submission that you 've had we 're wanting to acknowledge the work that has put in by those organizations that are not formed by government or commercial interests now that 's not to say we don 't want to work with government in commercial interests but we want to get recognition for those organizations that are not driven by community by a statutory imperative or commercial are not driven by commercial imperative they have a wider cope upper and they use commercial tools to reach their goals we have kept our organization very simple the description of the way we operate is on the back if anybody 's particularly interested please look at that the register that we have created as one on which NGOs need to put themselves we don 't put them on they simply just step up and decide that they want to be collaborative and they want to work in this treaty based way so having done that we then provide some links for them between them and with other organizations in the blog spot is accessible and you can see the raft of things that we 've been doing over the last two or three years particularly we are appealing to the council to develop a strategy and policy relating to NGOs now I don 't actually care with you call them friends or anything else some people call it the voluntary sector some people call it the nonprofit sector we have decided to use the shorthand of NGOs I 've they are a source of policy advice for the City Council which I think was demonstrated at the mayor 's breakfast I don 't if any of the counselors were there but it was a really really good conversation and people were collaborative challenging and supportive to each other so that 's who we are and what we want is some sort of strategy that appeared that applies to us and there isn 't one and the current long-term plan so with we 've tried and failed to get recognition of the things that we want from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority because what we 've really been hanging out for is the ability to connect and be accommodated at low cost in the central city and the central city development unit hasn 't been able to come to come across with that so some of the groups in Community House are already facing a an increase of fifty percent in their rates in their rent very soon or by the first of November and there 's something magic happens so we just appealed to you to do this sweetie again II thank you for your submission and the work that you did the thing I 'm really trying to understand and maybe you can just reflect on is why is it being so hard for the for community to be recognized as part of the blueprint in the central city like what 's do you have any idea what the barrier is because I see all these recovery strategies I see all these um you know commitments to psychosocial well-being and welfare but when we asked we told there 's no social impact assessment and there 's all this new development that 's being spent but nothing seems to be done for community very briefly yeah I mean that 's a huge question you know but I could give you a lecture but I want the the key thing for me is that with the the actual ng onus is not recognized we keep even drawn into this notion of community building well everybody does community building I mean Peter Townsend and I often argue but we 've got friends you know he 's he 's doing communities the here is that there 's this group of little agencies we reckon about 10,000 of them in Christchurch that 's a guess that from the statistics that have been collected that 's pretty fees most of them have no paid staff ninety percent of them have no paid staff according to the survey done by the johns hopkins university and we just think they need recognition and resourcing for who they are that 's what we want so maybe a recovery plan for the NGO sector or we 've tried that we advocated for a what was it called um we had a name for it a new anchor project that I 've we suggested a new anchor project it was Rick 's as Rick 's Gibson from the migrants into was I just be clear that that 's what we needed you know but we haven 't got it okay felon in entry thank you Karen I 'm can I just ask you about how pets we get there in terms of but I think we understand the value that can be contributed from the NGOs but it 's and it perhaps unless these things are sort of Matt sort of marked down as a specific economic benefits they won 't be recognized like an example as some years ago was measured or to thank for every and every dollar can invested in NGO work and it became a 10-fold profit those statistics are up on our blog spot this one another besides those stats are there is a really any other work that we could press help you with to kind like increase the evidence of the value well i mean the the has been recently a little publication at the city council 's support called holding hope together which was put out by that what the stories are of a number of NGOs in the city I mean we 've tried to do the case study thing we 've tried to do the statistics thing we 've demonstrated the population of the sector being that only ten percent of the organizations have any paid staff at all most of them are not I mean it 's just really hard to see what else we can do given I liked Barnaby Bennett 's comment in the Christchurch Press article recently where he talked about the need for some recognition for some funding for the city for the public space and I think this is perhaps an answer to your question Phil I don 't know but you know some project and of course I think of something like a community house or equivalent where we have that shared public space where we can we can we can do our stuff you know I mean we don 't actually ask for much appreciate that and thank your kids with it soft and like clearly you 're also wanting us at the governance level to support the development of a strategy and a policy so I appreciate that 's true but in particular for central city Kapil you see the thing is that place based organizations out in the suburbs have got places this church horses you know community but they 're the central city allows for the cert the the organization 's to be available who for whom an anonymous service is important you know if you 're a that in your own let backyard you 're going to need specialist advice yeah you need to you need to have those specialist services central city base and our appeal to the Christchurch City Council at this point in time is to take this seriously so that then that model can be shared through the urban development strategy implementation committee or forward wachee about whatever to make it clear that this is these are organizations that actually serve greater Christchurch tenants protection goes out to run your network why telling our treaty group has just gone out to do some stuff at Ralston you know we do that stuff thank you I 've got Andrew which may be the last question I 'll try and keep it as brief as I can early in your presentation Katherine you mentioned social enterprise and obviously social enterprise is one way that we can work together to possibly bring some sustainability into the sector from a funding viewpoint what can counsel be doing or how can counsel be working with the sector to encourage or enable social enterprise to more easily establish I recognition Andrew one of the things that concerns me is that it 's kamath it 's not templating it 's overshadowing the other organizations in our sector who actually can 't_''_673.01 do that income generation work so my appeal is that we don 't limit it to but they are part of our sector we love them dearly and they are very good at sharing their resources and their knowledge with the sector you know like and just sort of very practical things of how to do business like work in our sector they 're really valuable we we 've benefited a lot from the collaboration and the generosity of those people but don 't let it overshadow the sector because the sector is actually much much broader and that 's the vulnerable parts of the sector that we 're really wanting to advocate for thank you i 'm going to try and keep us on time this afternoon is that ok ok thank you very much indeed both of you coming in and for everything else can we just ask the owner to just close the session for us to be sure I 'm actually going to add in a little bit of corridor cousin we 're usually quite busy and we don 't usually in Catherine 's kept us up with what happens here my name is arianna from Tiffany high water manager at two-thirty holder we have all of our team at the moment split up ones in cocoa to supporting a client and once and I 'm third generation within the community sector and volunteer and women 's refuge but I just want to just draw on the point and regards to what the council can do I think what the council can do is make a meaningful space within policy and strategy in regards to NGOs because the thing is these are saying with them community which is there 's nothing should be done what that about us without us you know so and when you talk about the fabric of of Earth of our communities in what we know what 's happened here in Christchurch every we typically with an hour anyway work with the most vulnerable now everybody has been impacted after the with a vulnerable city so if you want to build a strong and well city you do need to incorporate the NGO sector you 're a good then I 'll just end on that and i 'll just say army me haha Abby yeah thank you and we 've got Tim elements to the Megan Ellen welcome Tim _"

    "text": "then next is summer summer McCambridge come know so wild and can 't_''_9.99 foundation Tim Shanahan God you get around I do how many I 'm not talking to you about stadium at lowest actually well they 're suppose that it makes sense you play football in the winter and San tennis in the summer so I 'm thanks to the opportunity again so walden park foundation is the is the s identity for the sport of tennis in christchurch currently wildin park is the facility at owns and as most of you would be well aware if not all of you obviously damaged in the in the earthquakes and because the land is owned by the sport it 's it 's one of those tough circumstances where it 's not a simple decision to simply move to another site and rebuild you 've got to take into consideration the the land ownership and and what the true opportunities are and and that takes longer so tennis has been in a difficult position where it hasn 't had the opportunity to move forward as quickly as it would have liked submission we actually identified that there was a preference for development at hagley park and the the United hagley park tennis club that 's there there has been a lot of discussions in the last couple of months with council staff and it 's been identified that for various reasons that may not be a possibility so when coming to the table today we acknowledge that part of our submission is is probably morphing as we go along and it might be that wildin park and the Pune why are the the logical solutions moving forward I guess with regard to that where we want is ongoing dialogue transparency and our dialogue with the council council staff so that we make the right decisions because when we decide to reinstate wild in park or move the facilities of walden park somewhere that 's a decision that we 've got to live with for a long so we want to make sure that we 're making informed decisions and it 's not just about what 's best potential is what 's best for the city because the city is a vested so that 's the that 's the first part that we 're just asking that that there is ongoing engagement and and we would be happy to engage with the staff but with counselors as you deem and feel as appropriate the other component of it is in the same way that the the council supports every sport whether it 's with the maintenance of the grass fields there has historically been support for the maintenance of certain tennis facilities and particularly park around the city and understandably when their facility was damaged in the earthquakes and a number of courts reduced it made sense to reduce the amount of funding but now that we 're back to numbers that are at priate quake levels in terms of Wilding Park having the six indoor courts it has the required 12 courts for four major tournaments and for use for the local inter-club would like to see that that partnership continues I think it 's important that I make it clear we 're not coming to the table with the sense of entitlement we 're not saying we used to get we do feel that there is strategy documents within Council thats a council has a responsibility to support the various sports coats and engages with those and invest in those to ensure that all residents of Christ you can engage in their chosen sport and the cost of maintaining wildin park are significantly greater than the amount that was provided on an annual basis but it certainly was a contribution that had meaning to the sport of tennis and made it more sustainable to look after that facility in particular the indoor facility and ensure that we maintain facilities that were of benefit to the people of Christchurch we just have to look at the fact that tennis New Zealand has in the last couple of years made it clear they want to bring all of their winter Davis cut ties to Christchurch we had chinese taipei last year we 're going to have a tie against india enjoy of this year clearly that facility is key to the ability to do that it wouldn 't happen otherwise it 's a facility that has some significant capital maintenance costs and continue to partner on that and and that is what we 're we 're hoping can continue as a result of this the funding was coming through the strengthening communities with her previous submissions from people saying that money still needs to be there to support various community groups and I agree with that wholeheartedly and I would hope moving forward the tennis can continue to have support from council both financially but also in terms of helping it come through the the difficult time it 's been in late with a good solution in terms of the long light the long life facilities required for the sport locally do I have any questions and Jimmy and Paul in one question because you are where long-term play moment council to show for the funding but regarding to a several category based on your other point of view how to a candle for advertise for instant either damage info charger three waters are the damaged reality and also community facility in sports in reserve the kind of maintenance and also the ankle party how do you to have a part per i 'm going to offer and and all of you would have put in a lot more time on on contemplate than me so please take this as a laypersons respond sir at best prior to the earthquake residents across virtual pain rates and those rates were applied to different community activities that benefited the well-being and the lifestyle of everybody in christchurch you have the challenge right now as counselors to identify with the rates year now receiving what are you going to prioritize for earthquake recovery and what are you going to put towards the continuation of lifestyle and well-being and christchurch and I guess that 's where we 're coming from we 're not saying that the needs of tennis or any other sport has a high priority than the rebuild and putting infrastructure back in place but there is still an obligation and you 'd like to think of responsibility to ensure a quality lifestyle for the people of Christchurch and that 's where this fits now Paul minus more just to thank you for the work you 're doing and the wildling foundation but also for a pleaser you still there and we 're seeing all the stuff moved to the south and there and I personnel be concerned that Tina 's pulled stumps and Limp tunapuna way and we feast I think that 's cricket at Paul stops also got it right again just clarify i 'm lindsey north on the gym of the writing back foundation we 're not leaving wiring back at least not in the immediately foreseeable future we 've just spent whole heap of money getting it up and running and we 're looking we 're just working through plans at the moment to upgrade it a bit further and increase the outdoor courts from 12 to 16 and hopefully we will do that so i think it can be reasonably comfortable that we r there for a while having said that we are also committed to other courts elsewhere and i just wanted to mention the map una y facility which is referred to so do understand there 's an allocation and the long-term plan for funding for infrastructure and things out there and we 've been involved in with the nap who know a working group in and bicker and settle we just want to urge council to keep at it and make that funding available because that i think is an exciting hmm development not just the textbook but for other sports in for the city generally and in particularly in that area of the city which is and maybe a bit under represented to given the population second so if you can find some more for infrastructure then please do but please don 't cut what you 've already got ya thank you very much and I stood comment that on the news the other night I saw that it was the centenary of the death of Antony Wilding who died in the war after being you know quite the quite the handsome tennis star you know the multiple winner of Wimbledon and and that the comments that were made on the news item was that you know perhaps there should be you know movie made of his life or a play or something dedicated to him because he was such a an extraordinary figure on he died you know a hundred years ago just recently I think is is worthy of mention but I was quite moved by the by the presentation on there was a news item and I was quite surprised and felt bad that I didn 't know as much about our local history as I should have thank you very much right we 're on an adjournment now until one o 'clock thank you

lumbered Resource Center community gardens and helps out she 's an advocate for her community and for those who suffer the debilitating ongoing life-changing effects of brain injury here determination to contribute to the lives of others despite alone challenges as inspirational the intersection point of all of these stories are all of these people 's lives place all over the city from mere avail to hey hey from Red Cliffs Bromley from addington to utterly organizations that function on a shoestring budget from funding round of funding round relying on the goodwill of the communities they serve and the partnerships they have with each other the City Council and other funding bodies with us in mind three quick points we appreciate the pressure on community facilities following the quakes and myself Mona and I and credibly grateful for the use of the lynnwood Resource Center which is council land council building next to the council facilities on Smith Street we 're incredibly grateful for the use of the facility access to facilities like this in which local organizations carry out community work is vital our Center is used by many other NGOs and statutory organizations as an accessible point for providing services in the community be they courses on healthy diet through the family group conferences held by Child Youth and Family through the residential advisory service people come because the server the place is not clinical it 's a home that 's accessible it 's their engagement and the services most community organizations like us are struggling financially and suddenly couldn 't afford market rents or sustained full management responsibility for facilities like these please involve local groups like ours and the decision-making processes regarding how local facilities city council facilities will be used for the benefit of local people point to stretching a shoestring but consistent grassroots social recovery which is the ground on which every other form of recovery in this city operates its people partnerships between local government the community and voluntary sector need to be strong with both parties resourcing each other the strengthening communities funding as an anchor for many community organizations particularly in this wider political national context in which we find ourselves in terms the devolution of responsibility for many services back onto community frequently without resourcing that 's a question for another forum outside the city to ensure the resilience of the rich variety of community organizations in this city please please consider increasing the amount of strengthening communities funding available to grassroots community organizations over the next three years last point as an individual I can by counsel and leading recovery with community input for me the only parallel I can draw as a social worker is working with an incredibly complex multifamily multi-issue situation in which there 's a lot of pain a lot of struggle and a lot of competition for resources that 's my only point of reference to the juggle you are having to do with us I appreciate and value the opportunity to have a saying however forums like this aren 't for everybody likewise dense text which we sometimes presented where there 's a challenge for many even the highly literate or for people like me that struggle to read a balance sheet but there are many proven tools that can be used to engage people 's views in creativity and problem-solving and leading our city forward the use of processes like participatory budgeting whilst time-consuming and challenging could enable clearer community participation and fiscal priority setting for Christchurch going forward we all know because we 're involved in a variety of relationships both personal and professional with partners with our children with their parents with colleagues with our friends putting ourselves aside and deliberately leaning towards and learning how that other person or group absorbs processes and then responds to information let 's keep the conversation open about how the broader community and the council can keep resourcing each other as we go forward the journey to recovery as we all know as we experience as long and has taken one small step after another we need each other let 's keep talking thank you you 're a thank you very much think that you 've raised a number of issues that really speak to a range of the submissions that we 've received I 've been sort of quite well heartened by the number of community organizations or community groups that have come to us not for a request for money but for a request for a partnership and a a more collaborative approach around funding so that it 's not just one to the other it 's actually have you know combining our our resources we can get the best things done with our communities because i think that the time for local government or central government over if we are to build the extent of resilience that we need going forward Phil thank you for your presentation one of the things you referred to to in terms of like the rank huge range work and bigger demands on on your center since the earthquakes it was really you 're also saying look could we consider increasing about the funding the sort of for strengthen communities so that groups like yours might benefit and so I just wanted it would the be any sort of additional way outreaches which if you had further funding that you might be able to tell us about all suggest I think there 's a huge opportunity both to develop new things but also to sustain what 's already there and one of the challenges which I face is all people that work in NGOs face as you go from funding round of funding round facing the competition of actually doing the verb work versus funding the work I 've been doing it since I was 19 so I 'm aware and I 'm nearly 50 I 'm aware that that 's sustainable in terms of funding resource that means you 're able to put more of your heart and head into the people and the groups in front of you as he is huge because we 're always having to be and we always will have to be split in our focus so yeah I think there 's always a range of new style that can happen but it will involve the same processes building trust establishing credibility making commitment of people long-term regardless of the particular program will process there are some things that we all know work with people and they all sent around some pretty similar initiatives so that 's probably a broad answer to a simple question hmm absolutely from my former head on I mean I was the mp4 crush it seem true I think 25 years ago in October so I have a long-standing relationship with Lynwood Resource Center and I 've done doing an amazing job we 've really run out of time for this one but thank you very much John for coming back on and for making such a powerful representation those for a long time myself and they do make a difference thing but they do add up and the weight on people 's shoulders generally across the city is very great and that 's been exacerbated by the experience that we 've been through but you know we can take strength from each other and I think that 's the most powerful message that you could bring to the table so thank you very much please _"

    "text": "it 's united association football club and I understand we have Liz her when Tim Shanahan feel hi thank you for the opportunity to be here and speak it 's kind of intriguing when you go from the message that you just have from former mayor and and and have broad that is and it relates to everybody in Christchurch now you 've got a small community group that represents 640 participants in their and their families and their players but I guess one of the reasons we wanted to be here today and it actually nice segue from what Gary was was commenting on is is often you have a situation where the staff within Council have identified a solution and idea that they want to see a mint it it 's still important to present it and make it known to the counselors that the people out there also value that solution and for us it at nomad you know football club it is the fact that we are a large Club fifth-largest and Christchurch we are in a situation where we are spread in terms of our and then not actually I mean some of the grounds that we use are closer to a number of other clubs in our own Club and while the name nomads might reduce we 're happy with that circumstance and we 'll live with it that 's not really where we want to be and there is an opportunity to exist at the current time with a new subdivision that 's being developed the hosted residential the indication we have had is that land adjacent to Tyler Park is going to be the development contribution for that the indications we 've had is that that will be developed as additional land to tullett park and we would hope that that does progress in that direction and that the club has the opportu to engage with council once that land becomes available and work on how we can I guess utilize that land to maximize its value narrow for the football club but for the summer cricket code and other codes and some of that might also want to use that land so that 's where we 're coming from we 're to happen we just want to have some face time to reiterate that 's what we would love to see happen it 's not necessary identifying the submission because we thought we 'd come with with one key element but we 're also of the understanding that as part of the process tell apart we 'll have a investigation of its drainage money is set aside and the plan for that next year and the following year as the implementation of a drainage solution and the reason I want to put that out there is last year the grounds basically tell apart did not get used it was too wet did not drain the club actually played all of it so the majority of the time games further afield so we 're excited by what we see is happening at all apart we just wanted to indicate that we are supportive of it and we do hope that it progresses great I mean just following on from from Gary 's presentation do you think that in terms of decision making this is something that the local community board should be personally I think it 's acceptable for it to be to be moved to the community board I mean from my previous experience with with Canterbury hockey a lot of the the process for the development of non-work Park post-earthquake was about engaging with the local community board of Pendleton why Murray we agreed on what the solutions were going to be and then it was about coming to counseling and signing off the lease of additional land so I think there is there is room for those sort of processes in the current political environment where we 're here and taking the opportunity that is presented by these hearings totally agree with that I 'm an absolutely right that you do so but it just has given me a bit of thought about the sorts of things that we should be thinking about in terms of delegations and resourcing our community boards to make decisions yani um I don 't you understand what the community we couldn 't already do I think it 's one of those situations where put it in context and I 'm happy to be correctly but we found about the development contribution basically the same time that submissions for this for closing as we thought no we don 't want to miss an opportunity let 's make sure we submit something I 'm completely comfortable with you guys now referring it to the community board but just the timing was such we thought no it 's not miss an opportunity to make sure that this can progress I think maybe there 's a confusion community boards don 't can 't_''_283.49 participate in our ma that 's a different statutory process and local government act yeah but maybe what you 're saying is we need to empower community boards to be able to make submissions be involved through the RMA plan changes etc rather than council staff I 'd like I 'm comfortable with the process been what it is I I think from our perspective we 're hopeful that having now presented something somebody might get in contact with us whether it 's it 's the green space park manager saying yep councils now heard this message we 're still on track to deliver club to make sure that when we take this additional land on it is made usable green space for sports and we actually talk to you as a club about how you want to see that land used as its and your fields junior fields intermediate feel and those things except a low level but I think it 's just about making sure that as a sports club we 're engaging in the process that 's a great thank you very much I 'm sure the chief executive is making a note of that thank you _"

    "text": "yes I 've already tripped on that one and today actually and I think I 've hmm and I have Bruce white here met him near with me between us I think you get 20 minutes Oh else he is he 's next you 've got to all right all the counts at the end of the table sorry I 've got over okay this up to date one oh I see so you 're gonna do it together a late change it right and we will do a song-and-dance Act to you that um it 'll be thank you very much for receiving us this morning and it 'll be interesting for you that you 've got two accountants at the end of the table who are mostly going to talk about process and the long-term plan I think is just a base case it really does need significant work after the first of July and I would be I consider that you should be completely reviewing your asset manager of plans I was here when they started in 2002 and at the time and I 've sent in and I saw projects rejected at the table resurrecting themselves as a staff promoted plan and we had no way of stopping them so you 're sitting in front of you with asset management plans with all the fancy glycerol around them that they are an amalgam of conservatism so you have engineers over engineering you have accountants providing for all sorts of things that might not exist you 've got auditors coming in influencing your plans and then you 've got interference by government departments I think that the figures you 've got in front of you are beyond conservatism and so I think it 's really important that you actually start a process where you rethink your capital projects I watched in horror at the flopped and basin process brief more likely call me to live yeah I I don 't want to comment on the technical aspect of flopped and basin but what actually really horrified me was the the way in which I think I was probably the only critique of that project and the way in which it was handled and particularly in front of critical analyst of the project whereas the engineers had probably five and a half days type of thing and so the in terms of decision making a complete and balanced as I saw of analysis and presentation so for instance when you heard this morning a local resident a Templeton saying this is what you could do that would be quite simple that 's on the ground comment and you almost important it is almost impossible for you to actually pick that idea up so the Kaiba leave that from weather with a base case I think you need to pick some big lofty stuff up and say now look maybe this is my idea you might be you 're probably rejected but maybe you draw a line around Fendall tanam and mirror veil and you say from there to the east which starts off at littleton from these of the east that 's your capital approach project for the next ten years and the rest of the city its maintenance and then you focus on what is broken maybe you need to look at a ball thing like a because it 's very easy to take the money off the art gallery but you will be wasting money on engineering all over the place which is miles more than what you took off the art gallery second point I want to make us about the Sarah the rationale for the government involvement the previous council caused the government to have to set up Sarah it had no other option but it 's now time for the key projects to be reviewed there are large central city projects which we all know need review if the figure of 420 million and this morning 's paper is correct then I can report to you quite clearly overspend potential overspend on there then you cost up their butts the neutral site and they didn 't mean to interrupt that I haven 't read that article yeah I did I thought guys are somebody written us so that I can come along and comment on it we we struggled to make a 20 million dollar Convention Center pay counselors it 's very difficult to actually make that sort of center pay and thus and 40 million per annum and I think that 's cautious who 's going to pay for them peer in them forever so you actually have to it is time to stop and I 'll come back to that in a minute you 're inheriting a sports and recreation center should you not be having a hard look at the costing and the operating costs of it and the other thing is don 't let the red zone be a Jutta bar to the east I 've already been spoke I 've already had large organizations comment to me about their views on the east and it 'll be eaten out by big organizations at least the council stands up and says this is our city government we want to work closely with you because I actually think the government 's there in good faith and we need to actually as a city step up and say we are your your match am I councillors requested under the Official Information that 's something that probably most of you haven 't got but it was a letter by the mirror and CEO of a key of Sarah and all of the issues all of the issues that we have been talking about here and that you 've been talking about the other day over the last few days rather we 're told the government was told about them on the 19 that March and and the chief executive of zero it was told about them on the nineteenth of febuary and and it 's really important that the government now steps up to the for the mac don 't think you are the junior party do not think that for a minute you just work out how much this council is paying for and then work out how much the net cost to the government is you work out the GST on 40 billion you work out the PA ye on enormous wages you work out the company profits in the multiplication factor there are we at the government saving and benefits etc the government 's contribution will probably be about the same as the Christchurch City Council you may be in front so I believe it 's time for the I think it 's time to call for the shipley Commission to get Sarah and the City Council together there are lots of excellent people and both organizations and you actually need to say to them we 're in this together we live here and and we 're really keen eye I know Jenny Shipley I have a lot of time for her I think she would actually welcome she 's a woman from Canterbury and she would welcome the sort of opportunity I think it 's really important that it 's made a political this isn 't about political party membership this is about the future of our setting for our kids the old council was largely thrown out by that by the rate payers of Christchurch because people didn 't see them standing up and being counted somewhere but and they got back in but unleash and the great powers of Christchurch expect you to take the risks and to take control and to show bold leadership if I could just talk about the processes and where I think the council really needs to to focus a little old but it 's more processes that we 're we 're interested in and I 've got a just to print out here of a document and I 'll just read something that 's really important we talk and we hear talk about culture and needing to change and all that sort of thing values form the basis of our organizational culture now I just agree wholeheartedly with that statement right this document is actually on the council website it 's actually the council 's vision values and goals document and the interesting thing is it 's dated ten years old and so happened it was put together when Gary was the mayor it 's actually do for the next review februari 2012 we 've gotten to review it and while I bring that up is the council 's values are really important so I just want to focus on one value or two values transparency and responsibility and we hear about transparency and with a couple of things I 've looked at Sur and council transparency just hasn 't happened one project 134 days to get it official information been answered very quickly or the better I got very very quickly 23 days now that isn 't transparency at all it 's very very serious and as a person with not a hiccup a lot of time to devote to these things I 've got business activities that I 'm fully involved in it 's so hard to be involved and yet public participation is the future key to the community rebuilding to community resilience and out in the community you 've got all sorts of resources and knowledge the transparency is really important and it needs to be taken far more seriously the next point we want to cover us Development Authority we completely support this this is an excellent vehicle we think it needs to have it 's important that it has commercial prudence it 's important that it has accountability but that it will promote decent public-private partnerships and the role of local government is the long view and the role of the private sector is the efficiency and that can be achieved through this organization and we applaud it next point we want to talk you develop collaborative planning framework where they can particularly over our water and local authorities are expected to collaborate but it 's also important to have public participation we must rediscover our villages our planning should go back to where people live and we applaud the strengthening of community boards it 's just excellent but with that strengthening must go the financial costs of their decision-making so if they end up causing legal costs those legal costs come out of the community board budget not out of some central budget somewhere the local knowledge will be will mean you just hear that the templeton before it 's just amazing and people when they are engaged just add so much and then we can tap into networks and if I talked about the the enable network came out of a billionaire who lived some prestige who lived here for six weeks of the year to play golf who gave me advice when I was looking at I 'd seen in Seattle in and and Shanghai data I saw am a ports authority seaport airport data port all controlled by the private were all the private sector and that residents received the benefit from there and the guy that gave me that advice was such a su moto who has broken TT in Japan who lives in Christchurch we need to actually look at systemic issues as a council and we need to actually look at council processes and allow a critical review you 've got 320 people earning more than a hundred thousand dollars you 've got 130 staff in your IT section be careful with your reviews however because consultants other later our predators often and they will tell you what you want brave consultants will tell you often what makes you awkward so in conclusion I think it 's important that we frame the debate away from huge rate increases and key asset sales I personally believe that read bhasin city care don 't need to be kept as assets who are potential strategic partners but can you get a greater dividend out of CC HL those are all debates and discussions that need to be taken over a longer period than just this time and that 's why believe that we should change to a discussion about smaller rating increases much more effective operating expenditure prudent capital expenditure that you take that big hump that you 've got at the moment cut the top off that hub look at some assets sales and timing is I think you could do this within the next year so that at the end of that this time next year we sit here and we say although we are required as a city under the local government act to do what 's being done right now we actually believe that we need one more year to actually get it right and then you will all be you will all benefit from being elected back into office because you 've done the right thing thank you if we stained so um the first question i mean that 's just it 's great to have a former mayor because to have that sort of knowledge i rely on Vicki a lot but she goes back even further than then you do in that regard she 's much more ancient no I knew I truly to agree I think that part of the issue is is possibly that the framework for decision making so I mean just from your perspective having been through what we 've been through as a city would you require our city to go through a standard long term planning process or would your perhaps called a halt for a bit more of an intelligent assessment of the long-term needs of the city and and the second question as do you think it was a mistake then to have a three-year an audited plan which really set us up for the surprise of our lives in terms of what the previous council had budgeted for but also signed up for without any assurance around insurance yeah first of all I think you 're you inherited something that was pretty difficult to see you a out of and I think anyone would admit that i 'm not i just think that it 's important that you use the shipley as a commission or no it 's an advisory board on transition what time on i think it 's important that that advisory that you and Ginny will be well used to public scrutiny end that you talk a bit deliberate and public because I was at a meeting the other night and I was staggering the amount of key enthusiasm by people to participate people are dead keen to participate and you need to create the vehicles that everyone can participate in and then another thing that 's important is don 't all do the same thing but trust each other to do the right thing so you set things up in a way where you are all doing different things and like I 've been you know I 'm involved in housing there I 've been really impressed at the enthusiasm counselors have demonstrated towards affordable housing and social housing and what what you 're doing it 's just great and and keep that up but start looking at your processes and your structures in the same way I think it 's unfortunate that your chief executive and here at a restructure that made her job almost impossible and but I think that it might be time to stand back and add onion I 'm obviously not don 't have a council background a bit of business background but I sense that the on the public participation side there 's a real need to get the expertise that 's available out there and don 't fear doing that of run public our large organizations and it 's amazing where the comments might come from the valuable communes they don 't come through the normal channels and as i say that i can remember somebody making a really critical comment i think it was the only decent comment and about five years but it was worth its weight in gold so you never know where a bit of wisdom bit of knowledge will come from and don 't fear it hmm yeah Andrew thank you very much indeed for your submission and Gary for sharing your thoughts with us in the context of you your previous mayoral experience is really really valuable I just had one question in the in relation to in your written submission point number seven one of the things that I 've suggested as a way of dealing each budget and we should prioritize it and then we should draw a line through it at a certain percentage point and everything below that line would drop off so the project with least priority would drop off is that what you 're suggesting in point number seven in your written submission II absolutely I introduced zero-based budgeting to Christchurch Polytechnic in the late 70s and that 's exactly what we did we to them we put top priority the bottom priority and we cost it alongside them and you cut off at the point where your budget runs out people expect you to be prudent but the other thing what is your priority and what 's your staffs priority is often quite different and I think that it is time to start challenging staff priorities particularly in engineering but I think that we need external assistance for that and I mean none of us are engineers and I think that there has to be a no because your point Bruce and I just it 's just it 's probably the most frustrating thing is to say to somebody you precisely you 're trying to provide what is it 's essentially contestable advice and it is difficult to find contestable advice and I think that that shouldn 't be done in an open you know sort of like council setting but maybe in a workshop run by the relevant committee and maybe the relevant committee should have some external expertise brought on to them is seconded members of those committees to help good decision-making and I just I think that you 've raised a number of points that actually go to the quality of the decision-making frameworks and how we do enable public participation but also allow well informed decision-making because I you know I don 't necessarily think that my opinion on a engineering meter is going to be necessarily something that 's going to lead to the best result for Christchurch so we 've got a huge job ahead of us and it it is allowing for that critique and no matter in every area if it without blame or without thank you know and that 's where transparency and the willingness to provide information and discuss is we raised that just didn 't happen and that 's part of the problem so if you overcome that and embrace the community embrace whatever expertise is out there you will end up with the city really on your side and moving forward but we do have incredibly good staff you know really expert really high quality and sometimes what happens is that in the context of dealing with a problem you can 't see that that the impact that it has elsewhere so but I 've also seen incredibly good staff stifled by this organizational structure yes an often incredibly good staff aunt promoted because they 're an irritant well thank you for that contribution former mayor gary moore and it there 's a um a note to endure experiment thank you very much and could i invite

    "text": "not not the best today could we invite the water for life Eden New Zealand trust and Martin Headley and race Lehmann are here to prevent to a thank you well thank you early and counselors the opportunity to meet with you and to give you an update of where we are with this rather exciting project apology from professor Simmons who 's currently oversees and here with Ray you 've already met you 've already had one presentation back in February and so I don 't intend to go through the Batum of the notes that I 've given new page in half but you 'll see there under item three that we 've been working and had an offer of support from grump shores the international firm of architects you are coming out here in about a month 's time to coincide with a visit of the Eden founder and CEO to view our project and to have someone put into it you 'll see there in the statement from grimshaw 's which was completely unsolicited when we met them that they are delighted to be involved they and clearly have a very good understanding of how to design architecture to take into account the natural landscape and based on our basic theme we 're also of course very grateful for the concept work that is currently going on by McKevitt and his team at lincoln design lab and the students there and so with the local architect the thing about our submission is really to reiterate that the core values of Eden coincide exactly with the goals of council right across the board and therefore without going into each of those separate disciplines we wish to congratulate council on thinking about us in this project in the consultative document I 've set out in section 5 there the progress that 's been made since the last presentation to council and it 's working along very quietly behind the scenes as we engage with all the various stakeholder groups and the design which has many iterations is taking a look out those stakeholder poids the key issues are set out in section 6 and essentially what we have is a visit from Sir Tim Smith the founder of first week of July even UK are looking to internationalize their brand and they 're looking to set up till three in China and so their visit here comes after the visit to China one in Canada and one in Europe and so what we have as our small group secured a two year period to try and work up a concept for Christchurch to be the australasian Eden site not in Auckland not in Melbourne not Sydney but here and the well factors include how you recover a devastated land to something really special so they 'll be here to meet with us to look at the site to look at our values have some working sessions and bringing there and put in their intellectual property into our concept and to explain to the people of Christchurch including yourselves and the stakeholders how that project had a big impact on Cornwall and its recovery we also hope that they 'll be able to meet the various ministers and their portfolios to also convince them that this is a worthy project for Christchurch you 'll see there on the second phase one and about this project if we get their endorsement and support which we 're asking Council to take a lead role as a key stakeholder along with clearly not are here and the other councils leak n then me to phase two which is essentially the preparation of feasibility study at that point it 's only Yale know that this project stacks up if it goes ahead then the space 3 clearly would be designed and the capital raising stage 4 would be the build and open so a long way to go but we are right at the front end of this project and so what we 're requesting of council set out on page 2 SiC under number seven which is really to receive your endorsement in a number of ways and to ask that your various departments and disciplines look to work and provide in their work streams activities which might help us achieve a synergistic goal perhaps I could just ask trace Lehman who 's just come back from Eden UK to make some quick observations give them a burly got a couple of Thank you Thank You Martin yeah I think over the last year or so we 've had a number of people that have been to Eton I was there a few weeks ago and i met with David Holland who 's the CEO there and I think it 's probably well it 's a little bit difficult to tell you that the importance of the relationship that we 're actually building with those people they are excited about at the project here as much so as one in China and those in command in Canada as well they 've been in operation for about 13 years now and and also about four years of development so they 've been almost a labar a laboratory for us if you like they 've got a huge amount of experience Eden UK is a unique attraction it 's not it hasn 't been done anywhere else so there 's a lot of learnings for us there and and they 're very willing to work with us and and and for us to gain the experience that they 've had just want to make here at the moment having just come back it 's interesting to see what 's been happening and there 's certainly in the news recently has been the that we 're going to by 2020 I think it is we 're going to have forty-eight percent increase spending by international visitors and by 2025 will have had a six percent annual growth in international visitors that 's all well and good it doesn 't guarantee Christchurch anything and and I think that 's a point that we have to bear in mind at the moment I do quite a lot of research for various organizations and at the moment were about six hundred and thirty thousand guests nights down on Queenstown were seven hundred thousand guest nights down on where we were before the earthquake Auckland of God we 've lost 700,000 Auckland 's gained 500000 we 're in a very difficult position and I think when we presented to you recently we showed some icons of Pisa leaning tower Eiffel Tower etc I think people instantly recognize those as and they define that the city well what do we going to be our icons for the future and unless we do that we 're going to find ourselves in deep trouble we need we need those icons as much for the other facilities that have a convention center alone will not be sufficient in attracting people here they rely on things to do as well while they 're here so that 's an important point just one last thing as I was coming back on the plane I picked up a newspaper in Singapore Singapore straits times and there was a two page article in that by a South African who had visited New Zealand and were was extolling its virtues if you like Hawke 's Bay queenstown Auckland Christ it 's didn 't even get a mention we 're off the we 're off the radar well that 's only one example it 's a it is an important one from someone who 's heavily involved in the tourism industry and that 's quite scary I think when you think that we used to be the second most popular destination in New Zealand and now we 're nowhere Project is going to be the savior of everything it certainly won 't be but but unless we have those icon attractions that attract people people come to places to see and do things and I think we need to understand that and that 's certainly why we 're here we see this as a really important attraction for the future so I haven 't left much time there no Paul really only one one question I 'm sorry look I fully agree with you and everything you 've seen and I 'd like to ask a question around the obviously the 1,000,000 the guest nights and the reduction to our gateway status what impact financially does that have to the South Island do you know well I I don 't know the actual figures but you don 't have to be a rocket scientist a little bit to work it out that its enormous suspend hartlebury yeah yeah but it is significant and I think that years yeah I think we should say that I mean the airport has done a fantastic job in getting people coming to the that and depend and and unless we worked on projects that are going to recover and then grow then we 're going to continue to be in trouble I think they draft and visit a strategy discussion document is highlighted the need for us to be a destination as well as a gateway and the need for iconic one or two iconic attractions to be part of that so I will put in a plug for the botanic gardens of the museum which are actually fantastic attractions individually visited you know probably more frequently than anything else but we do need to have something that 's that 's got kind of got that legacy factor to it and I think you know I mean I 've I loved the idea that in terms of your request around the residential red zone we don 't really have the authority but maybe some potential and chords so thank you very much for your submission gary moore i should say former mayor gary moore _"

    "text": "you 've got you 've got 15 minutes in total so however you want to we 've got a diamond have a community association one and then we 've got a personal one from you yeah okay madam chairman Stannis is ten minutes for the darn half moon association in five minutes for Pete Simpson yes that 's right absolutely right yeah thank you just introduce the Association I 'm chair of the Association Queen Association has been running as an entity since the 1930s in one shape or form or another we get a good representation and membership from the community we also run the community hall we run the website and the diamond harbour Herald newspaper and support an arranged of other other activities in the community so we 're well founded in grounded group I 'm cheer the committee Peters the deputy chair of the committee and we have a submission here people start off the submission I 'll finish the submission we had to do that in five minutes and give you time for questions and then I 'll leave time for the Pete to undertake over to you p you 're standing off thank you Richard good morning thank you very much for taking the time to to hear our submission the association made a submission for increased funding for for a number of activities the the long-term plan contained a range of funding focused primarily on core and legal categories and and that and we felt there was a room for additional funding for some of the key issues that community have faced and that the association have lodged in the submission the the community lost a significant asset with the godly house at demolition following the earthquakes and a great deal of work has been undertaken by the community association to consult with the community about what could potentially replace that building and what the future use of that site could be and there was great concern I think in the that 's a potential piece of land the council could foreseeably sell and thus remove what is a core component of the diamond harbour region which is the village center the focal point for the community and it 's also the transportation the ferry service we 've submitted that we that we would like to continue the great work that the association in the community of put in around planning for the future development of their site recognizing that the funding limitations across the board and we are seeking funding simply to continue that planning effort on behalf of the community and that 's by way of developing a specific plan for set of plans for their particular site but more broadly the development of what we 've termed a quasi master plan now of course the council have heard a lot about master plans and we recognize that a number of those have stalled simply through funding shortfalls but nonetheless having a plan for the community means that the community actually has something to engage and in terms of understanding its future we were going and how we might achieve our future vision or objectives as a community and so so we 're seeking funding for a planning effort for and on behalf of our regional community recognizing that it has significant growth potential and that as being witnessed through the a lot of building activity and the long-term plan itself which has funded the inner harbor road to the tune of two and a half million dollars over the next five or six years based on increased levels of service for that region I 'd like to move on to to the third funding area where we we seek funding to improve the safety and risk around the the ferry terminal wharf at diamond harbour terminus we 've had some health or safety incidents there in particular someone falling in the water through lack of a reasonable handrail and also improvement to the steps we recognize there 's a long-term potential to to really develop that facility to be really fit for purpose but in the interim we 're seeking some funding just to mitigate the existing risks around passengers moving on and off off of that theory and speaking of the fury I think it 's quite clear that as part of the littles and portrait coveri that the the terminus in little to itself is of significant concern to our community and obviously a lot of submissions going need for an improvement around around whatever is decided in terms of infrastructure and making that fit for purpose as a passenger point of contact in the wider network thanks and moving on to the remaining items within our submission first one in terms of asset ownership the committee has a position which i think is quite clearly outlined there I don 't need to say anything more about at the moment but just note that Peters and a minority on the committee and has a separate point of view which you 're including his own personal submission in terms of the disposal of surplus land there was a an item in attached called the I think it 's called the property action plan that was attached on the website coming below the long-term plan which was essentially misleading in the sense that didn 't actually say that those those action plans were not necessarily been approved in whole or in part by the council and that caused a lot of concern in the community because we actually thought the property action plan that talked about fast-track asset sales for and those areas have got very important public walking tracks and also a an area of restoration with diamond harbour walkway through it with the community has been negotiating for over a year with the council and the Environment Canterbury for the restoration programs through the zone implementation committee and funding and so there 's important things we don 't like fast-track asset sales also that proposed that the land underneath the communities council down at the community center and the Medical Center should also be disposed of fast track so we have no confidence in the property sections proposals and that also want to note that the property sections actions in respect of the restoration project have held up final approval of that project and we 're unable to undertake planting the season because of that the other points about purchase of reserved land I think are quite clear same reopening Givens pass road is to note that we don 't particularly like the approach of the council 's agreed to without reopening of the road beast entirely support the reopening of the road we believe that you chosen money I think you should have gone for a cheaper option terms the harbor wastewater discharge please continue to leave that on track as you have in the long-term plan you 've committed yourself previously to get in that place of word out of the harbor and just to note that the there are community group that 's hoping to set up a reserves committee there to ensure that progress is made on the reserves medicine plan I 'll stop it thank you you mentioned the planting restoration planting program can you just tell us about that and how that was some decent let 's in a gully behind the township and on council land which is freehold land and that we 've negotiated with Environment Canterbury that are the funding provider for it for the restoration work under their immediate steps program and the zone implementation committee supports that we 've spent over a year negotiating we got to what was the final document which the council we understood the council staff had approved and then the council senior counsel people refused to sign it because they wanted no and the community associations of view that we don 't want to engage in a replanting program for restoration of that gallery and this council is prepared to put in some kind of commitment not to have it disposed of and necessarily destroyed by the playing fields by the church no no that 's above above the actual settled Township between it and the what 's called bayview road it 's a very large area of land that was freehold in the council 's ownership now originally purchased by the banks peninsula council for holding for future subdivision and development in terms of the request for funding for a master plan two questions first of all have you got any idea as to the quantum of funding how much would be required to do that and secondly if there was a small amount of funding able to be put on budget rather than perhaps a larger amount would you consider something that just dressed the diamondharbour centers would be beneficial rather than the whole of the southern base I without going back to the Association to put those questions I interpret those the quantum would be based on on a significant amount of voluntary and put from the community which would be obviously a brazzers but I think a minimal summer of seventeen to twenty thousand dollars would ensure that we had some professional important to that that the framing of that planning process to ensure that it complied with all met with the requirements for a council and he can and so forth and the other planning efforts that exist today secondly the the question around the the breath of the the planning scope I think certainly the community 's core focuses on that particular site and the redevelopment of the village center and and that the wider planning effort is probably Alyssa concerned to the community and there for years I think we wouldn 't be an agreement with that proposal just just briefly we had another deputation about the peninsula NPO he 'd London and the possible people asking Council to purchase that that piece of of headland so it was described to us as having lovely send and at times it may and also though the will be your take on and two Scott well how would you describe I guess that piece of beach we have two headlands in question one is my book would point that leads across the quail Island mostly muddy around it and then you have the other headline called per hour headland which leads to repaper Island per hour headland was on the market some four years ago and the council went to negotiations right through to your chief executive level but the sellers wouldn 't accept the price that has three beautiful bays on it sandy base on it and would provide access to repaper Ireland says if we prefer actually if there 's going to be any council involvement and purchase of headlands that we prefer the pure headland be purchased over a point but I i noticed that ahead then is now under offer so that the opportunity may have gone but we did make the note that that some money from sale of the subdivision land at the back of the the township could be directed them to reserve acquisition yes look I 'll keep this reiterate the arm the potential benefits of a local planning FS and this applies both in the minimalist focus on the village centre godly house site itself which is the the one of only two commercially zoned pieces of land on the entire side of our Harbor the other being a bit block of land and church bay so to keep in mind that that that in terms of the community achieving what was defined as its vision as that through our consultation over two or three years post-earthquake a value of panning for that would be that residents can understand the future development pathways and the potentials for that site people can plan for their involvement directly or indirectly and that and that and they 're planning commercial opportunities are understood and can be realized supporting the growing population at a timely manner so in other words we 're not just reactive to council planning processes and the community are really very well endowed with skilled and passionate people willing to take ownership of regional development and wicked partnership with local stakeholders such as the council that he can and the planting that Richard talk to and certainly historically we 've developed our own medical center I 'll biet on council land that you were looking to sell and and that was a local community if it which is an extremely important asset for our side of the harbor given you know the aging demographic there in part so I would encourage you to consider funding us for a planning effort around that site and partly to to surge the community 's concerns around the potential for that site to be divested from council assets and we understand the imperative for that approach but nonetheless I think the community would like to take some comfort from that the other point that I would wish to make on a personal note is around the sale of assets that the counselors considering i 'd like to use the household analogy and that essentially is is that if i had a house and i had some extra assets which were nice to have but not not absolutely necessary and I was facing a dire financial situation I would i would sell those that that my submission is that the council should consider that that action and that really falls within the local government act does find responsibility which is to meet the current and future needs of communities and i think that the current needs outweigh the future needs and the economic rationale for that is that the compounding effect of the rating increases being proposed far outweighs the benefit of future dividend streams from those assets in terms the impact on communities you would never alleviate the rating increase impact on on the rating population with with the dividend stream of those assets and that 's a position that I take I think finally the sale of surplus land needs to be a notified activity as we 've talked to and I think we need to see the methodology for defining waters operationally redundant land and properties within the corporate real estate portfolio I think that that methodology needs to be transparent to the public right across Christchurch it seems to it seemed that there was a very narrow and limited range of properties included and that proposed fast-track land sales and ensuring that all wards were treated equally under that so thank you for your time if there 's any questions I 'm just interested in your comments around particularly a riot you talked about it being because it 's a regulatory framework power consumers to protect from any adverse manat novelistic actions by new owners we 've had quite a few submissions that Wellington who privatized or sold off their power company that they have huge issues when they have natural disasters because of the underinvestment and their network so it 's not necessarily covered by a regulatory framework do you have any thoughts as to the impact that that a private company Evan terms about lines network when it comes to adverse effects such as natural disasters if there 's any benefit of having it remaining in public ownership for that yes I do yeah so my background is reasonably brought in the electricity sector so I understand that that yes there 's a regulatory framework around the around the CPI adjustment CPI plus adjustment but the the need for a readjustment in terms of capital investment following in Christchurch and a ride have dealt with that in the way but have been constrained to some extent by that regulation around lifting prices but my understanding is they can be a reset on the basis of investment and in capital to to bring the network back up to the regulatory standards for service provision that but I would have thought that that was open to and I company whether it was privately or owned by council so odd balance I don 't see that as being a preventing the sale of Orion if they were to want to raise funds to meet those capital needs they would do that under their current ownership my question was so misunderstood yeah thank you you _"

    "text": "and one of the lowly little Valentine 's employees and I was very I 'm new to the job at Valentines I 've only been there for a little over three months and was very excited to suddenly become a commuter with my MetroCard and to go in by bus but I have a lot of commitments after work that don 't allow me to take the bus home and then get to where I need to be afterwards on time so there are several days during the week where I actually need to have the car in order to do the other things that I need to do and so it becomes a bit of an issue for parking the car the other thing is that there are days where the schedule doesn 't run according to what the schedule supposed to be which means that I need to leave for work an hour earlier when I take the bus than i do if i take my own car and an hour 's a lot of time to have to give up so I 'm very Pro bus I that there is a plan for a pedestrian city but there also needs to be an allotment for parking for those of us that need to get in to actually work in addition to which a lot of the shoppers who come in are coming in from places where the buses don 't necessarily run and we want the shoppers to come in and buy big ticket items and take them home and they can 't do that on a bus if the bus doesn 't go where they 're going in even if the bus does go where they 're going a lot of times the items they 're buying our way too heavy for them to be taking on a bus so if we want people coming into the city and supporting the businesses we 've got to give them a place to put the parking but the parking not only has to be affordable it 's got to be somewhere that 's well lit and safe because especially in the winter hours walking out in the dark at night is a little bit scary and in that need to be well lit and I realize as more buildings go up and more activity is happening in the evenings it 'll be a little less conducive to the element that make it a little frightening also thinking about whether and and when it 's cold or wet or windy or all of those things a lot of people don 't necessarily want to take the bus if they can park close to where they 're going so that 's something else to just sort of keep in mind and having grown up in the states where there are lots of issues with parking in big places there are things that can be done like for example maybe finding satellite parking a big place to put cars near the airport or something with a shuttle service that 's designated to a particular business so that people who are going to be working at the justice system could all park there and have buses that run in the morning every 15 minutes for like a you know two hour time period when people are coming in and then again in would be a continual but I think that there are sort of less expensive places to have more expanse of land and I certainly wouldn 't mind parking somewhere and then getting the ride in on a more conducive schedule so I think that 's all I have to say all right oh thanks was thinking like there was a case in Dunedin where someone parked at the stadium and got a really big fine obviously being in the retail sector you probably get people I presume coming in and complaining when things go wrong do you get that kind of feedback from people as well with some private providers around the kind of high levels of just more about the cost of it you know their thought of having to pay that much just you know for it for two hours or whatever and certainly I know a lot of people complain about going to visit sick people in the hospital or particularly if it 's a family member that they 're going to visit in the hospital that people visiting people in the hospital we 're going to pay a huge amount of money just to go for medical care or to visit someone who 's dying or very unwell because the last thing you want to be thinking about is running down and putting money in the meter when you 're with someone who 's not well my pleasure thank you look I have 12 11 seconds left thank you Oh brilliant thank you _"

    "text": "that 's cool thanks Gary Sookie so we 're now in your hands from the garden attorney reserved management committee thank you very much for having me i just like to switch hats now from being wrong trust manager to my volunteer role in the local community and opera been the chair of the garden of tony reserve management committee now i did appear before the council two years ago in the three year plan submission process and i apologize to those of you who are counselors then I 'm just going to slightly repeat some of the information I gave them to see at the garden of Tony into some context because I know we have a lot of new people here who I haven 't appeared before in this role so the garden of Tana is located as you can see up on the slide at the southern end of a Curragh trying to get the mouth up does it seem like it appears on that screen it 's a South off the aquarelle wharf and goes up to the lighthouse just looking up a little more closely clean natives you can see it fronts down onto the upper row of waterfront there and it has the series 's starts cemeteries anglican Senate fee on one side and the descendants and catholic cemetery on the other side so just to give you a little history the garden of tiny began in the 1880s it was called the akaroa domain and it was planted and exotic species to form an arboretum like garden for occur it was very well maintained originally but then during World War one and World War two when men were away the garden fell on hard times and weeds got away underneath but also and understory of native plants now it 's been very neglected for many years so by the time our reserve management committee came into being and 2012 that was poorly maintained under invested in underused and there was confusion in the immunity as to whether it was a bush or a you know bush reserve or a domain and it 's also covered in an absolute myriad of tracks I 'd like to thank the rod don 't trust for allowing might see in allowing us to the garden of Tony committee to use the map of the garden of Tony which was developed for the road Donald trusts walking products which we handed out the trust to you last year so it finally makes sense of all the many tracks in the garden of tonics primarily years for walking so in terms of reserve management a reserve management plan was developed by the Christ trips in Council in 2010 consulted on and adopted then of course there 's equate so there was a big hiatus before the reserve management committee was appointed in 2012 those of us who then came on the committee revet shocked to find that there was absolutely no funding for the garden of tony despite the management plan which had a lot of funding listed in the back so that 's when I came before you and did secure some funding thank you very much indeed for that so what I 'd like to do now is report to you on progress we 've made with the funding that you allocated for us and recommend some draft LTP so we 're very pleased the garden of tony is in this time but basically we want to recommend that you smooth the funding out and actually cut out some of the think big stuff so we 're actually asking you in the submission for less money rather than move so just to let you know who we are we are a core group of seven people we have two rly or had two key scientists on there the person who relocated the tools to agora a peninsula excavations contractor our heritage person from the museum and so on we 're a really amazing group sadly and I must pay tribute to dr. Warrick Harris our plant scientist who really worked hard for the garden he moved to donate and earlier this year but we 've been very lucky to get a lovely young man called stealing Rob Berger who started landscape design business in akaroa and it 's a real star and it 's dipping into Warwick shoes so we 're still a strong committee and in the three year plan I want you can see it planting interpretation making furniture and has control and this is the funding that you granted us two and a half years ago or two years ago and so we 're nearly through 2014 15 at this stage so what have we done well first of all we defined the priorities of all those hate the tracks where were we even going to start in this overgrown wilderness we designed projects swim some at the management plan we 've had several working beers with wonderful akaroa Lions Club and we 've been focusing on clearing and cleaning up and things that are beyond the scope of volunteers to do we have worked with Ian jacks and the bank 's pronuncia contracts manager to engage local contractors to do work so here 's an example of a contractor working to remove a Sequoia log that had been left abandoned by the side of the tractor rocked he 's pulling it out with that digger we took it off to the local sawmill the sawmill who don right melded up into these big Fletcher 's for us here 's our Lions Club making picnic tables made from the Sequoia that would have just been left to rot in the garden in place we 've also done a lot of track work here 's a before and here 's an after from one of our working bees the main circular track round the garden of time is now accessible by mobility scooters and a cemetery link track that 's the worst that we tackled in the B and then we 've had contractors in who 's just completed during the whole track Emma trees together this is in time for the hundred and seventy fifth anniversary of the arrival of the French Compton party settlers so they 'll be able to walk from between the two cemeteries to see ha who converted from being a Catholic to an Anglican over the first generation of settlement and our latest project is planting the main entrance gardens Warwick had this dream of planting plants of importance to mari and pre-european times of plants discovered and named by French botanists and an avenue of co fires along the roadside those have gone in with the help of in a working be just a week and a half ago so that was pretty full-on that we 've got a lot done and we 've also had a pest control program we 've been pretty successful an hour just running at a low level so our progress is being noted a lot more people of finding the news in the garden we 've had letters of appreciation and the aquarelle mail we 've had groups like the RSA coming to us wanting to plant ceremonial glibly pine in the garden of Tommy or wollemi pine is going in a commemorative tree for the French 170 fifth is going in and we 'd really like to thank maintenance of contract manager Ian Jackson PES support here so I think leaving the council at least as jobs been disestablished from the end of the year he has been fantastic because basically he just helped us to get on with it he 's come to our meetings he 's been really great to work with so to the submission fear you have the draft plan amounts for the next three years 24 could you please smooth out out so that we have 20k each year that way we can just keep getting on with our tracks krantz and into projects otherwise we 'll stall for a year and that 'll be awful and I want to say that you know these amounts that went into the LTP were done without any consultation with the reserve management committee we requested a breakdown of the information and we weren 't able to get one we 've got no detail on it so this we were told come and make a submission this is your chance as a reserve management committee we think we should be involved much earlier in the process and then looking forward you 'll see there 's some pretty big amounts in the plan for 2018 onwards we don 't actually think those large amounts are that necessary apart from 2019 20 where we lost to retain that amount so that we can do our really exciting new things with the playground which is putting in a treetop maybe a flying fox or something for big kids to have a hell don 't think otherwise there 's need for big scale capital works and if you keep on our little committee trotting away we 'll have got all the walkways done we 've got the schools to do the Heritage in our committee but the big issue is maintenance so we don 't want you cutting the maintenance budgets this garden of Tony once we put you put the capital investment into it an hour volunteer labor it needs the people who round and clear the gutters on the tracks and cutaway branches that fall and that type of thing to keep it open so please don 't cut the maintenance budget but we don 't think you need to spend so much on the capital so thank you very much for listening to me and I 'm happy to take your questions thank you that was very clear indeed are there any questions Jimmy we should we cut into the you 're the kind of order Tasker in relation to your funding because your paste come to a pole and read the cultural program still going on am I right for the ten years but you didn 't mention this item where the father fronting has like that is volunteer so when we 've got the traps now actually last year we had a Duke of Edinburgh school kid who went round at the weekends and check the traps and so that 's something that we can manage as volunteers I don 't think we need a lot of money spent on that and I mean I 've put up the basics there on the list but I mean what we want is a committee is the flexibility to manage those funds and so a pest issue comes up you know we can tackle it okay thank you very much what you were asking for was very clear thank you thank you very much a long a baby for your support that 's enabled us to get going Thank Sookie and is Pete Simpson here IP are you okay to go now yeah yep you can do however you want to yeah _"

    "text": "thank you you want to thank you madam deputy mayor and councillors it 's um isn 't it great to see Pete still involved in um I just wanted to the TSA 's will be my final presentation as me of as I got confused trying to remember that you were deep ademia not me second team at a table calling you made a mere four years so as chairman of the rod Donald trust as I 'm standing down and thank you very much for your appointment is of the new trustees who will be excellent what we 're going to do we 're going to look at one item that 's already in the ltp two items that need tweaking and one item that has no cost implications so the rod Donald trust covers the area of the peninsula which you 're well aware of and the trust were was set up with endowment funds from the old council we 're using the council 's public space strategy which was adopted by the council in 2010 and it was as a result of consultation and working with landowners the littleton head-to-head walkway Andrew Turner our trust member will be pleased to see this singing help write it and and the green lines show where the tracks already exist or there are public connections the red lines show private land crossings and we support the funding provided for this project and the LTP these are four of the groups that we work with on the peninsula the banks peninsula Conservation Trust the Orton Bradley pact we put funding into both of those groups each year the passion for the port hills and the quail island and these are all working to support the environmental and ecological health of the peninsula and three of them of support public access the Little River Rail Trail needs to be fully connected to the city cycleway network it 's becoming more widely used as the and as a key to the Little River Community Development we 're pretty enthusiastic about that I 'm sorry I forgot to my phone off and the good enough yeah the smash it against them I guess what my hobby is um but the off-road connection from a a city cycle way as well as to the old tight at we rode we think that that 's something that 's quite important this will enable people from port hills eastern and central areas to access the trail safely on their bikes when when banks peninsula became part of the city we had a first delegation that challenged the way we 'd operated as a council when the local community came to us and asked us for the materials to repair their their wolf and that they did not want any assistance other than the materials which was just appeared these are an important part of the bank 's financial and need council support and they are widely sebab viously left a message the and the trust supports are the council 's intention to work with the communities on these Worf 's now this is one of the council staff members beside a small rock that had fallen on the road and we 're a huge fan of the regional packs team and we just want to say to you that they play an important role of linking together support their their position and the council we think they need to be acknowledged for what they do and we 're concerned about their satisfaction reduce satisfaction levels and their budget so we think they need this the support the key issue that we want to raise with you today is to call for the council to embrace and this will be something that will the stats the process rather than an end in itself we are we have stitched together whatever you like to call the son of the spine of the lizard we 've worked with we 're looking to link air existing networks on the on the peninsula and we have been working largely with doc but for instance there 's something on this network that 's actually pretty spectacular that people talk about the tanning mahoota and the north of the north island there is a 2000 year old tree on this on this network that in fact we don 't acknowledge as a local community and it 's pretty important and the project commenced in june 2013 when the trust and doc signed an MoU since the council regional packs team have been absolutely amazing and we are now seeking an endorsement by the trust so that we can get people to to sort of gross support and knowledge of walking in an area which is part of the city the highly accessible easy to walk and there 's a group of kids that had their seven-year-old a 7 year old birthday party and the hat that I 'll talk about the few minutes so there 's a lot of environmental understanding that needs to be gathered up and and to teach our children and our families and Christchurch that within the city of christchurch we 've got all these amazing opportunities we have handed out the book on the on the project so and i 'll just go so the this is we 're out talking with tramping clubs we 're talking to schools we 're talking to we 've had a research project done at Lincoln University of how we can engage young people in the area and we 're trying to actually bring in Lincoln 's knowledge base our experience our networks progress to date you 'll see on the left hand side is a hut that our trust has purchased and I think this will be the first hat built in the network since nineteen sixteen Oh some very little ones have been up and down with tramping clubs back in the 30s 40s and 50s but it 's the most significant progress is the bits that they 've had on the right hand side as a sign of the pack horse which was one of cereals hats and this is our Hatters that is enabling people to actually continue a and it can be a two-day trip doc have a capital bed unto mark and signpost the tracks the packhorse hat is also subject to earthquake cam repairs so and we 're also working with key landowners to secure public access so basically what we are saying is as a trust is to retain in the plan your littleton head-to-head your financial organization grants to adjust to connect the Little River Rail Trail two holes will speed up assistance for Wolfson jetties don 't cut the regional parks budget and project for the council to embrace thank you was I inside 10 minutes that she who is without sin cast the first day the the names of the wrote the roads or the route that you wanted the cycleways at paul 's well again horse Walter city was it yeah the halls well linking the end of the cycle way and halls well through at least as far as the beginning of the old tight aku road it kept very short section along what is effectively state highway 75 that enables cyclists to join the Little River Rail Trail where 's at the moment you have the trail called the Little River link but really what that is is a link out to horn being who as a recreational cyclist is going to cycle to horn be in order to cycle back right I think your dryer quite catch that thank you for your hand signals from the car the other day Gary so I knew which way you were going I was able to signal to homeless II drove past only about it later but just that I noticed the bank if you got some good sort of community partnerships theatre working with dr. Segal to try and you know clear some of those trails and there is an issue with weeds but we have we have cleared the track behind Mount Bradley and it has been open for the last 18 months so you can now walk through from packhorse Hut to the summit of Mount Herbert and the trust paid in conjunction with doc out of the joint fund to get a contractor up that and clear it and it still clear last time I went through quite walkable just seemed to be a fair bit of were introduced Suki Thompson he works trust here 's the brains right I see certain some of the pictures to there 's a few cross-country cyclists in the Moto 's which is great and there is a group who are working hard on the sales side of the hills even around up a hunt spree part I 'm just wondering if there 's a way for and that they 're working with the regional parks people to Gary so the be able to be linked what is it with these one was it oh so he can well we went spoke to I presume you 're talking about the mount vernon Park tribute video and the summit round not trust themselves it 's a separate group of it do enthusiasts at cross country cyclists okay yeah yeah and we can certainly work within we see cycling access along but you really can only get as far as packhorse out on a bike at the moment you can 't get any further and at this stage we 're really concentrating on getting it as a walking route to start with because it 's technically pretty difficult to get it as a cycling rule I see that at the focus is just at how we have the spiral next and there 's some pretty exciting potential around little river yeah in and out a little river and that could actually make Little River pretty spectacular century center center for cycling excellent yes we 've had um a group from governor 's by about the wolf we 've here down the Robertsons Bay the aircar wharf regards to all those groups you know they 've all got skills they 've all got ability to find materials have you as an organization been working with each group because they 've come to us individually and what thinking was that if they all got together out with the assistance of a group but your whatever and then came to the council said these of what this is what we 've got this is what we can get together I mean that 's the sort of thing that Andrew and Sookie could I 'm very conscious I can 't make promises now and but Sookie and Andrew may be able to pick that one up about how it 's handled because it is it is a very important part of the local community and it needs a very big community input to make it happen so because I 've just know sort of presentations we 've had we 've got very clever people in each of these communities but if they actually pulled the resources in the context but maybe need assistance to buy it I that they 'd had an overzealous engineer designing some of it and it needed to actually have a very hard look at the costing and in and I 'd that 's what I would be looking at it but the beauty of a trust like houses that we are there amongst the community and Sookie has just got a phenomenal network on the ground so we should yep pick out we can run thank you you 'll see me later I see that _"

    "text": "it 's about 11 so we 're going to hold the morning tea after Pete Simpson as that 's oh okay slightly later than what we did and then Leanne will join us after that hopefully she 's feeling about the Death Watch that 's a welcome and just to remind everybody who 's making submissions especially you Gary that you are being live-streamed and this morning we are starting with a temperate and residents association and it 's not Val as Peter so welcome Peter come on up make yourself at home and you 've got 10 minutes to tell us about anything you want to what what 's happening attempted I competed Thank You deputy beer and counselors what 's once again we appear no fool I know full well was only ten minutes so we 'll we 'll have to take a few things in here the tip of the residents association would like to acknowledge that the Christchurch City Council has had a huge task repairing our city after the devastating earthquakes as well as the ongoing repair work also planning for much need new infrastructure is important to them as there is its association we would like to cover a few important issues for the community of templeton please note these issues have been brought up before mr. christchurch city city council in short-term and the long-term plans and in your voice submissions these issues are still very important to our community roads footpaths cycleways public transport sport regulator and recreation storm water and flood protection community support we recognize that the long-term plan is for the Christchurch City Council residents but we would really like to comment on a few topics of high importance to tell them the above-named issues we are to agree in the submission I at past and present issues still not completely addressed and over on going and not sold and still very important to the whole community of temperature and of issue is also faced in many other communities around Christ years roads and footpaths the main thing was the roads and footpaths that we are concerned about is most of the footpaths intended and I must say are in pretty good condition and that if people bring the normally actually pretty quickly and we we acknowledge that upgrading continuous continued maintenance of local footpaths is crucial to the safety and convenience for all residents and visitors tra would like to see an upgrade of some footpath take place in the short term rather than the long term to ensure Public Safety for all users for instance between Tim Burton and the tendon shops there are no footpaths whatsoever there is the main highway and water Lee Road both of which carry a huge amount of traffic these days so therefore our suggestion and it would be our request would be from curt raid which is the main sort of greg up tempted to bars raid which is the next road about a mile down the road for cycleway flash footpath at present there is nothing there at all there 's a huge amount of traffic going down both roads water Lee Road is extremely busy now because of the Waterloo Park area which is an ongoing and will be quite a large industrial area and people for instance pushing a push to you Adam I bracket and what that road and then on the main highway that would take the life in the hands so yeah that 's really important to us we need to ensure that Waterman cycling pars provide choices for travel options and contribute to easier getting around the present it 's a hazard as what to sit so that Dunham done and dusted we 'll get on to public transport public bus service we believe that the City Council should own hole with the buses and not as it is that prison and as it used to be so that 's one thing the islington re League of this journey currently travels down the main south road turns into holes from Junction Road and then through islington along what will be right to temple we suggest for following alternate route to capture more people as you go down water Lee Road that 's virtually nothing on the main highway if the bus came down the main highway straight through and turned at bars right now of course we do know that there 's going to be a change to buy us road which will they are figuring out another another road with with lights on the main south road and that would be easily but they 've got a camping pack theme of every 100 residents for instance just near the isn 't and hotel for those that don 't know the area and it would be a more logical way to to provide a satisfactory bathroom or guinness or the tuxedos and the priority should be given to bus stop some of our bus stops if you went and saw them it is horrendous they gravel with great pits when it rains people have to step out into the water or the bus driver has to stop on the road look at people get out which is a hazard to the traffic behind say sometimes we we wish we would see some people out there to have to really have a look at some of these things and editor and it 's not a big deal we 've got almost to fix these some of these things what 's the flooding in the bus stops and also lighting for safety over Rick okay the road that 's what currently happens the diesel that we use in New Zealanders is it makes the worst in the world and the hazard from from the castle engines from diesel we would stop people have this word they caught light rails over there are beautiful trends in some cities in the world brecon used to have them or city used to happen and it 's a quick way of moving people from point A to point B and you don 't for all carcinogens in the air I 'm not a scientist so don 't ask me questions if you want us to ask these asking questions you need to leave some time at the end o people what was it if you want us to be able to ask your questions you need to leave some time at the end of your dear minutes ok so the consideration for light rail recreation and leisure we have a lovely swim in the pool terminal but the hours were increased by one week this last season we 'd like to see it increased a little more the reasons Sun it 's great meeting place for everyone especially children and youth in the community there are no other pools in the region except at Ralston so nothing in hall be of course you know and say well and improved and improved time for the swimming pool would be appreciated or a further than to stormwater the storm water and flood protection in creek road is shocking you don 't require great amount of rain streets are flooded three blocks up from the railway line which is to rely street and in front of the chemist and doctor and all those places when the buses there 's a bus stop right in front of there when they have to pull into their frequently the driver has to pull up basically on the road and can 't get in toward the bus stop and it just keeps flooding and flooding all the time so we 're and this has been an ongoing thing for about 10 years sorry well once again we 'd like to see something done about that and we do realize that constraints the counselor under but safety of the other things community support we know that the software service center is in my words condemned but we certainly need something in the horn be written templeton area where we can go we 've already got two days i think it is where you can go to the to the local library very council people are but we would certainly like to see us with a new a new community community area whether people can go and and get not having to go to likes of Finland or halls and hopeful I believe we 've got a new a new area but there let 's think hornyon what have you as well so that 's one of the things and in summary the council and indeed christchurch node how important strong communities are we feel it is very important to permanently fix and really maintain current infrastructure we already have before us you protect your projects the above-named issues are still very much top of their wish list and we would like to reiterate how very important we feel these are to the community as a whole we issues and obviously feel they should be addressed as soon as possible we strongly believe the council funds should be used once to properly fix and maintain the current infrastructure rather than working on quick fix often resulting in more time and money to refix the land not once but many times sorry Pete we 've got we 've got their pride lesson we 've already but Jimmy is busting to ask you a question so I 'm just going to leave a little bit hope you won 't cool hey one question of Peter because you raised the issue of the flooding issue in Holmby but in temperature area for many years my understanding the council also dealing with issue for many years how is your recommendation how to you know to to fix the least the problem in common entity rather than the temporary what 's your recommendation well we did we definitely know that we can 't get all the dish drains fixed but most certainly in front of the area which is used constantly the doctors the hairdresser the the pharmacy and so forth in front a lot of concrete things that go across the dish drain I think there 's about twenty two of them in line the only drain we sort of wish to be fixed at this point in time is from the Howie street to Rio a terrace not all the others just that one piece just to put a standard curve in not one of those dish dish taught kids even getting off a bus well my agents they 're difficult to step from the bus onto the footpath so that 's that 's really important to us as is the footpath cycle way this is going to be the quickest question ever and we have the same problem in littleton with the swimming pool that you described in templeton wanting a longer season what specifically would you be looking for ah about another three weeks and when do you want those three weeks to be have from februari on or three weeks at the end of the season is thank you and that 's that 's what 's a pretty cool people here the safety people of it are they yep thank you very much okay thank you _"

    "text": "and you 're welcome William restaurant Anderson yeah welcome and so what happens is you 've got five minutes and you 're allowed to use it however you like so you 're allowed to talk to us for five minutes or talk to us for some of it and laugh a time for questions or whatever you want to do you concern that that 's it 's all fine welcome anywhere thank you for coming in at nighttime so William we 've got your submission in front of us Michael Knight look who isn 't ah it is and your brain you 're being live-streamed so you become a youtube sensation I know I 'm so basically thanks for thanks for the opportunity to speak um about parking in the central city I grew up in London I lived in London and it 's one of those things where you would never dream of driving into the central city and parking in London it just wouldn 't happen you take the bus or the underground and we grow up like that but for some reason Christchurch and New Zealanders are it seems that you literally drive park outside the door and go shopping and the concerns that I have and I know a lot of people other people have as well is that we 're losing so much parking in the central city and every great development that keeps coming up we lose more of it and by the end of 2016 there 's meant to be all these building something can be fantastic but we 're gonna have nowhere to park and enjoy them which is the concerns that I have um working at Valentines as a duty manager especially on a sunday and monday we get i get repeated questions and concerns from the public as well as our own staff wondering where we part where can we park and a lot of them have either gone around the block several times looking for parking and haven 't found it and just I feel it 's going to get worse as with the central city of almost that 's about all I have well that was incredibly succinct Thank You Jamie Oh lots of questions Jamie yeah Nia if all goes to plan and literal car park was to come down in October would you prefer that there was perhaps pause button pushed to have at great parking there to accommodate parking over there busy Christmas period and I 'm Dean perhaps construct the building a little bit later once once thats past or would you prefer that you scotland to immediately go with sacrifice parking over there busy period in the short term i think from the public 's point of view um pause it have it as flat land available for parking preferably by the council or not a third party and then ya later on in the winter period look at rebuilding obvious it 's going to take longer than that ya know it sounds sensible things I 'm thinking for submission and you talk about your experience living elsewhere overseas other cities or in the world I was just interested in your view on you know obviously council as part of this proposal is saying we think the private developers should provide car parking and we don 't need to do it as a a strategic s immersed well that 's our proposal can you just maybe just just just say why you think it 's important that it 's council-owned and if you see it as the council wing should be the strategic s owner of it or whether we should just leave it to the private market I think I think we need both um the concerns that I have around the private market would be cost of how much it is where 's at least if it was council it could be regulated and cost before the earthquake it was great because we had lots of different options we had private we had counsel but it was the the council was cheaper and we had the free hours and a lot over and that would probably be my concern that if it was removed and it was just privatized then they can make up as much profit early as they want out of it that would still put people off from coming into central city parking and going shopping that go to one of the free options out of town Nathan particular mentioned off street parking facility in CBD is not a strategic asset could be considered to be solved if council only you know to provide the old street parking facility rather than off street parking facility what is your point of view in the CBD um I think on street parking is important but then I would probably be preferred I prefer off street parking opposed to on street parking if that makes it thanks William Gladys rescued like if you just like to look out for it at a Knicks council meeting haven 't seen each individually unfortunately but there should be a packing report and there which will refer to yep it 's it 's clear there 's a short shortage of the short-term parking which we hope will be temporary but I just want to ask you about the once for example the bus exchanges and the buses are running bit in a better way yeah would you see potential then for staff to be able to commute on to go to work on the bus and go home of us rather than taking up the 's a completely different submission i think there 's been recent changes to the bus route and this is what i 'm hearing that aren 't necessarily in favor of where some of our staff live and that 's another whole topic for another day the cost would be one thing that I also hear about the bus stiffening for staff I think staff and people that work in the central city should take public transport and leave it full mainly shoppers I think it would be unfair to think that every shopper can take a big item home on a bus after shopping in town yep yep some of you thinks if you look at that report to and because I think it would be good if business people make you know have some discussions with their staff around that plaque they updated pain really thinking thank you ever know it 's good fun _"

    "text": "and making the time to make it 's a mess honest though thank you I 've next got the governor 's Bay GT restoration trusses this you Simon yes me what 's you okay thank you very much i head understood we 're getting ten minutes of it yeah because you 're a group well it 's the difference yes that 's fine my name is silent marco i am a member of the board of the governor 's by Gd restoration trust i felt board members i 'm gonna sleep about six minutes per my fellow board members a talented group of individuals did I come with you yes so yeah well they 'll come up individually image no I 'm good enough cheers here to tell you to come home feel free to just steal any yet you want to but you 've got 10 minutes in total you understand thank you yes right so they 're a talented group of individuals will introduce themselves following presentation highlighting their skills necessary to repair the jetty where a group were well organized grid lots of people have expressed support very close to home today is my footy third wedding anniversary when I asked Belinda to excuse me from my usual dinner date and having forgotten to buy her a present her response is typical of that commitment say the GT is all I want not a big ask the GD is a popular destination for people from throughout Christchurch how many counselors how many counselors have actually walked long it and it mired in the views of lyttelton harbour oh that 's good on because those who haven 't_''_89.549 I suggest should possibly get out of their own backyard to get out from to their own backyard and also possibly excuse themselves from this process we have lost so much in our built environment that was once so familiar closed off buildings streets and of course the jetty lying in disrepair continuing reminders of what we have lost a sense of place so important to us has preserved in those places we protect and we love the GT is such a place right press right I meant to give you a sense of ambience here with pictures what we doing things together with a common purpose that sense of community a commandment is a critical component in a healthy recovery this is all 9 i 'm not going to dwell on the g d 's immunity value the unique experience of a 300-meter walkway over water in a stunning on setting the benefits of restoring the GD are obvious we know from experience and you will know from our solutions hopefully the question thank you the questions that remain of concern er what contributions will be made by counsel what conscious my contributions will be made by the community and over what period of time the GD be restored they 're the three questions which I posed to you the trust proposes a partnering relationship expressed through a memoranda of understanding where both parties make meaningful commitments the relationship offer significant benefits the raising of monies the contribution of new skills community engagement spending your own money for the public good focuses one 's mind on a number of issues like never before you seek value for money you question how things might be done better you want a make a reasonable contribution and you do not argue what should have been done but rather what can be done the board of the trust has examined the reports and other information available to it we recognize there is a need for further investigation particularly surrounding the repair methodology and costing since the ferry meeting the board has met with two exceptions every week there has been countless discussions about outside those meetings we have raised the awareness of the public we have canvassed fundraising opportunities already we 've already raised monies and insult t-shirts not haven 't bought one yet they 're running out of stock websites up and running press and TV interviews we have our concerns about surrounding the costings and repair strategy and this is I think is a good example of what needs to be done that are outlined in the council 's Oh cell report I don 't know how many of you read it the report says it will take 225 working days to repair the jetty by 10 workers projected labor costs total 1.6 million dollars plus a 15-percent contingency to cover to 70 thousand dollars per day or seven hundred dollars for each worker whether that be a person holds up the flag the specialist on the drill whatever seven hundred dollars per day for that that 's equivalent of about a hundred eighty yards and plus per annum per worker we think we can do better the report proposes the GD be restored from barges by the sit on the sea reliant on the tide and conveying men and materials from Littleton each day our engineers on the other hand are of the view that the GD can be restored from the land as opposed to from the sea this will take less time and get early runs on the board it 's all about asking the right questions of getting the right investigation going the report suggests that trucks delivering services and materials to the site could not turn in the area of the pad the base of the jetty riskiness well known in the transport industry on who 's on our board challenges their view from his own experience there again we have also offers of support offers at competitive rates already assessed our ability to raise money this is what it 's all about we have assessed our own ability to raise money we 've spoken with those experience and fundraising the start of that process already we have Dennis I 'll Ridge on the board and who 's well-versed in this challenge I simile have experienced both from acting form fflint philanthropic trust as well as in raising monies for that for not-for-profit sector but we cannot do it alone while we expect significant savings to be made a significant sum still needs to be raised we need mostly to be realistic those who contribute funds need to believe this total sum is achievable the council will need to the counselors contribution will encourage public funding community involvement and commitment Council and work for whatever we can gage County intends to put off the work until about after 2023 or beyond by that date will not be a repair it will be a replacement costing vast in excess of what is now aged we will lose the opportunity for the restoration to be part of the on the taxpayer on the ratepayer it is far better for council to contribute now the sum of one dollar fifty for every one dollar raised by the trust there 's one dollar fifty three dollar raised by the trust the ocl report was hopeful in one respect the cost of demolishing legit he would like likely be in the region of eight hundred thousand dollars it is far better i suggest to contribute to the recovery than to its destruction the restoration of the 30 meter long jetty is a major undertaking it is far greater than any other GT that we 've been talking to and go in the basement apart from the the acro jetty of course and of course the harbor the port but as it is the most significant contribution in growth the community both of Governors Bay all of the potential and we believe of wider Christchurch I suggest as I prepared to give that commandment they prepared to give that commander of community involvement that the chip provided that the jetty be restored in three to four years the community contribution speeds made council make a contribution of a dollar fifty forever dollar raised by the community are some in the order of 1 million eight hundred seventy-five thousand dollars at worst we think it will be significantly less than that we 're not saying we want a particular sum of money we think we can say make the savings that will be born also by the counter by the community at large through the council we 're talking about a partner in relationship we 're talking about a commitment to contribution thank you now just like to introduce these lows of my fellow board members are here briefly how am I going for time I must be one of the dangers of having that picture up in front of us that it moves the time to miss ago good evening hello there I 'm Nick hold I am a chartered professional engineer specializing in geotechnical earthquake engineering foundation engineering design risk management and related subjects lemond the trust hi I 'm Phil Jackson I started life as a land surveyor with the Christchurch City Council actually I now we 're putting technology large part of the piling process has been surveying the positions and positioning the piles by using GPS and other electronic techniques we can do this better and cheaper hello I 'm Rick 's Gibby I the manager of excellence transport I 've lived on the financial all my life the Gibby 's originally came out before the fierce warships governor 's bar is very passionate to us and I bring to the trust a lot of experience as a practical person and the transport of materials and I know here we can do it safely in economically hello I 'm Dennis Aldridge i 'm currently CEO of living springs i 'm also a member of the littleton mound hobart community board I have some experience in fundraising also immobilizing communities around the common cause and we are very much of the persuasion that this partnership model can really work we fully understand the challenges that this council faces in the post-quake hero but we believe this could be a model for a number of other initiatives as well going forward and we really believe that together we can make professional writer and I have written about health and safety law an employment law for 20-odd years so what I bring to this project is communications or maintain the website communicate with the community and write thank you letters and also my husband is a senior project management senior project manager for Airways and he 's offered to manage the project to Brighton bloggers get in here everybody thanks for your time I 'm nicked again and consult civil engineer the other Nick and we have a similar taste in shirts and jump as well as it and a similar interest obviously in repairing the jetty an appropriate form and it 's quite disappointing to stand before you as an engineer to suggest some costings of perhaps done on it back of a packet but I think in this instance it may be detriment to to the jetty and that 's a very important point to us also in his absence is Nigel Hillier and some of you may be familiar with Nigel he perhaps watching on TV so hi Nigel up in Wellington tonight and he has a particular being restored it 's a huge important part to our our community as it is to the broader community of christ church and yeah we I think we 've made our point of saving and we wish you all the world and making the right decision thank you very short question the people of New Brighton had had a problem with the pier years ago and actually called the council 's bluff I suppose in the end that if we raise X amount of dollars will you match it and thinking I think that council wouldn 't the community I stirred say wouldn 't raise it would you would your trust be more amenable to sort of looking at the overall cost of this project and saying well it 's going to cost X amount of dollars if we if we raise this amount of money will you put in the rest well I think the important thing is that we think it 's the partnering relationship where I we contribute a certain proportion so it said it 's a dollar for dollar fifty and we raved that the figure how much we could raise within the governor 's bay community we and we analyzed who the population was the income earnings to that community the 800 people we knew how many families that work what what the income spread was so we raised then we identify what we thought we could raise through the banks peninsula generally committee and then we looked at greater Christchurch we looked at by philanthropy would give we 've analyzed this to death and with it taking analysis of from fundraisers themselves as a sound familiar with that area so it wasn 't sort of a foger puck daddy and said how much to reckon we can push out of the council it was really carefully considered some which was a rope to be raised over three to four year period we think we can do it in three years of let have let them or less but we 've got most importantly we want to be realistic we didn 't want to simply raise expectations and then fail in there and that outcome and so you know we are a determined bunch of our calculations and it 's not just the money we want to bring expertise to this too we believe that a bit of techniques and new techniques that weren 't available to the council engineers that consider this two years ago but our available now can substantially reduce the cost so we want to bring that I think it 's just I 'm pretty confused because you 've put a lot of pro bono work obviously being chucked at the Seaview yeah yeah that 's my boner how much so this is your table here and that doesn 't include pro bono so this is all basically image this case it 's all material costs capital yeah our contribution your see through our submission is all is a cash commitment doesn 't include we haven 't sort of value added the the pro bono work which would be very significant no so what you lift within your costings is actually for materials materials and labor I mean to be a labor costs I mean we 're not suggesting that I mean I 'm at my grand old age get kind we 're expecting that professionals will that what we 're saying is we have the expertise the professional expertise yeah to deliver the outcome but notice any physically do it ourselves I must say that even though I have been there was quite a few years ago I didn 't realize it was such a long its massive 300 meters well it 's the same length as new brighton I think new brightens 300 meters today and just low tide it still goes dry but it enables you to get to the water plus or minus five hours of high tide instead of plus or minus one and a half two from the beach just one final point I just on cost and how amazing these things that the seven hundred dollars per day assumes that you got to hopefully you wouldn 't normally show him a full day 's work but everyone knows that tides come and go and I would see us the actual tired of actual the ability actually work and get barges back in from littleton I would suggest that a maximum of seven and one comfort i could give you other examples well now basically I 've got really done my additionally I think thanks to you _"

keep to it so welcome and we are completely in your hands and you can use the five minutes however you want we 've got your seat I 'm yeah yeah go yeah go for it so thanks thank you for this opportunity and my name is Joey and McGregor I believe I offer a speech perspective of our long-term recent in ratepayer property owner a business owner we 've operated on base their construction business here in Christchurch for over 25 years and we employed mini-crisis restaurants over their time and our mother and your long-term plan indicates ongoing operating costs of around 450 million a year in 4.7 billion over 10 years in capital expenditure which is mostly in addition to the 2.8 billion that you 've previously included in the 2013 plan I found it difficult to understand whether the figures in your capital program included eats or excluded included the anticipated funds from your insurance claims your long-term plan anticipate significant rates increases where average rates will almost double over the next 10 years significant additional borrowing in releasing capital by selling assets agree all those options should be considered they find on a plane it may be a modest one off Olivia all right players and another option you should be considering i think doubling in your rates and 10 years seems excessive and unnecessarily tough on ratepayers i support something some idiot sales particularly prioritizing those asset sales they will achieve more than simply realize in cash for the council and the city sales that provide more investment and Christchurch better returns higher employment I don 't believe our Orion 's here to be sold you get good dividends from Orion and you should hang on to them the big picture view of your spending though that 's laid out by the long-term plan seems to be based on the presumption that is counsel you can charge more rates which means greater revenues and therefore more that you can borrow they 're currently interest rates a low interest rates council can borrow even more problem solved please don 't lose sight of the actual amount of debt in the actual amount of assets that you 're contemplating to sell I find the amount staggering the spending that the long-term plan requires the funding is excessive I think it reflects the desires of a large bureaucratic and operational organisation not really the desires of the community in the amounts of spinning are pretty unprecedented and they also be questioned by yourselves as counselors please just slow down there are so many uncertainties to you will the value of the assets be realized as you have anticipated what are the final amounts for insurance payouts on central steelman 's will your interest rates remain low at low levels and the long term over the teenies of the plane have you adequately provided for the possibility of an economic down to the final costs of your obligations to school and finally known that increased capital and operational top of your car sharing arrangements with crown are only estimated growth may not be assumed rate see revenues not is protected the council planning to contract major building products over the next 2-3 years and the peak of the rebuild activity when the costs and certainly we 'll be at its highest I don 't believe the long-term plan describes spending and the Weiss wisest way and for the best outcomes for Christchurch you don 't have the resources of the New Zealand government at your disposal to assist with managing all these uncertainties you need to take a more measured approach scale back your borrowings you 're spending your s in sales in your rent increases you 've got the opportunity smart past councils have been really smart and delivered fantastic things for Christchurch your circumstances are more difficult but as today 's council you can continue the legacy of them very smart and very astute just slow down take a long-term view of your planning many of the new facilities you 've provided for us over the past 10 to 15 years are fine in operating the large budgets to retain or replace older facilities like the Town Hall the Metro sports in the eastern of cotton 13 to spending at the Art Gallery and Christ ships are all in the first quarter of the long-term plan seemed like rushing into those projects to further spending into the second or third quarter of the long-term plan at the very least explore all the options what 's bending is truly necessary the long-term plan expects that communities facilities are going to be repaired or rebuilt using the insurance proceeds why are you not taking the same approach with these larger projects shouldn 't those advocating for the larger projects be more accountable for their spending a more rigid and capable approach can be taken defer all the major community facilities projects and your financial strategy till the second or third quarter defer the rebuild of AMI Stadium and definitely kept the spending on improvements to major community facilities million over and above your insurance proceeds say 400 million that 's not possible don 't go ahead with all the major community facility projects accept insurance settlements and lower appearing and improving the projects for the projects that do go ahead the best offers you 'll get the best offers from that default defer all your spending defined as increased levels of service over and above speeding let 's describe and Yorkshire plan is committed to the core and growth and make further savings from the two years capital spending in operations building because we 're in construction I knowledge about the different contracts that are out there at the moment Joanne you need to avoid it up yeah sorry we 've got a long way over x oh sorry just if you could just yes sir to my last paragraph is here just about the contracts that are out there for building projects i think council you 've hit some pretty valuable experience over the years with building contracts you 've made the most of the capabilities of local contractors in nationwide contractors and i think there 's a lot of experience here at council that you should make the most of and you can get some very good value adam of that experience talk about it as well if you like okay thank you very much indeed a very unusual mix of skills debris thank you very much indeed for coming in _"

    "text": "uh russell russell yeah you okay there yep no he 's here yep don 't always live just an accident in the last few days will tell you what danger they they put thanks very much welcome russell i 've got five minutes around yep can do with it what you like my accountant and my lawyer and my jewellery manufacturing friend have all shifted from the center of christchurch and they 're not coming back two of them bought premises and the other ones just said no i 've got a six year lease and the lease is much cheaper than when i can get in the center of christchurch so we have to have some way of getting people back into the center and we have to have new money now when you think about hokatika or methane or acai they all had something there that made people work hoka tekken might have had coal westport might have had gold and the miners went to work that stuff and somebody opened the shop to supply them and someone opened an engineering shop and so private enterprise did the or anybody else private enterprise will do it if you give them the chances so we need an attraction on christchurch in the center of christchurch and casual mall and we should put attractions there that wouldn 't cost the council anything except for perhaps one those attractions would all be paid for by private enterprise for example and i changed the name to moon if you ever come to cro you know think of the advertising if you want to go to see the moon go to christchurch for god 's sake it 's an it 's where casual mall used to be you call it changes name i was going to call it heaven for a start off but i understand that the concept of heaven is not universal but certainly the moon is so let 's call it the moon and the advertising chances are huge um and at the colombo street and i 'd put a steam engine and i 'd ask the fairy means steam society to put this engine there it 's 128 tonnes which would play some problems and i 'd have a come out you think of all the tourists that would come here to have their photo taken with a cap on their head in a big steam engine like that and the other end i 'd have a traction engine i don 't think traction engines are known anywhere in the world except england australia new zealand and america so the rest of the world has got a new toy to look at and take a photo of and there 's one man that sefton has got 10 of these things now surely you put one in casual wouldn 't cost us anything next to that i 'd have a and if you look at the pictures you 've got there i 'd have a coffee bar where you 'd like that one maybe a different color and it opens up and you 've got seats up in the top walk up steps to the seats some of you would see 40. isn 't it a fabulous sort of coffee bar and an interest on its own attraction on its own next to that i 'd have a piano in it 's 180 meters long so you could do it without any problems at all and this and i know people play them i played the damn things myself and i 'll give you one if you 'll do what i want put some pianos there make it an attraction make it a feature next to that i 'd have a dragon now you might laugh you might think there are you know in the picture with the hobbit and you 'll see the dragon there any other eyes open it 's made by it was made by wetter workshops and they made one for andy ellis our footballing half back he put it on show it at ellsley garden show why couldn 't we have two of them in a stone cave and next to that i 'd have an oyster bar and a mussel bar and a white bait place tourists come to christchurch and they go to tekapo and to queenstown and tiana and milford they never get to see these things and the asian tourists in particular seafood is very important and our seafood is extraordinarily of things that you 'll see them in that pants that i gave and i haven 't got time to talk about all those things that i put in there um but the lego bars lego sculptures you don 't realize how big lego is orton put on a show in labor weekend last year a lego society they 've got 19 000 visitors in three days christchurch put on one some years ago yeah there was 15 000 people went to it i think they have one every year there 's another one this year another one this year but yep why can 't we have a permanent one you have it 's called imagination station and well great so this is the sort of thing i 'm talking about if you put enough of these things in you 'll have people coming to christchurch instead of saying i 'm about to go into christchurch which is what they 're saying now we have ran bed and breakfast they don 't want to stop here they want to get to see tekapo and mount cook in those places and into see the moon and while they 're in there they can see these sculptures the things you can pedal which will work i found and you can pedal something else and makes electric lights go and have a display and i recover the whole of casual mauling you think that cost millions it doesn 't if i couldn 't cover casual mauling and close it off at the end so there were no so we could lock it up at night under four million dollars i 'd go up into ages and i 'd be looking for the people who 've made a fortune and many of them have over the christchurch rebuild how much of fletch is made in the second i put 30 billion dollars through their turnover here why can 't we say to them come on do your bit the flinders railway station in australia melbourne was built in the con rebuilt and modernized in the contract price of 1.2 billion and the contractor was so delighted with it at the end of it he gave the christchurch the melbourne people a large clock and station on the air a piece drops out of this and it plays whilst in mature why couldn 't we ask fletcher 's for a couple of million please and i 've got contractors and you 'll know them i know them personally i 've dealt with them two of them have said to me i can retire now one 's 40. and the other one 's a bit older than that he bought a very expensive house he just said i can 't do nothing he said so he just keeps on making money my son 's house in auckland has just had my son was selling his house and he just had a bloke come him and his wife came to visit him and he said what he got talking about he said i said i 've made a packet down in christchurch now there are lots of those fellas i 'd ask every electrician every concrete manufacturer steel and tube how much steel have they sold in the rebuild and asked them for a donation i wouldn 't want 100 bucks thanks very much i wouldn 't 's owned by the government the biggest percentage of it as a matter of interest the trust funds and those sort of things i understand it 's the biggest percentage i said let 's let 's do something like it brings people a five minutes up i wasn 't going to interrupt you because it was so different well it is different why can 't_''_443.52 we have columns of class iron why can we reinforce all the verandas and put growing medium on them and because it 's covered in with a clear plastic like exactly the same as i am i that 's covered in with a product called lefty that 's what i 'd cover in this thing and if you leave it cash them all open and they put bars in there and they open the four in the morning young fellas get boos and they come out and they pedal in the corners and they vomit into the gutters and if you if you don 't believe me ask any republican the first job they do in the morning is get up with a hose and am going to have to stop you but thank you so much for coming in that was really really interesting actually and i 'm just wondering if that bit that we 've closed off for gloucester street well i like the pianos and the dragons i thought they were really cool actually thank you russell that was lovely _"

    "text": "alright and Rowena is not here prashant no David walk David welcome got the job you never know the story hey well I 'm really increased away that council has taken seriously its commitment democracy by allowing everyone to come and have they say my position is that I 'm Secretary of halsall residents association and what we 've done is that we 've encouraged our local members to submit on their own behalf in particular in areas which are too contentious for us to take a stand as a Residents Association so in particularly things around asset sales and rapes rises so this is my part there are other members of our association who will come and help tell their story and I can almost guarantee that their story will be diametrically opposed to mine I guess the perspective that I 've got is that Christchurch really does have a livability issue and I guess one of the ways that there is really demonstrated to me is that in in mice in my day job one of the things I do is go around schools and i went to a couple of years ago who 's leaving tomorrow everyone puts up their hands turning left or tuning right and most of them going to Dunedin and the reason for that I said why are you doing that and they said well better social life better courses now they 're obviously talking about educational context but it really does come down to the fact that young people see christchurch is not a particularly attractive place to be and I think that that sort of thing has we have to bear that in mind when we think about the financial issues that the council is undoubtedly confronting I haven 't_''_125.479 kept up with the overall thrust I suppose you 'd say of submissions counsel but overall I 'd have to say that I strongly support councils rate rises in fact I wonder why you haven 't made them larger because one of the things that you have to say I don 't know whether you had hundreds of people saying this no not so many know one of the things that you 'd have to say is that I think it and if you look at the other rapes rises that are going on around the country at the moment our rates Rises compared to about there about two or three times what to need in this so we 've had three or four covered stadiums to pay for I think we 've actually had a bit more than that I think if you look at it 's just come through since i wrote the submission the rates rise that Aucklanders looking at ten percent i think yep ok team perceived okay they haven 't had an earthquake them even had a volcanic eruption so you know I think people actually have to get a grip and be realistic the places had an earthquake arguably we would say that the play that 's christchurch city was under insured well who 's going to pay for that we do and that 's just you know reality and we need to keep on top of all the community projects and so on that '_''_218.97 that are coming through there absolutely essential otherwise that issue that i said at the part start about our as I say we need to get aggro the other thing is if you look at the actual rates levels around New Zealand we 're not too bad if you actually look now at the way that council has proposed structuring the rates Rises with the more well off parts of Christchurch paying proportionately more again I 'd strongly support that if we go down the road of asset sales which I don 't really support but anyway let 's say we do well the people who will benefit from that are not the people in the poor parts of Christchurch the other people in the wealthier parts it 's a bit of a blunt tool but by and large I would support that structuring of racks Rises of having the more well off paying proportionally more and I 'll see the clock is just about tips i 'll stop well I 'm so fascinated eyes going to give you longer sorry Julie one question nitesh you mentioned you know to show for the used facility in city wide as well as in roseville area even post where area you young temper and I go skate boarder facility in moment also built the nila host world life new library in community hall and also the you know secures and body in the not pull out why aceito what kind of facility you know need to be considered for particular for specifically use the facility well I think if you look across my stage setting the provision that 's been made for young people as generally doesn 't really reflect their their role in the population this you know before everyone gets to our age they have to be young people you can 't skip and some people might argue that there 's not a good thing but you know and if you look across Christchurch we actually are under under performing in terms of some people call them skate parks I don 't think that 's a good too I think broad youth facility so now sometimes that 's going to be playing fields it 's just local scale playing fields other times it 's it 's not and I think one of the really good examples of the way reefton a while ago and I think Christchurch should follow reefton we don 't usually think of that but I watched their and during the day they 've got a community youth facility and during the day parents and their kids and so on played on that as it got dark you had younger people and that go to the pool in the pool would close and people come from Paul out into the youth facility and then they would drift off home and so supposed to do one of the things about reefton that while we were there we saw absolutely no vandalism and no graffiti and to me that 's how you build youth into your community and it 's obvious there that they value their youth and if you fail you their youth by and large they won 't go round and kick you in the shins thank you very much indeed for a very interesting submission dad thank you thank you coming in

    "text": "I haven 't brought the dog with me I could have done you could have sang you a song good afternoon everybody I 'm here as a public health physician representing the district health board so although I am one of the medical offices of Health for Canterbury this is a cdhb submission and I 'm accompanied by Sandy Princeton who is from our health in all policies team thank you for the opportunity to be able to talk to our submission I don 't intend to read it all out nor indeed to present you very long speech but I 'm just going to pick out a few it key issues and then give you hopefully plenty of time to us both me and Sandy any questions you might have about the district health boards submission we are aware that there were some questions around social impact assessments on repairs to Street plans so on and so forth earlier in the day and the district health board then has recommended that the improvements in footpaths and traffic signals and other things that have an impact should be prioritized in causing the most accidents perhaps leading to the worst health outcomes and that they be fixed first prioritized rather than rather than just say a grid system of repairs we support your prioritization of the cycleways forming cycleways and support anything that makes this a more cycle friendly City it is good for the health of our community it reduces costs for for the District Health Board on smoke-free issues we we endorse the smoke-free that the council indoor smoke-free 2025 we we recommend that the promotion of council smoke-free policy is added to promotional material produce for residents and visitors and also around healthy food we recommend that the council work with the district health board on healthy foods for the council and a sugar sweetened beverages policy we are we have recommended that a warrant of fitness system be established not just for social housing but also for private rentals as well so that those people who rent a house can be assured that that house is a healthy house in other words it 's a warm and dry house we agree with you that social capital is hazards but many other aspects of our life as well and we recommend that funding for social and cultural groups is recognized as playing a role in building this social capital and in improving the resilience of our communities finally the only other thing I 'll mention there are many other things in our submission please could the council notify the local alcohol policy as soon as possible our district health board spends one hundred million dollars a year fixing up Alice I can 't this is the LTP and I 've ruled that I 'm not taking any comments on it but I am no noted good thank you right I 'm viñales oh sorry there 's lots of questions no le Pauline for key Phil thanks Alistair I just had a question are you mentioned on page oh you won 't have the same thing there with you draft vol 2 Sport and Recreation you talk about the cdh be disappointed that the council is not going to replace paddling pools and you list them there including Apple II park which is one that 's happy and I that as well and you 've recommended the council maintain all seven paddling pools christchurch with the cdhb be prepared to help fund that as its and i 'm not being smart I mean we 're looking at partners and we we agree that this is a hugely important from a social well-being as we 're as well as a general health perspective is there a possibility to partner in a funding way here I 'm not the person to ask I don 't hold any purse strings for our district health board okay not fair enough enough you 're not alone to it I 'm Pauline we hope you pass the question on and the the hospital has a cold coal-fired boiler do you know there any plans to upgrade that to a cleaner system there is and the the board the district the board of the district health board is looking at the their options around that the proposal is that there will be a boiler that can be be a more sustainable sustainable fuels also a wood-fired boiler that would be using renewable renewables rather than Nicole be able to do both and I understand that the that that not only will it be able to do one or other but it can be switched from one to the other if you know I think the initial plan was to continue using Carla and then switch to wood chips really thank you but we have we have us I mean as a public health unit we are particularly concerned about the district health boards role as a as a leader if you like in in sustainability thank you okay one in relation to the any new social housing is built using my life mark and home star standard have you made that similar submission to the district plan review yes we have excellent excellent the second one that you mentioned and was about a sweet and sugar policy yes you want to elaborate a bit on that essentially I think we need at all large organizations and you know the district health plan is the largest employer in the South Island but that the council itself is substantial employer a need to consider the kind of example they provide for us it 's for our patients as well as for our staff and there are many organizations that without consideration provide for example highly sugared drinks which are not good for us they are leading to contributing to the obesity crisis that everybody is well aware of and there are options around that but it needs to be set in policy by those organizations that permit people to sell such products on their property and the district health board looks at its food policy and we would like to work with you on yours we have we do have some areas where that 's considered but we don 't_''_526.21 I think we 've we 've got we don 't have a finalized policy as such okay okay I 've felt and I second I just ask you thank you for that your comments particularly about social housing and eh be supportive there what are just one that is in terms of like your policy say around continuous yeah this morning is there a way of extending it support about what you currently have in relation to mental how that might work out in the future and I really I guess I 'm who 'd you say look you don 't have the purse strings but i guess i 'm referring to a no extending the current allocation of staff so that in fact especially in these you know really challenging times that partnership might and might be more fruitful we do have a member of staff in the in the public health unit who works with environmental health officers looking at houses providing advice to tenants around retrofitting houses and around ensuring that house whichever one they 're looking at is as healthy as it possibly can be we would welcome any collaborative work on looking at improving the effectiveness of that staff member or others if you feel that more were needed I 'm wondering particularly in the area of mental health and advice that the DHB specialized staff have and I think they already contribute and there 's no question that 's in designing that 's how in fact we might especially this with you hell in fact we might extend that that working relations to do and we could look at more specific assistance collaborative work rather than the population based stuff that we do as well excellent look thank you very much like an eye on behalf of everyone thank you for what you do for our city at we have a very constructive working relationship with the DHB and we value what you have to offer and so thank you very much juki right during the meeting until seven o 'clock _"

former counselor he 's had a lot to offer the council over many many years things have also changed as well so but we haven 't had time to discuss the issues and easy dude welcome thank you you I 'm Bridget hoon CEO of nipple mainland and Chris Rado the board chair for Christchurch Newport Center Marin councillors nipple is the number one team participation sport for women in the country second only and largest tombs to rugby our sport supports the building of communities and provides health and welfare benefits from participation since 1999 sports organizations in the city have lobbied and advocated for additional indoor court space to enable sports to more appropriately cater for the requirements of the members and the wider community christchurch nipple has been requested by past councils to be involved in feasibility studies and other research regarding possible shared or other facilities in the has been all at our own cost so far to no avail so we are absolutely delighted at the prospect of the second largest city in the country christchurch finally giving a multi court indoor facility metropolitan sports facility to provide for this generation in future generations while we applaud the commitment of the city council and government to build this top class venue nipple believes that there are two critical issues to be addressed and the Christchurch City Council long-term plan firstly the reprioritization of the need for no less than 12 courts for the proposed multi-use etro for netball basketball and other indoor sports this includes the provision of a show court with spectator seating for two and a half to three thousand people with broadcasting capabilities for tournaments to showcase events and to provide for community use this would contribute to the economic recovery of the region delivered in a shorter time frame we would hope than the five years that is proposed secretly the provision of transitional support for netball basketball and other interested sports providers to support the provision of facilities and a temporary or completed we understand that there are many community courts out there often these are not of the required size or services to be utilized by our respective sports many of these surfaces and courts are provided and ministry of education facilities and therefore are restricted to the community and to the respective sports for competition and participation opportunities we know too that these facilities within schools will come under increasing pressure from the community in the meantime for utilization there appears to be an assumption that the variety of single court facilities over the city will provide adequately full sports use this is not the case in addition the needs of network cannot be taken in isolation with a variety of sports all crying out for court space that includes basketball football and other indoor sports court users christchurch net will centre provides community network competitions for the benefit of approximately 6,000 players officials coaches and umpires from within the city many of these people identify specific are Maori and often come from lower socioeconomic households being an equal New Zealand lead center in the largest and the South Island netball to continue to grow in the city players at all levels need to be able to experience playing conditions that are now available in other cities or they will move away to these other centres the safety factors are playing outdoors hypothermia and jury risk also need to be taken into consideration especially for the younger age group of players which at the moment is our largest area of growth net will needs an indoor venue that allows our local competition league or coaching and development opportunities in other formats of the game to be played safely at all levels at various times of the day in various days of the week a venue that allows 14 trainings practice games development programs and other associated neutral activities a venue that allows us to host the New Zealand international events and a venue that is a viable option for hosting tactics and Z chairmanships games in the city as well with the metro now being at least five years away our sport cannot continue to wait and do nothing to grow the sport and provide healthy participation opportunities to players for a low budget plane peppered transitional arrangement which we envisage would be shared with sports such as basketball what 's all marching tennis and many others until such time as the Metro is up and running a transitional indoor sports facility with the Metro still going through the approval process and ends recently reported it is unlikely the facility will be completed until around 20 20 netball cannot stand still for a few the five years we are enabled to cater for existing needs and providing programs that have been identified for delivery in ybor New Zealand 's whole of netball plan without access to and all court space our proposal is that the City Council collaborate with neat ball basketball and the other sports codes to provide a transitional multi court and or sports facility that caters for our needs but does not require significant financial investment something cheap and cheerful until such time is Metro as completed + G H netball believes it 's large members of membership base and supporters see the value of an indoor facility in the center is confident that these people will the provision of netball and other sports and draws the consequences due to a lack of facility are that the progress of netball and Christchurch currently presently handed at all levels in equal New Zealand 's whole of net will plan requires sent us to deliver various forms of netball from social junior pay to play mixed netball in other formats Christchurch net will is currently unable to implement new innovative programs which require consistent delivery at various times of the day and various days of the week and doors many players will continue to have this sport hunted by whether in health and safety issues plus we have rapidly deteriorating in ischgl courts at hagley park soon to require maintenance it 's been literally exists of two hundred thousand dollars another consequences players not progressing beyond that grassroots experience as the center is unable to give them give them a variety of playing times which the 24-7 workforce dictates flexibility there may not be long term future for netball other sports that require indoor facilities can be basketball is currently utilizing as much space as available in various suburbs numbers in organised competitions there are currently no other alternatives available to us waiting for a further five years for an indoor facility where I doubtedly see a decline and our numbers we have a proud sporting tradition here in Christchurch and Canterbury we would like to be at the forefront of this again we do understand the need to be patient in the competing recovery demands that you obey Plymouth an indoor facility is urgently required for the largest participation woman sport and New Zealand we are keen to work with the council around exploring transitional opportunities that do not require significant capital expenditure and they may be innovative they may be things that we haven 't thought about but we would certainly like to explore those partnerships and innovative ways that we can provide for our sport in a transitional facility until such time as the Metro is up and running sport is an important component of the recovery of our city and bringing our community together thank you thank you obviously we 've got an arrangement with central government around the Metro sports facility which is what own staff or with them or with the kisses the ccd you that 's the other partner in it then the need for the timing of the courts because I mean we haven 't got money on budget for transitional facility so you 're actually asking us to put more money on the budget and I 'm just wondering I mean when did you first raise this is an issue mayor and councillors we have braced this with council staff end with Sarah staff over the last 18 months or more and more specifically in the last six months when it became evident that the timing of the completion of the Metro facility was being pushed out beyond an anticipated timeframe being 2017 with it was kind of news to us as well so you know I you know I don 't know that where we settled on it so if there was a time frame that we were able to deliver the number of courts that are needed as per the original kind of approach what would that timeframe look I mean what is your deadline I mean you it was 18 months ago you said we need a transitional facility but before that you didn 't say what is the deadline we 've been saying for for 20 years that we 've had an egg haunt space so you know I had a new we 've had an earthquake in the meantime yes so here we 've got to all be patient and deal with those issues so let 's not think up 20 years let 's think of the announcement of the metra sports assesses every sports facility was supposed to have been started last year yep anticipated time frame of 2017 that was the the planning that strategically sports like meatball and basketball and futsal were working too so saying okay we can put sticking plaster over things and try and think of creative ways which is what we have been doing since the earthquakes another five years no there 's no more sticking plaster left it yeah so if we were still at the 2017 stage you would be you wouldn 't be able to get there like what we 're saying now is 2020 collaboratively amongst a number of entities around how how we can get around this we 're looking for a hand up not a handout that it 's all our collective responsibility to collaborate and find some innovative solutions that are cost-effective for us all to manage those sporting opportunities within the city right well thank you very much I mean obviously those are the issues that we need to take into account so thank you for taking the trouble to come and make the solution and the last one before a tea break is this _"

    "text": "mmmm i stained it may have collie good I think it 's the opportunity of being with you here today I 've always thought that the council plan process was a wonderful meeting of participatory democracy and representative democracy and thanks to the staff for much much better background material than we 've had in recent years I was able to get a grip of most things from the documentation which he provided to take my printer a wild run downloaded but it happened who I would like to come in in just in passing there is a bit of a mismatch between what said in this document and what was said in the free document about the 1.2 billion shortfall I could find only 750 million dollar shortfall in the main document and that was plugged by the sale basics of 750 million I couldn 't see any other extra deficit of 450 million between the same address so I don 't know what the explanation of that is it was all covered by rates reserves borrowing development contributions and special dividend don 't want to divert my advert the council at the stage and that is the review of the capital program in this document you say that you 're going to carry out a review of the capital program one of the four levers which is me chand and I 'm very pleased to hear from the mayor of a few weeks ago and from other people that a a review of the capital program is already taking place and this submission is intended to be helpful to you in encourage you along the way of a very vigorous review of the capital program now I 've provided a little hand-drawn graph of the key element of the submission which I put in an app for sorry go if you look at that first read column on the left that is the amount of capital spend that you claim to spend in this current financial year just over a billion dollars the green column next to it is 573 million dollars which I understood at the time i made the submission was the expected total capital spend for this year in other words you were 450 million red columns at the cap of projected capital spend 4 2016 2017 both about 900 million bowls now what I did was to reprogram that capital expenditure according to what i thought was achievable according to past experience the best indicator of future performance is past performance and if this year you have been be able to spend more than five hundred and seventy three million dollars I thought it was unlikely you 'd be able to spend more than that in few years so the first few years runs about five or six hundred million volts you 'll notice that the cabinet evening is pushed forward so the middle years of the decade there 's more spending the council has programmed at the end of the decade it 's about the same if your up down to the table below you 'll see the net reduction over 10 years is 691 million dollars but the real point that I want to make you to take from this map is that there is no crisis at present time for capital spending because in the next three years this current year under speed by at least a billion dollars so there is regardless of whether it 's a good idea to sell assets or not there is certainly no need to sell assets in the immediate future because if I say you under speed by a billion dollars at in next three years if you turn to the next page you 'll see a revised reprogrammed of this option for capital reduction and I prepared this just a day or two ago when I heard that in fact the likely unless theme for this year was going to be 500 million not 400 million and so I reduced the 600 million predictive expenditure down to 500 million for the next few years and if you follow that through there 's a net reduction over the decade of 981 million now people say where is where is it going to whereas the reduction going to come from well the answer is in the immediate in the first few years it comes because you simply cannot spend that amount of money the construction industry and the project managers and the planners etc they is there before your eyes to the experience this year and last year and so on I thought you 'd be under speed by 300 million this year I was wrong it 's even without 500 okay so what happens if you cut that amount of the capital program over the teen years you come to the next page and you 'll see accuse of that under this reprogram option with the special dividend of 750 billion dollars or asset sales from cch old deleted now you 'll see that that deletion is in years 4 3 is 1 and 2 its next year and the year after 550 million on 200 million which of course adds to the borrowing requirement but overall you can see that the cumulative debt if you adopt this option and do not sell the assets is still considerably less than it would have been under the current council scenario so you can see that line and bold near the bottom that is the reduction that there is in borrowing the reduction and the debt in progressively year by year there 's a summary down will be 2493 meadow under the reprogram option it 's two billion or 185 million so there 's a reduction in dec there in 20-25 of 308 million but in addition you 've saved 201 million in loan servicing costs over that period so if you add those three things together the council is better off by 1200 and exit submits miss front there shouldn 't be twelve hundred and sixty-eight I 'm us I 'm edits up and Brett 549 sorry about that that 's mental arithmetic now as I see it in the initial gears the reduction comes because you simply can 't spend the money there is no point in putting money on the budget and telling the ratepayers of Christ use of the functional crisis when in fact you can 't spend the money in future years obviously expenditure has got to be reprogrammed but there are lots of places in the long-term plan where it seems to me councillor had not had the opportunity yet of taking a hard look at the expenditure in addition to 88 million for information technology maintenance capital has been of capable for information technology enhancements 126 million twelve men in the year and you have to ask yourself where is the look for this and somebody proved that will be 120 thousand hours cost of the hundred dollars an hour to be saved as a result of that spend each year my view of information technology is that there 's a law of diminishing returns you can spend so much and get a great deal of benefit you spend more the benefit actually reduces the cost benefit reduces as you spend more so that 's one thing which could be looked at I 'd be inclined to drop 80 million off that and see how much sure where people object see if there 's going to be a real reduction in efficiency in the council the flood protection one is another new thing it 's it 's a massive program and if you look up this book you 'll see that almost all of the monies to come from borrowing massive and it seems to me that the aim is to produce a Christ Church which is less wet always been a city we are in whether you get a bit of rain you 've got to take your car through a bit of water or maybe waiter a little obviously if houses are being inundated they must be protected but it seems to me there 's a lot of money there that could easily come off that program as for the argument that you increase costs when you reduce when we reprogram renewals there is very valid as a principle undoubtedly if you don 't renew your infrastructure it will cost you more in the long run but if you defer a renewal by two or three years it probably doesn 't make much difference and certainly if you 're borrowing to do the work if the job for example is going to cost 10 million and you did it for three years you 're actually spending six hundred thousand year on loan servicing if you go ahead and do it where you do actually is it going to cost 1.8 million for a ten-million-dollar job if you for a few years I doubt very much so deferral staff will help to prioritize the programs manager Mitch and various other things in my submission but that 's the main point that I wish to make about the need to reduce the capital program and the way it can be done relatively painlessly and if you ask the people of Christchurch where they where they want a super super flood protection scheme or more modest rates this borrowing etc I think I know which one they choose I 'm sure that 's the case but I 'm sorry you 've gone spoken to time so there 's there 's there 's no time for the first time for questions I 'm sure I 've made my point redeeming you here indeed but I know that a number of us had a lot of questions we would have liked to have asked because there 's not novel everything that you 've seen as as agreed university around the table but this that 's the way things go so shameless it the debates is very useful and unveiling my sister out from Christians of other times okay thank you Nick wall mainland and Christchurch nipple _"

    "text": "this is a personal submission of my apologies for the couple of typos in there but I was him cross-check the HBC submission and I filed this one I live in 59 online so i hit the harriet throat and this is a down as a person who 's lived in the central city for a number of years and planning to get back as soon as possible earthquake damage permitting so i 've submitted this and the reason i asked as it doesn 't affect the council money it 's a case of policy and reconsidering policies i 'm not asking for additional funding etc and disaster counsel concerning i would like to ask the council along with those I understand it 's just to renegotiate the current cost sharing agreement with the CC view and the government on the Inca projects I consider that a a more extended time frame be more beneficial to the city and allow the city to absorb the change in what 's going on the circle city on a personal thing I would ask that the council and it 's this is derived the central city with small business owners and as opposed to the building owners this is the people who are training and on the simplest of each day you showed a commitment to the central city I 'd ask the council to nature the development of comprehensive business plan including marketing for the regeneration of the central city I consider it very important so that those who are training in the central city I can identify it I 've noticed they can 't tell you what the pain is for the central city I mean they can tell you what the malls are doing and what are the themes of the malls but they can 't articulate what that is now if they 're going to show a comment to the central city would nice that they knew where they say thought the simple student was going that could articulate it easy and I think that 's not unreasonable request I 'd also submit that the council review all spinning on the central city and train and transition products externally and internally as part of this focus to the business and the council staff had to be commended for making the attempts to make the CB it 'll visually vibrant however i think the city now needs to review the policy I think it 's time that we 've bypassed transition and started to concentrate on regeneration or than the central city and where the focus also honors working with those existing businesses and voting businesses to come as well an example of urban regeneration i think is an outstanding success is the arcades came through the victorious victorious street from victoria square I think that whilst it 's perceived as a temp we won 't_''_145.19 I think it made some measurable consider contribution to the city I 'm not sure I think I report a golf course etc transitions would well up to now I think it 's time that we showed some commitment to the central city by making them or design be solution to that one so I 'm emphasizing more urban regeneration as opposed to transition projects particularly ancient i think the coordinator with the council I notices council some internal and external ones and a to fix they try and how they 're ordered it our the same would be advantageous as well and I 'd also submit the council consider seriously consider set up a committee of counsel to provide leadership over and over see the redevelop with the CBD these committee would have a number of issues to deal with ensuring that the central city and the business of container that I would regenerate despite the exuberant competition from the suburbs I known as an example that ccdu is planning to market increase the number of reasons in the central city who 'll be seeking representation in the special area now the planning and practical issues alone of where the pot where the mark in flux for the simple city meets the businesses I kind of have to be resolved and I think I suspect that the Council of agreement that the resolution be if it wasn 't_''_214.34 in the Environment Court which it may do is they better here as process going through if some sort of resolution on mediation to stop which will the places will happen which won 't be 's going to be this is going to be a special area and I 'm draw upon my experience in the past whereas a resonant the community board it 's doesn 't quite provide the same coverage because the central city isn 't turns it be different for the mix of people who are living there and the reasons why they 're there and I 'm not sure that a community board hasn 't managed to do so in the past will certificates I think it counselor finally focus on this now understand the maybe over extra ccd you but you are stakeholders and our consultant and staff to start work with them so I 've asked me and as an aside as like one of the issues is coming up now I note that there 's a Superstock planned and Manchester Street as part of the the successful city the closest breast area toilet facility is in Cathedral drunken despite we provided I got thinking there aren 't many as far as i can see planned rest facilities or toilets in the central city and if the tour going a particular restaurant or coffee shop where do they go which is just one practical response just a quickie yell the transitional projects that we 've had a central city have actually put us on the world map has changing the way people view christchurch and i just want to get a sense you say that we should have more the urban regeneration what you could argue that the transitional his urban regeneration I 'm I understand that and I understand appointments and appropriateness for what is for what was a solution to reinsert and view of the circumstances out there what I 'm seeking and what I suggest is it 's a time to crank it up in other words let 's go for what a more permanent solution those are timid as well as I understand are designed to be transitional which is why site at the arcades which is temporary but looks like it 's going to be part of a contribution so that looks for deafness as a job walking soon like you know to take Victoria Street it 's like ninety percent bill should be almost depleted yeah I understand we 're coming like just I think it 's an opportunity to get the Arctic 's urban designers and the young youngsters involved and I think the arc is a good solution the arcades is the next step up for the TMP transition that 's right side of that why pick more of those products but and a lot of the central city 's still sitting empty there 's building sites where there 's not a lot going on and it would be nice if they start looking presentable and the signal city look like it 's now moving thank you very much Mac thank you very much me and David close _"

what it 's okay it 's five thank you very much for granting us the opportunity presented her submission and we just like to thank the council for their support for the Isaac Theatre Royal Ivan cotton an agreement that 's fantastic here the theater back in the city and whilst I bring up the Isaac theater oil I 'd also like to acknowledge the Heritage Christchurch hotel being a very good supportive Heritage Week and the building they occupy the old government building a superb example council intervention of retaining heritage building and it 's making fantastic contribution to the terms North Canterbury the deputy mayor can book you back we 'll be able to brief the counselors on the process of how the council and Davina managed to save their building we 'd also like to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge the professionalism and dedication of the crisis city council the staff our appreciation with endeavors as a side note we 'd like to note that it probably sounds pedantic that the word in the draft LTP the word of square is used we 'd like to remind that the council that its full name as Cathedral screen we like to request that it be referred to as Cathedral Square understands postal address still is cathedral square that 's Cathedral Square I think that you 're referring to a straight takeout from a ccd you document it so they call it the square ccd you document we do not call it the square but we 've it 's lifted the documents actually lifted it is Cathedral Square I you thank you very much for cooking in it but if I put on we 'll make sure that there 's a bracketed reference to the incorrect name that 's in the blueprint thank you very much we 'd also acknowledge the council 's communication by pointing out to the business of Christchurch that here at your protection amounts to one point one cent per dollar of rates which are considered to 're biased on the more substantial issues we on a 10 minute submission or go yes right thank you very much we just draw attention to the council 's the reduction in heritage funding particular policy in 2018 and voice are concerned that it 's dropped from four point six thirty five to two point six to nine we understand that it is the council landmark ground that the council 's proposal to drop them from funding we point out that we we think this plan reduction of funding is premature the only point out that there are still our number of buildings diaz we house the public trust building harley chambers duncan 's building and another other buildings which are still at risk which would be suitable for their ground and we said the grant will be essential for you to help with your attention further on we 'd argue that if the council feels that it because of funding we understand the pressure of funding the council southeast sees fit that it needs to reduce that landmark funding will respectfully ask the council that it increased the Heritage or the huge at the sender funding one of these people it became one required it could substantially consume most of that ground for that year and the still ongoing here it 's particularly suburbs with a large Charles etc on page petroia attention to page 221 I 'm sorry for the mistake on the Academy Museum special project capital ground we note that the museum is seeking it 's got the set of money has been set aside for three grams for the Museum of approximately 3 million dollars per year at some time over 19 million we 'd like to submit before any capital funds over at least the chem use iam that the proposed development should have been through a meaningful consultation which will be signed with the council we 'd like to remind the council that according to the Environment Court decision in kennewick museum Trust Board this crisis city council the museum is bound to consult with parties to the decision including the Christ Street Civic trust our reason for this is that we 're unclear as to what the monies to be used for 're not aware if it 's going to be used for strengthening and if it is for for a redevelopment project I would block be in a situation that the consultation have occurred because if you call the last redevelopment project ended up in the courts and since the council 's push for money would be a good idea to wait till the processes fully resolved before fun zone release considering that the counselor stated that it 's it 's got some funding pressures and wrap around that period in addition is we 'd also like to fully endorse the allocation funds for the christchurch talent or rebuild we consider this as an important so the community widely used by the community prior to the quakes it is an important building as you will have noticed the garden house is listed in its top ten consequence of the world and we consider crucial we brought back we fully endorsed the funding for mona vale inside of the turkey and we think it 's great to have those two heritage buildings bank one thing that where we thank the council providing for our city so that if you want to make this emotion you can make a meaningful submission although we would ask that in the future that the unfunded kemper would be in a secret document because it can get all confusing when the press rings you as an example it says this one you 've got to get your girl 's apartment to find out which but that 's a fairly experienced we would submit and ask that the restoration leads to buildings be brought forward as soon as is practically possible and we commend the council for making them with a tight and strengthened so that they can walk back as a business possible here at each owner the reason we ask for those particular two buildings as they weren 't very very successful and the public utilized them as an example our city which will most encounters will be aware was very successful as committee exhibition space and also as a public venue as far as I 'm aware that isn 't an equivalent public venue in the central city so it 's another magnet to bring we brought attention to is that we noticed in the decision-making process and volumes as regards we came through a decisions on the criteria listed here just as a community and intergenerational we 've provided some documentation just to ask the council consider he returns and character-building says generations of economic prosperity controlling factor community then as a cost we 've included some documentation on that one Donovan andrew from i will conclude on the diagram what 's out my only collect breakdown he say what i suppose you would call him a heritage building economist at the breakdown of the actual economic returns peerage to the environment into the city as an example he points out that sexes the team percent expanding on site on here just tourism is a cheap on site the ninety percent spin both ways also draw attention to perfect that according to the powerpoint was presented a workshop in virginia heritage visitors the heritage versus state because twice as many places and spend two times as much money good trip so there 's real look Benson at work and could I just meet some part of a submission that the Lockheed Indian and I made to the Select Committee of expenditure and Finance two years ago at Parliament and Lynn mentioned to the committee that came ahead pointed out that if you demolished a 7.5 x 35 meter commercial building that 's that wipes out the gains made with us with the recycling of the previous 1 million 344,000 coke cans and that 's just on the the dumping that the landfill aspect of it so there 's tremendous gains to be made and all sorts of ways by retaining buildings near it 's busy here it is building in addition we 've also included an executive summary of a study called older smaller and better measuring how character buildings and blocks of influences even impulses people vitality this is as a economic study cost bit of analysis done from Washington San Francisco and Seattle and one of the highlights which we 've included there you may have notices there 's more jobs in small businesses in the buildings more more non-chain businesses startups in those sort of areas and thus 36.8 percent more out the reason for mentioned particularly the study of powerful effective parent is a very very good cost-benefit study and it also that particular organization is also the provision preservation Green Wave is also doing which are fitting buildings for green we draw attention that it is Seattle when we are sister city of seattle we think it 's worthwhile to approach the able to see if there would be to come out and breathe or response the staff to brief and its sister city relationship and thank you very much for that 's good to have a stroke places can abuse no I just and could I just mean some that we 80 Historic Places Canterbury rather than start basis trustus sometimes little confusing sorry thought I said Historic Places Canterbury now I think you see trust actually but it just to make it clear for everyone okay well Historic Places Canterbury is what 's written down so it just shows that I 'm sicker than I thought so although I apologize for that yeah I think you no doubt about us with my own mind so anyone got thank you provided all sorts of information which we may not have anticipated would be there my colleague counselor and return it talks about how in Europe people actually build around here at each buildings if you 've got some sort of measures overs social well-being you talk about community outcomes here but if you 've got any kind of information on the contribution that can make know the not specific I 'll study cited it 's a case of there is a positive feedback and branding within the social wealth and responses working within the area the spaces Tim I 've noticeably what tend to be more intimate people tend to communicate more than those particular what they call I call it fine grain buildings the other issue too is a sense of social well-being for those are aware we won sunday i watch the crowds outside the isaac theater world food outside the door and almost around the block on colombo street i 'm trying to think of a modern building and christchurch with a queue up to view it possibly with a good gallery yes I 'm it 's great thank you thank you very much and

    "text": "hello I just wanted to and receive the library today because I want to put in a plug for the value that the community libraries bring to the community and I had just put some demonstrations on the submission that I 've made so I was just going to talk about those so when we hand our library we are like family and we put out pamphlets in the community because we have a very high turnover and a power most people only live in the area for about three years so we constantly need to be letting people know hey we 're here come and see us and that 's the bit that I have noted down and set people that would be no want to make contact within the community so for instance we 've had some books that we culled from the library in the large print because elderly people read a lot of large program 9-3 books so you have to be constantly doing that and i took some over to one of the local homes and they were absolutely thrilled to get them and they river and they were going to be bringing so many residents over to visit the library and so they 're really excited to get contact with us we have a lot of families who live in the area who are just meeting and some of the families are lower economic and they find it great effect that they can walk down to our library and they 'll get a DVD and it 's only two dollars for the higher for the DVD and it 's a real family activity so we quite often get families come in and the kids are outside it could be the ones that are allowed to choose the DVD and it 's a real family activity we get grandmother 's who come in they 've got to entertain the kids in the school holidays and being able to just walk over the road or whatever to be able to get a DVD for the kids great way to entertain them gives kids an ear teen because it 's all right beyond the river and is a lot of things to see in the river and and all that kind of thing and its really nice just getting their interaction and finding out stories or why people enjoy coming to local library police any questions I don 't know that there is any question you could possibly ask after a brilliant submission on on on why community facilities are so important so thank you thank you very much for making the effort to do that ok Historic Places Trust smart _"

oh my doing it now too yeah rocky well mintex i was at repeated it but that 's okay variety okay so on the metro sports thing sorry but under under prepared for this and the the main thing i wanted to submit about the metro sports was a keen desire that when it comes to the point of oh okay when it comes to the point of their going out how that venue is managed and so on that pier thank you but there is a a public we call it public tender process are transparent into crisis to decide who should who should run that facility i think that it 's a facility that will add a lot to the city and it will be it will be fantastic and it 's necessary and everything but i think that there are lots of ways to sort of skin that cat from would obviously be very interested and potentially being part of the conversation around running it facility our expertise and facility management particularly for community good i think that 's really aligned with what the council wants to achieve with the metro facility but they 're obviously also has to be a commercial and you know underpinning of making that successful so i guess my concern is that if we if we observe history that will be assumed that the council runs runs their own facilities or if not one of the counselors subsidiary companies runs and council facilities and i think that that 's wrong i think that there should be a much more transparent process of public tendering the Auckland City Council if we can do to utter those words here the yorklyn City Council does that with the accounts of facilities and the Oakland YMCA operates I think nine of their facilities and the Auckland region and does so very successfully so it 's not that the YMCA is completely clueless about this sort of thing so so that was the main thing that I wanted to serve how that works in the city I 'm ray from the info yeah thanks Jay Z in terms of thumb swimming pools two questions I does the ymca manage swimming pools in auckland yes in an Australia yes the Christ you try and say doesn 't have a swimming pool at the moment but we have one and our strategic plan to build one and then it 's probably in the central city in this intro silly yes there will be a split wood would not be in conflict with neutral in my view or as we wouldn 't be doing it that 's learn to swim smaller smaller operation more along the lines of what Centennial was or equal gem so if you was if you had a hundred and forty seven million dollars to spend of counsel money yes plus obviously maybe 50 or 100 from the crown what would you be putting it in turn the central city area stadium space places for community gathering in terms of this their sports which is low-cost I would probably be filling the stadium space with programs run by outside earlier and one of the things that was done by the council was pricey times he runs the best basketball negan and Christchurch its not New Zealand and just just putting it out there and really if the council wants to run basketball programs in the stadium then they should get the ones around their basketball program in the stadium so I think that that should be the ethos around it so it 's actually contributed by two by the community rather than the council doing to the community what they think you know it sounds a bit negative but you know me and and so stadium space sure olympics you know the big olympic-sized sort of swimming pool I think would be great I 'm not sure that its location really lends itself to a whole lot of family activity so I would probably be looking more at the sports groups and their elite sports this sort of thing over the eastern frame would be a better place for yes I think we yeah he 'll well thank you i think you 've sort of start to answer the being more for specialized sport rather than families because wornall is going to ask you was you know one of the things we do in the city is try as councils to try to provide swimming for families so it 's affordable so like if F in fact our went out to tender how would a group like yours be able to ensure counsel that that swimming costs for families were would be affordable well look there 's no I can answer that because that would all depend on how much the council and what returned the council expect it you know and all of that sort of thing but but the way that we make the rest of our programs the YMCA runs affordable is by through social enterprise so we have a number of other aspects of our organization which provide money which pays for what we do at the YMCA which which is essentially subsidized so I guess I can 't really answer that question because it depends on whether or not the pool costs would still be subsidized by rates in vivid comments you know swimming they 're not going to make money unless they subsidized by rates you need a decent Linda swim program and other things operating around it to make the money Helen often yes absolutely and I think that there 's a space for that but i think the communities for each side of it should be in the suburbs which is where families actually wanna go they don 't you only want to trick into the middle of the central city for a half hour splash around do we know they 're like okay no that 's great thing thank you very much and if we could now have andrea lunch from a power pole at library and for somebody who was not

    "text": "it would Pierce not here I 'm Tracy Schroeder good afternoon tena koe my name is Josie and here on behalf of the ymca which happens to own a large camp in 10 e 240 bids essentially and about 70,000 bid nights per year so we are the biggest surge creator and why knew it and that 's why I 'm here I 'm also want to clarify that i have worked and lived in winery for eight years myself so I know the environment extremely well and my husband ran the salmon fan that was mentioned earlier for 20 years so I 'm not just a sort of a figurehead from the town talking on behalf of a real community that I hadn 't been has it been a big part of my life people before me have talked about the environmental issue so I 'm not going to go on about that i think if you 've heard about that there 's also been some talk around the fact that we 've been promised and promised and promised and not God not gotten not god so there 's go to that either the ymca is has chosen the option of continuing is have most of the submitters and i understand from obviously the one thing he 's had a lot of relationship with the community one way or another and is the previous can 't manager I I know a lot of the people who live in winery and in general these sort of two schools of thought there 's a school of thought that says party if we get a big search system town system we 're going to open the floodgates for developers to come in and they 're going to completely change why nui and there 's going to be you know bulldozers and back China 's and it 's going to turn into a Corolla and there 's plenty of people is 11 winery who do not want it and really the kids kind of when they 're keep from honest in the camp that 's a good plan anyway then there 's the other school of thought which is actually we want some development and we wants in life and we all we there now I understand that the council sees y muy as one of the places and the peninsula that is right for development and I would agree with that it 's a beautiful beautiful place and it 's got a real hole and soul and heart and that sort of thing but I think the question here is not about whether we progress with a sewage system or we don 't regress with a sewage system the first question before bet as around whether or not y muy is Ted for development in the future because frankly if it isn 't if it 's just a big pipe dream that isn 't probably going to happen then what should be being invested in as giving the community and winery some really really clear advice as to how is the investment around their own personal sewage system so to answer your question you asked earlier term I think short these piles of options for people to manage their own cirrage and people do that in rural communities all over this country so y know is no different the problem is because sewage system we will it sewage systems the gray to the point where even are you know the financial dilemma that individual or homeowners have is really quite nessa nobody wants to spend ten thousand other than a septic system if the following year this council is going to finally do their cleanup they seed so what needs to happen is you first you will need to decide whether it 's a place for development and there 's a whole quagmire she 's around me but if that 's the case you need to get on with the sewage system so everybody can because obviously that means you 're going to have to put socialist and then be to get on with it so that people can move forward with their lives and sort it out and the me if it isn 't likely to happen in the next 18 10 or 15 years then I think you just need to save it and say they will no be there will not be a town sewage system for this length of time and I would suggest a septic system last not 14 or 20 years so everyone can also move on with your lives and next scenes and sort their own search system out that will upset the developers but for the record it won 't actually really upset the camp for the community I think the best thing is to put on the search put it in the system with we 're right for it we 're really for it where we 've got our head around at law of X or thing for the camp a river we have actually contrary to some beliefs we 've actually got a really good system we 've invested about two hundred thousand dollars in the system in the last few years it 's working well it has inspected like you can every single year it passes its inspection every single year and we have resource consent until 20 29 so there 's no disparate disaster for the ymca if we don 't put the Sun but for the community is really really important than it goes in I think I 'm running out of time yeah Pauline um thanks for submission haven 't been to winery I 'm sorry most of my kid 's head um do you have a lot of land for your system it was one of the shower teams soft and suggested that people take ownership with your own systems been told that the land is too steep of you differently and you got way must have way more land that you can actually run a whole septic system well obviously we 're not a little section so you got to imagine there 's a whole lot of vetch owners with little sections they don 't have anywhere to distribute their their sewage or their wastewater we have 13 hippies yep so okay so they 're in a plantation specifically built to deal with our we have our own settling pond for goodness sake I mean we 're a little town I can 't just establishing it yeah yeah i noted your comments about the way that the the discussion document was presented so i 'll go back and and reflect on that so yeah I 've had my apology so that 's fine oh it 's I are yeah yeah thank you thank you oh I think you 're big is the ymca now oh no it was a to clarify bit i think that 's probably it 's an era _"

    "text": "Thank You Mia and counselors I 'm normally here in my role christchurch coastal pathway but i 'm here today in my capacity as a homeowner winery and thank you very much the opportunity to submit on this plan i 'll be quick because I know you 've enough time today the winery wastewater particular reticulation and treatment scheme has been long awaited with consultation starting prior to nineteen ninety-six and the project and was first including the banks peninsula long-term plan in 2004 so it 's already been delayed over ten years in our property we 're using a long drop but like many residents we 've put a live in ready and to connect to a system we thought would be operational in 2009 and then we thought and we expected it to be able to do so this year we know that the council 's under huge pressure with high demands on capital resource and we can understand why each project must be reassessed in understanding where the money has been spent however we do request that the council consider putting priority of the winery wastewater system is ready to proceed and our concern is that delay will escalate costs and duplicate the enabling costs that go with any project delay will also involve costs that would otherwise be avoided so Richards mentioned the sea view lane wastewater treatment plant that would have been decommissioned if we go ahead now if the plan is deferred this plant will need counsel upgrade and council maintenance the YMCA upgrade is now urgent and the YMCA would need to consider other options for disposal of waste water which we think and would have a huge impact on such a worthwhile organization and then finally delay will extend the environmental risk and effect on health and the DIY systems are long draw on drops septic tanks and storage tanks and and we or have to coax our children to walk up to him in the night with a torch but we 've got used to them but however many are old and they don 't necessarily perform properly and property owners will be under it and willing to invest a lot on the assistance because they really are a temporary measure to environment in public health we understand the reports is that the environmental risk is now only after heavy rain but we suggest that this will considerably worsen after six years another six years the area is known for its unique Ecology 's and wildlife such as they hit dis dolphin it 's a significant tourist destination every weekend we see people gathering so it 's an important area former hanging high so the waste water reticulation scheme we think is really important for environmental reasons it will reduce the threat of untreated wastewater entering the harbor and deliver cultural environmental and public health benefits so we urge the council to consider it a high priority thanks very much Christians ham tum um we 're all we 're especially through the submissions how important the environment is and unfortunately things they 've been delayed and delayed and delayed and now we 're finding ourselves there in a very difficult situation due to mother nature so I 'm just wondering about self responsibility has anyone over there looked at composting toilets I think there are a number of different options that but certainly when you know that the system is a sort of stopgap measure and and in some respects there are two minds on this because we this property has been in the family for three generations we know rates will increase we 're not continue to sell the property so it will a new system would increase our rates but but we 'll think further environmental reasons it should go ahead and considering it 's ready to go you know that outweighs the disadvantage of a rates increase and possible change to the community but you just can 't have in this in this age treated untreated sewage going into composting toilets etc would be an answer and a medium to long-term well your honor we 're really looking at a huge amount of numbers and so we 've got to weigh up what we can do and what we can 't do so you 're an alternative it seems like it may be for the individuals i don 't i don 't need the answer that i don 't know a cost of composting toilet we 've operated built really for a connected flush toilet but found it very quick question just um a number of similars have commented on the smell and i 'm just curious deering i can when you see or smell the sewage being discharged or words were spoken to our neighbors and they have a takeaway system and so they were that 's what they that 's how they found that solution but we thought it was easier when you 're in that small community to talk to people rather than report people and but yes there 's that is an option I mean I 'm just trying to understand whether a cone has any role in terms of monitoring that 's not being done or enforcement that would deal with some of the environment or figs okay that 's wrong thanks thank you very much thank you thank you I think Malcolm frost isn 't here _"

    "text": "welcome Richard thank you very much for the opportunity to present to this issue it matters a lot to us and we hope it does to you too we do understand that the council 's under some we understand some of the financial pressures that are facing the council at the moment like many others we have been following closely the progress of this project and have been immensely irritated by the repeated promises followed by repeated postponements we chose option 3 to have the scheme implemented this year the process is started will before amalgamation of this banks perimeter with the city and indeed one of the chief arguments in favor of amalgamation was to secure access to greater funding for infrastructure than the banks peninsula district council could ever have had after amalgamation things move quite quickly we had regular updates from the council engineer and a few information meetings in winery it was always made clear that the money for the project was available the start of work was delayed only by lengthy procedural issues I have in front of me a letter which I think we council project engineer Michael Sheffield dated the 28th of March 2008 about progress it ends with this sentence we are on track to complete the new winery sewage treatment system in late 2009 we understand fully that the earthquakes caused an igloo avoidable delays but at the drop meeting a drop in meeting in winery in 2012 at which the grinder pump system was explained to us confidence was still high that stage two could be completed in 2015 and we were most impressed with the planning that had been done already as a result of earlier promises we and very probably others like us included in 2010 in the construction the construction of a toilet cubicle in renovations player we were doing in our batch a soil pipe was laid in the concrete floor leading outside ready for connection and the cold water supply was fed to the back wall these are still waiting you tell us that seventy-five percent of the submitters favor the adoption of option three the do it now option as their preferred way forward and we are part of that my impression from roadside who at present have less than ideal wastewater disposal systems have postponed improvements precisely because of the repetition of seemingly plausible promises by former councils to complete the job by a certain date the results of such action or inaction are easy to predict more leaky septic tanks more bacterial pollution of waterways and more smells forgive me now for talking a bit about smell property owners who live downwind of a neighbor 's takeaway tank will like us experience the nasty smells that come from them at times there has been some improvement in that situation recently but basically the problem is just that whenever sewage goes into such a tank an equivalent volume of air must come out through a vent hence the smell drifting onto nearby properties we have bitter memories of the visitors and friends from Holland to our batch when the smell was appalling we could not sit on our deck to have lunch in mild easterly conditions of course later on we had discussions with our neighbor about it but such actions are embarrassing to us and embarrassing to them because they had spent no other solution what we are hoping for by coming here is a win-win situation for the council and for us he would get stage two done this year and the council would save a lot of money by deferring option to the deferment to the next long-term plan deferment would mean that improvements would be needed at the Seaview Lane plant now an unnecessary costs under option three as that plant would then be commissioned if the scheme is deferred the YMCA would need to make upgrades now again an unnecessary costs for them under option 3 as property owners above anchorage bay we observe the great work done by the ymca as their students walked to and fro from cape three points we do not want them saddled with unnecessary expenses and may be forced to cut back their good work if the scheme is deferred the pollution of waterways would continue unchecked and may be involved expect expensive treatment unnecessary under options reef deferment would inevitably mean cost escalation and deferment to the next long-term plan might mean even more delays because we could come at the to do the job the cheapest way to do the job is to do it now and we would urge the council to adopt option 3 thank you and I do apologize I 'm coming down with something and I had to take drugs so I 'm starting to they 're starting to kick in but thank you very much for your time and I will be playing back the submissions that I 've must so thank you list Adam _"

Derek I 'll sorry Neville Dowie was going to go first because you 've got planes to catch or something important to do yep come on up make yourself at home and the way this works is the five-minute thing that cheer takes up a new disappear basically is what happens and you guys don 't want to submit together you all want to do it with your five minutes ok fine we 're totally in your hands up behind us is long drops there is also filter systems and septic tanks which in a lot of cases are inadequate they are leaching as we well know between the clay and the topsoil into our Harbor three three rivers main rivers and also eight underground known streams to us at wainui also positioned along there is a Christchurch City Council unit with a public toilet facility which also has an aged septic tank system positioned just 15 metres from this water harbour over here on the left of the heart our little harbour a little bay is a rocky out point when and mussels our property long drop dates back to nineteen fifty-seven and yes there have been lots of holes dug and lots of holes filled in many times we have a steep hill and there is no way a septic tank can be installed we are similar to many many others are right around the harbor frontage this is our concern but let me put you take you back to the picture we 're drawing with the bay here and let 's follow out a little bit further let 's go out through to the left over here and see the dolphins see the penguins see the international tourists swimming with the dolphins let 's go out further a little bit to the right and let 's see an internationally acclaimed salmon phone the are Kuro of some it 's known all over the world we come back this way a little and there is a commercial muscle operating come back a little bit further is a commercial help collecting farm operating out in front we have a ski lane out in front we have all of these things going waste water surged raw surridge at it it 's been going on for years as I say our property dates back to nineteen fifty-seven so how long will this continue to be and how long will it continue to go on so you want some proof okay let 's look at some concrete facts the mussel farm is a good example the actual bacterial level of those muscles during a drought before any water runoff whatsoever and any rains arrived was such that those muscles could not be harvested a very very serious situation in fact it was three times what they would be allowed to actually have a statement now I 've had it claimed that the water in a Corral Harbor is clear enough and it 's fine it 's been passed but that does not take they have not taken into consideration so many aspects of the winery bay as we know it EG water currents winds convex and concave in the actual harbor bottom hey this is our backyard and we are absolutely destroying it it 's time we took a good hard look at this part of the reason the procrastination of councils over the time have actually left the situation totally exposed and the septic tanks because we 've been promised and promised and promised have lived the septic tanks that are able to be put in basically null and void so it is totally irresponsible to suggest that we delay the surge scheme risk the health of citizens risk out tourist trade risk our farm and exports and a bigger picture of the council finances this is not a huge spend but only a little dot in the ocean it could become a very very embarrassing substitution if left unchecked thank you oh no I spoken my time that 's fine thank you very much _"

    "text": "Jane Margaret baisley and build a field for Environment Canterbury Regional Council thank you where the N and counselors for the opportunity to make a submission on your consultation document and graft long-term plan Environment Canterbury would like to particularly thank you for your ongoing governance and support and the Canterbury water management strategy and in particular your support for the Christchurch west melton and banks banks peninsula and so on my horror fan committees we would like to see more references in your plan to the christchurch west milton banks furniture and Selwyn mejoras own committees as a key mechanism for community input to water issues many aspects of the long-term plan will contribute to the sea WMS vision and your proposals for continuous improvement to the wastewater and stormwater networks throughout through ongoing repairs and renewals will help reduce wastewater discharges in the environment to the environment we 're particularly interested in the work that you 've planned to reduce wet weather overflows of wastewater to decommission the littleton diamondharbour and governors bay wastewater treatment plant this is something we 've had an interest in as long as Corral waste water treatment plant and installation of a new harbour out for so we strongly support those projects and we also note on page 58 are your reference to improving the health of the haven and heathcote rivers and again through the christchurch west milton so implementation program the community has already expressed a clear view of the targets and priorities for dealing with storm water in these two catchments and so we recommend that the zip is referenced strongly in your long-term plan I 'd also like to refer to the building a sustainable transport system and we support the your commitment to the hubs and spokes public transport model we also support the proposal councils a proposal to spend 30 5.9 million on public transport infrastructure over the next 10 years and we support your proposals for dealing with transport growth and particularly in support of the earthquake recovery and you 're aware of the key infrastructure improvements which we must deliver to support the new services and in particular the earthquake recovery and future great I also would like to acknowledge the support and resources provided transport governance with the other councils of Greater Christchurch New Zealand Transport Authority and the Ministry of Transport this review and the odd and going support of the council to identify the short and long term solutions to the issues faced a critical to a well-performing public transport system and we thank you also for your support to the greater Christchurch public transport working group and the earthquake recovery we recognize the significant challenges your council faces this area we ask particularly for your support to work in partnership to implement monitor and review the loop we acknowledge there 's an overlap between that review and the christchurch replacement district plan processes but we 've both been required and it to have these expedited by ministerial direction so we need to work together to minimize duplication we are possible and similarly with the littleton port recovery plan that it 's important we continue to work together and finally I just like to touch on the flood management and see that you 're addressing the increased flood risk following the earthquakes well we operate on different pieces under different pieces of management and we offer their significant expertise to assist with and review your program and we request that we be involved as soon as possible in the process of developing plans for stop being provision and we were surprised that the council had proceeded to a pre-feasibility study for tidal barrier with only minimal engagement with us and our liver scientist not as much as we were and just to conclude as you can see there are many areas that we work together many joint initiatives and our collaboration is vital to the smooth running of our community and I 'd just like to acknowledge the very positive relationships that we have developed with you and your staff and I was thinking this is think about the fifth time I 've been in to appear before accounts and I thought I actually know all the councillors and that 's the first time that that 's happened so that indicates that we 're actually seeing a lot more obvious so we thank you for your relationship and in collaboration with us thank you thank you Domo could i pick up on there are opportunities for us to work together in a strategic way then this would be an area i have a very strong view and have written to the government about the need for a national policy statement or and wore a national environmental standard and relation to our natural hazards particularly in relation to sea level rise because you know it seems to me that the sea level is going to rise you know around the country around our coastline and the same you know to the same level so that the standards should be set nationally in my view so what we 're and what I 'm this is what I 'm worried about and I 'm just kind of asking for some guidance because we 're going to go out and talk to a community that 's already under enormous stress over district plan changes long-term plan changes that we 're here to discuss today and now we 're going to go out and and and talk to them about the nature of the the pressures that might come on their environment in the next 50 to much at once to be placing on the most vulnerable communities not just environmentally but actually in terms of the earthquake damage which has as we know mirrored the effects of you know 50 years predictions on sea level rise in some parts of our coastline and actually 200 years and some parts of our coastline we would certainly support support you and be happy to go with you to government for a national standard and rip would be also be happy to work with you to determine a suitable time when we can to start community engagement we 've discussed this previously you worship and we will continue to support that in fact all regional councils in New Zealand are supporting the government to come out and give people certainty as to what to plan for and and I think there 's a huge saving and litigation and heartache here if we can be brave enough to simply say that for the next hundred years we think this is the Ferger and this is the figure we should work to hmm I could also note if I might make paragraph of natural hazards where we were bringing together our to work streams has actually occurred in the time that this submission was put in and we 're now Christchurch series natural hazard program and the rest of the region 's natural hazard program is now joined other great it 's just that I 'm worried about the timetable for commencing that public engagement which is not far off and we 're receiving our briefing on it I think next monday and i think the the planned approaches the following tuesday which is straight after queen 's birthday weekend and i just think that with all of this the long-term plan and that and the in the district plan review and all of these things happening at once because at the end of june will be notifying the final elements of the natural hazards chapter to the dpr the independent hearings panel so that will be in the public arena at the same time and I just do you think that this is an appropriate approach what do you think we should just hold back until after the natural hazards anything by delaying this for a few more months while we try and see if we can get that lock down I think we 'd be happy to talk to you about about that alright can manage that yep that 'd be great yani so thank you for submission just a very quick clarification on page 98 avarage into which you talk about environmental education you 've asked that we reinstate 30,000 of funding and it 's a 31 schools have had their facilitation withdrawn if we were to consider putting that reinstating that then are you currently contributing or planning to contribute to in various schools for the schools within Christ in it enough so what 's your condom three empty wagon dance that we still we already provide funding for enviro schools in partnership with various district with some district councils throughout the region and where there is no district council we stand alone with them borrow icicles but the loss of you guys in the christchurch city makes a big difference to those individual schools and it 's a real message out to the youth of today very important for us if you 're if you can find within your incredibly challenging budgets the ability to come back and with us we believe that in in five to ten years neither of us will regret Apfel I 'll be brief thank you very much to Margo for your complimentary comments to account so and also though I just want to round the area of equality we just wanted to raise that one because but I think when we we may our submission and we could have pets be more specific about some other issues and although we have got the waste environment and management planning team which works together with again I 'm just wondering about some of the specific issues we have and how in fact for example one has been an ongoing one has been bupa during Rose Street and does the other one in at bromley so it 's just how in fact we ensure that we you know we try and resolve some of those issues and collaboratively to well we see I didn 't acknowledge the work that is going on i come back from living Earth meeting and we 're certainly kept praised of the various areas that are affected and I think we do slowly move forward in the middle in low it may not be apparent to the immediate neighbors and I think we 've just got to keep on working working together and because this hasn 't always happened and it is happening now I think that 's a way to succeed and certainly acknowledge the work that the jaw doing in that area well thank you very much and your much appreciated very helpful contribution to our discussions so thank you very much and we 'll adjourn now for afternoon tea we 're running behind schedule so I there a number of submitters the next group of submittals are all submitting on the same subject the wineries waste water reticulation and treatment scheme stage 2 and it is it 's I don 't know whether I mean everyone 's welcome to join us for afternoon tea but if if people can think about whether they want to have their five minutes on their own or whether they present and then give it a bit of a time for questions that might give a bit more flow but but it 's really over to the to the submitters what 's what 's appropriate under the circumstances and so it 's 33 37 so if we could be back here at 350 thank you _"

    "text": "welcome Richard good oh you 're a nice to see you good at muna nice to see you all and apologies from chief commissioner David Rutherford who was planning on being here he 's ended up in Auckland it at a another important meeting so nice to be here on his behalf and I think probably greetings particularly from Dame Susan Devoy as well given that there 's some elements in her portfolio and the commission that had been addressed in our submission sir greetings from all of us I 'm Richard Eckersley I 'm a human rights commission are based in Christchurch and one of the part-time one of the two surviving part-time commissioners that are still on the board of the Commission a you 've had our submission and you 'll notice that we 've focused it on two main points seriously the need for the long-term plan to support the council 's responsibilities in terms of the human right to an adequate standard of housing and more about that very soon and secondly ensuring that the plan recognizes and celebrates ethnic diversity and prestige the Commission encourages Syrian to ensure that the long-term plan provides a sound basis for undertaking its functions and a human rights compliant manner so with respect to housing it 's important to recognize that both central and local government have responsibilities that are relevant for the provision of adequate housing for all and those of you involved in the housing task force will have heard me on the subject already and in fact I think you 're going to hear me on the subject again it 's really really important and it doesn 't mean that local councils have to provide the housing themselves but it does mean that they need to take steps to comply with your responsibilities when carrying out their activities the council can have a really strong impact on the right to adequate housing when it makes decisions in relation to matters such as lend you some planning and zoning and free structure velopment and delivery of services such as water and sanitation the use of public spaces public transport and the enforcement of building standards it 's important that the seven standards or indices of adequate housing in these areas and that the long term plan supports a human rights centered approach and this is the subject that some councillors and some of them some staff have heard me on a number of meetings affordability which is what we hear a lot about in the the public dialogue about housing is only one of those seven standards that apply to the right to adequate housing the others security of tenure that people know they 've got a the right to be protected against forced eviction harassment and other threats the availability of services materials facilities and infrastructure people have to be able to access services such as safe drinking water and adequate sanitation yes affordability the cost of housing must not threaten or negatively affect people 's enjoyment of their other rights habitability probably really important one for the council housing must provide physical safety and protection against the elements and must not negatively affect people 's health accessibility disadvantaged and vulnerable groups including people with disabilities must be given full access to housing and have their needs taken into account location housing must allow people to education opportunities and must not be adjacent all on top of all very close to polluted land and cultural appropriateness people 's cultural identity and beliefs must be respected and supported and taken into account by the housing so affordability as one of the seven and from my point of view and from the point of view of the Commission it 's not enough just to focus on affordability and so as I said as we understand that the council doesn 't have an obligation to directly provide social housing but when it chooses to do so it 's important and its role as a landlord that it complies with the seven standards and particularly habitability for example by ensuring that homes are warm and safe and free from demp such like things there also some concerns about accessibility in the human rights commission 's brief broader accessibility in the city and we see that the council has a key role and encouraging the construction of accessible homes and housing as well as ensuring that public transport services are accessible for all members of the community including those with disabilities and I 'm sure other people have submitted on this idea to help ensure a lifetime accessibility for homes and buildings in the Christchurch region that 's our first point in the second point is around celebrating and encouraging diversity within our city we acknowledge that Christchurch is an ethnically diverse city in the Commission therefore recommends to counsel the following things that council recognize and celebrate this diversity in the long long-term plan that the council lead by example by encouraging cultural events amongst council staff and recruiting staff from diverse backgrounds and thirdly the council established a multicultural advisory board and or a council wide multicultural strategy I 'm happy to stop and take questions or comments from members of council at this point if you so moved thank you thank you Richard and thank you for your submission of work with a housing task force in and housing and general obviously clearly the I 'm looking at the UN report and your submission as part of it it really puts it I think beyond doubt the responsibility of all over housing and we 've been having a that how different is that to a post disaster time I mean this this talks about a kind of usual time that everyone 's responsibility but how does it changing but I think that but particularly particularly concerned but not only concerned with the situation of the people that would be seen as the most vulnerable but even in the earlier months after the ferry earthquake in particular the people that came in to Christchurch worth information and advice on post disaster recovery and and such like we 're quick to remind us even though it wasn 't necessarily picked up by the media there in an in a disaster or an emergency situation the people who were the most most vulnerable prior to the disaster continue to be the most vulnerable and the post-disaster experience it doesn 't create a level playing field just because there were 10,000 homeowners who are immediately impacted by the earthquake a stratified so yes there was some newly disadvantaged people but the people who are already marginalized isolated stigmatized we 're still in the lowest of the low position so created more disadvantaged we 're always encouraging organizations who have their influence to be particularly cognizant of the people who are the most vulnerable with the inference that our obligations just simply deepen sorry with the inference that our obligations it 's wrong because we 're you know we 're talking about a human rights framework that says all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and so we 're talking about people being able to experience and enjoy those rights right across the board and that the most vulnerable right two days including those who are you no pets newly disadvantaged and and it means that we know it 's not level playing fields a funny tune but essentially we want people to experience the same experience of the human rights quickly because we 're running out of time do you think that the eqc n insurance issues in the time that it 's taken to resolve these and in fact many is still unresolved have played a role a significant role and the quality of housing and the cost of housing in the city is it something something i 've personally looked at i know that david david has looked at at trying to help insurers and property owners to have better conversations and for decision makers to talk to each other as well around all mostly are you able to answer though but and i 'm not just do you think that what 's gone on in the last four years in the city with insurance sneak you see has played a significant role and by you I mean the commission and from what David 's done in the quality of housing and the cost of housing in the city I think it wouldn 't be for me to comment on those things in there we didn 't we didn 't submit on those elements and I think I 'd be outside my brief and speaking to the submission of faith yes dear yep yeah now I understand it yeah I 'm probably not going to to go to that point I really want to focus on there on the things that we 've specifically submitted on yeah um thank you for your submission I just including local government has human rights obligations and responsibilities to its people particular the most vulnerable and in light of that comment in your submission in regards to housing yep have you got any views on how we can prioritize our spending and recognizing a large percentage of that is of the cost share with government around the most vulnerable without any social impact assessment I mean with being told by Sarah they haven 't done one and it seems to me in terms of trying to work out the prioritization of spending to address where those vulnerabilities are it 's very hard to know where to start without a social impact assessment but I 'd welcome you Eddie Eddie Eddie I mean Mike my question and response would be what are the barriers to a proper social impact assessment being done affects the information that 's required in order to prioritize it 's been there I mean I guess yeah I 'm not sure that an opinion for me is going to anywhere anyway replace it is that something that the Human Rights Commission has considered or is that if the government might do it which they why I mean I do you think there 's a need for one I don 't think the Commission itself is in a position to undertake that I don 't think we resort we 're not resourced for that leave me thank you bro check that 's very helpful thank you very much I just have to interject there because that 's where it to the ten minutes and I think we 're straying into areas that really aren 't relevant to our long-term plan so thank you very much thank you and could I now invite _"

Hamilton and Thompson to resume my area not that they bother to ever talk to me about that that came up to hearing the Christchurch City Council and I oppose there in that hearing the Christchurch City Council priced that my rates would remain rural and my property youth would remain rural that was also promulgated by the commissioners of that hearing when they made the decision to to change the zoning subsequently I appealed to the court on this but Minister Brownlee using the CEO and nothing 's happened anyway because it was a bloody stupid proposal in the first place why would you build houses on a place that 's full of liquefaction and 400 millimeters but I continue to use my property as rural and I don 't think you should rate it any other way than that the proposal that your mr. Ballard 's put forward is flawed he had no supporting data it doesn 't have a basis in fact in roars of current practice it bears little relation to the determination in 2095 which was reached after extensive consultation it 's not what was promised to me specifically in 2013 at the hearing and noted by the commissioners and of staff find it difficult the determine what 's rural in I 've proposed a solution which is in front of you that 's based on current practice if you don 't feel like carrying out this proposal e not expect you to fix the flooding issues repair the bridge deal with the capital costs of the services that I provide on my property let 's have a footpath and some bus before I start paying but i 'd like to say specifically that i actually want any of these things and that the differential was in recognition of the lack of them but if there 's going to be no difference and when I expect some equity on this and as you can see I 've got reams of data here that provides the backup that must have a large seems to be leaking now the next thing I 've got there is a graph that shows your rates rises for services that I don 't get compared to the CPI and the average earnings now for what it 's worth my earnings are in fact a negative scale on that the way that shows what 's happened to my property rates since 2003 when i bought it in comparison to these other relatively standard figures that I 've sourced from Statistics New Zealand so this isn 't a fudge this is what I 've actually had to pay and as you can see it 's increasing considerably in particular over the last year I paid nearly fifteen percent more plus eight percent on there for this coming year plus ate and ate and ate and whatever after their bearing in mind this is for nothing pretty much for me now that 's not sustainable it 's not fair and it 's not equitable those costs there at the moment three times more that than a friend of Mines property in town but he 's got water waste sewage he 's one point five minutes walking distance from the park which some bizarre reason seems to have news facilities in it he 's got a footpath cube channeling traffic calming how 's that for you it 's not now I have to explain to children because it 's one of the things that I do from time to time the difference between need versus want now we don 't need cycle waves if you can either cycleway then I think I want to footpath and curve and channeling and stuff before you do that we don 't need a stadium don 't need any of these things they 're all wants and I 've said here for some period of spend money on which for some reason I 'm going to have to fund the lumped in the general rate and I have to pay for them a note that I don 't have a library card and I don 't make use of any council facility I can 't walk one and a half minutes to a council facility I don 't even have a footpath to walk so I think you need to allocate these costs for wants and some needs to really to those that benefit it and it 's real easy to do if you go into a stadium or something like that and you pay for it don 't make me pay for it so costs to be in efforts not in the general rate get rid of that and if you 've got a money problem then you simply need to sell some non-core items such as the social housing and all these sorts of things that you 've got get rid of them sorry counselor back but get rid of them there 's three hundred million dollars what relevance have they got to mosquito picture wise that i showed you to start with none whatsoever to me or my property the only thing i get from the Christchurch City Council is rubbish and recycling the green burners useless on a on a rural property in cash nobody 's figured that so presently your rates demands are four times the cost of my car and which I receive a much greater benefit than I do from the Christchurch City Council you go ahead with this proposal when there 'll be five times the cost of my car it 's not for you that 's pretty much what I have to say so plenty of data here if anybody really wants to know I thought you made some really compelling arguments and I really enjoyed reading the submission one thing I want to ask you though is and I 'm not being facetious or inflammatory isn 't the city more important than just you so I hear what you 're saying about the importance of your car and the importance of the things that affect you and the things you pay for directly but what before who go to libraries where does your line in the sand begin and end when it comes to providing for that so councillor James you put me in a in an awkward position to be honest because it will modesty to reply this way but when when the earthquakes happened I was one of the first people in there and to the city I was on the CTV building that night I did the trio 's assessment of all of the buildings in town on the day following and I spent six months in the city a lot of that was unpaid and I don 't give a damn about that i was there helping people I look after some foster children and I also teach it some sports facilities and so on so personally personally you know I believe in community involvement and doing things for people and not just for me I actually don 't want to be here because I am feeling a bit like this is all about me and it 's not about the community it 's not as if I don 't have think it 's also important that the City Council leads and shows people what being fear is about now it 's not fear that I 've been paying four times more than somebody else who gets a whole lot more stuff from the Christchurch City Council so that 's okay and how much you pay etc well I think it 's very simple but if somebody uses something they pay for it okay and it 's something that you can do and it 's it 's within your powers within the rating in in in to an extent you 've made a recognition of that by having the real rate differential but frankly I don 't think it 's enough but whatever and now you 're proposing getting rid of there I just don 't think it 's fair counselor James I 'm sorry and I do I mean I actually feel guilty or be here being here talking about me but I am talking about 2,000 other people and most of 11 hundred and thirty-one and most of them seem to have made a submission so we 've heard be something that we have to address and review of The Milk campaign there is more than 11 hundred and thirty-one that are affected by these increases council about ok the figure we shot so I 'm just saying that that I 'm representing around 2,000 ok right right thank you very much and we now have the Human Rights Commission Richard tanks _"

    "text": "it 's Joan rich mettler but that 's all right I 'm sorry been dealing with it my eyesight 's rubbish as well at the moment okay good afternoon things thanks to the opportunity to just to speak to a submission that we made in we 're just here to talk about the mayoral flood task force final report particularly around them a tweaker waterway and Morgan 's Valley and no doubt you 've seen this but and at the top of it says the water catchment around flooding and multiple houses marcin street level street and others and i suppose we 're here just to put some faces to some people who live in marsden street we had 21 miles and street and heath get behind our story i suppose is we were earthquake by rock fall out of our property and bridle path road to a to bridle path road was very early on red zone property a lot of rock fall in and around our house and their lounge those sorts of things and when decisions were made i supposed to to mitigate Orton or not to were made around the viability of their it cost effectiveness of it and we get there there were two houses in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate that so fast moving on from there that was reasonably difficult but but we can live with it and after moving around a bit we bought a property in marsden street we looked very carefully through all the learn all the background history of the neighborhood and in floodplains and all those sorts of all those sorts of things that we were much more sensitive to then probably we were before and then I was very obviously very disconcerting and the least and probably for Madigan and the first instance to have the flood issues and hid kit when that that waterway did overflow out of the morgans Valley out for a cross marsden street in literally from bank to bank across the street and something that my two sons wouldn 't have been able to walk across probably without being swept away so that that was surely hideous HD to wake up to and then I suppose that water didn 't come through our newly renovated home but we Joe head to wrestle on the 84 year old neighbors door who 's had of hearing to wake him up to time there was water running Dennis always so there was a very close thing for us but not for some of our neighbors we had water running under our house completely and filled the basement or what the land under the house with with layers of silt didn 't get up until our floorboards certain become an insurance thing but there were those I suppose there were some of the issues around that now those things and those events happened on a couple of occasions so for us what their names and our faces I suppose around the mass and treated street experience of that that I suppose that just locates us but we 're here more more to speak to the long-term plan here in and I suppose just being totally solution-focused ear not not going what 's gonna happen what 's cable is if there 's a solution and the thing I suppose it 's front and center things as it seems like the solutions half-made like it 's half constructed it 's almost done it just needs to be finished or the last Lincoln it needs to be made now I know there 's complexities around the properties that they 're linked runs across in the red zone aspects of that and what the developer previously was going to do and there won 't be doing and those sorts of things but our that would be a our player I suppose on on behalf of our scenario a four year old neighbor as well as as well as others in the hit community that this is a classic example of fence at the top of the cliff or in this case our pipe at the top of the street instead of sandbags it at the bottom and all that carnage afterwards so until oaring here I suppose is that this link up is as a priority because of what it would mean for Heathcott Valley and I suppose the last aspect of that is we kind of feel that we shouldn 't have to neither should Dave next door you shouldn 't have to do that really Thanks this this is just occurred in the and more than 150 year event last year it was and the other 12 months really see if they were and and part of the additional problem was that the ground was saturated when the second hurt so this isn 't this isn 't a normal event and and the truth is is that we we simply don 't design to the highest level so that 's the reason why it 's not on the on the budget at the moment the issue for us is endless merrell task force report flood task force report it seems that Karen doubtful as a temporary arrangement was always temporary arrangement and the long-term arrangement was a drain that linked the bottom of this the strain along the road 60 meters and into an already constructed drain that went down through cooks lane when that development was put a drainage was put in to join up with us so it was always in the plan some plan but because of the rezoning needs as 60 meters I mean we 've got there and help tickets you know I 'm sure most people in Heath cut wood yeah I mean I don 't know will obviously get technical advice p and our officials owner on it so i 'm not i 'm not saying no I 'm just explaining to you why it 's in the position that it was at the moment the mural flood task force was just looking at the urgent deficiencies that caused drainage problems and over floor flooding and march and april is specific purpose not the land drainage recovery program yani i just have to say this has been subject to a number of complaints through the council particular if you talk to the people in cooks lane who had raised concerns repeatedly and had ed previous passes of flooding as I understand it so I mean thank you for your submission have you been given any kind of idea as to why it 's not included in our land that 's right in a long-term plan when it was identified from the mural task force no half of it was about sort of just asking Christians but we didn 't really get many answers but the other half to make me laugh was several depends telling us what to do when it happens gift and I found that quite and concerning really because you kind of have enough yeah so that I 've just been reminded by staff because my memory isn 't working very well at the moment either and so apparently we have our staff to provide this information to us as a result of the submission on the first day of hearing so we are going to get that information you know and in this list chance of everyone and he 'd get needing the services that the other lady was asking for I think we should get on and do straightaway give him probably every time it rains I imagine you get Manny it 's not every time at brains these were 21 on 50-year events immediately after each other I mean one was probably a one in 100 year of em but I just got these a pretty heavy right everyone just why thank you can say no and when it rains you know people wouldn 't flockton you ladies as well but there 's actually a easy well it appears to make it straight yeah and that 's what I don 't know the answer to we need technical advice so the only reason that I was trying to explain that that you weren 't on the on the lust was because it doesn 't because of the rarity of the events they exceeded the design standards and don 't trigger immediate reinstatement of the waterway work program but we are getting advice on it so you know I don 't know what the outcome of that advice will be but obviously we 're going to take your submission into account as the other submission that we 've received on this as well well in no doubt others another thing is sure your local councillor who raises that on many occasions will be and it is difficult even when you 're in the state of constant fatigue yet to even write a submission I know and look the cities the know I totally understand and and and and in get where you 're coming from and nobody wants to put people through a process like this but this is our process for long-term plans i promise you if i run for mayor again this will never happen this way again we will have a much more personalized approach to dealing with people who want to raise specific issues as part of a planning process i genuinely believe it should be a community planning process and not a sort of a top-down process so you know i 'd like to think that it will be better next time but you know thank you very much for coming along and I I really do want us to find solutions that we 're people recognizing that we 've got a hell of a strain on our budget at the same time lately yeah and I suppose the last comment just as weak as relievers is that you want to provide solutions and and to us when we read through this there 's one setting leiram big bold letters thanks heaps be assured that 't worth coming saying it thank my my frizzy just took used to you want to proceed now leave us don 't even well I thought if there were lots of submissions like this thanks very much no thank you very much thank you _"

    "text": "if you go do you want to put the two together and just speak across the two or you 're good with that you hey yep that 's a general idea so you guys got to 14 South bright and residents association and empower class reg and there 's a separate note being circulated around cell phone okay well good afternoon all and thank you for this opportunity to speak on the submission I would like to start just too big in my submission by discussing the state of council housing in South brighter put it bluntly the property is owned by council and housing New Zealand are an eyesore and reflect the neglect and the disregard being shown for our supper we find it inexcusable that the authorities can lead properties in such a deliberate edited state for it up abandoned and neglected and a collection point for illegal rubbish dumping given the red songs have been generally cleaned up what is the justification for leaving the green songs in such a sorry state new examples of this are the council housing on Santa Cruz lane on top of the river end of kipper waifu secondly following the land subsidence caused by the earthquakes temporary stock banks were put up in place along the avon river these stock banks are not up to standard and as this is a submission for the long-term plan we would like to see a budget budget for this be stopping the land in this area requires substantial investment in plot protection to mitigate the hazard created by the earthquakes the height of the stock bank is up to 1.2 meters these stock banks were not place before the earthquakes and they have been confirmed as being merely temporary the council has confirmed subside ins of only 50 centimeters of the area the facts show that the subsidized and subsidence is much greater the height of the stock bank shows clearly what has happened along the estuary and what we can expect in further when further seismic activity happens the condition of the stock bank poses an imminent risk for the residents dwelling and for the residents I am convinced that it was purely a matter of luck that the stock banks did not frightened residents association has raised this issue with Council on numerous occasions it is of urgent concern because it affects the future of the residents their life savings and well-being particularly those living close to the river when a long-term plan is is submitted for a sustainable City surely you would agree that the three top priority should be number one the residents secondly the dwellings and thirdly the well-being of the ratepayers either this hazard introduced by the earthquakes needs to be mitigated or a managed to tree needs to be implemented implemented as per the New Zealand coastal policy statement this hasit has not been caused by future sea-level rise but the earthquakes the South Brighton community has lost a lot and we are quite certain that nowhere else in New Zealand you would find a residential area 6 kilometers in diameter with a population of approximately 5,000 residents in which the only service is available our theory and a petrol station we would like like to see council offer some sort of assistance to encourage the return of services to the soft brighton area we have suggested that area could be set up with water electricity and other basic amenities further services could be established in temporary facilities coffee shop fish and chips shop food store container shops depending on the interest and the feedback from the local residents the flexibility given post-earthquake in the castle building regulations they are extensive and the flexibility is there to deal with the situation I would also like to touch briefly on the council finances my observation of the legislative environment here give me cause of concern so far what we have seen is an emergency response to the recovery in my opinion a band-aid legislation has not been updated sustainability should be the main objective for the future of our area and city we are now entering the second phase of the recovery and hopefully we will see positive changes that will improve sustainability the following are some aspects with a substantial impact on council insurance claim settlements that need to be fully considered before any insurance claims are settled earthquake-prone building act will require extra strengthening of council assets or yep and ass will be a s and these items the earthquake prone building act and the 1170 remain as before the earthquake or substrate after the earthquake they haven 't been updated the geotechnical choral practice this is another factor you know which is controlled by the New Zealand geotechnical society it has not been updated it will affect strong ground strength requirements liquefaction vulnerability foundation design and ground remediation settling insurance claims before these fundamental things are in place would cost council a lot and the ratepayers yeah and actually when these aspects will finally be in place they may cost structures that currently are repairable to be deemed for a rebuild and looking at the big assets like the Town Hall these are substantial figures the City Council credit rating also needs an urgent revision the council retain City Council credit rating dropped after council lost the building accreditation building consent accreditation and it was revised by standards Poor 's two or three days before the accreditation was regained it hasn 't been updated since this accreditation was regained this affects council finances in regards to cost of borrowing and this has to be taken our long-term plane they want to see our finances excellent yeah great ratepayers just to conclude here the ratepayers a risk of loss due to hazards introduced by the earthquake are entitled to the protection of the Resource Management Act obstructing these residents from protection of the legislation could be considered negative practices a duty of care is all to the ratepayers it is my belief that elected people aim to deliver that care to the ratepayers of our city all right David clean thank you and can I just acknowledge Hugo your continued acknowledgment of problems in the area and your tenacity and following them through can I just follow up on one point there you mentioned the condition of stop banks do you have any notion of from where to where we need to be concentrating area put on stop bank work yeah there are areas of high erosion which have been a dented identified by a cut there are areas along tibal way street there are areas around the Owls terrace where the stock banks are purely eroding away and these thought banks are in excess of whole area it 's not only you know where they busted it it 's going to cover you know hundreds of properties this is as significant impact dennis is a serious concern these stop banks they 're all just pretty much gravel on top of San you know start banks needs to be protect us against one in a hundred years event they need to protect us against erosion they need to be structured you know engineered to a standard so they can protect us against the Russian and groundwater and through clean thank you if I may just offer a clarification over the Santa Cruz units double check with staff most of our complexes were under the cap but this is one of those that went over so that insurance I should now lies with Civic and until we get some movement from them we just can 't do anything with it you 're not going to repair them so we don 't know yet we 've still got to get to that point but still do it has seen the mess have you been that offer 100 you it 's like this is wrong no I will flee their bit yeah I mean that if that 's an urgent issue then we should raise that with staff about not waiting for the insurance you know to be resolved before we I mean if we 're going to demolish them we should just demolish them as we 've done with the car part a lot of even demolition I 'll suspect is tied up with the insurance yeah I know I 'm sure does but if usually demolition has held up when the insurance are disputing the coverage of eq c have over kept it then I mean that it 's each individual unit I can 't believe if they 've over kept the whole lot that it doesn 't a rebuild anyway but we I have to say we 've had visitors from overseas over Christmas times for two years in a row and I 've also Li felt very very embarrassed on behalf of Christchurch safety council because it 's city council houses that they leave it in other states it 's no excuse yep houses have houses have separated there it 's absolute disgrace there 's no way that these properties will be repaired they 're also weight and earth and people aren 't acting stuff that is absolutely it 's barricaded it 's terrible yeah but thank you very much if you go and i 'm out now my brains not working Emma thank you very much for coming in could I invite Jerian and Richard Matt here _"

    "text": "yes after all that joy and games everything I 'm gonna come right back down because of a boring old humdrum stuff firstly I just like to thank everybody for the opportunity to come and talk to you and wish you all power and what looks like an absolutely grueling schedule over the next week or two I really don 't envy you one tiny little bit I 'd also like to thank everybody for your work that came about subsequent to my presentation on the mirror the chair we were raised the consumes regarding the proposed cuts and funding to the community grants that you make available as a result I 've heard that that you have acknowledged that this was a mistake and I 'd like to really thank you for following up on that and for getting back to us with that reassurance that presentation did provoke some public comment and people some some comment around the role of the not-for-profit sector what it ought to expect from the city what we ought to expect from government and so on so I just like to talk a done a presentation to you sometime ago about the diversity of the sector the range is not just social services but health arts environment history recreation so on and in the role that it plays in community well-being we know that what it covers everything from directives provision down to building social capital and that boy if we hadn 't had social capital in our city would be in a bigger mess now than we can imagine it 's that social capital that enabled our communities to pull together and to work together and to carry on through this difficult time we also know from what Rob Gordon 's been telling us and international evidence around disaster recovery that now is a really difficult time in the process at it 's a time when typically the social indicator get to the west we are seeing peaks and demand for counseling for other services people that haven 't thought they were managing finally realized that they had in the wall and there 's increasing demand on our services and some of the commentary after the presentation was around well why are just like you to visualize a pyramid an extra between the pyramid upside down so the points at the bottom and that point at the bottom the sharp in as the most accurate service requirements and they met by central government so we 're talking about Ministry of Social Development through Child Youth and Family we 're talking dhb we 're talking about hospitals and house mental health care were talking about the president supports the probation and so on those services are delivered directly by government and what I 'm hearing from the not-for-profit Sita is that line is actually shifting down lower and lower and more and more of its being moved out of central government to the next to your app which is the contracted services from the not-for-profit mainly not-for-profit sector okay some of them are contracted private companies like for instance age and dementia care has provided by groups like Ryman and Oceania but a lot of them that next here app that still critical social service and health service delivery is provided under contract to government departments and picked up by the not-for-profit sector down to the bottom of that upside-down pyramid that sharp point and ending up and the government services now you 're of here that the relationship Arturo is in trouble at present looking like not getting funding from government we know that there are several community groups service providers that are already closing downsizing we know that government has got a new program coming out the restructuring of the way they 're going to fund these groups through the contracts that they provide what we also need to really be aware of as its central government has a policy of not funding for one hundred percent of what they contract the groups to provide so a fuel contracted by central government to provide a thousand widgets and you 've costed it out it 's going to cost you a hundred dollars deliver to deliver every single one of those widgets government will only contact you they 'll provide they 'll pay for about thirty to seventy percent typically so maybe you know fifty sixty percent is paid for by the government but you still had to meet a hundred percent the government 's philosophy is at the count of the communities need the service thing community needs to contribute to the cost and so that 's why you get the social service and other providers who have government contracts also coming to city council also going to Community Trust lotteries all these other funders who are the ones you know they 're doing the fundraising and so on because they have to meet the balance of the cost of providing for that contract in order to meet their contractual requirements to central government and we 're hearing that central government is tightening that up and we 're hearing that as from next year groups that have for some time being contracted you know long history of contractor government will not be getting their contracts again or will be getting reduced contracts and all happy having to look elsewhere so I 'm just giving you notice now from next year you 're going to be seeing a lot more demand from agencies in the city looking to be able to maintain those essential services then the next layer up at the community groups that you guys will know from your work on your local community boards and so on and they 're the ones that are building the social capital and they 're the ones that are stocking the next you know helping people to stay well stay connected stay engaged and not be isolated so that we have a healthy strong community and they are the ones that are looking to you as well for the support and keeping our communities going we 've just done a button I know some of you have already got our book holding hope together and those are a few of heaven I 'm coming to your community board soon and we 'll get one then and that tells the stories are just a few of the not-for-profits and the ones that people don 't think of and disaster recovery and we 're talking about things like I see if I 've got them sick people slip my hands and move quickly and the school of music you know they lost the premises they were look so down where are we we talking about playing and to get be able to get back and forget about things for a while doing something that they loved doing with your friends and just making music is a really powerful healer for children for everybody so that 's not an organization you think of providing a direct service and disaster recovery but that 's some of the role that they have the new brighton community gardens a lot of anxious people wanted to be around other people and the comfort and then just to start to focus on something that was a non quality in a routine and something would actually grow and what brew was a sense of hope and stability so these are the groups in order to keep supporting our communities to get through this really rough time the next bashir next year before we start to turn the corner and leave the difficulties of past behind us that are still going to need all the support that they can get to keep your communities connected and well and strong and happy and able to come out the other end and really enjoy their with thank you I think that one of the things that you know I 've kind of raised before and you 'll be familiar with it as that is the idea that instead of just funding individual organizations on a year by year or even two or three year but actually looking to build the resilience within communities and and that means probably duvall veng stuff that we do as a council back out to the community in resourcing them that way rather than so much yet so I mean and that 's the work that we 're going to doing over the next week wireless how do we get our grants so that they connect with other funders and how do we make sure that community organizations are resilient and the true sense of the word either that 's sustainable over time and that they do meet the needs of their communities because I 'm I don 't buy the argument that you have to pay for it to value it but it has to be meaningful engagement with the community I think there 's a real unmet need across the not-for-profit sector from central and local government from the funders to sit down and talk about what are our needs as a community in Christchurch or what are our strengths and yeah yeah what are our strengths what are n is just a really good indeed scrutiny of where do we go from here and not have it as an ad hoc a bit from here a bit from the air I 've got the so good idea but you 're doing something else you know I 'm one of those that breathe the loss of the long term council community plane because who is doing the planning for the community as a whole you know central government don 't have that degree of local knowledge after the quakes you may stay was great at pulling together the not-for-profit sector but they really relied on the City Council 's strengthen community staff really and the not-for-profit sector itself to be able to find those grassroots groups because the only ones that central government knew about but the ones that are contracted to provide services so I think there with all the strategic thinkers rivoli can pull them and from yeah and see what we can do together fairwood last question now I 'm we 've gone over time and I was just I decided caught your eye but ok if it 's ok we might know I will ask a question I 'm Shirley basically saying it was your submission there especially given the history of cats and this recent one isn 't another cat but that in fact too so that in fact community development with a plan say is part really at least an equal partner with the resilient communities that in fact this council should try and make up to organizations like yours what what has been lost that would be wonderful if we could in the past few years with my bronze figures back in 2019 the grants were 10.7 million let 's the community strengthen communities grant this year there 'll be 8.7 served as a loss of two million dollars just since 2009 and of course none of the other founders you actually give cost-of-living increases yet you know it 's so to let managers on the smell of an oily rag but the smell and then oily rag is getting quite faint at present because for most part there are not pop you know their grants don 't keep up with inflation and you know you get new groups coming along an old ones fall out of favor and it 's not necessarily to do with the value in the community it 's just what captures the imagination of defendants they go yeah be really good if we could get back up there and it does you know when you see that in all power to economic development and the fact that that can be Development Corp they get cost-of-living increase in a non contestable brand through you guys yeah cos lost a lot of funding after successfully winning the court case over the social housing increased by the way just mysteriously thank you for their helpful addition thank you thanks very much Sharon good to see you and could I now call Hugo kristensen _"

quail island to the top of Mount Bradley and the many hell walks connecting with the many Hill walks that there are and within the crater rim the athletic can beep up mount Bradley mount her but the rest but people like me and more likely to walk around the coast for a coffee at diamondharbour and home on the theory way down the track I know it 's a private business but i would think perhaps one of those floating pontoon and so that you can make a loop on a ferry quail island picnic round to the do besides drink coffee well as walking picnicking swimming biking tramping kayaking think of the margaret Mahy peninsula park she 'd be delighted I think she bought a peninsula and I hope it 's not this one to protect it she also read a book the katanga to twitch wasn 't that was later filled someone I think it was you councillor Jones mentioned mud flats so I went out there it did like water yesterday you could probably get around to the point on foot if you were quick and good at rock hopping I 'm sorry that 's all right I confused as well but it 's an ideal place for recreational papers for beginners you can get out of the wind which everywhere it 's blowing its part of Charteris by weather is already established water sports imagine that the promotional potential and the demand as the city grows you know I can see this and lonely planet shut up Jim go now look I feel much better already so you have you have you have reestablished that sense of joy you know because it is wonderful you know in the future there is a proposal before the council apparently at the moment is divided in three dots mm-hmm no no no no this is also a patch alongside that 's for sale currently and if we bought the lot and then adjusted the boundaries on sold the surplus keep the gym you know i 'll be through well we have it we have a submission on that very point so thank you very much for for that because actually the previous submitter had data in here and here submission as well so but it 's actually worked out quite well that you 've spoke tab it as well so thank you very much for your time much appreciated and i 'm glad that you 've reinstated that sense of joy that I had on saturday but somehow seem to have lost today but it 's coming back I 've on said they 're enormously encouraging I did to actually really enjoyed it it was a great day yeah so thank you very much and now and I do apologize to Graham much all from the show each community _"

    "text": "surely woods here no Nancy bands attention up on the screen but I 've got a bit of a sweet little bit of an issue oh I guess sorry tena koe toe good afternoon thank you for the opportunity to speak today I 'm here to support my personal submission with regard to the community I live in and it 's supporting infrastructure and this is Diamond Harbour I submitted on four items and I will speak to only one of these today and that 's the planning and resourcing to support the continued operation of the ferry terminal between diamond harbour and littleton particularly providing direct and unrestricted access to central London Street in littleton and maintaining the diamond hoe reward we 're fortunate and diamond harbour to be linked does that come up there to be linked to wider christchurch by a six-minute public transport strategy i might just does that show for everybody okay then I brought handouts just in case could we hand those out please thank you sorry I was waiting for that to to fire I 'll carry on and we 're fortunate in a six-minute public ferry crossing we may drive to the central city in 40 minutes or we may take public transport to the central city in 35 this was excellent forward thinking back when the operation began and today provides a crucial link for residents of the southern base the southern bays being port livvie poo tau diamondharbour charteris bay church bay comprising of 2,000 residents the greater christchurch urban development strategy of 2007 identifies littleton as the greater as the activity or service center for these southern base which it is by 2040 one the population of the southern bays will pass that of littleton and this link is the key to a sustainable future for our economy for our community sorry though patronage dropped post-earthquake due to the relocation of central city businesses this link is becoming more important again as the central city rebuilds and our community is growing it makes living in diamond harbour sustainable it connects us to our commercial and retail services of London Street it decreases the reliance on the personal vehicle and it offers choice and transport modes and reduces the city transport initiatives we already have in the central city being the accessible City document the Christchurch transport strategic plan and others however the council says very little if anything at all in these documents about this ferry connection specifically the littleton terminal may sit within port operations land but it is an asset and service to the Christchurch City Council and Environment Canterbury the community has been in a scenario of uncertainty about the location of the ferry terminal on the Littleton side for almost ten years the residents wish to retain direct pedestrian access or less than 400 meter walking distance to the central London street from be jetty its current location or from nearby Worf 's 4 5 and 6 and you can see that on the map where that 's identified the three-finger jetties fingerboard sorry and the littleton port of christchurch wishes to move the terminal to dhampir bay which is a much longer walking distance to London Street not only is retaining a ferry terminal on Littleton 's waterfront in either of these locations go to urban design it also respects the history of that of the end of Oxford Street was the landing place of the Canterbury Association in 1850 the first settlers and colonists from Europe of the South Island landed on that point at that place and the departure point for epic Antarctic expeditions in the early 1900s these were expeditions that departed with a third to a half of the residents of christchurch lining the wharves to watch this phenomenal event of explorers going into the unknown today 's equivalent might be Barack Obama going on a rocket to Mars that was that kind of sensation we have opportunities here for overlap of heritage culture commercial enterprise and transportation rich experientially and economically viable while continuing to support littleton businesses through these partnerships I recognize that there 's a parallel process at the moment with the littleton port recovery plan and I ask that you the council address the ferry service and infrastructure in public transport planning in the long-term plan and in future transport considerations alongside cycling and the bus services and our pedestrian links and to maintain the very public terminal at the node at be jetty or the infrastructure needs of the growing community of the southern base to answer any questions only the wharf where it lands the wharf where it lands is little Tim port company operation so this is all covered by the Littleton recovery plan which is not a parallel process it 's an alternative process yes yes I know I appreciate that and I 'm familiar and I think that the target of looking at buses and cycle lanes and pedestrians is is worth thinking about how the ferry fits into those connections and how those links are made a transport notice is not a disk is not a destination not it 's a link it 's a change getting people from one place to their residence to the services they need so if it were moved as a result of the little term recovery plan that you would want us to take into account all of those connections and the planning that we do in the connections and the support of the services that the business is a little to offer London Street is bookended by Canterbury and Oxford Street and that ferry to town they get off in the evening I commuted for eight years and you stop to get groceries on your way home you stop at a physio appointment this is the service center and in a growing community we 're going to be relying on this more and more I also think that the move to Dan pure Bay not only a longer walk in connection but offering a bus from that point for the one kilometer up to the town center would be an urban equivalent here in the city of putting the bus exchange at Carlton mill and hagley park and saying here 's your destination there 's recreation here but it 's okay you can still walk to the CBD and we 'll put a bus onto the CBD it 's the yachting at the marina is the different activity to a transport node that people need to access the services okay Andrew two questions and they 're both very quick ones i 'm assuming that you 've put in a submission to the littleton port recovery plant and you 'll be pleased to know said in there about the ferry aligns with the presentation you 've made this afternoon second question the one part of the network that council does have some control over and it 's noted as a priority in the activity management plan in the long-term plan that deals with wharves and marine structure is the wharf at diamondharbour is there anything that you wanted to talk about about the wharf at diamondharbour to draw our attention to our notice in your written submission you 've got some comments around surfaces and signage and so on that is the one part of the network that council can influence yes I tried because of the limited time I tried to focus on the most pertinent and critical in the next ten years thinking about services and infrastructure and that is that location in littleton but yes the maintenance of the diamond harbour Wharf is definitely on people 's mind in the community and its accessibility and learn about the the other points that I made in my submission was the adoption and implementation of the start point reserve management plan and that when people arrive where do they go how do they know the safety and accessibility they 're accessible car parks there but actually getting on the ferry is not accessible so those those issues need to be addressed yet their secondary to I think the most important one of the connection of that link but thank you very much for your time and much appreciated thank you thank you and the next one is slammed Ginny and I 'm going to get the name _"

    "text": "we are obviously one of the two main businesses in governor 's Bay that are open to the public so we actually get a lot of people inquiring about the jetty not just locals that want it kept and reopened and we would be absolutely happy to do a survey on that because it 's phenomenal the amount of people we get each week domestic tourism so from people from christchurch but also from around the country i 'm not sure if you 're all aware that our wonderful margaret Mahy was resident of Governors bay for many many years and there 's quite often I pick up the phone or I say I might be marketing our products around the country and someone will say to me oh you 're from the land of margaret Mahy so he actually also get people coming from around New Zealand that know that governor 's Bay is the home of margaret Mahy and she was very very supportive of the GC and the foreshore as you know as well so I feel that it 's important Canterbury icon again because I have marketing material that 's out there that uses the governor 's made by GC for public and publications that the businesses are actually not related to governors bay but they feel it 's a strong image for canterbury to promote their brand so i just from memory I know that canterbury christ church canterbury and tourism has used the images of the bay Peppa 's resort which I thought was really interesting because they have a really beautiful outlook via themselves but they chose governance by GC to promote their their Canterbury image and I feel that it 's a defining feature with an you know if you see a photograph I wish I could put a recent sunrise photograph I have of the bay and the GTF on on screen there and it 's just it defines governor 's Bay the GC actually defines a few if you see an image you define governor 's Bay in the picture of it and I as i said i believe canterbury through the GT and we 've been part of organizing a couple of dinners for fundraising on the GT for now and we would actually love to continue to do that and actually make it a large fundraising feature for Chumlee again because of its iconic stature really and the previous mere was at one of those dinners and still talks about it when I see him I feel that we 've got a really extraordinary actually a bunch of people behind the project to support the jetty rebuild and it 's quite rare to get that many talented passionate and skilled people together so I know that I know that we can pull it off if we have the council 's backing that 's need any questions box that says I 'm prepared to help the governor 's Virginia restoration trust raise funds and or practical help if we 're able to secure a partnership with the council to restore the GT great news Ellie and then Andrew I did see that you 're looking a bit tired now that damn I should have bought chocolate I will yeah Andrew and we 've only just started this afternoon of course as well yeah thanks for your submission we heard more to come about how much governor 's bail people love the jetty and how governor 's been some ways is defined by the jetty and you put forward a slightly different arguments as part of your submission which is that there 's economic benefit you know you talk about wedding receptions in local businesses as a result of people wanting photos taken of the jetty and so on do you believe that the jetty is a drawcard for tourists coming to governor 's bape yerli to see the jetty because they 've seen it in advertising materials and to what extent do you think that then drives business or economic benefits into businesses like the governor 's bay hotel and she cafe and I do it should I do believe that it 's part of that picture I actually wrote my submission at the governor 's Bay face so I can 't remember anything for that foot in there but I keep writing and writing because I remembered you know all the different aspects so I think that it definitely is like I say that I would actually be get inquiries about what 's happening with the GC will it be repaired and I do believe that I wouldn 't say that people go to governor 's by purely for the GC but it 's part of the picture and certainly when people are considering having a wedding or a function particularly weddings that we 've done many that have got married on the GC that there is a key part of their decision making process of Tim we had another community come to us about their duty and Robertson 's Bay and how they were going though you were getting together with the resources available in that community to assist in repairing or leading the repair and just needing support rather than the counts on the right path of Christchurch paying for the whole thing what are your thoughts on that about your community because you 've identified this as such an important part of your community and is well that 's exactly the approach that we 're taking and there is a committee that set up for the development of the process and the repair of the was here on Saturday you know he 's an engineer there 's several people that not only have the passion but actually have the skills to support the whole project and reduce the costs overall so I see exactly that that the governs bay community and the ticularly that community would be leading the project but we 're asking we 're saying we can 't do it on our own and we need that support vixen i 'm just gonna book just before you go I just want to see if I can um deliver your wish for you but might take awhile cannot go from there yeah it 's not going to work I 'll go with and up email and so on I should oh yeah look how they 've set up the trust now that means yes so you 'll you 'll be working with them yes well yeah yeah and we 're you know I know ourselves in the hotel are really happy to do fundraisers and just provide their rights under three alcohol and chocolate gonna be a winner one yep but yeah just how just being too risk-averse in terms of the facility or is it really badly damaged in doing math I really can 't make a comment on that would be good to us on the night now if I think actually other people from the community that are coming this evening I think it must be within the whole picture of Canterbury and the damage that 's here you know I can 't say how where it should stand and priorities obviously that 's up to you guys to decide and but in terms of damage that doesn 't look that much but I think there 's some piles to be replaced and so forth and you know I think it was just a wise decision to keep Canterbury icons like that particularly when there 's local support from very very talented people that can support the project is old gt 's to suffer from to food maintenance yes I would say that that I think that it is a particular issue with with this as well they 're all characters at the year yeah yep it doesn 't look like the GT for you but there you go surely woods thank you thank you _"

think there 's a bit of a delay in terms of you hearing what I say and there 'll be a bit of a delay and us hearing what you say so we 'll take that on board and make sure we speak slowly when we have questions thank you but thank you as we come out to the winery wastewater submission and my grip prince is detailed in a solution is to proceed as claimed a one-on-one through a sweetie pie I understand that hit that in front of you I want to really keep it Everett lad but I 'd any questions but bearings the first thing is a strong a scissor or this I should I man either postpone or possibly the fear pop Sydney phoning as a counter productive for the economic development of windup and so in the first paragraph I indicate here that it why this pain and I 'm sadistic that winery put fatally at the economic hub of the peninsula rather a nice space and so the pet degree was an improper of the year things can 't_''_125.79 be managed and then it 's a very important part given the unique character of my doing the it is important structure effective the second thing is I want more attention to that winery residence over the time hipping largely marginalized in terms of council expenditure and I indicated there whilst it 's very reasonable that are a small group is a benefit ratio distribute why do you residence by an RC whistle for the rates in terms of necessary and culture for a principal notebook as despite the pain that there are done crowd of children at wandering around yep with wine CI and surfboard there 's nothing in the way of rubbish collection identity wastewater other than what 's taking place of the Rutherford scheme and I could draw attention for example to this length of attention to the small earrings the road had partially collective will be mostly row I mentioned wear a neck spent there was an incident view of weight but only two and a half feet of whip robin li shiiin bra stick one side at took a sample postponement it neeta soong so third argument I 'm concerned that despite a counter-argument by the cock-block meant that there is a discrimination for all of residence by Aundre I don 't mean age are giving the ones that have been the problem I 'm buildings as opposed to the new scheme with it a council expended it 's already been done to me it is very important that older parts of wind early heaven fit equal be a length of good faith of the council knowingly proceed we 're one part add the city the ER village is marginalized gather and it was pointed out the council documents that the Rutherford a state that they are paying extra the services provided then in the case when the expert is provided for the older reticence is a fee to be paid for as well I think that it 's not a good I my fourth one it 's a I raised the surgery and breed by one of the youth staff of this so that the whole area of at sheer driveways and I College a nice bad part then is to say there are a lot of legal issues in the notion of a shared model we are for example when it 's a sheer okay bones people who legally spent but no point they insist bit hot and done son but the out of them ilysm I get beside it to me these my problems with regard to sheep right and shreya driveways as a dominant form of X 's in many of the homes of winery just in the URI that I love them anchorage bay there three shared driveway and about four at least and there 's about 30 properties attached to them so handsome and not i do indicating promise what she had modeled my neck the issuance of sheer drop seems to me a nation of a teen the stick adora teach to a personal situation where as a contents of the earthquakes my field rain was broken during the course of eq appropriate carry out repairs be given at the time the steam that had already been proposed in but for one was about take place it seemed to me very unethical to have the cab the eqc spit pops twenty thousand dollars or whatever when it might be redundant the period of 18 months whether the council now competes to postpone it it particularly puts me in a very difficult situation i 've contacted at the epc and they are to give them a heads up of the situation and i had not had a written response i won 't make a verbal communication so they we 're a bit of an issue but there is a potential problem think by postponing the eqc have closed its books print out of a month appear to look at it even though it 's on little uncertain then I 'm problem quite a difficult perceptive despite the fact i think i would argue habitable final thing that I vivanta sir and that is the assumption the shared model they all the right players have equal can immediate heaven to possibly particularly context of figure that had been state by the council would putz considerably more my house for example is a 100-meter asheville to drive way that would have to be because of the nature of the landscape to be reconstructed these were there are any of the sewage issue so it seems to be the pasta is considerably higher they are what had been indicated in indeed not all ratepayers if they hit to be able to do so well I would argue very strongly as I think the democracy is outputted that the model is unfeasible hustling of clarity it seems discriminatory for people who live in love exists of heaven or a style that I think as a problem of brigham the ultimate hoodlum council it for the rule it 's a are a people of winery proceed as clean the council make it viewed the small population does it better however in developing the plan originally the council has already decided that smart scientist does not bitter and I thought might fall off to the ink problems my understanding is that they add my new scheme is already budgeted I clearly happy now to respond to many priests doubles thank you I think that you know this has been a bit of a learning curve for me as a new mere presiding over the council and I feel that issues like this should really go to a hearings panel rather than to the full council on a long-term plan because we would then be able to hear from all who were affected although we do have others that we 're hearing from today but you 've highlighted a number of issues that are very very relevant to the decision that we need to make and I don 't know whether anyone 's got any questions but I feel that your submission has really spoken for itself and unless anyone does have any particular questions they want to canvas no I really think you 've raised the question of shared driveways you 've raised the eqc issue you 've raised you know the potential discrimination between the older scheme and the newest I mean the older the newer residents are already in this game so you 've raised all of to take into account as we consider what to do I think as a council we weren 't the council that was and play at the time that the earthquakes happened and I think if we had been we may have asked for all of the capital projects to be analyzed at that time and a question that we wanted to ask was whether this was one that we could analyze at this time but I take your point that that has led you to make decisions that you may not otherwise have made so and it do you have a question no just that I I think like I can add this is phil clearwater counselor Phil Clearwater who 's the chair of the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee thanks John and I think i can recall seeing you at wine why new e discussion and i think counselor and andrew turner was there too but it 's good that you 've made your points further today to all of the council so I don 't have any further questions to ask you it 's a very clear submission you now go down in history as the first person ever to be video streamed into the crash tips that he canceled could I destroy change the clothes in there to the speech bubble it is above my eat well done _"

    "text": "maggots representing two submissions so got ten minutes yeah and there 's the two submissions one follow and the other on behalf of project littleton and on behalf of yourself thank you very much for giving me here and is mia delzell says I 'm here on my own account and also on project little tense and where I 'm talking about the same particular phone and here goes I 'll see how good I am with this technology so first of all what I 'm really on about is lyttelton harbour time bank which is part of project littleton invites you as a city council to become a time being but now why i 'm suggesting that is it or have us but heaven as you could become a member within a community such as one suburb evaluate the benefits and then consider being involved city wide I 'm saying why have a time bank way do this and I 've got here it fulfills your some of your strategic directions about a livable city strong communities healthy environment on a process phosphorus economy they a time bank would other reasons would be UK experience really shows quite strongly there 's a lot of involvement on UK and between councils or whatever they call them there our local bodies all I suppose we call them adhere to and end time beings so there 's a lot of research about that the second point I want to make here is that Christchurch City Council has financial challenges ahead being a time bank member would facilitate a significant amount of work being done outside the traditional money system adana saving for the city cancel other reasons it creates further citizen engagement increases day-to-day requirements with the people of the city and strengthens community development now I 'm talking about a time being common sort of assuming that you know what a time being because there a lot of people know but I just go over the main points with it first of all time being because I have proven tall for growing strong communities its individual or organizational members trade the skills they are willing to share so only what you want to share it 's not what you think you the time it takes so everyone 's time is equal it 's a powerful talk in SVD time beats are built on the concept of co-production everyone was a contributor and this is where you start hitting the community development happening because everyone as a contributor it 's not sort of a top-down we all do for you everyone has got something to add to the city and everyone has skills I 've got here examples of hair a few became a time being and how this could work now this I 'm going to talk about two different ways that 's sliding in the next slide so the slides talking about I 'm just giving a few examples with of these heaven or not it 's just to give you a mind some ways to think about it tomm bank members could run local swimming pools they could run recreation centers parks reserves in their area they could prepare meeting places of course all of this would have to be done in ways that comply with standards and so on in an exchange and the council could offer any advice or you might want to run course on something that 's particularly dear do you have and then that could be given talent credit score so that 's one way the usual way of trading the next way this comes out of the UK I swear people in the city might do we are working beings for the whole city and they worked necessary be time bank members but as a time being per group you could issue time bank vouchers and these could be the work be done and then the people who do the work have a choice of what they choose so it could be increased to swimming pools interest to a festival and and I 'm also suggesting that there might be partners that you want to join with like I 've put here as an example the entire tech center all restaurants who have spare capacity at a strange part of the day they could give vouchers to the city and they could be given to people and return for the work so it 's really moving in a different economy and now a this idea and that you agree in principle to the idea of becoming a time being member and that the lovett inhabit I 'm being provides basic information and further reading we 've got a lot of information there and the council identifies some champions within the council needs to have drivers within your organization but it wouldn 't need me and you 'd sign up as a time being inver within the long term harbour base sometime link because it 's one that 's going strongly it 's got over nearly 670 members so it 's quite strong it 's also the first one in New Zealand and Christchurch start study council starts trading and at the same time you start evaluating the exercise and see how it 's working for you and then if it 's working for you you can expand it out to the whole city now I 'm aware that you 're looking at other complementary currencies and I think they are wonderful I 'm thinking this is a good first step because as easy easy is right last one here are there any questions lights and got an example of retirements helping deliver a rich experience for the city thank you well Margaret I mean I just always am impressed by the quality of your presentations but this is the first time that you 've asked the city to become a member of the time being and I I wondered how that would look and so I 've been looking forward to to the submission having you know reflected on the experience after the earthquakes the other thing that perhaps wasn 't mentioned in that was the incredible resource the time bank was you knew where all those skill sets were you knew where they loved you knew what they were prepared to share with their community at the time the earthquake stroke and i think that 's that 's just adding another layer of resilience to a community that wouldn 't otherwise have been there and that knowledge has gone right through the us through the FMA they 've talking about that example of what time banks can do in terms of disaster yeah and I know that counselor mangies raised this question idea of you know sort of working as a community to contribute to to rates you could see the time bank really spearing the development of that I think it gets people to understanding what a complementary currency is now and it 's like flies and things like that people are quite capable of doing seaman yes that 's not so one or the other yes one it 's both Ind that 's great yeah um Andrew thanks for your presentation Margaret and great to hear the little time makes doing so well 670 members I remember coming to a gathering where the time bank had his 300th member i think it wasn 't_''_489.259 that doesn 't seem like too long ago so well done you see this obviously as a way of council doing things very differently and you mentioned community facilities and parks and gardens and so on as ways that we could do there and those sort of comments actually align perfectly with things that we 've got in our activity management plans in this draft long-term plan but you see this as a way that we maybe on reserve management committees or doing other work in communities that could be seen as the council 's area of operation I think it 's a shift in people 's understanding like I was in the village the other day and summits looked and said this or this needs to be done the council hasn 't done this and I 'm thinking no no this is us this is airtel we do it so it 's a shelling shift that view I think we 've been for too long being some other organizations going to do stuff for us I think we as citizens need to look after our own and do it so it 's one way of strengthening late I see ya Jimmy I review the your retainer submission one of the issue regarding to the sales of a seat because you I mentioned off street parking could be sold and also by emotional our counselor committee outcome they have diversity and prosperous economy if a council you know to sell these are off street parking how to achieve the community outcome of livable city and prosperous heard your question entirely where we simply sir because you recommend you know the off street parking can be sold you consider could be sold by the council because it 's not a strategic of the candle shades but you also mention the council our community outcome you know to outcome is the livable city in the prosperous economy even council considered to sell this opacity of off street parking facility how to achieve this outcome I need to pause here the submission was put on by our group and I 've come to submit on the Bank part so I 'm not really well come forth on that part about submissions I 'm sorry I can 't really respond to you Thank You Margaret I 'll just that Ellie very quickly you mention in your submission we agree that key facilities should be prioritized for repair and rebuild facilities that are no longer relevant will use by a community should be solved doing come to mind en I 'm answering the same question I 've come prepared to talk about time binky so oh ok sorry got in yep I 'm the member of the adding some time bank group and I guess but one of the features for me is like a number of elected members is the time frame and I probably had more time when as a community board member I 'm just wondering as the besides us being involved at sort of a council level and I 'm thinking of ways we might going to do there too is a scoped worth who is your community board already involved in as the scope for other communal respects to be involved in time banking to do you think I think very much so they could be at the moment no this is my first foray and two local body politics and we 've had do work with people that are community board members and probably pay them and time credits personally rather than sort of it as a council but not as we hadn 't done that a lot a lot of potential I certainly think there 'd be a lot of interest and exploring how that could be done so and I think that 's set up a working party to see how that would look yeah after having committed in principle so that 's something we 'll consider in the deliberation on the long-term plans and thank you very much thank you now we have the video link so this is _"

first time we 've ever used this technology as a council so we 're and for you know and another another another breakthrough in terms of remote connection them n tony romo nice to see you welcome thank you nice to see you as well thank you for this opportunity to present my submission on the proposed 10-year plan for Christchurch City my submission has three basic points the first one is appointed principal in my view the current city council is in effect the trustees and guardians of the city 's assets envisioned as a city for a number of decades we have held the view that the council has a place in owning assets that will benefit benefit the city as a whole and generate ongoing revenues in our recent elections we selected Emir whom we believe best represents that vision so I guess it came as a surprise to me to see a plan didn 't selling up to fifty percent of so many of our strategic assets in order to pay for a range of assets that i would suggest our questionable value certainly in terms of their ability to produce ongoing revenues for the city itself to be frank it 's my view that if we as a city wanted to see asset council to represent that approach we did not therefore I argue that in order to proceed with the asset sales approach they should more than this should be more than simply a consultation exercise which again to be frank could be ignored at the end instead I believe that if the account is insistent on this course which again I would argue it 's so out of kilter with the decades-long vision of our city there needs to be a formal referendum health only by going down that path can you claim a genuine mandate to take this radically new and to date i believe unsupported direction i 'd argue that failure to do this takes away any and all moral right for the path you 're taking secondly the ten-year plan argues for asset sales as partner requirement with the government to keep balanced budgets each and every year while the notion of balanced budgets is laudable we appear to be bearing to an ideological obsession that does not take account of our unique challenges to give an analogy we 're a person to have a major health crisis to expect it and every year they would have a balanced budget though at times of periods of major cost overruns in order to return to health I 'd argue that is the situation that we have sing the council should challenge the government on this point and do so with the utmost vicar I had heard it argued that the government might seek to force the city 's hand if we fail to balance the books every year to Ajay dog you so what obviously there 's a neoliberal agenda to force the City Council to act in ways that I don 't believe that people wanted to do if the government is going to interfere in some way and we 're going to count out to that rather than challenge it then why would we have the electro representation that we have if I wanted a council that agree with every condition of the current right-wing government for Christchurch I and others again would have elected the appropriate mayor and council we did not we 've got quite a mix of people and we 've got the particular the city then let us all see there and of course if there is no pressure from the government if they 're willing to allow us to run things as we should then I for one see no problem again with a short-term period of unbalanced books in order to achieve what is necessary to get our city back on its feet finally an alternative plan has been put that suggests we eliminate or at least defer some of the legacy projects if we are required to demonstrate budgetary wisdom that surely makes the most sense eliminating or deferring some of those projects I 'm unconvinced the council for example should be funding the proposed Convention Center and a new stadium we 're not or being involved in those things I see the former 's primarily a commercial venture and the letter as a status symbol to me we should be looking at the costs that we are putting into those processes and minimize or eliminate them entirely looking at some of the projects i guess my argument would be it 's in the same vein of a family with they 're still doing well we would not encourage such behavior in families we know we should not be taking such a reckless financial gamble at this time let us get back on our feet the BMW can come later thank you for listening to my submission if we took the convention center off the plane how much money would we save as a council I guess those are the sorts of questions I would like to have fully ups okay the answer to that is 0 right because it 's not on our budget it is on the government 's budget so it seems to me that there 's a view that you 're expressing that would suggest that the council should not meet its obligations under the local government act and be replaced by commissioners I guess on the first of July when we haven 't produced a budget well again I 'd argue the point I 've made which i think is that you 're suggesting that 's what would happen now that 's what the law allows the law allows the government to intervene when the it allows what I 'm putting yeah but yes it allowed it to it doesn 't require it to it but we we have a legal obligation to deliver a budget by the 30th of June hmm I 'm not disputing that I 'm disputing some aspects of it and I 'm suggesting that we have to look at that and perhaps look at the situation where we may end up with an unbalanced budget in some areas not a balance point yeah we 've done that to a certain extent but I don 't yeah anyway Paul that 's Paul lonsdale councillor hagley free meet them are just interested in your comments around democracy and decision making and just these two questions first do you agree that we 're a democratically elected well of course under so you would agree then that any decision we make here would be democratically approved by the council well you 'll note the words i chose the tree words i chose were a moral decision I didn 't suggest you have no legal right to make the decisions you 're going to make you choosing given the significance of that direction I believe there 's a moral obligation to take it out to a plebiscite we 've been democratically elected to make decisions on behalf of their constituents of crisis oh the decisions we make will be democratically will be legally enforceable I 'm not arguing about the legality of it I 'm arguing about the morality of it think i think the yeah i 'm sorry that that 's the end of the time that they leave allocated but always good to hear from you and you ism Thank You Margaret chief _"

    "text": "the mana movement oughta tahi Liana Robertson a surrogate Kiera I chaotic 88 um number he knew Kyoko take at all um I 'm now two Robertson and I 'm gonna cheer woman for mana movement or taytay and I 'll just like to thank you all for hearing us on the sum ting year draft be with you as our submission is really simple the most important issue is the 10-year plan is the proposal to give to the council to the power to sell our city assets I know his four reasons why the council should reject them put any proposal to sell our assets Athens emphasize our assets because they belong to Christ Church citizens not the mere and the counselors one the proposal is anti-democratic there 's been no direct council contact with household or citizens to inform them of this radical council proposal and get the informed feedback this is not a genuine public consultation any asset sales will shift economic power from the citizens to big businesses I will progressively shift Christchurch from being are people sitting to a corporate city to the proposal sell the house in order to pay it a mortgage but this is what the council is proposing we 've seen it all before with labor is seen stripping in the country and the 1980s through privatizations and part privatization that was a failure the council wants us to repeat that failure three the proposal will grow an equality of prostitutes City Council is to sell assets or privatize the city assets and an equality will increase even more than Christchurch the rich will become richer and the rest of us poorer that we will be welcomed by many of the wealthy but we will be heavier burden for families already struggling this distress legacy are prophesied privatizations from the 1980s is with us today with the quarter of New Zealand children growing up in poverty I see it over every day for the proposal is unacceptable there are positive alternatives to seeing assets to meet projected budget shortfalls for example really eight renegotiate with the government the funding for capital projects the government says it doesn 't want to renegotiate this is arrangement but it will always prepare to businesses such as the owners of the owners of the bluff old alum alumna and aluminium smelter on the price as it pays for electricity our mere needs to take up the fight on behalf of the people of Christchurch because you are elected to represent us not the interest of the national government and its wealthy back Becker 's yet manner youjizz you all to reject selling out if it 's here ha here hard to New York they are hitting that I head down with our head down with that what is the greatest greatest on this earth and there 's people people people killed a coat a joke ever I 'd clean you could you I 'm going to take it on face value you know you your assertion about that proposal will grow an equality because I suspect it would could you explain how though that happens we 're going to let with a cell down or a partial sale down of assets how that the kind of equation of that yeah but I think it inevitably does because you 're in a runner sort of was just one particular policy selling one set of assets it wouldn 't have such a dramatic effect but but in the environment we 're in we all know from the past experience of the last 25 years that that that privatization is part of a whole set of things which lead to greater inequality and so if you 're selling assets like Orion for example their priority then becomes that becomes the shareholders rather than their customers so if it 's if it 's owned by the by the city then the priority tends to be the cust ends to be the customers but if it 's owned by privately the the priority will be the shareholders and one of your one of the submitters before talked about my Tahoe or the or the government superannuation fund buying those shoes but but we know better off with that because they are there to make as maximum a return as they can because biggest with to anything here I saw a Ryan 's work firsthand in the east of Christchurch immediately after the earthquakes the CEO cycled around from community laid out a bit of paper with the network there and said to the people he said if we can 't come back to you on Wednesday and because we haven 't got yeah I 'll start again if we haven 't got the power on by wednesday i 'm going to have to come back and look you in the eye tell you that can you please tell us how that might change with a partial well i think i think if you look at the privatization of of electricity generally in the nineteen late 1990s and you look at the effect the the dramatic increase in in the price of electricity over the last ten years will far beyond a five or six times the rate of inflation i 'm not sure and that 's because the those companies want to get the maximum return that what they want to increase their prices as much as they think they can to maximize the return for their shareholders so that the same thing would happen with privatized Orion they will be looking to you know to gauge the people the shareholders whoever the ship is if they 're on a regulated price that they can 't charge more than the regulated price path well i mean i think you get you confusing up with retail and this is ryan as my retailer now that 's fine I i think i think the principal stands you know and i 'm not again i 'm not like i 'm not i think we 're losing sight of the big picture in start I gathered some piece it 's a tad Tim thank you um this ninja do it with regards to rather than selling but get past a shortfall can do we can 't juggle the books of leasing some of the assets and having having a all the Aces hit management structure in or really so if we were to look at leasing with say elements of a social responsibility in those contracts and also when those assets are handed back so after 30 years of whatever and there 's a quality guarantee element of the probably the Aesop being returned forget with also with them brasiliense built in me cc or a museum super fund or whatever you know so which is owned by all New Zealanders what were you thought what would your thoughts beyond those so the s it would return but it 's owned by all New Zealanders whilst that 's being leased out I think I think you 're in the same situation you remember when they sold telecom and we had the Kiwis year which is what you 're talking about it element of social responsibility built into the contract and you look at what actually happened with telecom where you know it was sold in 1990 and then over the next 10 years 12 billion dollars in profit went overseas and then when they sold that up to 12 years they got another they got 12 billion dollars extra in in capital wealth so about eight million dollars in capital gain for the for the owners so i think i think the principal stays the same that the you know building in that social responsibility actually actually had no effect for for New Zealanders at the end of that telecom thing we had was run as a as a monopoly enterprise but it was sold overseas it wasn 't so ACC and New Zealand here ok i 'm talking about it up my nice i see but we would expect a cc you know we expect ACC when they 're investing money to get the best deal they can and they 're not they 're going to be wanting a proper return from the people from from their investment here otherwise they 'd be somewhere else well there to fix the sale for all of the lease price doesn 't look we 've got a little of social responsibility in the IE keeping price at cetera that will bring down with the sale price but i 'm just saying we 've got a issue and I 'm just thinking yes I can gallantly fought without losing it that 's all no I understand what you 're saying i would i would say that i would say that we in looking at those things we 're taking the focus off we 're off the problem with a problem actually is and i really want people of Christchurch will really get behind the council I mean the council national government want to retain the electorate seats they have here in Christchurch they desperate to do it but if there was a movement in Christchurch that really put the wrong name they back off very quickly well we 've got we 've got we 've got an idea about how we might do that so cute oh thank you very much for your submission hey no no no no no no I 'm not my evil twin is not speaking at this moment thank you so that 's that 's all for tonight we have had some people agree to move to another day and with a couple of pulled out so so so that 's fantastic and I think that we adjourn today 's meeting until one o 'clock tomorrow afternoon _"

    "text": "John and say up I I didn 't know you 'd move to Christchurch until I read as a mushroom indeed welcome when did you arrive hmm genuine junior right well welcome welcome to crashes Ricky you 're a coach oh my name is Bronwyn summers and I have returned home after 15 years away and was astonished to find that policy that has absolutely failed at a national level has been touted here in Christchurch namely the sell-off of assets which of course at a state level was started 30 years ago and billions of dollars have gone off shore of things that you and I owned before this is my offer shortsightedness and I think it shows a complete lack of political force site you are selling off what rightly belongs to us all and more importantly future generations what will be next for Christchurch house in water and anything else that none of you were mandated to sell one of the Australian states is currently floundering around trying to find something they haven 't already flawed off to sell because they have Christ 's no one here alternatives and I suggest that those of you who sent they should be sold should resign and let democracy take its place I think talking about alternatives there are always lots of alternatives and we have in terms of the proposal that the council 's put before the people of Christchurch give us the authority to sell one hundred percent of all of the assets that 's essentially what the council saying and we have seen this all before we saw in the 1980s in particular 1984 with the Labour government then we sort with national government our national assets were we were asset stripped and they were assets which which the people learned but they were stripped away by the government and of course we always told you no no would it be worse off this is a wonderful policy they 'll be trickled down everybody will benefit we were told that in 1984 and here we are in 2015 with a quarter of our children growing up in families living in poverty that 's just well it 's annex was only unacceptable to my generation and it should for them we 've just a list of four things there if you 've got our submission on after you live in front of you but there are four things that we see and it 's based around renegotiation and I want to make this point really clear renegotiation the corporate set to do this all the time they do it every day of the week they go to the governor say we don 't like this we want to renegotiate look at skycity what they did and they got the government to agree to reduce the size of the convention center they were proposing to keep it within within the original budget well the sky city 's budget and we 've seen Rio Tinto you know every time every time they every couple of years they go to the gums or they threatened to close the aluminium smarter and I have to say it would be wonderful if they did close it because it 's actually of it 's been a huge drain on this community for a long time the community of New Zealand it you know they anyone in the country so what I 'm saying is that this renegotiation it 's just part and parcel of what happens and the christchurch city council needs to go to the government and renegotiate these things the capital projects and the the cost of the building horizontal infrastructure and the convention center money you know if you 're here in the last 10 minutes while the convention center may the government 's paying for that so so we 're not considering it that 's the wrong way of looking at it this is a hundred and sixty million dollars the government has earmarked for Christchurch if you ask the people of Christchurch they 'd say we don 't want that money spin on a convention center we want our roads fixed up we went out when our foot Pass fixed up I think the council needs to act on behalf of the people of Christchurch rather than on behalf of a National Party agenda and let 's I mean we all know that the over the last few years the government has been squeezing and squeezing and angling just position where it is forced to sell assets and i think that the the the Council the mayor and the council need to go to the people of Christ you can say and bring the people of Christchurch on site because the government will back off if there 's a strong response from the council which would be backed up by the citizens of Christchurch all of the Snead 's renegotiation we do not want to see people of Christchurch repeatedly have said we don 't want to sell our assets even the former mayor who is a much more conservative individual apparently he said he 'd never they would never sell city assets and yet it 's been considered here so i think the you know I think we 're where it seems to me the whole discussion has got around we 're looking at individual treason and when we 're forgetting that there 's a forest there and the frost is actually the the welfare of the whole community of christ church so our our I guess Brahman and I we 've been mulling this over we would on this bring the people at Christ John side and say to the government no we don 't want a National Party agenda for Christchurch we want to we want to an agenda for the citizens of Christchurch thank you can I put a different scenario to you one that kind of goes previous council here is a here is a mechanism whereby you can basically hide the financial reality of what has been signed up to I an unaudited three-year plan people make commitments and run on those Commandments as part of an election campaign and they get here and find out that it was all smoke and mirrors and that there are some huge holes in our budget and then we 're told that we have to find a resolution to that problem without necessarily having access to all of the tools that one would hope to have if you were in the non audited environment so let me just put this to you if say for example all of the cost sharing agreement was put to one side and all of the anchor projects were off the complete the work on getting our damaged infrastructure fixed what would you do what i would do is say to the government that the priorities of christchurch our deeds and we want to renegotiate the agreements which have which we 're rich previously that 's I mean it 's as simple as that no no but but for example the end the horizontal infrastructure it 's a predetermined rate of contribution from central government for Murray determined asset renegotiate I mean the government with the go what I 'm saying is is that it 's I think that there is an assumption that 's being made that there is some have more that is jus and what if there isn 't more jus under the cost sharing agreement that we have now right from the artsy of the government rejected the idea of having a.m. where they call it done that everyone in New Zealand Plaza pays a flat year a flat fee right I 'm done with it right the government rejected that how dumb was that well okay that 's done they made that decision you know they to tell the government this is completely unacceptable we didn 't know the situation was as bad as it was we 've we 've now got this crisis where we have to come and we have to renegotiate and instead of the government pressuring the council to sell assets the council 's pressure and the government has say look we 're not selling assets that 's completely off ball we didn 't know council here campaign to sell assets and we some say the government you know this is what the people need and they rejected other options in the past world that 's their problem it shouldn 't be the ultimate is our problem now Ellie quickly so you go to the government you say right either renegotiate or actually give us some more money and they go I don 't think so what do you do well you say to them you get the people of Christchurch on site is what I said before you get the people of Christchurch on-site people of Christchurch do not want their assets oh and if the council comes up with a 's Choice people have come up with worth and an alternative but the council comes up with an alternative and says the people this is what we 've got you 'll find 75% of the city will say no we don 't want we want to keep our assets and we want this absolutely but if we can 't get an auditor account across the line an audited budget across the line by the 30th of June more then you will have your wish I think that we 're less true well the point is that I can 't_''_598.029 I just don 't understand why the council is so reluctant to challenge the government publicly in a way the way you 're making assumption the West got well like I 'm watch I 've seen it yeah we are but we 've been awaiting the independent review of the horizontal infrastructure and we 're all all as soon to be revealed Becky stars John just in terms of the assets that the current the City Council Owens people of Christchurch own do you have a some are more valuable than at the moment we are investing very heavily post-earthquake in the enable network so we are committed to spending another 300 or so million dollars on a new asset purchased post-earthquake so it does that have the same degree of strategic value to you as the port the airport and Orien I think that 's the problem i said before about looking at you know tree by tree we 're looking at the whole forest I mean the cow or should be investing in and developing new you know new infrastructure itself for the benefit the people of Christchurch there 's no problem with any of that but we shouldn 't be looking at selling the assets which we have I mean it 's like that if we didn 't invest a bit money we could have loaded all of the date on to those companies the existing companies use that is the problem is that i don 't know that people were a hearing what the problem is and I mean you know I 've been problem is we 're missing the big picture he was ripping Johnson that a submission against selling assets and this it could be detailed how the projected budget for short ball shortfall could be met I said it would be better rather than just coming along and saying no to any asset sales come with the alternative and it has to be an audit of all resolved well we come with your children no ask the government for more money they drillin renegotiate the agreements no but it means us the government for Jersey what it does and rio tinto do it skycity does it the corporate sorry we don 't have quite the frontier bag and acquisition and and they yeah anyway but but we may get to the point that you were looking for anyway sorry but thank you very much much appreciate it and last for the evening _"

    "text": "Stephanie hazel grove hi good evening I just want to make the point that I 'm here to support those people who want to keep our assets for Christchurch and in particular water I 'm against the privatization of water for New Zealand and ended in Christchurch of course water must belong to the people it 's our life the basis of people and our food supply it mustn 't be privatized it can be argued that having a clean water supply pipe to a city as it was done last century and sanitation and the ability to to wash and have em basically clean water is more important and has done more for the health of the public than any medication so once again my my view is I 'm against privatization of water thank you that the plan as it stands at the moment doesn 't propose that we sell their you know set up a company and sell you know the company to to to anyone there was some discussion earlier on in the year about using charging as a mechanism for conservation you know we have going to resent the fact that our generation you know put our pristine water on our lawns and and showered or nuttin flushed our toilet whether you know it 's just to me it 's extraordinary that we haven 't taken stronger measures around the conservation of our pristine water supply that we have here in Christchurch and I wonder have you given some thought about how we protect the apply I agree with you on the privatization of it by the way but this that the conservation I 'm it 's something that I 'm grappling with because the only the only comparisons that I 've seen that actually show how you reduce dependence on the water supply for those basic services as to charge for the extra use of it I 'm not an expert on how the council would do that and do charging I know some councils in New Zealand do charge for water like Dunedin but I think there 's a difference between well they 're just there is a difference between the council and contracting out management of the infrastructure that 's one thing being able to say this is true or not that charging for the water making an additional charge for the water could be done without privatisation but that 's a serious distinction I 'm sort of kind of sidetracking them I 'm saying it 's a given around the privatization but how do we consider their water that 's a very good question in it I do you think that 's a priority for the counts yes I do great do you think so yeah I man I do too Becky could I just pick up on what you said here I don 't think there 's any proposal whatsoever to privatize water I think it would be an ethyl matter even contemplate it but just in terms of the new stadium or the convention center the stadium has come up a lot of times a lot of people have said delay it further we 've already laid it eight years and so a lot of people have said delay it further I 'm assuming you 're saying either don 't do it or just delay it much further but anything it 's completely built and actually operated not by the council so there is no cost to the car so and that at all would you still want it delayed given that it 's completely government to work other people funded I thought there was a part of it being paid for by central government and another percentage to be paid for by not so number where we have nothing on our budget for us well as that 's a different issue but in my my opinion I think that it 's not a clear asset for the central city it 's an international more of an internet and attractive for international participation which is a good look for the city but to my mind if it 's there especially earlier than the rebuild or as an early part of the rebuild then I don 't see how international conferences will benefit Christchurch because i think that the payment for them will go offshore restaurants will there will be some restaurants but how much of a convention center and a stadium will benefit Christchurch I think that 's overestimated yet I think the council-owned an operator that yeah but we that 's not what 's being proposed so if we if we delay the convention center or stop the convention center from being built it doesn 't take a cent of the budget that we 're looking at for the LTP well I 'm happy that it be delayed if necessary more but it doesn 't it doesn 't save us any money of it under your views are accepted by a large number of people but i think it 's usually more about the scale of it I mean it 's just so big and I think there 's a lot of people who are saying it doesn 't need to be that scale yeah I mean just looking at the plans and I haven 't researched this but just to me it doesn 't it doesn 't look like something we must have now we 're not sure what it will be how beneficial it will be but we do know that we must have the streets and water infrastructure and all the rest of that yeah but it 's a good powerful message to end on thank you very much thank you cheers and a spark _"

    "text": "good evening you worship counselors thank you for the opportunity to speak I 'm David Chamberlain just like to make a couple points to the submission I made and the first part of it selling small percentages of several assets and my opinions not the right option it will only provide a profit to lead managers who are providing the IPO and once again it 'll be the rate payers who will suffer because council will end up selling a bigger portion of each of the assets to cover the cost of the IPO the other point I 'd like to make is I think that the best option was the first one that counsel was considering and that was to sell a portion of CC HL doing that we could have one or two long-term corn stone shareholders like night tahu that perhaps the superannuation fund maybe even one of the big banks would be interested this would release the funds that needed to repair the city and we 'd get our services back to normal that way we 're only dealing with one particular asset and there 's be talking to two or three selected that is to provide you with the phones that are needed and that 's all i think i should say mr. illusion thank you um and it 's good to have a bit of time for some questions some good breath yeah thanks David so we didn 't really get to discuss this before with previous submitters but you 'd be happy we 've already made about having partners like night are who or the superfund delays cereal and KiwiSaver funds as longer too vestas that week buy those shares back from in the future I think that they would be good long-term providers in they have the fans available to actually invest i never thought of acc that would have been another one that 's probably quite good then always looking to invest and i believe that it is good to have someone who 's going to be a long-term partner and we 're sitting in a building that you 're in a partnership with no Terry now and they 're just proving to be quite worthwhile so why don 't see and its really interesting that you say that this is a this building 's of worthwhile partnership are you aware of how much this building is costing us is a city yes I know that the the agreement sorry I don 't know exactly exact cost but I know the agreement was pretty strong on and maybe not i who are on the winning side of it but it is a long-term option and I believe that you will have the opportunity at some stage to renegotiate this building I what I kind of really appreciated about about this was that you 'd you 'd started from a position of being opposed to the idea of you know sheer of CC HL being sold to a strategic partner but that the more you thought about it and then looked at what the other options were that you felt that that you came back to that point but on the the porch one I was interesting that you 're sort of basically I think that what you 're identifying is is that the port probably has Littleton has probably more of it might actually end up costing the city so it may not actually be the best investment for us to be involved owners it explore that a bit further yeah the idea with the putting the ports down is it happened with both Auckland and Littleton sorry both the Auckland Council and the Christchurch council both sold off their ports then suddenly something happened and they bought them back now I think that here it was a matter of the ACH sales but a Northlander it was the case if they got scared off by the thoughts of Darren and ports of Tehran are very strong they 're big independent company and they doing very well that 's still 44% owned by their regional yes yes they do have a portion sixty-six percent owned by their region and their region now earns more from sixty-six percent than it in from a hundred percent but they 're also a very aggressive for any interest in timaru which are very interesting to ask them present a threat to our port well exactly right they had the option they did want to buy it so they bought a block each year and that was submit was eventually they said that wasn 't worth it so they joined prime point and they now have an internal port at rolleston which is going to be big they also have the same thing in such a situation that worried because they have a partnership with Northland port but the real point was selling yes it looks re I 'm run we ought to see the light flashing the real point with the port is if you cannot sell an asset sell it all get out of it all together and let let the public run up don 't don 't miss about with bits of it either there or as i see it originally thought the part that I like the best is to be every partnership was somebody with cci gel yeah that 's great look thank you very much for your time and for making us so much on them for being thoughtful in that regard thank you and the next _"

    "text": "good evening welcome thank you thank you your worship and hardworking councillors I saw your working last week I understand you 're going to continue with these hearings next week my name is Louis Wells and Maya support person is mr. dennis o 'connor from this raiden neighborhood network to which organization I am indebted for showing me how to make the submission against asset sales I realize it is a tough task financing our cities rebuild but I urge you to hold back till all the financial data is on the table and known with certainty before disposing of any assets these assets give our citizens a stake in our city they contribute to our sense of belonging I 'll give us a feeling of control over our lives having some say in the airport Orion city care and red bus they also provide employment for many in the city and I feel they ensure that Christ Church will not become too expensive a place for many families to live in as well they provide financial security for future generations I welcome the delay in the building of the less pressure on finances I encourage you to keep negotiating with the government for a better deal I know it 's a tough past however you and I were not responsible for the devastating quakes so why should we be burdened with rapidly increasing rates and is not the rebuild firing our economy and helping fill the government 's coffers finally I would like to refer you to page three of my submission with the list of the 16 names of those people who supported it of the 21 people invited to do so one man had already signed one was uncertain a third said he 'd do anything to get his rates down but what struck me most was that only one person another man stated that he was pro as it sails and of the women one decline and 11 gave support and without hesitation however i hope you the council will hesitate before disposing of any of this treasure trove of assets which was so carefully combined compiled through the foresight of our ancestors as a hedge against our city becoming too expensive for its citizens or big a risk to take the rebuild won 't go on forever but assets can thank you thank you very much um it 's great that you you know talked to so many people when to get a flavor for you know how they are responding to the situation that we run you in terms of the in terms of the situation that we 're in in terms of priorities you know getting getting streets fixed on getting pipes folks and things like that do you think that 's the priority I suspect it is and as unique drainage and things like yeah so drainage pipes the and the and the streets yes that would be pretty much the top priority for you as your other perhaps need a list but the rates increases that what what did your neighbors and your friends think of the rates increases that we 're proposing well there was the one man who said he 'd do anything to get the rates down I didn 't really discuss rates with other people I can simply invited them to support my submission which was opposing submission we were told early in the piece no one would be whistle do you think it 's growing too long a boaters say that that would apply to the council as well which actually it belongs to the people I 'm not sure quite what you 're asking do you think that phrase no one will be worse off applies to the council as well when I guess they 're part of the city yeah I think yeah slightly unfair question because it was a statement made after the September earthquake not but I febri wait yeah it 's probably unfair I mean that there were promises made and I 'm not sure that they 've been kept I think that promises were made after September and after februari I think that it should have been an opportunity for someone to say oh no this is much bigger than September and we can 't keep those prices and and then had a reset around expectations I think that would have been reasonable but people still have heightened expectations around those sorts of commitments that one after September and I you say that there was the contract was sixty percent help from the government he succeed I would say that this was so huge and so devastating that sixty percent would never be enough yeah thank you because you 've actually highlighted that 's the that 's one of the issues that we are confronted with and and what you 're saying is that we should actually ask the government for more than what they committed to learn the cost sharing agreement I think we should I guess thank you yani I know it 's been put to you that you know the choice between asset sales and fixing up a broken streets and the suburbs but I also wanted to get your feedback on the central city because we 've got a hundred and sixty million on budget to gold plate already earthquake repaired streets in the central city and I just wonder so you asked putting that in a slightly pejorative way seriously seriously you ask your question have 160 million doesn 't I took this out of time because of the five minutes was that okay um gold plated just say we 've got 160 million dollars on budget for the central city streets and how does that sound to you when now not so damn so just to give you one example we 're proposing to spend 16 million dollars on five blocks of kilmore Street which has already had a tooth quake repairs to to weigh out at the same time we 're proposing over 30 years to fix the earthquake broken streets in the eastern suburbs so I just wanted to get a sense from you because many people have said to us I don 't think that we 've decided that the streets and the East are going to wait for 30 years yeah well some over a longer period of time and so just in terms of the central settle which is about it 's about 1.2 billion I 'm really regretting letting you make this question out of time um and I want you on the central city but I just wanna ask what 's your view on the central city projects the expensive projects that will lead into a short projects like convention center they could well be set aside for a period and delayed thank you very much thank you and thank you again for going to so much trouble to make a submission and then to come here and present it on behalf of so many people thank you thank you the next person is David Chamberlain _"

    "text": "dammit boot re thank and I think the specific community so it 's a representative group good evening welcome hi normal a burn fat Salafist OPM muwah fear my Louisville fan favorite on the loo and more tonight specificity need auto Tay karaka take the tour coming to me in Dakota a teeny well I 'm same day this is twice month and this is chris many who many of your work will know so we 're part or representing Pacific communities here in Canterbury to bring the submission to you which you already have but there are some key points that we 'd like to make tonight and first thing is that we realize that you guys have a really hard job and we do acknowledge the hard work of challenges that you face but like the former um submitters we actually think that central government needs to contribute more to the rebuild just to continue things going for Pacific communities although we are a small community we have contributed for a very long time to the city and up until 2010 the Christchurch City Council had what we in at the Art Center since 2010 and differently since the earthquake there has been a little or decreasing engagement with specific communities which is one example and we think that for effective participation of Pacific peoples here and and Christchurch there needs to be better engagement with Pacific communities in terms of what they do our one of our young leaders Josiah and mere of the cheat and as mere in the chair raised four points that we 'd like to support one that the City Council should continue to support youth activities within a server communities such as spec Beck and Polyfest that council should be sending a representative to the Christchurch cpn which is the Christchurch Pacific and it work it has a head representation on that network for a long time and that they council needs to reinstate a pacifica reference group so that you continue to have better engagement than you do currently so that you can continue to improve the services that are provided for specific communities so the the issue of Pacifica engagement is about participation we are all active contributing ratepayers and that council needs to come to the party and be better at engaging with communities and there we have noted in our submission to you ways that that can be done one of the key priorities that we think is really important given the earthquake as and it 's been on the council add you well we 've raised it with counsel for the last 20 years probably and that 's the notion of having a Pacific village one of the things that we tend to forget here in price huge is that as I 'll terrible as a Pacific nation and I 'll tear or as an island we 're all actually Pacific Islanders but you can 't tell in Christchurch it 's very hard to see that you 've integrated Pacific architecture at flavor and tombs of our lap landscaping and what we see in our packs you can 't tell that in Christchurch we still I like a city in England you know and we 're in the Pacific Ocean so we think that integrating all flavors of Pacific into the city is really really important and to be a diverse and vibrant place and diverse and vibrancy differently as seen in the Pacific so along with it in terms of integrating stuff around participation it 's also about develop developing different types of relationships we 're all in to Christchurch being assisted sister city to places and Japan and China and wherever why can 't we be assist us atty to places like a beer look well offer Fiji 's about Glee not okay you know you know what I mean so we need to think a little more regionally in terms of the Pacific around economic development around trade we 're prepared to bring you know families here from a purse of it to work and to work on the rebuild we know there are a number of filipino families here but we also know that under the government 's read a seasonal employment scheme there are lots of pacific island families that come over so it 's just about council having a rethink about the relationships you have and you who you could be doing with it who you could be doing relationships with 's an assumption that most pacific islanders are migrants in actual fact glaive statistics show that sixty percent of the Pacific population a new zealand or so we have every right to be here we have we definitely have historical and relationships with with marty in terms of my teho so there are a number of ways that we can collaborate vocals ewee with local government with central government and the private sectors to think about how we could do development bitter because development isn 't just about money it 's not just about economics it 's actually about people and i think that for us pacific communities as well as all the communities in christchurch need to be considered very carefully in terms of a long-term plan there are just some other issues that people raised that I want to meet you and one was that there was a group of older guys who are really clear that they 'd like to retain the Rafferty golf golf course under Rafferty club management there yeah that the planes stadium be the food for at least another ten years it was terms of that inner city funding and marketing stuff around anchor projects and what 's happening a definite it definitely needs more diversity in terms of the transformation Legacy Project projects they 're absolutely needs to be a Pacific flavor I mean I think for as the instances we think of us as a Pacific nation and remember where we are and all of the people that connect us globally throughout the world in here maybe our willingness to be able to collaborate about solutions rather than just see us as part of the problem okay that 's enough for now happy times questions for that that your comments just ended on a perfect note because I agreed you know you can 't possibly focus on on problems without the young people as part of the solution I 'm just ridiculous so yeah it 's a very very powerful statement Oh Jimmy chain two questions okay first one you articulation would lie to prioritize investment for development on the Easter site in the home be I regarding the home be a my understanding people I 'm not counsel they have plan we ever put into the Southwest aquatic center in the also new home big library service and accept the loss of acidity what kind of facility you think home be need to prioritize it 's a really good question considering i 'm not from home babe um yeah I think the you 're asking the right question and that 's the localization of that engagement yes and there are pockets of Pacific communities all over Christchurch and nary Artem and the Selwyn and why me districts and further afield and they 've come here for the jobs just like my dad came here in the in the 60s to work within a sea as an avionics engineer they 're coming here for the work and I think when we talk about engagement and the development and support it does need to be localized in it I think it actually needs to be at award level and so if we 're looking towards a community governance structure I think it would be really valuable to have will give some thought to how pacific and other cultures can be engaged at conclude yes okay thank you man second crease your particular subject suggest you tonight space the party skyline for a culture in the linguistic divers come it community they won do you think I 've already consider all those of Pacifica community or not yet whether cover the Pacific community the cult called caot our cultural and linguistically values yeah so um and it 's part of the issue like with Pacific communities culturally and linguistically you know the cool thing is something that 's been as another label yes excuse me there has been put on us and we are culturally and linguistically diverse but we 're also part of the Pacific region that a four-hour Tarawa you we just need to be cognizant of where we are in the world okay thank you okay yeah thank you I 'm Phil mmm thank you very much Chris 's you 've partly answered the question I was going to ask what I just wanted to take a bit further that 's especially around relationships a at their ward level and like we you 're probably aware we hope to strengthen to ask you about is some ways that you think that are strengthening communities teams to might be able to kind of like engage better with the pacifica community I 'm not sure if this is the place for that forum but I think what we did want to do is signal that would we see real value head and for the community boards and for the council is a collective for that would based engagement you 'll be aware healthy families as an initiative to bring a range of different entities together as a as a partnership with Pacific trust Canterbury having a lead role which is unique and it 's a real real positive for us yeah and that 's sure it 's sprayed and Heath get to start with but i think if we can get that engagement right it will just provide a framework to do so many things that we could not do an arrow if that 's council on its own in Pacific and others thank you Chris and where is it really coming from to as part of that that 's empowering community people on the ground and in the suburbs baseless silver centers to do their work so my other but the other part of my question too is there any other specific ways apart from what you 've mentioned perhaps that at a council level that other governments level there in fact we could also assist you I Sam might want to contribute as well I want to acknowledge the counselors and community board members who pro- and set up an opportunity to engage with Pacific at the Boston club four or five weeks ago I mean that was great and it just showed a a signal from the elected members and staff working together that they were open to that engagement and so I think there is an opportunity for council elected members and possibly senior management especially with your new structure maybe there is an opportunity it might just be an annual conversation could be other food I guess the other food so it does have to be all day and we know some good caterers and over there there 's an opportunity of you vehicle so that 's to consider their engagement to I think we 're very keen on its alluring the idea of you know what we can do in partnership me there is much more than absolutely hounsell came to feel others because I just think that that naturally leads it to a deficit model and drinks model and the communities offer so much strength you know and it 's best not to ignore that so you know thank you very much for your submission and look forward to ongoing engagement that 's not overthinking thank you right and next one is Lois wells _"

bare but not there babe welcome thank you Oh Mario rocky terrain amore or a key to pin wah mario rocky tell family they had a tickle hooked or head tucky tehee their tech eating dinner Cotto to rockland how do i okay my name is Steven have this is mary borden we Rick receipt um keep our assets can debris I 'll it Marie start he 's about to run you through a few cracks some key points you 've got our submission six of them very brief showing the council 's commercial assets will only be the beginning not the end next in line will be social housing indeed there 's already started in water parks libraries roads and the whole gamut of council assets and services the council is on a slippery slope to flood North a lot not just all the commercial assets but everything to it is not the council 's own material is the question of asset sales and rates increases of course when rates initially when you go up and up the council went over the income stream from those flogged off commercial assets to keep those rates increases to a tolerable level which is precisely the rationale for them being owned by the council three who will buy these assets it won 't be the mythical quote-unquote mum and dad inevitably it will be transnational corporations and the people of crisis will lose control over our own destiny as a cohesive portfolio of publicly owned and hugely valuable assets will be broken up and sold off to a collection of different transnational corporations whose top priority is securing the highest profits and biggest returns for their shareholders for the Council on Christ huge will lose the ability to build on resilience to the city 's vital infrastructure quote a ryan chairman craig boy succeed city ownership of Orion had allowed company to do some things that private owners would probably not have done such as earthquake strengthening from the 1990s direct quote from Boise does with regard to debate over City ownership of certain as its boys back so Ryan stayed in city-owned direct quote utilities providing essential services particularly where they are seen as a natural monopoly I think they should stay with the community and quote priest 12 7 12 contrast publicly owned a Ryan 's proud record of acting in the public interest with the Chevy record of the overseas own dwelling to the electricity five what 's the Russian panic the Auckland City Council website makes a valid point quote that is fair to spread the cost over the generations who will use the assets unquote the Christ huge City Council is being stampeded by debt Asteria Shock Doctrine and disaster capitalism and to making hasty and irrevocable decisions that will have permanent negative effects on the people of Christchurch 6 and final democracy is their greatest asset and the one which is under greatest threat and Christchurch no counselor campaigned in the 2030 election on a platform of selling assets those you now call for asset sales should resign and seek a mandate on that policy at the next local democracy first of all let me congratulate the people whose choice counselors for coming up with an alternative it 's interesting to see that they can do that when we have been told there are no turnips Tina has always been a 30 games of democracy Tina means there is no alternative and to come up and say Tina is the old separate ploy of suggesting there are no attentive if this council was really concerned with maintaining democracy they would have made sure they 're bureaucrats delivered some alternatives secondly we can see from the Cameron reports terms of reference that the decision to sell was made before commissioning the Cameron partnership and we have serious concerns about the Cameron partnership because they have been involved and dodge key asset sales before teleconference tins they 're not ashamed of this they actually boasts the batter on site the council has a large bureaucracy they have access to all the figures they should be able to come up with some alternative the four options given in the and the 10-year plan document are not really that much option they all slippery slopes why don 't you start selling assets a continued Cameron partners missions or sale of water assets page 46 I think it is consuming 47 is exciting so we 're happy to take questions or discussion good questions Yanni thank you thank you for submission just in point 7 you talk through that 's the cost year and I just want to give you just elaborate on that just just in terms of the public process and also what commitments or lack of commitments that that hasn 't it you mean the 60 40 cost share split with them with the central government well I think I 'm eventual running away with from the council a bit at the moment because we see that the ccd you and Sarah are making decisions about running out the anchor projects now so it 's very clear from looking at the various bodies involved like eggs and ccd you and Sarah that the council has got a very small point in this process and so the council 's not making the decisions that count the central government 's making the decisions meeting that responsibility I would say that I was impressed with council and Menzies appearance on campbell live on friday night my message to councillor menu would come back from the doubt side it 's more like over the side so obviously good to see you having a wreck since you have so now I know okay I mean here 's a question for you so you say in 2015 the council expects to receive 46 million dollars that 's the dividend with cchr which is on an asset base around 1.6 billion dollars that 's less than three percent you then say if the assets were sold which is not what we 're intending to do this income is lost to the council forever and we will all suffer from every rate rises try to explain that sense is because it 's completely untrue so well everything 's completely untrue thin them the Cameron report is also untrue because the Cameron report makes it very clear that holding these assets has kicked our rates down come via to comparable City Council given what you don 't understand is that annoyed small you know that how little that 's the issue I do understand opportunity costs what you should be actually say is what you 're spending that money on is the issue well I could I could stake that money in the bank in the markets you could end five or six percent of you don 't to be making money what we see there 's been counseled borough because they 're a secure risks they can borrow a lot lower than the average month and father Barela cap what we also see is in PPP 's which I define as a social service paid for by a central or local government but delivered by a private entity with it 's an NGO or a corporate entity what we see is the people they end up making the decisions in those situations are the kept the people that supply the capital the money you 're not answering that 's yeah I am and so what we see is costs increased hugely simply holding those assets keeps costs down doesn 't well that 's even after all the PPP reading talk about your statement around heard the fact that we all suffer from heavy rates rise yes we will suffer from me rewrite charge because I was delivering those services will increase because of corporates are they to make a profit but that 's all folks some people move around talking about the dividend loss well I realizing there 's a capital return so it depends what we do with that couple air capital is this a dividend loss so in that case you might argue what that dividend is we 're told that it 's been pretty good in most cases except for city care which seems to have a an empire building you said an empire building an empire building three percent return I 'm asking you to justify your statement you 're not able to do so i think i have done sober out the other return we get is a return that Orion chairman describes which is resilience that 's a very important return and most of the people with a Christchurch lives through the earthquakes earthquakes and had their power back on very quickly would just to address your point at seven o 'clock tonight there 's a public meeting at the netball courts was to academics from Wellington no I mentioned it before and I said I was very frustrated that it was held on a night while we 're having hearings unto the LGP because i personally like to go and hear that don 't worry and paul harris its gdp to Herot p their heads and they actually compare the increase in price of still publicly owned wellington water since the 1990s which is something like 17.5 percent compared to the increase and rates within our privately in fact overseas owned well into the electricity everyone online is regulated the prize the prize path is regulated and set by the Commerce Commission so johnny was it yes i know but the comparison isn 't the right comparison what you 've got to do is compare apples with apples which is electricity with electricity so did the privatization of wellington because i actually think you can make the case that the privatization of wellington meet that they didn 't invest in resilience as prices increase out of line with the rest of power prices because i don 't think that is the case all the all the research i 've read on BP it 's a PPP situation no it 's not it 's a perfect situation under the definition I gave you which was a public service pay for or led by a local single government and and delivered by a local that 's not we 're not so so so every in every situation there where there 's been cost reductions they have come in wages and in situations with such things I was actually trying to be on your side here I think you 've got a really good argument around the resilience question but to compare water with electricity distribution it doesn 't make sense to me I mean did did other electric due to ryans prices increase at a lower rate because it hadn 't been privatized the point that refs making is that it 's a regulated price path and in fact Orion has had to go back to the Commerce Commission to reset its price path its network and that 's not surprising after a major earthquake no but that 's my point is that it 's a regulated monopoly monopoly so the argument around resilience is a really powerful one I haven 't heard the price a differential made out I haven 't heard that argument made out the price differential is always there 's always going to be pressure on prices when these monopolies I think we both accept that I think Roger would accept that to you can regulate but the regulations are always under threat by governments that are committed to neoliberal know but this why we have a Commerce Commission you know cuz I Commerce Commission is not independent it 's it 's built with people who are ideologically driven along one particular line here 's a public role but anyways at me are there are other questions Phil reference you make to on page one to one for us is numbers is what in the Cameron report are referred to as risks and you 're really saying they should only be seen as uncertainties display there 's not only filled fall within a normal probability curve and you can sort of work on them uncertainties are just set and it seems that most of the uncertainty involved here is uncertainty and how central government is going to make decisions and where they 're going to live up to their their own commitments to fund and the other uncertainty is seems to be the costs which are driven up by the cosy monopoly that 's been set up under sarah with the construction companies and the third uncertainty is the insurance uncertainty but Abby 's been changing very quickly and I 'm not exactly sure with the insurance and certainty is at my but those suits and the one uncertainty that if the council wanted to be really democratic they would address is that uncertainty of the of the cost share agreement with central government and they should be coming out and telling the people of Christchurch this is where the major in 30 years this is where we 've been Nick down you the people of Christchurch need to know that and we 're not being we 're not seeing if it turns out that the cost share agreement calculations were based on a on an assumption that didn 't turn out to be sustainable at law because the government always funds after an earthquake they always pay sixty percent towards the horizontal infrastructure and they pay eighty-three percent as it was in this case for the roads but what if it turned out that they didn 't owe us any more and we still have to repair our land drainage recovery program we still have to you know and this that 's what I want people to focus on us as what if that is the case because if that 's the case then we actually have to construct a new relationship with central government about how we 're going to fund what is a substantial amount of work that still needs to be done and selling off assets is not the way to fund it these assets are the toolbox not the family George yes we live so you 're saying that central government should pay more than they contracted to pay if it turns out they 've central government has paid the cashier agreement seems to be Philly it will be all out in the open very very safe I assure you it should have been out in the open before these hearings started we 've only just finished the underpayment review the obvious answer is to as the People 's Choice has done delay and defer so we delay fixing the footpaths over on east of Christchurch we delay fixing the road so that they continue to transfer the cost to the people who are driving their cars in those areas I mean where is it okay to delay well leave aside the anchor projects pretend that none of them are there well just focus on what are the priorities to get our city back on its feet the first priority is to make good decisions there is a geographer at canterbury university could dead rehab she in a public lecture at the university said very very clearly in her opinion the some of the decisions as to which area should be read zoned early on the piece were rushed yeah rushing does not lead to decisions or just what you have to wear to make a good decision I agree so we can take some items off our capital program while we actually analyze the situation we 're absolutely committed to doing that we 've already said that publicly but the issue that I 'm trying to work out is is that if there is a work program to do and there is no further commitment from central government how do we pay for it well we have spoken about borrowing and our submissions and it 's a point I keep making two people have spoken to is that when most of us in our 30s these days it used to be in their twenties buy our first home we are quite happy to borrow six or seven times annual income and there is a no the local government fund out there is an artificial a completely arbitrary and artificial cap on borrowing so you just say reset the cat well I alginate did when you briefed us at the camera when the camera report was released we put that question to your man and there because if you did auckland and also want to go there which is not a valid argument because open has a grossly preference set of roles a growth problem they 're special they 've got what could be seen as have beneficial products like watching maury offshore whereas whereas we have suffered a severe earthquake and it 's only reason them to lift that cap and allow future generations to pay for some of the benefits they 're going to or negotiation alternative dick profile through some other means well I my understanding is a coming up with a local government funding authority is fairly Furman and you 'd have to negotiate with them and central government to move there anyway or we could opt out of it anyway thank you very much that some we 've been looking forward to hearing from you and I hope that the meeting goes well tonight and thank you very much for holding dear to thank you very much goodnight thank you now same _"

    "text": "oh come it 's nice to be here so I 've just prepared some notes that I 'm just going to read too but it supports the submission that I put in so führer my name is David Bristow and thank you for the time to speak to my written submission which is obviously a very demanding and busy time for the council really do appreciate what you 're going from at the moment firstly I strongly use the council to put a plan in place so that it can renegotiate the cost share agreement of the crown the object of this review would be to re-establish a priority list of crown and council projects based upon meaningful and extensive consultation with the citizens of Christchurch something I believe the previous counsel failed to do and seeking no public consultation or import and binding us to a cost share agreement that is putting huge pressure on this council and the ratepayers of Christchurch the extent of existing cost share agreement in terms of the number of projects the scale and the timings of these projects which are already experiencing delays underlying objective to keep control and ownership of our strategic assets their generations of ratepayers have contributed to over many years neither council needs to implement a full review of its financial assumptions and not to keep its costs under control it is a priority work sorry as a priority work to landscape the entrance to the sticks meal reserve on sticks Milrow just recently completed when I 'm sure there is other priority work more urgent to be done the council needs to move with greater haste and vigor to resolve all outstanding insurance claims it needs to open the council bra around the problems with the claims as this outstanding issue has a huge bearing on the long-term plan I urge the council to seek the proposed global settlement which has been around for about a year now at mediation in September Padilla is taken for now four plus years to get to that stage and that the aggrieved payment could be on the council 's box this year and that would have a huge bearing on this plan oh you 're not going to sorry I mean quoted on student butts yes yeah but the article that he wrote is that actually an appropriate for our insurer to be talking publicly about any public especially knowledge them year yeah but it 's not correct it 's not accurate okay I 'm already the University of Canterbury 550 million and the port company 440 million claims have been settled graduate urgency is needed from all concerned in the space I am opposed to the full or partial sale of our significant in strategic assets why would you sell or sell down strategic assets that would generate 230 million in dividends over 10 years with the growth rates expenses in Christchurch over the next 10 years the in dividends are likely to increase finally rate increases proposed eres tan unsustainable and I would expect the majority of ratepayers and residents and Christchurch would have great difficulty with FEMA is proposed when wage increases range from one and a half to three percent of any we are looking at a rate rise over the next four years of thirty-three percent my children the future ratepayers of Christchurch are facing daunting the reserve bank financial stability report out this month quoted a sharp rise in mortgage rates could stress highly and debt borers I would also add that a sharp rise and property rates could also stress highly and bit iris I support the common-sense plan thank you see you great and room for final question okay thank you very much all right so we have an adjournment now until six o 'clock and so if everyone could be back here we 'll start on the dot or six o 'clock and fate of people could be back here at five to six we 'll see if we can get under what _"

    "text": "stainless and Adam hey you are not Adam as well well we met you yesterday is the other day no no oh you meet me that 's not I did meet you last night that 's what I everything 's blued and Wallace is great lately I 'm hearing it was a wonderful night last night it had nothing to do with hearings fair embarrassing that 's alright that 's alright no no no of course I remember last night I have been ya know I 've been conducting private hearings in my own time mayor and councillors I 'm Jane Lee 's and I 'm a trustee of the Christchurch arts audience development trust if you want to refer to it and something short you can call it cared that just makes it a little bit easier the Christchurch arts audience development trust operates the cared project which is directed by representatives of nine key Christchurch arts and culture organizations those are the art gallery CSO Christ Church in Canterbury tourism skate public art for whom I 'm also a trustee dancing performance who operate the body dance festival word christchurch so it 's a broadly representative group of key arts organizations and they meet we meet monthly with the intention of growing audiences for the arts collaboratively so working together so we can be more efficient for the Arts in the city so the representatives of those organizations made at make up the Caird steering group so you 've got the trust which operate which operates our activities you 've got the steering group who make the decisions on how we act and you 've got the individuals from the representative organisations we 're an independent group and since the earthquakes we have independently undertaken research into audiences for the Arts in Christchurch we 've created an audience development strategy we 've built a large database of individuals who have an interest in the arts and culture in Christchurch we 've employed an internationally experienced marketer to deliver our communication strategy our activities have been supported by creating new zealand by the city council arts advisors by the joint agency group by the ministry of culture and heritage so what we 're doing is there is a group and giving our ideas and our wisdom and our ideas have been accepted by a number of the different central and local government bodies our progress in organization lead audience development is being tracked internationally our model is are really interesting one rather than government telling us what they think thats organizations should be doing that arts organizations are talking together about what we think we should be doing and organizations from we know Newcastle and the UK are watching us we know the organizations and the US are watching us because it 's a different way of working we 've created a vision and our vision is to make the arts and culture part of everyday life for the people of Christchurch in cantabria you will see the names of the different organizations we are working together in a manner that we want to develop arts audiences for the whole apps arts and culture and Christchurch so although there are large number there are a number of larger organizations there we recognize that we can only grow our own audiences by growing it for everybody we if we work of the two years foundation work that we 've done with the larger arts and culture community and invite them to take part on a pen art strategy so our submission today is that the reduction in budgeted costs for events and festivals will challenge the council 's ability to successfully deliver a thriving arts and culture environment and Christchurch the steering group however also comprises realistic people we recognize the Christchurch City Council 's financial position but we also understand the importance of Arts and Culture to Christchurch City and I 'd like to run through and emphasize the effects that these cuts will have F implemented on the city firstly we 'll see a reduction and arts and culture organisations staffing budgets which will result in job losses and a reduced ability to keep and attract good employees we will necessarily limit our deliverables which will result in less arts and culture activity in the city that we pressure on young and emerging arts and cultural practitioners which will reduce our ability to foster young talent it will indicate a backward stick for the city 's new creative sectors activities and has the potential to financially benefit the city through domestic and international tourism it 'll make Christchurch a less attractive place in which to live which will impact negatively on the ability to attract international students workers businesspeople emigrants and investors it will limit the ability of Christchurch artists to reflect the cultures and histories additional pressure will be placed on organizations to raise funds through philanthropy and sponsorship and an unknown future environment it will reduce the ability for individuals to engage with others in their communities attached arts and culture events there is a risk that it arts and hope that arts and culture organisations will be insufficiently resourced to maximize the benefit of the new city facilities which we are planning the ability for the city to attract top quality conferences and events will be reduced through limited pet resorts and supporting things to do it will lower the visibility of Christchurch on the national and international stage in conclusion the Christchurch arts audience development steering group representatives would like to reinforce the importance of maintaining funding to the events in festivals budget we and culture have on the quality of life of the residents and the overall economic impact the reduction in the vibrancy of the city would have we encourage the city to embrace new efficient and collaborative ways of working and to recognize that the arts and culture have played an integral role in keeping the city alive since the earthquakes and we can continue to do that if we 're appropriately funded into the future thank you Andrew new efficient and collaborative ways of working only great ideas yep when you think of that what sort of things do you see what sort of models could you see working I guess to give you a little bit of a background to me because I have to answer to see the question individually rather than on behalf of all of these organizations my husband and i onlys construction with some sponsors of the Arts I 'm I was instrumental in setting up this trust I 'm also on the skating public our trust and I 'm on the botanic gardens trust which is just being set up from my perspective what saving all of those organizations money it 's sharing resources it 's sharing and using the intelligence that actually exists out and around christchurch you know it would be lovely to to assume that we were just going to throw money at this but this is it 's not what 's going to happen you know we want to maintain the Sun but I think that we can no longer work in a siloed environment we can 't think about if you imagine a big pie graph and you imagine in the past possibly we all had our own market shares of audience and we protected them individually what we know from the research now is that if we look at that whole pie is something that we can share together and we can encourage others to we can share our audiences with others we just enrich the benefit for those audiences yeah right hi Jane just a quick one in terms of the trade-offs that we 've got in front of us pharmacy arts has been very important and other community projects and community services of it if we like 150 million for the Metro sports at 100 in terms of the stadium and that kind of something where do you see the balance there by what you see is more important for the congruence it 's a hard question to us someone who 's a construction company exactly but one foot in each camp oh yeah well that 's right um I I 'm not an accountant so I 'm not a person who 's good at balancing budgets I am an emotional person and I have chosen to live in Christchurch with my family I don 't want to live in a city where there are not that it 's not arts and culture and there 's not a heart we clearly have to skin the cat in a different way but I think our focus needs to remain strong in those things I 'm term and then yani I 'm just following the earthquake a lot of groups started up there are a lot of new groups with regards to getting funding to the apps in performance and other things which has been vital for the 's what is recovery from the earthquake what is business as usual I what escape is doing prior to and we get back to normal with the nine million dollars down to search how much of debtors say government money or different money rather than the business as usual that was being supplied I 'm not sure that I quite understand the question sorry pull a number of groups have been getting funding from government weathers they would not have got prior to the earthquake so there it 's some stage there has to be is just that since we 've got a look at skinning the kit there 's only going to be so much money and so do you have an idea of the amount that will no longer be coming to Christchurch we 're not as business as usual because you I think what you 've got here is absolutely common sense and it makes so so much sense because at some stage there is going to be a change of attitude and we have to help it I don 't know what the the money that kind of over the earthquakes in recovery what I want to be looking at is as creating a future that we I don 't think that we have it there 's not a target of we are now recovered I don 't think you know we 're working through a recovery phase and suddenly we have recovered and then we move on to a next phase I think that we 're now here yeah yes let 's let 's say this is that let 's make the most of this now and let 's say this is this is how it 's going to be and we 'll just you your always improving you know i 'm not sure that there 's a point at which their changes i wish i knew what the what your question was about the government funding i don 't know myself I 'm sorry you think you 've just described our new normal rather than be a you say Yanni thank you I 'm first off can I just thank you for for you and your husband and your company for that commitment that good to say unfortunately i don 't see that across the other companies making a lot of money from the rebuild which has been one of the issues for us in terms of like declining and sponsorship of events and festivals for example but Manny Manny jaani jaani jaani just can I just ask you to exercise a little bit of distribution so sorry I mean obviously one of the key considerations as part of this long-term plan is whether we should privatize or first our our venues bite the home kastle arena into not lot no Donna being a strategic asset so a religious one to understand from you how is there how important is it that we retain strategic ownership of those venues this is allowing the private sector maybe to come in and take over there running in terms of the impact on that yeah I 'm not an expert and you know assets I think that there are people around our group who could who could answer that question well I 'm I 'm a marketer that 's what my experiences though yeah if you 'd talk to people or find you the right people to talk to and just the only other just in terms of your membership I noticed by the way tahoe cultural counts on the art center aren 't members do how does your mucho yeah well what we did was I probably naively thought oh this is a good idea we should all be working together and I didn 't understand any of the histories or any of the organizations particularly well so I got on the telephone and we had an initial meeting I 'd say we probably contacted 40 or 50 organizations and probably 20 of them came to the initial meeting what we had to recognize is that while we want to be representative of the city and the arts not all of those organizations have the resource to be able to turn up once a week in those nine organizations between them by the end of this year we 'll have put 37 and a half thousand dollars into research and writing strategy pretty big hearted of a lot of those organizations some of them even put to put put in more money because we really believe in this so there there 's a group of people who have been prepared to give their time and their energy we recognize there are some holes and that steering group but there are also we 've spoken to a number of people and they 've said can 't_``_918.3 do it now believe in what you 're doing and we 'll sit back and wait till you 're really successful and then we 'll jump on the bandwagon and it 's understandable it 's understandable but thank you Jane it 's great that you 've made the submission and i think that the approach that you 've adopted in terms of getting people together to to focus on this aspect of it is really welcomed for the city and i love the attitude that you know we are where we are and let 's just get on with it right thank you very much so the last one for this session is David Bristow _"

    "text": "cash i 'm not sure if i 'm pronouncing that correctly can I say we get a little break shortly or yes we 've got two more hour three more okay hello yeah an inferred from typical scare you pronounced it almost perfectly oh very well sorry unusual yeah today I just want to speak mainly about the asset sales um and there 'll be a bit of a spoilsport here but I really do be him mentally opposed the sale of Christchurch assets and I think this council has been partly elected on the promise that assets wouldn 't be sold and I found it disappointing that this was still put on the agenda I can see the pressure you are under but I think and I 'm sure you did actually explore a lot of possibilities in terms of keeping the assets but I think and there are ways of maybe getting around selling assets generally I think it 's better to keep key services like water energy public transport while I acknowledge that the assets which are up for sale are not necessarily essential services but some _''_103.68 be run profitably and provide environmental sustainable and social PR social outcomes at the same time so it should be really kept in public hand and other assets like little import and Christchurch International Airport important continuous revenue sources and it would be ludicrous to give them away for short-term gain and I think the government has got a lot to answer for by the City Council is under such pressure we shouldn 't forget though that christ church is still feeling the effects and the aftermath of major catastrophes and in though I understand that we need to get back to sense of normality I think normality can 't_''_166.14 be bought with flash projects like those anchor projects I think it 's much more important that we do really the essential things like getting the horizontal in infrastructure repair as soon as possible so I think here they are other ways of saving monies and here are some suggestions and I thought about first out of a abandon the stadium and the convention center since the government has not honored it its original contribution towards the horizontal infrastructure I honor the anchor projects and it 's an assumption I 'm afraid yeah yeah I 'm sorry but carry on yeah um well this is what I picked out from the media that the government didn 't honor the original contribution to the horizontal it 's on to the infrastructure as a room I know the media has said that but it isn 't necessarily they 're not necessarily reporting the outcome of any consideration of the final figures that reporting what other people are saying so okay we haven 't got to the end point of it so the media have to answer I don 't know it 's not their fault it 's their reporting what people are saying and you 're picking up what other people are saying we haven 't got to a final point on that you okay that 's good to hear yeah well am I think the government should actually contribute because it is a massive civil disaster we have experienced here going back to the to the stadium anchor project dalian is already struggling with its stadium and they 're working hard hole like this in Christchurch and add to the Newton 's misery on top of it by competing with dunedin i don 't quite understand it and yeah as to the convention center i really do see the need for conference capability but i think maybe there 's other ways of working towards having capability for example and by working with the universities and they have got fantastic facilities which are often not even used and edward help the universities were financially struggling and would avoid the need for a convention center also i would suggest maybe i 'm wrong there again but the insurance ensures haven 't paid out yet and i think that would be one way of getting revenue pressing the insurer is to pay up including the interest that has been as a crude since the earthquakes yeah Victoria Square it 's very controversial I hear and I absolutely think it 's not necessary and not wanted and the money could be saved there the memorial war don 't get me wrong I really I think art is important but the memorial wall is expensive pompous the haven and the wall will only contribute to flood risk and as other hard surfaces along the waterways also a war as a symbol of the for the deaths that occurred through the earthquakes I don 't think it 's really appropriate because grant also was involved crushing people during the earthquakes and why not have a living memorial like on the the line of auto cochino plant a cockatiel tree for every person that died during the earthquake and also there are plans to erect other structures along the rivers of Christchurch and I think again hard surfaces are not suitable for flood-prone city and why I have those structures which cost a lot of money if nature is the best playground it 's the best place for people to relax and enjoy I used to live near rivers in Europe and the tracks along the rivers were hard as surfaced with crushed metal which is still porous as opposed to concrete or tarsier also and understand the building of the Margaret my playground is already underway but i think that was also lost opportunities i don 't you you are going through the different anchor projects that are part of the agreement with the crown but but we 've set aside five minutes for the submission so there 's just no time now for questions so if you just like to kind of wrap up with one sentence a message that you want to leave with the sure my messages to think of the essentials and lot of flash projects which don 't actually really address the burning issues that 's great the government thank you very very much the christchurch arts audience development project _"

    "text": "should this Steve events I don 't know if you 're Steve Evans see women 's I do know a woman called Steve it 's a mirror of Rotorua is called Steve he is my home and on right oh you know here probably make us um some unclear bullying you 're clear Leah Wally yes right thank you so good afternoon Mary counselors first off thank you for the opportunity to be heard and support of Fletcher livings submission to the long-term plan first and quick background I 'm clear Wally not Steve Evans here 's Elle coo I 'm a development manager at Fletcher living which is the operating name for flexure residential Limited which in turn is a fully owned subsidiary of fletcher building limited a company that has been building houses in New Zealand for over 100 years as you may know Fletcher living is currently undertaking a number of residential developments in Christchurch including at our Terran cars road which is 238 units built over three stages at 350 combo Street and segments which will be 76 units with some commercial premises fronting on to city which will be 114 units again with some commercial premises fronting on to Wells Street so our submission here today arises from our wells and colombo street developments which are both medium density housing developments and it 's also quite relevant to other such developments that will be an increasing part of the housing mix for Christ 's Church in the foreseeable future whether those are apartment buildings groups of townhouses evil or even retirement homes so our submission today is to invite the council to consider adopting an opt-out policy for multi-unit developments and respect of waste services the effect of which were to be allow such developments to arrange for their own approved alternative rubbish and collection services rather than use the services provided by council and I 'll get to the reason why the policy would also confer rates relief by omitting that part of the targeted rate that relates to the council 's rubbish and recycling services so the reasons for the submission is one of practicality and also to better reflect the operational reality that arises with medium density housing so to provide a I mentioned earlier which is a mixture of townhouses and what we call in the news and apartment buildings we 're currently working through the target sustainability program which has been extremely useful for the development on a waste management a waste management strategy in advance of our application for land use consent which we 're flying back soon the council has indicated that will service the muse and clicked from a private laneway which is what Atlas laners which is where have you know the area that 's right adjacent we will however have to apply for this as an extended service but it will be granted at no charge of more than five properties are present which is actually the case with wall street so that 's fine however due to the volume generated by the apartment buildings council has said that larger skits could be collected under its current curbside policy only if clear and safe access is available however this would require a great deal of accommodation in the design and we have arrived at the conclusion that the working heights of the trucks as high development effectively in addition to this this is what there is also the issue have been able to accommodate sufficient storage area for the skips given the volumes involved and the frequency of the council collection this means that the waste management solutions for the Wells development will likely be through a private provider however we are mindful of how important the level of body corporate fees are and services and the level of services that you actually get for that when we bring these units to okay and indeed for those units resale down the track so put simply owners do not wish to pay full rates including targeted waste fears and then have a private collector fear on top of that if they can 't get the curbside system working which is a situation that we have at and will facing with the wells development so it also like to offer in support of our submission that Auckland and Wellington cities that have also seen an increasing amount of medium density housing both have mechanisms that effectively lower allow for an opt-out policy and are a mission of waste system in place i should add however that in auckland in particular which is the one amon know more about such developments have opted out that have opted out and have been given rates relief still have access to but are also expected to contribute fairly towards the cost of Auckland Council 's other ways to minimization initiatives so the essence of our submission today is simply that we 're asking Council you invite them to consider in addition to its policies to better reflect the reality the operation reality of higher density multi-unit housing developments in Christchurch and also to in order to future-proof councils policies to ensure a fair outcome for Christchurch residents who are increasingly choosing to live in such developments and Paul thanks for your submission I was aware that one thing aware that there is no targeted right on inner-city properties for waste so the general waste so thanks for that clarification oh yes the saying so you could natural fact get your own waste disposal done by the body cool and there are no fees it 's Easter you threw out within your majors central city is actually different certain parts of the central city either you don 't have their target right put on your on your right well I think we would need to check whether it 's at well street I think that difficulty is getting the track in to the mouth no I understand that but i think the targeted grateful waste is actually on suburban it 's a little bigger than strip that cos my under school we have seen Marshall in tirana better submission from a group of residents of a of a facility where they can 't have the buns and they showed that they brought the actual case of eggs that were that they had to use and so staff are actually looking at finding a response for the council to consider as part of this process so you 're really reinforcing a solution that could be a way forward I think that 's why we 're here determine and fill and just really simply basically you 're wanting to do your own system of rubbish in these complexes and he writes reduction because its of who 's picking it up it still goes to Kate belly so the resistor lacoste to the council so it 's just a rate reduction to cover and reflect that the savings and pick up you should be here that 's perfect right exactly exactly where the curbside collection can 't work for various reasons as of design and skips and larger trucks and volumes and there 's a whole we tried very hard to try and make it work but it 's just not going to work so very typical for multi-unit developments that are various reasons it 's tricky so yes exactly thank you I 'm Phil so thank you can just clarify for me and I 'm not on the irrelevant committee so excuse my ignorance of its set but it 's just it can do I understand now that enters the old signum school site the ground floor is not commercial it 's all residential it 's great you answering my questions it 's fantastic it 's going to be it 's going to be a mixture it 's always going to be some commercial so it 'll be a mixture of townhouses and again a smaller apartment building and so it 's a mixture but yes you 're right so it 's residential with the little tiny bubble commercial just on a Columbia Street in accordance with okay and I think if the concept plans could be run past the local community border think that would all be helpful too because there 's a number of groups who know are very interested in and what you 're doing but it 's a matter of people understanding there 's just a suggestion from me well I 'm the business I 've been doing some consultation so we just tied down Colombo just FYI so we 're lodging our land use consent for well shortly that we just hind the down the final design and plans and we have kind of shared those with the neighborhood but not extensively until we get the final design so with Colombo we 're a little bit further behind but we 're hoping we 've been engaging with the neighborhood and I 've been in contact with them so in be within a month so we 're just there now and would be happy to Paul in just to catch me up again are you suggesting you 're going to be using skips you say you 're gonna be using skips yes well there 's a combination of things but I guess the key point is we can 't get the curbside collection working in terms of what story and in terms of accidents so how did what sort of rubbish go something doesn 't go into bags forcing them into the skip so we 're working with counselors you know you have a targeted let me just get the name right target sustainability program so we have consultants you know waste better than I do coming up with the solution so considering some recycling in there oh it 's solutely yeah it said yeah it 's gotten it 's got nothing to do with the in terms of minimizing waste we 're doing what we can to ensure that we are you know providing the typical and expected service or waste in the variety waste collection so okay it every week how often do you think well we 're thinking it may be needing more frequent yep so that 's the issue with the biggest gaps less frequency those kind of things so I 'm not at the forefront of that work that 's why we have experts working out what would spear sites i can get in more detail once we tie down the solution and I 'd be happy to and so do you do you actually need to have counsel permission to adopt a particular system it 's a good question not that I understand 10-6 you very Christian he put anybody not sure about that however if you like an up the Auckland situation if you want to get the rates relief you have to be that system that you put in place with a private collector has to be approved if perhaps we could take this offline because it absolutely I 'm yep apologize for the time no no that 's fine that 's fine but thank you very much welcome pick some time okay mannford from _"

    "text": "can I just ask a question at the outfit because we 're not read this I thought that we 'd already heard the submission because we had a submission last week yes i know from yes but but this is about rebuilding it with the RSA bowling club rooms as in hagley park is this a joined-up submission with them not really you 'll be selfish splendid trees we go through it Hank you 've got the I just was a bit confused because it looked like it was the same side did you get the sheet with schnapps on a bun Chee oh it 's just coming now I did put it in yesterday so I don 't know why didn 't he on you sorry right good afternoon mayor and councillors thanks for your time i 'm john nimmo i 'm a member of the primitive bridge club and the negotiator and these proceedings and my companion here is the President Donald Mackenzie our mission is not coming to seek funding but somebody to seek permission on behalf of our club to spend its money along with the site of the RSA bowls clubs room in hagley park which no longer habitable or safe to use at bridge club permanent bridge club was founded in the old red building down on the corner of cramnar square and omar street 1961 the original part was the first brick building and christchurch it fell over in the earthquake and two-thirds the complex disappeared so it was just the front piece that looks like is built in eighteen fifty six black sea built in about nineteen hundred and two now to bring you up to the current term situation negotiations with office of Christchurch City Council over the proposal date back to early 2012 when it appeared we would be loading a new complex by Christmas which Christmas was not clearly established and here we are three years later back at the beginning again right now our club is very keen to re-establish its new club rooms and central Christ suits the christchurch baton Club has the site in heavy Park this fear is not ours and no usable club room facilities or the substantial funds needed to build a new is well cashed up but is no suitable site it can afford to build on in the city and reestablish itself so i think this proposal are sort of kind of a perfect match for both organizations now between the two organizations will be about 200 people who will be making regular to the site which I think justify some consideration and the pros new building would be just 250 meters away from Merrill Tabram so we really could re-establish in the same year of the city which would like to do now attendance intent is quite simple both groups happy to erect a building that does not exceed the footprint of the current RSA building we think the proposed design is suitable for the locale and aesthetically acceptable of regulations allow the clubrooms could also be subleased to other kindred group for their use so our requesters the council reconfirms the petanque tables concurrent tenure of the site grants permission for the erection of a new building and has the old building demolished we have enough funds in hand to build new club rooms and carry out any of that you recommend it to the baton Club that they contacted the hands off Hagley or the gardens of the pack they having an informal meeting as we speak at the moment so it appeared there 's a fairly corte belong tante between the two groups so that 's some hopeful sign there 's me done so what is the difference between this and the other submission does the same really because we are kindred grips we 've got no actual right at all video any other place it 's just that but we both want to build there indeed we do but you are you talking about building one facility or building two indeed we are one yes and they agree with that too right because we 're paying it for it so yeah so okay what we should have done is we actually should have got the two of you to come on together I don 't organize your counsel me no I fell um I 'm just thinking in terms of process and you know look resolving what sounds to be a good idea if in fact committee is its some good ongoing implications just seem i 'm not sure that submissions like this it rhe in the right place no i 'm not i 'm not one hundred percent sure their inner but it i mean i understand why the ltp process has been used what we 've just got discovered is that there is a sort of a groundswell of individuals who have issues that would actually benefit from having a process where they could just raise them with the council on a relatively frequent basis so we have done that over the year frequently not much I 've been here for 18 months I 'm not taking on your people okay okay um Yanni and then term I 'm not thinking for the submission and you know it sounds very logical that the one question I have though is in terms of it hours of operation in the car parking what the hours of operation for the the bridge clubs usually meets and an evening although it 's in such a lovely locale have we had it we would also have daytime bridge it a daytime usage they do have would have tournaments where it would might roll into the evening but there wouldn 't be on a regular basis so the evening you should probably be one maximum two nights a week and what sort of numbers of people in terms of cars well the club 's have the 200 members between them the bridge club has about members and we would normally have about 50 plus people playing on any one night so just I mean in terms of timing I think looking at that district plan as well it 's probably quite important if this is something that we 're going to consider I 've always wanted to learn bridge now at the time oh no no no I put a wait till I retire I haven 't going to time I can play euchre and 500 but anyway um sorry ok that 's all fine Eugenie his yes the City Council has actually not the council but the council officers have already drawn up a proposed plan from the driveway through to the lake and there is an actual parking open up the gates or whatever oh the rookies just got another plan in mind from our point of view we 've got some reservations we 've got lots of elderly people like your mother and you know some of their concerns about the current dark environment round there but i guess that I 'd said to them we 've got to look at the big picture to start and I 'm quite sure we certainly have funds etc to to look at the environmental factors we might need what we really need at the moment or soon is that they go hits this feasibility so we can actually start to do something like when we priced it up in 2012 we thought the 400,000 would leave icing on the cake now could be a different matter and the other problem of courses we haven 't had any ground testing done and that might in itself propose a major obstacle so we 've got to start somewhere and hopefully out of this will be somewhere soon again building l this building that you 're doing with you know oh yeah know I think it 's better no squeeze huh turn it squeeze I that turtle squeeze that 's the footprint of your building we 're not wanting to impose yeah we got more than 80 how much have you got did you like alone please a discussion a turn thank you very much I think it 's a great bit of comedy and hopefully it can work i do think that it should that the committee system is probably the better way to go i don 't think we should be looking at the negatives you you 've got some fun engine with us and have the potential to create something really good for two clubs and possibly other users so thank you very much for thanks to the environmental pack as well if scientistic options to think they 're yours okay thank you very much next one picture residential _"

    "text": "opportunity to be heard I 'm Warren brewer and beside me is Paul Pierce I believe you might have met them a bit interview and the day we don 't propose to go through our entire submission route for group just highlight a couple of the key issues as we see them firstly we think that this consultation process fails and it 's up within its own terms we don 't we don 't see it as being open fair and inclusive in fact we 've gone so far as to suggest that it 's something of a shame we 've got some incidents instance that that we can table to support this contention but the process is neither unencumbered nor independent as the guts are else 's summation the the covert as we would see it interference is from that government who has cited the only piece of evidence we have as a little fun from yourself met a mere two ma 'am Minister Adams regarding unilateral changes the agreed statement of expectations and being a concern to that to the council as as in fact it should be you to an extent that is beyond the scope of a fear and open process we also regard and some of the regulatory burdens as as a problem Sarah and various other organizations that are not democratically accountable to anybody and we also think that some individuals involved in this hearing itself are not overly how do I say this play we are not genuinely engaging in a open and fair process I 'll give an example of that in the long term planned community pre-engagement the direct quote from that report the issues around asset management and ownership visited the strongest responses across all online print and face-to-face comments many people revere mately opposed selling any assets and seeing it as short-sighted that was done before you December meeting when you dissolve that asset sales were probably the way to go excuse me the second point of contention that we wish to raise is we don 't see in the propositions you you are considering a nd long-term draft long-term plan as being anything other than ideological dogma it 's based on a highly contested report the Cameron report to the opposite it 's objectivity tortured by dogma and our view and as supporting the failed policies of last century 19 we 've gone through several governments during the last century that sold assets and the interests of saving money reducing taxes and various other things 19 billion dollars worth of our assets were sold and we still have a debt that would be the same situation that we face here in our view that 's essentially now well no there is in fact international evidence showing that privatized services do not deliver what has claimed of them and a good example of of the sure where to go news frankly the issue the issue behind the camera report in the embedding of that into this long-term plan is of great importance and we believe that it 's not being considered properly in this forum as we have seed we regard that the information and they were thought to be insubstantial not to be not enough to base some of the decisions that we are faced with was making in the city it is dogma they are proven to and there was increasing body of literature suggesting that public ownership and democratic control of public utilities is the best way forward now we went to some trouble to fire the public contentions been made by the press now that that some of the best financial brains in the country have poured over the council 's finances will wrote to the press to find out who these people were and what the conclusions were and we have not had a reply unfortunately we also note that deloitte 's have given you some advice on the worth council ownership and we also note the comments of Orion Chairman and Craig brought boys who noted that the retention of community assets and particularly monopoly assets should be vested under in the community and none other than Adam Smith would support that monopolies are often more often than not Smith contends a conspiracy against the public poor do you want anything without being pejorative and an understanding that the council to some Eckstein probably justifiably sees itself between a rock and a hard place in other words between the preferences which I think 's our property it 's essential property we should keep on the one hand and the pressure sometimes I live the ideological and sometimes practical from the government on the other which said government is ideologically driven itself now we would ask that this council build up its loins so to speak straighten its backbone and contest with the government for example I have heard it said that one of the arguments that the council is confronted with is we have this arrangement with the government which was signed by previous council but we are committed to it thereby well I also understand that from yourself madam mayor you have written to the government say and I quote in this regard the recent unilateral changes to the agreed statement of expectations are a cause of major concern to us that 's how they damn well should be my point is not the only thing I 've written on either that 's always dangerous to queen of things to writing no no I deliberately put to right okay well I 'm glad that you did the point being that any contractual one party that contractual arrangement is void and therefore you have the right and I suggest the obligation to say to the government we need to reopen negotiations on all these matters thank you very much and see what the responses I 'm quite sure that if as I say you brace yourselves you would get massive public support I 'm weekend we 're running a little bit short of time we were going to suggest to you that if there are no questions to take up the rest of our time we were depreciated if the balance of our time allocation could be assigned to the commute keep our assets coalition which you 'll take hear from later no I have a question so say so I mean look we have of course we have written to the government and say sorry I 'm you speak out of course we 've written to the government said that we want to address a number of issues not just the cost year but actually a number of issues that like our land drainage recovery program which we can 't cost with infrastructure straight strategy so we 've written to them about that and there is a process going on where officials are talking and we will be talking with the government eventually on these issues but say everything was off the table so say that we didn 't have to proceed with our share of the anchor projects the government took all theirs off the table say we got to a point where we couldn 't fund the damage that was done to our land drainage recovery program what do we do how do we cope with that aren 't we allowed to actually look at our asset base in order to release some capital to get our other assets our underground assets and our roads well we 've had people from New Brighton telling us that their foot paths have been unable to be traversed but from nearly five years they can 't even get out of their houses on with pushing prams or on their motor scooters so how do we deal with that well with any council of course it 's always a matter of priorities to wear are concerned the way to realize their value is not by selling them off that by using them as collateral to raise money it 's right and they 've got we 've got the deep built into the whole structure because of how much money was put onto Mabel deters we could into the assets but because there is an obligation of at least 350 million dollars post-earthquake from the previous counsel to purchase or to actually make enable networks despite the fact that the government was going to do it anyway it 's not possible to put sufficient debt and to the companies and not breach your debt ceiling so we have looked at seven different models for Team sincerely is a problem my understanding is that if you look at comparable councils in terms of their population and their indebtedness we 're almost home clear compared to Dunedin and Wellington and other councils no no but we 've hit the debt ceiling the lgf a limit and 2020 this another official construct I mean that 's the problem it 's a legal construct and it is our relationship mean this is the debate that we 're having as as as what do we do when we get to the end of the line in terms of our capacity to borrow stuff and our religion we have to stop behaving as though we live in ordinary times we have an exceptional times in this town I think I think we do know that terms I 'm one I ask this question of poor and I apologize if you were here when I did what is your thoughts with regards to rather than selling dows and leasing you asking him now yeah you know as usual so for years or so Warren this is to you so it 's just I 'm apologizing for you as here when I asked I mean I 'm not opposed to always sales full stop i 'm not opposed to leasing for stop it 's a matter of that of the issue that you 're discussing though i don 't know what you want to lease but by and large leasing will not change your position from actually ownership of it we 're in the issue of what they 've got what that would advance for the council and the people of Christchurch because because the mirror is quite correct it 's pushing our bloody prams on the streets that matters not covered stadiums and various other luxury things that that people are just pissed with at the moment frankly you know we 've got to put people at the center of this rebuild and an ordinary punters the same we don 't feel like that 's happening we feel like somebody else is interfering in this pot and that the issues that that are beyond the life of ordinary working people what has the interest of the government and council appreciate you stuck with some of the stuff because of agreements and the line put people at the center of the rebuild that 's our message thank you good and it 's an extremely positive note to end on thank you very much jeez thank you now the Kremen of bridge club _"

    "text": "move on to the next submitter but must mcfadden isn 't here so we 'll move on to Karina Duke from the blind foundation thank you thank you so you 've read our submission and the blind foundationer really came to see the council take up the opportunity to create in a city that 's fully accessible inclusive for everyone so we would like to support the council in any way we can to provide that I think throughout the plan there 's discussions about affordability and trade-offs I think it 's a bigger economic trade off not to build an accessibility cost a lot more money to retrofit but it 's also socially a cost to us if we don 't ensure that the city is able to be accessed by everyone to get services and facilities we would like to say we 're not against cyclist but cyclists on footpaths or something that are a challenge for our clients so those who are vulnerable pedestrians find it more difficult to deal with situations where you have cyclists travelling at mix speeds particularly efforts through the CBD and it already been identified to have recycled cyclists going on to the footpath as part of that commuter route it creates conflict points of conflict whether they be coming from in front or behind it doesn 't matter how many bowels you 're in a lot of people will not hear about I 'll be confused and we 're not just talking about people who are blind or have low vision people with cognitive impairments people have had strokes people with learning impairments they are all going to have the same issues as our clients do and that 's the feedback that we do get so we would like to see some rethinking around the cycling networks the development of those we fully support them but just not being in a shared space and making pedestrians the vulnerable person in that environment one of the other things we 're looking at you mentioned the council only entity we 'd be really keen to support if there was any awareness or training and also that there 'd be a requirement that there be audits conducted on any of the works going forward pulling that into the process there 's been quite a few that and other times I 've SAT here and talked about some of the projects and some of the issues that have ended up we 've had a lot of consultation but a lot of the designs that are out there are car scene truck then designed for pedestrians are not designed for cyclists but if they are designed for cyclists again it 's at the expense of a pedestrian so the morehouse intersection would be the classic one at the moment it 's actually I don 't know if it has passed any safety audits but it 's unsafe for our clients it 's not designed well three major questions sorry I 'm not familiar with the morehouse intersection with what are the new design of morehouse intersection lincoln road so you 've got a change we 've got the cycle path coming out of the park for pedestrians it 's very confusing where you want them to go to be able to work it out but also some of the traffic islands are unsafe to enter and of heavy traffic on more house there so there 's yeah so there 's lots of things like that so we 're really keen to support to get things right first time because it costs a lot of money to go back and fix mistakes or errors or safety issues so we 're really keen to see that that gets built into any long-term planning within the city and we are keen with other agencies we work quite closely with other groups particularly CCS disability action d fatty arrived this year the same building as us we 're really keen to see a city that 's logical its accessible and also it benefits Turris so people who don 't know said he who are coming in for the first time and accessible tourism as a growing market you know we have a population that 's aging but we also have a population with the last disability or census that indicated one and four so it 's time we start planning and make the city and closer for everyone did you did you submit on the accessible city AZ component a just wondering around that that particular intersection is that more unsafe for pedestrians than it was before because I wouldn 't have wanted to cross that road before in certain parts it is but it 's also a longer journey for pedestrians to actually get across that road you 've got longer time standing within the road itself but also the alignments aren 't designed to make it easy for pedestrians so there 's a whole range of things that have gone wrong Hospital corners another example it 's not just one is don 't love this really only one year so at the moment they 're not designed for those who are blind or have low vision but there are actually designed for anyone who can bunk either Sonia in EM mind eonni it 's really um thank you for your submission and I mean as a shame that this is like the third or the fourth time you 've come and talk to us and we 've still got the same issues that are being resolved so I 'm really keen to find a way forward do you a levels of service that would mean that we could have a resource to do these audits as part of these projects rather than having to rely on external people coming in after the affair what can we do to ensure you know that we can try and Graham Connor Paul 's another one that comes to mind so not wanting to repeat those mistakes thinking about what is it that we could this do to try and cement culture change the best process would be to look at putting any planning when it 's not even on paper had a consultation bring groups and so this is what I do a lot in Auckland in particular is bringing the groups that are relevant get them talking around the table talk about the issues decide what 's important and then put the drawings down then audit the drawings get everybody to audit those drawings and go through the whole process it 's impossible to employ one person who 's got a full understanding across all the sectors that you 've got aged you 've got children you 've got plan there 's a whole range that if you involve everyone in the planning stages and then go through to the technical auditing which is what I get involved in a lot and I know CCS does also very a free trust but it comes to different environments you look at who 's the expert on the rolling environment who 's the expert in the building environment get the right people via and get the tick off at each phase of the proceeds that 's the best way to do it I don 't think you guys actually employ someone in the disability here at the moment I think that position still vacant that 's an important conduit to getting things right and having the right people getting around the table the other I just think I 'm bit but on that particular one we didn 't we weren 't leading that project we did the consultation but we weren 't involved in the original decision that was made under the accessible City chapter of the did the consultation I think the design was done through the I mean the one direction of the bus that was all designed under the central city recovery plan yeah but the issues that have been raised by the curb cut downs not being connected in terms of where they direct people all that design detail design was the responsibility of counsel that we were where these consumer and I mean you know it 's no comfort to say I told you so but you wear this is like the third submission period about the inaccessible transport plan for a central city and until we start making different decisions I can 't see this changing but these concerns were raised and there 's a I mean we 're told that these things are incorporated into the design but then we 're seeing the finished product doesn 't reflect what our expectations are Vicki at that submission that process that you talked about about people sitting around the table and going through and drawing the plan and then sort of feeding back on it does that not happen here not so much in Christchurch it there are a lot of plans that do come in through happening a lot with all of the accessible city plans it happens with some so I 've been involved with different ones but in general not as much as it should but particularly now when there 's major areas of change you know that consultation has happened we 've submitted on it would put suggestions and recommendations for changes none of that has actually gone through to the design phase whereas projects and crash it 's like the over ribbon precinct which I was involved with a couple of other external agencies I with the same team I worked with in Auckland for the shared spaces we sat down right from the concept stage and worked our way through and it saved a lot of their time going back and redoing drawings which cost a lot of money but that 's a potential that could happen with the council yeah so that 's what you would like to it so I 'd like to happen yes very good all right thank you very much the I don 't know it is that it must have mcfadden have heavy gazette mr. bra hey where Oh made me counselor some thank you for _"

    "text": "welcome back to Peter toughly with another heckler even got a hat on Peter but this time representing the beacon of neighborhood association yes madam mayor thank you we are a neighborhood association and some might say that I have to be ought to stick to our knitting and mind only our neighborhoods business but we 've never been a parochial we 'd have been parochial in our in our view of city affairs so while we are addressing some local issues we 're also taking account of the fact that what affects the city as a whole affect our residents as citizens no at no neighborhood is an island entire of itself as John Donne might have put it the first thing the foremost of our local concerns is is to do with the river Heathcott we live in in the beckenham loop of the health cut river which is part of what makes our whole neighborhood so attractive to live in and yet last year the flooding show that the picturesque character of the river has a threatening aspect as well in fact those floods caused a huge from a pre-flight level of 270 we got a hundred new members in a week and now we have over a thousand and there was considerable hardship within the loop and in view of that we would urge the council to expedite work on effective and realistic flood prevention and mitigation measures for our river as well as for the Avon we 're also also helped we also have a concern about local pollution not only from emergency overflows of sewage but also since the earthquakes since the earthquakes the kashmir stream which is a tributary of the health cut has have a lot of silt into it as a result of seismic activity and that finds its way into the health cut and adds to pollution so we 're very welcome end of the envisage reinstatement of the health got river and the kashmir stream on page 58 of the consultation document that 's been put out and we would also urge as a general issue that affects our river as well as others we would like to see reinstatement of the city 's sewage sewage infrastructure expedited as the way in which there 's a sense that our river has been a poor relation of the of the avon because the tourists don 't see it we had one enhancement project canned ten years ago the half cut river vision and this this time around the mid Heathcott linear park master plan which was all ready to go before the earthquakes was suddenly defunded and we would like to see restoration of funding for that that plan we realize that this isn 't a good time to be asking for money to be spent but one local saving among others that we would suggest would be deferring of repairs to the beckenham service center and library and Learning Center complex because it 's working at present it 's not noticeably broke so and we don 't think it needs to be fixed right now in fact we would very much prefer it weren 't_''_266.94 that could be deferred we think on a citywide front we have always had been opposed to the selling off of commercial of commercially and commercial assets that are owned by the community we for expressions of opposition to that and we see it as something that should be regarded only as a very last resort when all other alternatives have been exhausted and what concerns us about the LTP is that it doesn 't strike us that there has been such an exploration of alternatives and that the underlying thrust has been acceptance of asset sales and that the public has been led to believe mistakenly we think that the only alternative is between massive rate rises and asset sales we think there 's an alternative strategy and we 've made several suggestions about how spending could be we think beneficially pruned we had some agonizing over the the Town Hall which is quite a one of the things that the government did not impose on the City Council we would be quite happy or well we would be prepared to see that mothball free for a few years and then revisited sometime in the future me in the meantime saving the expenditure envisage on it we note the government 's recently announced deferral of a billions worth of capital projects and you in considering considering other deferrals so in conclusion we have considerable misgivings about the proposed asset sales and we would urge the council to leave no stone unturned in the quest for alternative thank you very much thank you have fell thank you very much Peter and also for your ongoing support for the victim community and Peter I just want to ask you about the mid hid kit linear plan and and you 've also referred to the concerns about flooding and I 'm just wondering if counsel can put money for that plan would you be happy whether the focus be on the waterway at the river as a waterway and in effect starting by fixing the river from that perspective yes yes indeed we realized that it would be silly to embark on beautifying the river before all the other thing that all the other aspects have been have been problems have been solved first so yes other things have to have to be done first but that plan we you know we what we 're wanting is a firm commitment to realizing that some linear park hitters thanks Peter my other question readers about deferring the library works like about how long would do you think how long what sort of time period are you referring to to delay the rebuild then of course that 's assuming that the building remains safe for people but what 's the time frame absolutely it does depend ultimately on you know geotechnical and structural issues and on the assumption that there is no perceived worsening of that we would say you know let it go until after 2017 so not outside the 10-year plan hung still within the 10-year plane yeah but I mean could we put it out till 20-26 if it 's if it holds up that long yeah but I mean obviously that 's a given but I mean that 's the question is can we put it off the 10-year plan Joseph as its servicing people now if it was the service people in the same way with 10 years be possible yeah subject to as i said to geotechnical and structural issues the remaining more or less the same why not great yep one know and these are our revised document one issue you didn 't mention they got into a you such as pencil the proposed the widening lincoln law because you can see the con center where splitter 8 in the community whether it is the no more no more happen oil or use the authorities is a issue well as you know it is outside beckenham but but we do have a sense of a a sense of solidarity with people in nearby neighborhood but also we saw that as as another opportunity for saving and we know what happened to sit in them when Brom Street was was was widened and we 're aware that there is unhappiness within addington about the prospect of the same thing happening there it 's great thank you very much Peter got to see you again so soon and will now _"

schedule I 'm sort of hold out only girls people haven 't come I 'm sure a few people out there would like to see things ahead of schedule too but I certainly understand you right here here yes I as you mentioned a sort of good opener mint chip person and appointed counselors my name is David Coons I i 'm here today opposing the rural rate increase part of the long-term plan but a background we 've loved that property called sunset point and car tuner for the last 13 years during that time i 've been on the banks peninsula a MP committee for that whole 13 years sea I 've also been on the committee for the utter hood domain and for the past six years being the chairperson for that domain as well certainly understand the immediate vicinity during this time that we 've lived there we 've endured many highs n lows while we 'd love it if I can first just take it back to 2006 bit of a jogging your memory labor was impaired that time Helen Clark was the the prime minister in New Zealand Gary Moore was a course to the mirror of Christchurch so we 're going back a couple of years near Chris Cairns don 't you probably didn 't realize it was the first year that he played an international cricket match ever not there longer dog chipping obviously was made compulsory trade me was purchased a year by fear fix and March there eats a mere bents Peninsula district was amalgamated with the crotchet City Council the first evidence we saw from crisis city council that stage was was a need to have a look at the rural rates at that time there was I guess a didn 't have a great grasp on what rural community was about and that there was a small rural holding within the crotchety council boundaries before the amalgamation and since taking over bench manager of course that 's dramatically increased where the majority of Brewer holding and Christchurch 's within the instrumental council that 's what the banks peninsula area sojourn so were the first that we knew at that stage about the rural increase in 2006 the increase in the general rate was through a letter there was obviously a course of action that we could take around that the criteria at that time was certainly different to what it is now on that it was stipulated that if you had a property of two hectares or less that a substantial amount of the property need to be set aside for farming the area devoted to the dwelling needed to be less than fifty percent of the total area the dwelling needed to be positioned in one corner of the property etc etc all quite reasonable and understandable items we we wrote to the Council of that time the a first leader was rejected so another was written and again that was rejected and I insisted upon that time that somebody from the City Council actually do visit our property as I established that Google Maps was the main basis for things of that stage and I was will know 2006 the old resolution wasn 't that great so that was accepted by the council I was expecting one or two people to turn up and two carloads of people to end up which was good and obviously showed that the council was taken it seriously so within a couple of minutes we walked up our property I spoke through what was exactly in my letter already and within five minutes of people arriving they 'd agreed that our property was then farming at that time now obviously moving forward to now we 're at round two when it comes to the rates for farming or rural property this time the criteria has changed it surprised me somewhat that there was that I didn 't see any way any consultation around changing of the criteria for what meets and now there is obviously a particular criteria that set which which has two parts over the less than five hit deer in terms of size or that the land value was greater than sixty six percent of the total capital value it 's a question that I do pose is at what point did the land size determined what the land is useful it confuses me a little in that it 's a bit of relevant sighs verse what it 's been used for on that basis to thee yeah the land is used for what it 's used for should be what it 's rated for and obviously there is a need to sort of the revised that I guess in terms of moving away from just a two-part storms criteria likewise I asked you know aslan size used to determine whether a business as a business when we 're talking about writing for businesses and residential the zone you know as land size the basis for whether it 's arisen and I if I can refer to section one or two of the local government act as you and financing policy that if you can just be mu with me a moment so that of course talks about how the council 's activities that are funded who pays for what and and why the general rates obviously used to fund services that the Council believes our of public benefit and of course the general the general rates come out of that so the council consumers the benefits are distributed and it states unevenly being proportionate business and rural and residential businesses obviously to need to have benefit more and rural properties to need to benefit at least they 're in residential so if the council applies the differentials to the value-based general rate and that states that that must be based on the use to which the Landers put so stands to reason that effects in the policy that the land use must be part of the criteria yet the new criteria set for the German rates for rural does not have any mention of what that land has been used for so does a little bit confusing me obviously page 92 of the long-term plan document states zoning and the assumed economical use of the land again in your own document for the long-term plan it also states the economic use of the land so the effect assumption toward the economic use of the land is removed as is with the proposed criteria essentially it 's it 's a blanket rule for everything stating that any property under five here 's cannot be productive cannot be economic and cannot be used for farming which it doesn 't make sense so I 'm going to do apologize but in my woods that 's wrong at the moment and as I stated earlier think you know 2k loads of counselors or counsel people already agreed with me yes so and summarizing I it 's my opinion anyway that if this if there is only two criteria then essentially what we 're looking at is that the lane users have been completely ignored and on the surface of things it can appear like there is it 's purely an exercise for for gathering revenue which I know you are short of two but if that 's the basis of whites 'd managed to group all of these submissions together we 've heard this submission before so from others who are similarly affected and I think the administrative efficiency has been proposed in this model and what a number of saying is that we actually do farm these smaller holdings and that was the reason for the differential and you should stick to it so would that be a nutshell sort of sort of a bit anyway and I know I realize I 'm not going to be the other person that 's raising this dodgy but look you 've gone well over the five minutes and I 've been lenient in that regard so but i think that the message sydney has been well received in terms of the process that we 've gone through and the substance of that argument so will be certainly taking all these submissions into account thank you very much right so we 're going to adjourn the meeting now until 335 _"

of it previously when we were professionals working in the legal profession Apollo power yoga has attracted thousands of people back into the central city and many of them comment that the only reason that they 've come back in since februari 2011 is to come to our studio so that we 've been a draw for people to revisit the central city with road closures noise vibrations dust it hasn 't been an easy process building up our business we started from scratch in July 2013 we weren 't a relocated business we were new to the our studio was a new creation and we had strong growth in the course of our first year but we noticed around the middle of about twenty fourteen that parking difficulties for our customers coming into the central city started to put a handbrake on the pace of our progress when we don 't see a student for a while and we follow them up and ask reasons why invariably a reason cited by them as the difficulty of the studio there were several nearby vacant lots that people could park on for free the restart park carpark by valentine 's and the on street car parks had the first two hours of parking time free and there were no restrictions on the street car parks as to time we were aware that the vacant lots would eventually be taken up by the owners and developers wanting to participate in the rebound but at that time the draft transport plan showed numerous off street car parking buildings that would be part of the rebound and close them to the center of the city the council 's practice at that time of offering free car parking in the central city also seemed reasonable as that 's what 's provided on suburban streets around suburban malls so the businesses in those areas can offer both their staff and their customers free parking we assume that that level playing field would continue on be available to us on a longer-term basis the vacant lots used on an ad hoc basis for parking are becoming fewer and further and further from the center after dark and they 're not a solution for the problem of where people are to park their cars if the rebuild is to be successful and I post the question where does the council propose that the large numbers of people anticipated to return to the center of the city where are they going to park their cars what the counselor is now doing we submit is seriously unfair to Central City businesses and it will kill the recovery if it continues charging over three dollars per hour parking on central city streets when on street parking is free near suburban businesses literally drives people away from the center and alfin to the suburbs restricting on street parking in the central city to 60 minutes where most suburban streets are not time restricted or not time restricted to the same degree also make central city businesses a much less attractive option for customers if someone 's made the effort to get a car into the center and has managed to find a park they will want to stay for more than an hour and we submit that the council over several hours instead of rushing them away after just one hour reducing on-street parking times from two hours to one hour does not double the number of people who can make use of the car parks as a council parking employee has said to us you lose all the people who need to use parks for more than an hour so if someone 's coming in to visit professional for advice or they 're coming in to exercise or to shop and eat with a friend or to visit the gallery or to go to a movie or to dine in a restaurant or any individual or combination of factors they can 't park the program that you 've called the accessible city is actually making the central city inaccessible to people who aren 't walking or biking their program is removing hundreds of on-street parking spaces and central city businesses are just a pup supposed to grin and bear it we made a submission on the accessible City consultation asking you to defer the program for the removal of on-street parks until such time as they were sufficient submission fell on deaf ears and yet when the proposal was made that a few car parks on Rickett and road be removed so that there can be a bus interchange the local businesses there said this is not good this is not fair and it seems that you exceeded to their demands trying to create a culture changes to traffic use by picking on one part of the city in isolation and it 's a vulnerable part of the city the future of the central city is yet to be made certain and it needs encouragement to ensure its viability picking on that one area to create the culture change will not work people would simply opt to stay out of the central city and go to suburban areas for their needs if there was a reasonable amount of off street parking available with the first three hours free for instance the on street situation might not be so crucial but there isn 't the City Council has not replaced the off street parking capacity it provided but prior to the earthquakes and the LTP doesn 't seem to providers to possibly supply the capacity but inevitably a very expensive rates will kill the central city recovery we believe that the council having been a principal principal provider of off street parking for short-term stays prior to the earthquakes the council cannot simply vacate that role and leave it to private providers we do understand that the vision for the central city is to make it more pedestrian and cyclist friendly and we do not disagree with that we look forward to the time when the central city is once again full of people but right now it is very sparsely populated in terms of both businesses and residents and may remain so unless there are sufficient incentives and forms of encouragement to draw people back in the businesses with the courage to locate here is still dependent upon people travelling into the center from the suburbs to do so by bus or bike is not realistic for most people we have students from as far away as rainy hora loca tight up preble Tim and Sumner they should not be excluded or discouraged from patronizing central city businesses other Central City businesses have lease renewal decisions if things stay the way they are we would be most inclined to move our studio to the suburbs which is where the counselors policies are encouraging businesses to locate Thank You afternoon madam mayor councillors I 'm Margo per pic as Hamish said we 've been operating the Apollo collar yoga studio since 2013 up until then I was a partner in the law firm of win Williams and with that background I want to give you a few examples of how City Council 's parking policies have been affecting Central City recovery before the earthquakes when Williams was located in the bnz building at the corner of Colombo and Herefords street and large majority of other major Christchurch law firms were also located in the old CBD within walking distance of the courts we regularly surveyed our clients that when Williams to find out what they thought about our services and how we could improve and one of the issues that always came up even prior to the quakes was the parking people found it difficult to get a cart us know about it but with almost all of the lawyers as particularly the bigger firms located in the central city clients had very little choice about just having to pay for parking that changed after the quakes when Williams temporary premises were in a big box retail development at the end of Martians road and clients and staff got used to driving their cars right up to the office and parking for free when we decided to move back into the central city when win Williams the law firm decided to move back into the central city there was a lot of negative feedback from clients and staff about having to pay for parking again I would imagine that similar feedback to other professional firms was at least part of the reason why so many of them have located their officers outside of the central city ask ourselves why frames like buddle findlay duncan control and young hunter have put their offices in victoria street and why botha mystical the firm that created the central city recovery plan blueprint is in Hazeldine in addington I 'd say the fact something to do with it it 's as a professional firm if your clients you can to get riled up by having to pay for parking you give them the choice the choice that they want of not having to pay operating a parlor power yoga with hamish we 're finding that the parking shortage and the charges are a significant impediment to growing a central city business well the cost of parking is marginal compared to a lawyer 's bill or an accountant 's bill it 's a big difference to the cost of one yoga class or coffee in a cafe or going to a movie it 's not just our business it feels as he fecked I 've heard students at our studio say that they 'd like to support other Central City businesses such as say going to a movie at Allison video land and then off to one of the bars around there a restaurants after up but they look at the fact that they 've got to pay for parking even on a Saturday evening in the central city and they go to the numbers of businesses that are interested in coming back to the central city the win williams building right next to you has been ready for tennis since last year and they can 't get any apart from when williams taking up the top three floors but they were committed to that several years ago we have students who had businesses in town before the quakes and who are still in the suburban locations they were relocated to after the quakes and they tell us that they admire us for coming into the central city but they 're choosing not to expose their own businesses to these conditions in relation to parking charges were asking you to use your powers fairly stop tilting the plate the playing field in favor of suburban businesses the entire city would function better if we could get hundreds of businesses back into the central city but that won 't happen if the City Council keeps making it more attractive to do business in the suburbs and as far as parking capacity goes we urge you to get back in the game parking buildings were a should be that again you 've had no return on the council car parking buildings for over four years which is ridiculous when you 're facing a large funding shortfall council-run car parks can return revenue for the council while keeping the market rate for parking at a reasonable rate so that people are not put off coming into the central city by the exorbitant charges that you get in some of the other cities here in Australia we 're passionate about seeing the Central City get back up on its feet and we 're just asking the City Council not kicking it back down just so you good now for questions yes we are thank you so two of our car park buildings were in the frame and have been compulsorily really acquired by the crown so it 's not as though we unwilling to get you know parking up and running but you know it is kind of difficult to do that when your buildings happen to be in the wrong place mm-hmm well he much mentioned the the draft I think it was the chapter of the showed lots of little car park sort of scattered throughout almost one each block and that seems sensible to me but that just seems to have gone by the wayside is it the accessible City chapter of the central city recovery plan this is back when it was that yeah the draft chapter before it became a you well was that the draft accessible City chapter or you going bless her after Sharon I don 't think it was called accessible City then when it was just a draft chapter of the central city recovery plan that dealt with oh no no the council did have a view that instead of having these massive buildings that they actually should have smaller ones and it was the same with bus stops as well they didn 't want one great big interchange they wanted to have it distributed through for lo que ya so I 'm not saying you have to go back and rebuild you know Manchester Street that is in the frame as you say but that capacity that capacity has got to be replicated somewhere yes I know and market to see what what the opportunities are I 'm Jamie um thank you for for that um there was a submission that we had I don 't know if we 've already heard it or if I 've read it and we 're going to be hearing it shortly never meet a blur over over this area time but um I went through a submit anyway and it made me to the targeted rate in the central city and advocating council to to further explore that obviously with malls free parking from the consumers perspective from a tenant 's perspective it 's not free at all no it 's not it 's part of what table is relax so I 'm interested to explore with us their combined cohesive joint version collective approach doesn 't it system a central city and that 's an asset in some ways and it 's also helped us back in others would you as a small business owner be amicable I suppose to to further explore a targeted rate a small percentage if collective marketing or potentially free parking is then a possibility Central City business associations and we have discussed that and we think that that is the way it 's it needs to go in order to get the same synergies I suppose operating amongst Central City businesses as happens in a mall yeah yeah I 'm Phil and thank you I just wonder if you 've seen the recent central city parking plan it came to where infrastructure transport Environment Committee it hasn 't been signed off by council but I just wonder if you had opportunity to see that no I haven 't okay and so it may address some of your concerns clearly there are some issues for short-term parking right about the concept of having three years for on student off street parking free do you know of any other major cities we were in fact that is worth I understand and this the second hand information but somebody else that I 'm on the Central City Business Association was says in Rotorua they have the first two hours free and it 's all dealt with by understreet monitoring in some way I 'd really be interested if there is no we do have a unique situation here counselor though I mean how many cities have had the middle of them just basically bombed out you have to get those businesses back into the central city ill manchester did and and that 's why we had the Lord Mayor come over as part of the share an idea international speaker series and you know we 've had a lot of insight from how other cities do it but don 't necessarily feel that we 're entirely taking me on board I 'm Tim I just think what about a minimum charge for two to three hours rather than a charge for an hour I mean that 's I was just spreading the load but making at least as well so what are you rather than say the first one around three first one to two hours free that you 've put it under get two hours for a lower amount or three hours per love yeah well that 's not the restart mall by a car park by Ballantine 's as operating I think it 's 50 for two hours parking that it 's only a dollar and people don 't mind that it 's when they have to pay you know over six dollars to park for two hours that they think well this is making us a fairly expensive yoga class six dollars on top of eighteen dollars it 's yeah yeah absolutely yeah but you would be open till you be you know yeah to something that makes it attractive to come back into the central city instead of discouraging yes this Wilson 's car park just long hair food street beyond the old bean seed building where they have all day parking for four dollars and some of our students parked there because it 's cheaper it 's cheaper than trying to be on street for three dollars and maybe get fine yeah or walk much further if they pressed for time I have actually done it myself it 's I totally agree there I know that Wilson 's is a private company yes and you 're asking the rape hair to subsidize the the cost of parking well it shouldn 't have is the issue and I guess that 's the point that we need to need to debate it 's no more of a subsidy than the City Council having available car parks and suburban areas that are not charged for that are occupied by people visiting suburban malls but this is this is why but that was the point that they 're not actually free to the to them on the street they are the streets are not any free to the to the shop owners on the street that 's why we have rules about where businesses can develop because you know the on-street parking in those areas it becomes a nightmare if you 're in a residential area so I mean it 's a it 's an interesting point but I think I mean you have definitely made your point and I think that you know we and and just in relation to that you do have suburban rules but you need to then modern to the resource consents of the businesses that have them because of traffic generation rules yeah we 've been told by the council monitor and we 're aware of businesses that are outside of the scope of their resource consents not just at a marginal degree by a very substantial degree in suburban areas which is preferring those businesses by not choosing to enforce them yeah while you do employ people to enforce parking yeah the other just one last comment you madam mayor you mentioned the fact that the car parking buildings within the frame and compulsory purchase by the crown you 're not just at the worm or a victim of Sarah that your partners in this rebuild and if every years I 'm sorry if if the land is being taken for one purpose your mind turns to other land what other opportunities are there and at the moment we 're not quite seeing subject what counselor Clearwater is said about new plants that we haven 't seen we 're not aware of how it 's going to come about that people who want to visit the city will be accommodated the Litchfield street car park is on its way down and and that 's you know going to be crossing car park is an arrangement we 've entered into with the people involved in that development so so we are getting there but it is frustrating in terms of the timetable for a lot of these decisions and of course the frustration of losing particular carfax edgy seed which were essentially a really good uncommon ER for the council and the fact that the you know an earthquake levy was basically put on our system to replace and come and I 've just it 's absolutely beyond comprehension that we would end up taking on debt in order to in order to fund missing revenue so but anyway our inheritance is what it does and that 's why we 're doing the long-term plan so thank you very much for your submission us hey thank you thank you in my file and David cans if we could move on to you _"

    "text": "Kathryn and John haven 't arrived yet so if we can move to the PSA Nigel 1 John hi hi but afternoon i 'm angela collier from the PSA and with me i hope my colleagues john space in noida one well so the PSA is the largest trade union in New Zealand with over 61,000 members Democratic organization rip ramin representing members and public service that work in amongst other things the local government sector the PSA represents over a thousand staff at the question City Council and its council controlled organizations following a merger with the southern local government officers union on the first of April and around five thousand eight hundred workers across it can be region are also members of CSI our submission is that the council should not sell assets the PSA considers that the privatization should not go ahead and believe that if there was a lengthy consultation process if that rehearse with members of public aimed and the community Dean that would come back with its own answer that that the asset should not be sold we believe it 's an ambitious project program there 's inherent risks such as rising costs and completion overruns and and in particular the fact that there are no details of the insurance payout which is yet to be finalized and other things like the government 's contributions and believe those haven 't_''_132.51 an impact as well we 've noted the existence of the common-sense plan being floated by councillors and we 've seen in our submission that we don 't in dorset plain but only because we were involved in it and didn 't have any input unter enter that so we still agree with the principles involved in the common-sense plan and see that it is a viable alternative to the proposal that the council is currently looking at as far as selling assets and consider that further if with further discussion you know we 'd certainly like to be involved and have a look at that and to respond to any other proposal that doesn 't involve selling assets the council is a steward of the assets on behalf of all of the residents of christchurch both now and in the future and we those assets that selling the assets is short-sighted gives short-term gain for long-term pain when those parts of the organization of their if they 're sold off will increase the costs to the public so if we actually have a look at what happened in the Wellington area Rhea and Wellington they had two assets so there was water that was kept in house and there was the electricity area that were sold off so over a ten-year period the water rose x 17.5 percent the costs of water rose x 17.5 percent which was less than the rate of inflation and the electricity sector that had been sold off rose by two hundred and ninety-five percent which was well in excess of what inflation was so the costs to the whole community for an asset that had been sold outside of the council 's Authority increase dramatically so that 's what happens when it 's gets old is that the private companies want to make more profits out of it and that being doesn 't focus on giving the return back to the community the other concern that we means that the workers that are an unfun durable possession and that the workers that work in most council controlled organizations if they 're privatized quite often what happens in those areas as the general rule of thumb is that the terms and conditions and wages of the employees and those privatized companies actually get reduced so that 's that 's a cough a further cost to the community the end of the income of those staff and and what they 're able to to earn the community we believe that the council is a steward of the assets on behalf of the residents of Christchurch both now and in the future inter-cell would be a betrayal of that stewardship of the role for now and for future generations so we believe that a should be retained within the council 's ownership you know what is there 's an opportunity for this council to do some some great things and there is a responsibility on this council that is huge and we don 't first for a moment underestimate the complexity of their there is an opportunity and we would really consult on this plant actually to spend more time with the community to contest '_''_371.659 to debate based on based on all the information at hand once council has all the information at hand once the the process of ascertaining you know what is or should that central government share be what is or should the insurance payouts be that is the time to then make an assessment about okay therefore what do our strategies need to be going forward please take the community with you in this in this process is what we would urge in '_''_404.009 and what 's being presented at the moment is it is simply too quick and it is simply bereft of too much of the information can I just ask you a couple of questions well as you 've used the Wellington example and I 'm really disappointed that Peter Harrison buck weary is speaking at a public meeting tonight while we are sitting here listening to submissions because I 'd much rather be there you know hearing the the story told you know because it 's a it really is a what happened between the water company and the utility well the that the electricity distribution company it 's what did what happen to the privatized electricity distribution costs as compared to ones that weren 't privatized and other parts of the country now I don 't know if you 've got that number on the top of your head but I suspected ascent as much as the difference between the water on crease and the electricity increase so that 's my first question if you don 't know the answer to it then could you ask it tonight and bring it and just email it through it in the second question is what happens when you haven 't got enough money to fix your infrastructure like you know so your assets are under the ground because their pipes or that above the ground in their roads what happens when you haven 't got enough money to fix them in a reasonable period of time are we not allowed to look to one form of our asset to help fund the other asset in terms a priority that 's the question guess it 's it 's about what their dialogue isn 't about what their discussion is and we 're that balance where that balance is strike at the moment what you 're talking about is the ability be able to sell up to one hundred percent of some a seeds yeah but we 're not going to do that we 've said that there 's an amount of money that we require yeah and it is the at the extreme end so that so we 're going to look at all that look at let 's just assume that we get to a point where we don 't need to raise 750 million bits assume it 's a smaller amount than that to get our horizontal infrastructure fixed you know at what point do we just simply say we 're not going to fix that infrastructure we 're going to hold on to our asset because holding on to a revenue-generating asset is more important than the infrastructure that supports our communities I think that what we are saying is that before we get to the answer where we need 're saying is that we don 't know and counsel does not know at this point actually what the question is because not all the information is available think those things if there might be people there might be a case there may be there may be a case of for something so it 's not not right not it 's not don 't so asset it 's don 't consider selling assets before you frame the question as one that actually gets the public to see what the choices are psas position is quite well known in terms of in terms of asset sales and do we as a principal tend to oppose them yes we do but also do we as a real world view know that there may be at times some some partial sale of sses we do know that as well what we are saying is that the debate is simply not well enough informed at this point in time and we want to take we want to support to take the community along with that thing debate yep all but the I was just are paying the staff more money than they will get on the private sector is that what you 're saying so we 're pains our CCO staff camila money they would give to the privacy current know what I 'm what I 'm saying is that that the the CCO what the little that people are paid in CEOs is a reasonable rate and going rate for what 's happening within the organization but quite often what happens is if it goes to the private sector as a private sector will look to reduce the amount of money that it pays to employees so that it can make a greater profit that 's one of the cost-saving measures that they undertake I mean it 's not the right way to go about it at all because it under undermines their income that people have got or the Hemis all right but thank you very much and if you could supply the answer to that question it would be extremely colorful certainly have a little super fun all your business thank you now could I have fun Hamish Kim movie and _"

    "text": "move on to Lindsay Caswell wasn 't expecting to be here quite so quick ok my name is Lindsay Carswell you probably all know me I am a retired school teacher and I thought economic some accounting kerikeri high school for a number of years this way I 'm opposed to the setting off the council-owned company for assets the history of such sales throughout New Zealand over the last video of years I 've a central or local government has shown that the decision to do so was somewhat short-sighted and resulted and a transfer of wealth from the public to a few of which it addressed a few people at the expense of all New Zealanders there are a number of options that I believe are available for the council to consider that could reduce or eliminate the need for asset sales these include the Fuhrer some of the projects in particular the stadium project now unemployment at the moment in Canberra is at three point one percent according to statistics New Zealand my latest march up the latest batch quarter nationally it 's a rate of five and I believe that the level of planned capital expenditure that you have as outlined in page 69 of the documents is unrealistic I believe that longer term is needed to smooth out some of those projects 15 to 20 year time frame is probably more realistic Leah second point I 'm not going to go into any great detail but to renegotiate the cost sharing agreements for government the reason I 'm not going to go into that is the next point Robbie covers a bit clearer in other people too i think are already talking about that particular point i would insist but the government pay an increased share of the rebuild costs am i am of the view that the tax revenue the government is will receive during the period of the rebuild will be much greater than the cost to the crown about 15 billion dollars but it may be going up gain whatever the latest budget papers happy to show so I 've got tatrix here which I will go over a few minutes I tried to obtain information showing the impact of the cannery the New Zealand economy I approached Treasury and then reading you an economist throughout New Zealand all advised that they had done its no research on fri and east of admitted to me that the issue is very complicated which is why nobody has done the hard grind that 's not nobody CDC 's done the work we could get that information although there is no hard research to support my argument I have made some calculations on aspects of the rebuild determined the increase in tax from that particular activity a very true piece of research I did augment their I looked at unemployment and countering area it 's declined 5,000 the workforce over this over a five-year period of increased for 32,000 I would imagine some of those people will probably be unemployed some will be from overseas at each person that comes off the unemployed benefit it goes on to full-time work saves the government or an expenditure and in income tax fox petite twenty-two thousand dollars times thirty-two thousand gives 700 million a year over ten year period gives you seven billion GST on the estimated know what the business income tax will be on profits the GST they will be paying you or do I know exactly what the individual income tax will feed you have a look at the fun of the grass I 've got here probably the retail spending Canterbury is quite spectacular environment the simple calculations show that the tax revenue of a crown will receive over the next 10 years will exceed the cost to the crown and as a result the crown should be supporting a council with further financial assistance this is not asking for a handout the tax gain resulting from the rebuild should remain in Canterbury I 'm aware that the government is experiencing difficulty in achieving a budget surplus the 2015-16 year but if it were not for the Canterbury Earthquake rebuild the financial position of a crown would be much worse other matters the plan we 've got here the 2015 and 225 long-term plan possibly the most important financial plan city council has ever had to reduce yet there is no clear financial statement showing the capital expenditure required your Mountain borrow and I sort of feel that account should show the cable expenditure required and then show the deficit before borrowing and asset sales just make it a lot clearer to see what 's actually going on that would look through everything then but it 's can 't find it anywhere and then Road totals for these items should also be included another point final point there is no requirement the local government act that requires the council to have a balanced budget section 100 of the Act requires that the council must ensure that a fuse projected operating revenue or operating revenues are set at a level sufficient to meet eight years projected operating expenses and here 's a statement then from the auditor the office will be able to the general the local government act 2002 defines operating expenses in operating revenues as having the same meaning as under generally accepted accounting practice unfortunately the ji AAP definitions are not but not that precise but the accounting standards defined operating activities as the activities of the entity that are not investing for financial activities capital expense your items are considered the office of the order the general in short the balanced budget requirement excludes capital expenditure I don 't know where it came from you Thank You Lindsay and you know I was kind of trying to be helpful in terms of my interjecting on on your comment you might like to put a request through to the Canterbury Development Corporation for the information that you say isn 't available because it certainly is and somebody just needs to ask for it I did have a quick look on their website no no it 's not only website you need to write them an answer just to assure that you have I mean I 'm well over time and I belong I 've let you go so but I 'm I am trying to be helpful in that regard for what and there are other people in the room that might like to follow up on it as well thank you thank

project I 'd had our cell the members of our group to come and speak with me but I think they must what this process was too intimidating I have no idea why they thought they 're very friendly and we don 't write so this strengthened you seek the project has been running for three years and it has a steering group and an interagency group and I project managers a project that some a the injection consists of eight government organizations three local authorities in key stakeholders in the sector na has five extremes which are working on their own projects in goals the strength in you said interagency group recognizes the very difficult task the council has a heavy to reduce its deficit in having to make some decisions our submission lab focuses on a simple version for Christchurch for young people aged 12 to 25 years old and supports the crisis youth council submission 's a place where young people will want to stay and we on think there 's been lots of talk about young people being a future of our city and they need to be involved in the rebill they need to be revolved in what 17 new communities but there has been little evidence of this and I know that the council has engaged with the crisis youth council with an MoU and I know that it was great attempts to engage young people and make submissions to the LTP as well but we believe that this should be the responsibility the council should be taking this possibility to lead and empowering young people to engage in all aspects of civic life and their youth engagement as embedded and council of practice not just now that for the future okay with youth friendly place and spaces so in 2013 there was a youth well-being survey carried out through the strength and ustick project with Sarah lead and we had a Hui in 2013 as well and the survey gave evidence to what came out of the who that young people places for them post earthquakes and they wanted to see places and spaces created for the impost earthquake which will obviously help them to want to stay here so we believe that providing safe cycle ways as a huge part of creating a youth friendly city and we support the council 's spending on providing safe cycling routes and prioritizing road repairs so that young people can ride their cycles on all suburb of suburban roads and in the city booth housing this is necessary that the council needs to seriously address has been an issue in Christchurch in New Zealand for many years the homeless and vulnerable young people are also some the Christchurch and we suggest the council allocates funding for youth housing as a percentage of the social housing budget and we 've already submitted on that and the social housing Summerson 's came about council has an obligation to be promoting the social economic environmental and cultural well-being of communities and the present and and if you end in the future employment crisis needs to be a city where their career opportunities for young people no in cultural background and there needs to be a set budget for the mayor 's task force for jobs we believe that it 's a great way for our city to progress opportunities for young people to gain employment from high school and those particular those young people who don 't have school qualifications and local school achievement building the capacity of our you sector so youth organizations services play a crucial role in supporting our young people in communities and often they are working with some of the most vulnerable people in our city and without them young people would not be supported and local communities as they are we encourage the council as its promise to be cutting funds through the strengthening of community funds this year and we are grateful for that Eric Ries does that funding has increased over the next 10 years for strengthen communities and not reduced and we believe the council should consider long-term funding at least three years and this aligns with best youth development practice and supporting young people along to him and lock the short term assets and rates we s it 's we believe this generation should make some sacrifices for the x generation so they are left with as many assets as possible to make Christchurch the place I will stay and attract young people from other places to live here most generations of only thought of you needs been thinking about the future my generation did this when were the beneficiaries of free to Sri education and then we decided at the benefit they would allow the government of that data make to sure education user pay so it could be better off by having our rates increased it 's going to make Christchurch a better place for the next generations and what a legacy to leave right Phil thank you John I 'm particularly understand your comments about employment for young people so you 're really saying because their understanding of course is that employment in Christchurch is at a high level or lower unemployment legal so it 's your information in effect there are some special eerie areas and I think he referred to young people no qualifications where who might benefit from a focus things one is your right been there is also quite I 've been busier the there are those young people who don 't have in say leave a one or two and they 've really struggled to get jobs in the rebuild but low school jobs because of that some of them may have drug and alcohol issues as well and we think the those young people a thorough zero an opportunity from the get jobs that 's now because there are low school jobs and the jobs which deserve the infrastructure of horizontal and vertical and infrastructure need low-skilled jobs so we um we think that some of the Miz task force for jobs should look it and also there are some of us information given to young people about what jobs are available in Christchurch for instance i know that manufacturers need young people and work but the schools are not being told that that 's a need in a lot of young people even Christ you get jobs and other manufacturing jobs and other studies so there 's some are career information that needs to be given issue that 's we 're been trying to address so we are we 're also one other thing we 're working on is supporting employers to be bitter employers of young people employers have us for a young people to have a passport which allows them the employer to see what our schools a young person has not just the work schools but also the soft skills around their hobbies what I good at we also believe there are employers need to have some in some schools on how to support young people when they would course any development so with it 's something that we think must there me is task force for jobs can work on but when bhagnani thank you for your comments about all so how intimidating this process can be if you were redesigning this process what would you do like maybe a group of young people together and ask them that question as well and to make that the whole this entire process of their LTP submissions is an intimidating one although those documents are produced to try to make it easier they were come in two parts now computer could barely handle printing at that so yeah I I don 't know it 's such a big job I wish I could give you an easy answer and but i would say young people would have some idea of how they could be better approached but that i have heard people say they like share it an idea and no its resource intensive but if we could go out to the communities of young people and present some of the stuff to them in sort of a youth friendly way in the areas where they are and in ways that make it real for them and it might be a good way to give them at least beginning to be engaged in this process and hopefully in the long run empowered in this city yeah yani you for raising the concern about the lack of youths face in the central city something that 's come through from the community as well the lack of community space given that sierra and ccd you 're really doing a lot of the Inca projects I just like the bus interchange to make sure that it 's got some youth space in the air or if not was there something we need to pick up as a council so the projects be engaging with Don must go in CLE edmondson Ronda um from the building of opinion design team was quite some time and we 're finally after being on the door with finally henesys success and that the youth voice canterbury which is a collaboration of youth advocacy groups youth councils have managed to have to put them submissions to victoria square and they have two young people from the crushing youth council we said on the reference group for victoria screen now which has happened through those conversations and we are hoping that 's the start of having young people on sitting on all the reference groups for each precinct and Don 's thinking that 's what 's going to happen so that 's a big positive step as far as the bus exchange goes young people did make they filled out a survey two thousand young people it was her but not everything that 's some of the young people quite disappointed about that we 've now said to Syria that way that with what we want to do into the council as well we actually want to go into a you thought of any places and spaces order on the bus exchange once it 's up and running to test whether as a youth for any place for young people so that 's something that I 'm sure will happen so there is some progress but it 's still not it 's not just about the CBD it 's about young people and their communities as well making sure places and spaces available young people in their own communities where they live and in the study obviously as well because we want to make sure that young people stay in their own communities and don 't have to come into town on the city for the entertainment and the things to do leisure exit trip thank you very much so thank you for putting me if I didn 't thank you for suggestions about how we might improve process as well I think agree that it 's not as intimidating because it could be for young people do yeah yeah yeah I think David blowers hasn 't arrived _"

    "text": "supplementary tables sorry that the supplementary I thank you legal or if I lift someone a half no I human sorry years supplementary number three she really sorry which supplementary whereabouts is it we 're back alright sorry okay thank you thank you good afternoon my name is Christopher dewdney I 'm a registered architect in an urban designer I 'm a fellow of the new zealand institute of architects and a member of new zealand urban design forum my submission requests that the council retains profitable and socially necessary assets councils wildly unnecessary anchor projects and accelerates the reuse of existing facilities for instance crankiest apart in the last half century Christchurch went down three tracks that have major repercussions in the following decades firstly the university was relocated from city center Timandra in a distant suburb beyond riccarton secondly the city surrendered and designed to traffic planning priorities including the closure of city streets such as Victoria Street which accelerated the demise of the square as the premier public space on the City High Street in Victoria Street the two historical diagonal imperatives inaccurate city should never be large suburban shopping malls with parallel redevelopment of the city centre as a living environment now instead of a hopeful new solution that rectified these mistakes the disaster of the earthquakes has been followed by the tragedy of the botched rebuild based upon a flawed concept with top down and fixable implementation almost no account has been taking at the public desires for rational replacement of facilities instead highly unsuitable projects are being foisted on to the central city creating urban desolation and such huge debt the necessary projects will be deferred indefinitely urban design experts as well as local developers and tribal citizens all condemned this failed rebuild concept board is not yet lost first cancel the wasteful anchor projects and reinstate badly needed infrastructure in particular the 500 million convention center and a caustic stadium should be cancelled and thank s a park in the previous Convention Center respectively repaired and rebuilt this saves a thousand million million dollars also means the important sit in streets of the city in lanes gloucester street and charger lane for example are not closed and huge series of the central city the central city located on the green frame stadium area is now empty this is not as crazy as it sounds space available is large enough and the influx of 25,000 citizens will rejuvenate the city center a stated aim of both City and Sarah as nothing else could university by the way is 20 year plan anticipates capital expenditure in the coming decade of a billion dollars about two-thirds of the capital word if this is spent developing the new inner city campus sales of the existing campus lenders residential plots in an already serviced existing suburb will readily fund the remaining capital development required an urban campus can be very beautiful and ce4 exist for instance a tiger university or Melbourne or Sydney University for that matter thirdly the above actions will largely resolve the dead center issue caused by the central like shopping centres and the linkages between university business industry not to mention de Polytechnic will be greatly facilitated by their enhanced proximity in summary through the long-term plan stop the anchor projects now instead implement useful truly inspirational developments that will enhance the city and mention the other line well I thought I don 't not sure if you guys can deal with it no but we might like to hear it right the missing bitters get rid of Sarah and SEC the hopeless ccd you Tim um you point to here with regards to not closing Victoria 's street I 've done probably as many if not more so the last 30 years and cathedral square which I don 't think is ever achieved what it should have done through designed to the point where the steps and cathedral square in front of the cathedral cause so many ankle injuries that they 've been afterthought put some aluminium handrails which looked like they 'd stolen out of ear I know but the closure of victoria street that 's insane but actually created probably one of the most beautiful spots within the city and you can see that from the reaction of those wanted to redesign it i absolutely take your point of trying to wriggle out uvs own close one but I 'm I realized this yeah I believe Victoria Street should never have demise of the square taking all the buses up and taking the victory it as a way to it too so it was no longer at the focus of a focal point for the city in its day-to-day business but closing our streets leading into it historic seats streets like Victoria Street was another blow high street and Victoria Street are the two main historical streets that cut across our grid which was applied after they were there ok thank you thank you very much for your submission um yeah our minutes it 's just head yeah no I mean it 's it 's very impactful so thank you very much for taking the trouble I don 't think John Miller 's there _"

    "text": "as Simon Cruickshank from the ministry of education is not available rural sorry you 're too strong residents association bulb cross that 's what i meant here chancellors okay our main submission to the council of course has been sorry to the long term plan has been strongly opposing the proposed change to the criteria in the rule differential for the rule differential or to be able to claim the rule differential firstly we we feel that it is a hugely unfair burden on the properties that fall outside of the criteria the rate increase should this go ahead will be somewhere in the vicinity of 40 plus percent and I don 't care which way the accountants actually taught it up I 've done the sums myself on my own property which doesn 't qualify and that 's what I come up with so that 's that 's the first point I want to hammer home it certainly doesn 't blend in with the so-called predicted rate rise of eight percent has stated publicly the second thing that actually is needs to be sort of brought home is the ten years sorry over the 15 years I 've been a member of the rule community I think just about every five years the council has made an attack on their rule differential one way or the other so this is the second time i 've been at in front of the council talking about it the last time it was actually against the the actual reasoning for the different so there 's no argument from the council side of it that a real differential shouldn 't exist that 's not what we 're here to discuss what we 're here to discuss is how you dreamed up the or how the staff members dreamed up the criteria and from what I consider will confine doubt i think it was like a finger in the air and if the wind caught it stuck and and five hectares seemed to be a perfect way of actually putting a figure on what was a farming activity how the hell that came about I have no idea and I think it 's just another accountants way of actually taking the easy choice for real depth of looking or checking or or analyzing different ways of attaining rates it 's just a simple maths or a simple formula the trouble with that with the wonderful criteria is that probably from the elders rural residents group and the members it encompasses is the fact that the properties would probably be in the 75 maybe even up to eighty percent of the would fall outside or wouldn 't apply in this this criteria that be all under because generally speaking the the rural land use that 's contained in the council 's plans relates to four hectare blocks as or ten acres as the absolute minimum you can subdivide down to so obviously the right take for the area that I 'm concerned with is going to be of a very beneficial nature to the council 's coppers what also gets me is and I believe there 's a briefing paper been sent to you met Amir that that was actually outlining some discussions and some process for console tation let me one hundred percent maybe two hundred percent assure you that no consultation has taken me and other members of the community whereby they advised that they may want to look at the long-term plan documentation to see if they take the criteria applied when I talk to the writer of that letter shortly after I got it he agreed that how the process had come about and was wanting some strong feedback well hopefully you 've got it better myth that the issue I have is right across the board the council certainly from the counselors and the mayor 's perspective there is a general feeling that we 're we 're keen to actually engage with the community groups and get the feedback well how the hell can you make a policy whereby we 'll come up with a policy whereby you don 't engage with the community you don 't actually see how or what other options could actually possibly explore I I completely feel that there are parts of the rural community that probably aren 't rural and nature for one of the better work however the plan doesn 't actually justify and we 've long since gone past that point where actually justify the rule rates differential so what I would suggest for this decision is for if you want to have a reasonable dialogue you engage with the community over the next 10 years or till the next LTP review and come up with a better way of actually diagnosing the reasons for having a criteria for the rural rates differential and who can hand who that applies do not some willy-nilly figure out of the year that just is dreamed up on the on the hope that possibly no one will comply or the Pope that it 's the easiest way to do it there 's got to be a different way and there are i can give you examples and quite a few of people that are less than two hectares are economically deriving an income from their from their rule holding so mad amir I I believe that this is totally unjust and I would like to see it removed from the table and some other mechanism put in place to engage with those communities that cover the rural sector and come up with a better idea is applied where the property is zoned rural or residential in the city remote defined as outside the sewer Network the end primarily used for farming or forestry yes the current criteria it 's it 's a bit more than that but yes generally that 's it yeah so the difficulty that start behaving you 've got obviously got the memo that that we got at the earliest stage of the process yep the difficulty is is that some people who simply have a lifestyle blog who don 't farm it at all have claimed this discount well it doesn 't say they have claimed it i would say they get the benefit of it what they have they that 's not lame thing you don 't put a claim in to get a rule discount it 's just automatic because your zone rule well that 's not how the criteria actually we but I mean the truth is is that we 've had a number of submissions on this already we 've already said that we will you know be considering this measure carefully the points that you 've us to consider this and a little bit more detail that just think thank you for that and there 's been quite a lot of other submissions on it as well and just in terms of the process that you said you of laying on the table when sorting it through over a period of years I 'm suggesting I 'm wondering if that could perhaps be done over a shorter period than 10 years because we do to an annual plan as well as the 10-year plan so maybe a process that works over the next year where there 's consultation and debate about what what this could be might be a better process or what 's absolutely yep yep that that to me would at least engage the community properly of those those affected communities definitely and I think from that those communities can go as the papers or the proposals come through those communities can actually take it to their members and work through some dialogue to come back with a with a considered way of going forward I do yep I 've already had that explained it it does make a hell of a difference to the owners of the it does and and sometimes looking for a administrative Lee easy way to get to an end point doesn 't necessarily produce that a just outcome so you you can be assured that the submissions process has effectively drawn council 's attention to this and we will definitely be taking that into account it 's good hope so so well thank you very much for making the time to come on today yep and i 'm yeah i just i wish that we had a better process for actually dealing with issues as a as a group grouping of submissions but we have been unsuccessful in terms of getting people to agree to a particular time to address an issue so that we could just deal with all of them at once but people have busy lives and it hasn 't been possible to do that and you know I guess it 's a process that we need to look at for future plans as well but it 's something that i don 't think was busy and i read it but if the Christians not put out there to bring bring those rural community groups or representatives together then you know that 's that 's a different story or maybe we could do that for the rest of the submissions in okay no thank you very much to that feedback okay okay I think I 'm Chris Dabney _"

    "text": "creative new zealand Stephen Wainwright ah not Stephen unfortunately hello david pettit David welcome colleagues wish your counselors thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today on the draft long-term plan with me I have chris archer who 's our senior arts advisor based on christchurch so Chris Herbert who 's our senior advisor for the Christchurch earthquakes and with the place user one of the members of the Arts Council very busy on this governing body so if I might I might quickly just run through our key points that we 've made in our submission and then we 'd love to deal with any questions the council may have about that yes so we acknowledge a creative new zealand they 're difficult financial situation than unique circumstances that council finds itself in and planning for the future for christchurch we believe that the long-term plan should position the arts as being of vital importance for the city 's future given that a vibrant and diverse art scene connects inspires people attracts a creative workforce and stills a sense of community pride and its key factor and destination for domestic and international visitors as well we strongly recommend the council refresh its arts policy and strategy which we notice laying dormant since july two thousand and one we 're excited by the opportunities of a successful performing arts precinct bring to christchurch energy councillor strength and its commitment to the precinct within its plan encourage castle to carefully consider the need to fully or partially restore the talent and all the james hey theatre and to take account of the future needs of the arts sector and the community in making this decision we encourage council to acknowledge within the plan that its role in respect of the Arts is carried out within a broader regional or an international arts ecosystem which includes co-investors like creative new zealand we believe the plan needs to shift its focus towards this ecosystem and how the funding that is available from council can be more effectively leverage within that courage council to bring together all arts and cultural tivities into one arts and culture activity management plan for example combining the arts and culture community grants and events and festivals we believe that having one arts and culture plan are supported by a revised art policy and strategy demonstrate a real commitment to restoring the conditions necessary for a successful and cultural arts and cultural contribution to Christchurch residents lives our principal arts survey the New Zealanders and the art survey tells us the arts continue to enjoy a strong support on Christchurch residents participation in the Arts increasing and residents viewing the Arts is essential for the city 's future we therefore believe that council has a critical part to play and directly meeting residents expectations for accessible high quality arts experiences as well as enabling a broader environment in which the arts can flourish thank you happy to answer any questions that you may have a breath thanks for thanks for the submission it 's very detailed and full I 've got one question on the town hall where you encouraged us to carefully consider the need to fully or partially restore the town hall if we didn 't do that what would be the other options we should look like I 'm a pastor to Chris on the new build option when the blueprint came out I provided for a 1500 cedar my 500 see the new builds so we were of the view that the tunnel was unrepairable just feels because of that statement Victorian it was clear that subsequent to the blueprint the council 's my decision to repeat the town hall so as far as we 're concerned all on you we we want to get up and running want to get our people back into the amenities we understand the difficulties the complexities of they appear insurance issues whole range of issues so we are not standing on the sideline that we are keen to talk about those options of other options have emerged since your decision to review yes there was ever a budget done for a new 1500 snow you 're talking about five and a half hours in this seat it was a rough I 've and a half thousand dollars a seat so rough so a new bill would probably slightly more than 127 million to get that you 'd be fax 150 million probably better sex price break all those options so superior to nature and yah need in le ok um really interested in that synergy of anchor projects have you talked to the crown about the convention center all night are his cultural center around the opportunities for performing arts to be xxs that space or utilize that space or have partnerships yes we have a program to do a group that involves the crown crown representation and the council representation so we exchange information so we 're I mean is there any opportunity for the convention center or the cultural center for moat are due to the coming up space Itzik well we 're not having those maybe not directly involved in a conversation the general feeling is that we neither independent Civic Center as opposed to something that 's integrated into the convention center le um I was just trying to understand why why well the Ministry of Culture me if its facilities of this size have matrix an optimal matrix for amenities and civic center is cool one of those we have a past on performances we have graduations and ceremonies and a won 't find that you won 't find those under greater than to a convention center David a separate standalone so the community yep um Eddie thank you um your submission who does the council to strengthen its commitment to the book that 's pre sent how in what way ah for me in reading the documents and preparing it may just be a case of it didn 't give me an impact a sense of impact of brass that cap this was something this council was throwing their weight behind I guess you could say it felt as though it was appeared on the list of anchor project at the beginning of the document I had trouble trying to navigate where the financial commitment was in the in the financial statements itself that some 30 million was coming from borrowing so again there was kind of a in the wider context of the choices that councils having to make about timing and projects in commitment and commitment it felt as though that may be pushed into the nice to haves rather than what we see it as is an moving into in a vibrant attractive half Christchurch because was a performing arts precinct of course you 'd have people coming into the town some of them already living in the town and the accom sure that 's going to be built in the John and you when you put something like the court theatre out at addington it doesn 't have the opportunity to attract the theatre bars or restaurants and the spell out before the theater and after the theater and not just the court theatre but any performing any performance that 's going on in the town they don 't have that there 's no interaction between the two in a place like Eddington whereas if they were in the inner city there would be dead in direction and so that 's why we 're saying whether it 's old on you or wherever it is somewhere in the central city we need a thriving performing us yes anyone else Jimmy one question okay because you look from a council bring all together all arts in a culture activity into one us and the culture activity managing where so many cultural event or activity arts there 's a tunnel of the multicultural at the most fear I 'm not sure how to prioritize those that the cultural event and also activities how do you think I would say those things as that job that task of prioritizing being easier if those things were brought together you 'll be able to everything choose where to make the investment more wisely and have a better appreciation of the array of events activities Cristobal 's that sort of thing that were on offer I 'm aware that the council teams that are responsible for those areas have recently been brought together to support both the arts and events and activities like that so having them work to one activity management plan one strange one revised strategy hopefully sort of enables the conditions where we can get the best bang for our buck in terms of the investment that we 're looking to make in in making the city a more vibrant place it also makes it easier for those trying to access those those funds as well just one stop learning to my question on your third point on your second page with regards to funding that is available making it easier for funding that is about or more effective to leverage what do you mean by that as an awkward as a year 's going to be hard i don 't think it comes back to that one stop shop kind of concepts are you know creative invest and new zealand invest a lot in christchurch the council obviously in christchurch as well and there are other funders out there as we know like the community trust who have the ability and n to make those investments into arts and christchurch so for a part of it is encouraging us as funders to work are more closely together if we know what clearly what councils looking at funding what 's important to councils are to council we can look at how we might be able to assist on particular things we 're not competing with each other in terms of on it 's something we don 't do that 's something that the council does you know we were to support one things together that individually it may not cross the line we have each other we can make the distinction between business as usual fans if it is something that goes on and pave quick recovery pounds and so we have business as usual which as well David 's really talking about how we can make that easier earthquake recovery funds are running out they have a finite time we along with other organizations like the Community Trust have seen up a great recovery funds so we have learned how to work really closely in order to be able to complement each other 's and you know leverage their budget benefits and back into the city but those funds punishing I 've got a couple of years ago and their art so all those people that we 've seen it you 've seen set up here they 're going to come back to business as usual but thank you very much and I think that at that point has been made by number of arts organizations and I think that councillors have you know sort of understood that happening because then you get the the whole being greater than the sum of the parts and I think we get that so thank you very much for your submission thank you think of your time thank you thank you _"

    "text": "Peter Buckley not here oh sorry Peter Buckley yep come forward please good afternoon everybody as you say buddy my name is Peter Buckley and I resided 164 old west coast road but no as a rural raper I wish to strongly object to the removal of the differential for properties and the five hectares proposed and the royal rating policy the long-term plan twenty fifteen to twenty to twenty fifteen to twenty twenty five others will have presented on the historical reasons why the differential was introduced in the first place I went to comment mainly on the unfairness of the proposal previously there has been recognition of small 224 hit their blocks which can be productive regardless of reason sins on them and whether or not they provide full time work there can be no difference between a two hectare block and a five Hector blocked when there is a rural activity occurring on both the same token both can be economically viable or not viable for example air three hectare plot is situated between 263 blocks all three derive an income by grazing team all three would and maintain their own swords and water at some considerable cost all three do not have street lighting footpaths or access to buses beer is a justification for penalizing those blocks under four hectares similarly there is no solid basis for picking a sixty-six percent land value to capital value ratio to determine rural activity now I know a for Hector blocked up far from us where the capital value is actually under the sixty-six percent so in the Christchurch replacement district plans stage 2 chapter 17 policy five it states a and sure identity and distribution of rural dwellings that will enable use of existing sites less than 4 hectares for rural dwellings in the rural urban friend zone where it will not result in large lot rural residential development and 7 avoid the expectation of land-use change of rural land to urban activities or for large lot rural residential development so no hope for subdivision then in the future in conclusion I would ask that the proposed criteria to the rural differential rating policy contained in the long-term plan 20 15 to 20 25 be removed and as rating policy has applied in 2014 2015 the thank you okay um the original our difference wasn 't I just wonder whether you 've got at the right way around the purpose of the reduction and the rate was so as to advantage somebody who was farming or had a forest on the land and it wasn 't a residential lifestyle block so if we retain the existing definition but it was focused entirely on whether it was primarily used for farming or forestry would your property qualify for the discount no it probably wouldn 't know so you don 't primarily use your property for farming or forestry well it is I mean as I say we graze a few sheep but the soda is a five-hit D block and I can 't see really see the difference it 's that arbitrary figure of five hectares that I objected really so I 'm doing the same thing on my block as a five hectare place is doing on the above and yet they 're exempt so but the the purpose of it was really to provide an advantage for is actually that you 've got a lifestyle block that 's not bang bang on the same basis as everyone else in the city yes but we you 're talking about residential yeah but it really is a residential lifestyle block if it 's not being used for farming that was the what I 'm saying the production was to allow people who were farming not to get caught up on a and a residential rating situation yeah I I hear what you 're saying that I still think that so what 's the difference between a five picture and a 3 Hector after doing exactly the same thing they 're they 're not using it for forestry or an economic an economical activity but they 're doing is yet the same as us so we 've had a number of people come and give examples of being under the five hectares but actually farming the block well I suppose you could say that we are actually doing it as well yes yeah but the purpose of it wasn 't to allow for the difference yeah I think I just intended to give people farming the land a discount not the other way around okay oh I get what you say yes yeah like that thank you very much i mean we have received a number of submissions on this subject and we are definitely committed to looking at it as part of the final review of the ltp thank you thank you the new _"

    "text": "thank you and friendly is not here so Edward Hitchcock I have some paper handouts yeah well somebody will come on Sean will come and collect those and distribute it for you thank you houses for the opportunity to come and speak to my submission my focus is on the issue of asset sales but particularly about the Orion assets because my own experience has been in management and working for Orion so I feel that something I have an ability to come in to hunt but for me the first thing about asset ownership is I think that for almost all of us if you have an asset you have something that you need to use all the time you need to own it because it 's good for cost minimizing and it gives you control how many of us would reinter our cars or rent a house if we had the option to buy I think it 's it 's very it 's very basic that ownership of assets that you that you use every day is actually very important but I want to talk particularly about the Orion electricity assets obviously the first one of those are the dividends yeah the thing about the electricity acids is that there is there a very secure asset the income stream problem is very reliable the use of electricity is likely to continue in the city for quite a long time to come and I think that 's actually why there 's such a lot of about selling assets is that there are actually people out there who are very keen to get their hands on them I think they need to be careful with which motivations that we 're following and considering selling them a second item i think is that the I think staff I think we 're better when they 're actually serving serving the rather than just serving an employer under public ownership management is actually there to serve the city and its people by good financial management but also it can make and making its decision to consider consider the needs of the city rather than just of the shareholders and we can all be all know the examples of telecom trends rail that have 're looking after their owners and that has been at the cost of the the country and anecdotally I hear that Wellington to electricity assets are in much the same situation they 've been they 've been sold off and now they managed at a cost minimizing and melted cost minimizing way yeah I think some actual object lessons and that come from the experience in the earthquakes Orion had before the earthquakes spent considerable money strengthening substation buildings it might will not have done that between cost minimizing it was there to make sure that to improve the possibility is good performance in the earthquakes the transmission line that was constructed in a few days after the earthquake it was an example of the fact that the ryan had put aside some stocks of 66 kv line construction materials that it would if it had been cost minimizing it wouldn 't have had couldn 't have done it in that situation the Orion is there designing the network so that it 's going to serve the city not so that it 's the cheapest thing that that will will 's that 's significant about ownership of assets especially where they 're ones that have a big interaction with the council every araya asset is on council land and there are interactions between orion and council on all sorts of issues that when it 's publicly owned orion can in effect give an informal return to the city it doesn 't need to be extracting every last cent out of the council those services it provides whereas as soon as it 's privatized that boundary between between the city assets and the orion asus is going to be a strict financial business and both sides are going to be trying to extract the last but it 's going to cost a lot of money to negotiate and in the end i think the council will lose but of course the question then comes as towards you what do you do instead of owning assets I 'm aware that the earthquakes have put the council in a not particularly good situation I think the answers that is that we need to retain the assets so that borrowing is appropriate I think one is the stadium but I think there are several other assets that where we 're replacing the temporary things we have now perhaps the temp reason could be made to last longer so that we can retain control of those assets just go for us in central government to contribute but I think the other thing that 's really key is to make sure that we 're taking advice from people who have the interests of the counts of the council and people at hand rather than that what might be interesting the people who might buy the it is it 's me thank you very much that 's some time up I 'm afraid yeah that 's not an ideal situation but if people can leave a little bit of time at the info questions that would help the engagement and make that you know sort of more of a an exchange rather than a straight up submission so thank you very much okay thank you _"

    "text": "good afternoon no me and counselors thanks for the opportunity to speak to my solution was introduced myself I am sociologist by profession and have had 24 years of professional experience of social impact assessment of policy and planning changes and also with social impact assessment of many resource consents for urban and rural projects on Resource Management Act so I 'm going to speak to my submission which you 've already got and explained a bit further that 's the thing I want to cut highlight is the release of capital pre-funding as I see it assets such as our international airport port and electricity network are essential for the sustainable development of our city so control these assets must be retained by counsel counsel cannot rely on corporate interest to put the community 's long-term and just before those of their shareholders I find that rather than ie that council should think that corporate interests will actually put the community interest first secondly I want to talk about building sustainable transport networks and I want to highlight railways row is an important component of our transport network yet plan given the current condition of our roads the council needs to urgently plan for community wrote for commuter rail services to be reintroduced and for additional freight to be moved by rail rather than by road if you just live in their brand street you 'll see the number of trucks going down that road which could be golf that road if they could be all some already are by having these inland ports but we need to do more for that we also need to think long term not just ten years about what happens to commuter transport and I think we don 't want to get the best at Auckland 's go into next I want to talk about the cycleways we 're talking a big investment here 162 million over 10 years now I think the first floor of the plant roots should be preceded with but then the project should be put on pause for five years to assess how it 's going to look at is it changing the pattern of how people move around the city and what are the benefits actually going I think some funds saved from postponing that could be also used for a feasibility study and a properly funded one 19,000 k but a big study to see look at the long-term option for role in the city lastly I want to talk about the anchor projects I support that there should be a delay in the construction of the new stadium under 2025 I see that the council 's contribution to the former am stadium replacements 253 million and the central city multi-sport facility is 147 million why Cannot we combine those two projects in one on one site and I think we could a considerable amount of money be saved because actually stadiums are not fully utilized in most parts of the world so why can 't we sort of create a facility that has used go 24 7 thank you very much right questions I 'm Yanni thank you for making the time to make a submission I was really interested in your introduction and you 've commented on a number of projects we should fund or not fund and we should do an assessment have spending or prioritization and if not do you think there 's a need to have something done in that regard so we can work out what the true priority should be in terms of the social impact I 've not seen any assessment of the spending no but what has been disappointing is that colleagues of mine try to get funding for a social impact assessment of the effects and aftermath of the earthquake as far as I know one crown instituted some work and was at the sudden of bikaner myriah and it was a very small study and that was really disappointing because we 're not going much from the social impact of disasters have no money spent on and government won 't provide the money do it is it something you think council should consider funding to help us understand where the priorities should be prioritization should be in terms of funding well I think you should consider it yes and it 's that that 's the end of the time I 'm that I have sort of kind of professed a lot of the things that sorry about that and if we do this again we 'll get a bit of process in place thank you _"

    "text": "good afternoon and thank you for this opportunity to speak to counsel my submissions a very simple one we live in pretty challenging times and this is evident and the financial challenges facing council as a public we seem to have very high aspirations on what we do what we 'd like is a city and Christchurch but I don 't think our budget meets those aspirations a couple of points first and foremost in terms of the replacement of some of the large assets it seems to me that we should be looking more towards a process by which we replace like-for-like I don 't see the justification for instance in having a library roughly double the size of the one that 's being replaced at several times the insurance proceeds that were likely to get to replace it certainly on the matter of the Town Hall is another for instance quite this think that 's complete waste of money the council will end up having a whole lot of public assets that are underutilized and will probably generate ongoing operating losses into the future and there might be auditorium with good acoustics as part of the convention center in making a contribution to as part of the cost sharing process to essential government to fund that aspect of the convention center just a couple of ideas the last one and i know this has been voted on and also housing accord signed with government last year but it seems to me in reading through the council accounts a rather opaque or my ability to read accounts as poor probably a combination of the two from what I can deduce social housing loses significant millions of dollars per year I don 't expect that 's going to change over time and the asset value is probably several hundred million dollars as a council as I understand it we wish to enter into some form negotiation at some point in time around cost sharing with government the government is going to be politically very averse to providing more capital to this council I suspect so what I 'm suggesting is how about doing a straight swap social housing which as a central government issue in most other cities and return so um so Wellington hasn 't got social housing you know I mean there 's actually only one city that sold at social housing that 's all condom that gets all the publicity it 's normal for councils to have social housing the council this council always almost boasts that where the second biggest landlord and New Zealand after house in New Zealand it 's right because they open soda and that may be the case all I 'm suggesting is that in straitened times we 're by the council 's own publications that would have to lift rental incomes by forty six percent and it can 't do that that another alternative exists yeah I mean the thing is is that we have a whole strategy around social housing what you probably read as part of the LGP process which takes well I mean social housing is never cost the ratepayers of Christchurch a cent not one single cent ever learn our entire only account yeah I 'm Glenn thank you i 'm going to ask a question thank you for your submission just to say at the moment community housing providers so to attract the income related rent subsidy our tenants are charged about the same slightly less but we attract that difference up to the market level but my question is around what do you see as other options for our social housing tenants for whom we 've been providing since nineteen thirty-eight of we ourselves pull out of social handsome i really see this is something that we should be negotiating with central government now i 'm not here to debate the rights or wrongs of whether you know walk-ins decision was a good long poor one however the fact is that the rate payers of Auckland are not holding a potential liability for that housing like we as ratepayers in Christchurch are now if I understand the papers correctly the council 's proposal to put of them to some form of trust arrangement has the council I think owning 45-49 percent and that 's the rules of central government dying Ford I don 't see any compensation for effectively giving up 51 percent of the equity of that housing and do it at least Italy retain and obscene own right okay well then it 's the ownership that I 'm suggesting could be a mechanism by which to negotiate with central government yeah Phil so is as you 'll understand our government are entering into negotiations around a lease aspect of their social housing so in fact following your suggestion though if the government say we 're not going to give you any more around this what what would you do then in terms of the people who live in the social housing you 've got any other suggestions well to me if the government hasn 't prepared to skip them to that mark then I think that 's quite a large political issue for central government and something that I think to some degree there 'll be a lot of support for having that argument publicly out of the city with central government look thank you very much I appreciate your time that 's some food for thought there when the Sun talk _"

    "text": "to Robin McCarthy welcome thank you peer counselors so thanks for the opportunity come along today just to speak briefly about my my submissions cuz of a it 's got coupla submission so i presume i will be called back for the second one well maybe not i don 't think so okay um just to comment with a start I 'm tour operator i wrote used to run along the summit road and thousands of tours up and down there me and my form of stuff and it would be useful if a trade was reinstated and i had a bit of a thing about this i think that bit round by underneath the mound Cavendish with a gondolas maybe a couple of years the settle it precedes it and drill a hole through the top of the mountain there may be a short line and it would get rid of all the problems of ongoing rock full rebuild the raid everything else and might be wary of investigating the cost of that and comparable to cost of repairing the existing Road anyway I move on to the asset to raise additional capital and a pub with 750 million dollars which you 're proposing to probably a shortfall in your finances but I a little bit concerned about the method that you 've chosen for these asset sales and by way of inviting strategic partners there 's no definition of what a strategic partner is red dead it 's rude that could be someone like night oh who why not Bob Jones you can be a great strategic partner a good track record could even be me I got much money but for deal was good enough i could probably raise some so i think that it is an issue that you should really consider seriously i believe that the original structure of the port of littleton was ideal partially flooded he had a value for your shares every day they were trading on the market and when it comes to selling another transfer shares it was a very efficient way of doing it you could probably put out the tender to Syria a number brokers as to what sort of commission they might charge when you put an was that we a better way of selling novice as well I 'm not working why the council bought back their existing stake and the port commenting I would create that I don 't think it was a wise move but anyway and of course it if you 're going to invite strategic partners in at the moment how you 're going to value the shares okay you can go around several companies and they 'll come back with a value of some kind but is that going to return the maximum to the council I 'm not sure about that and then if you 've got a strategic partner who you fall out with then here you going to get rid of the other thing too because they might hold you over Bell when it comes down to selling them and you know we get a situation like this you 've got a strategic partner if the relationship sales then that could cause other problems too and there 's also the chance that you might get a bit too yummy chummy with your strategic part whereas it 's probably things aren 't right they just sell it is and if the council where does if they are publicly listed say forty nine percent stake at some point in the future when the council 's finances come right now want to re-enter the market it 's pretty easy we 're done so it 's about all i 've got to say on that one and as for the canterbury christ it 's kind of your tourism submission I 'll sit it all before that I 've just repeating it you 'll all read it and I would hope that you might take it on board and do something about it we 're looking for transparency accountability on the accounts what I know we are the making the grounds to we know what I 'm making some i 'll give you one that given conference innovators 5,000 one of the former board members on the transport these issues have got to be resolved i can assure you that there is a lot of things which are not in order to the counts and i 'm asking for a forensic accountant accountant you want two heads up on where these some of these grants again and i can give you that but it needs that they need to be held to account we need we 're on the turret on a stakeholder in the tourism industry and i don 't see any reason why I can 't attend the board meetings I said time and time again if they are preventing us from attending the board meetings and they got something to hide now the structure was exactly same doubt with McKenzie District Council and I never had a problem with me attending their board meetings ring them up one day said you mind if I come no great come on down and half time we had a coffee I don 't see why it shouldn 't be the same here that 's what I got to say thank you out breath mean by that is a part of it is going to add value and it 's aligned with our strategic goals I 'm now in terms of buying shares back ultimate and actually dealing with any other issue it 's shareholders agreement will always include things like preemptive rights which means you have the right to buy that stake back which is the same arrangement we have with the government in terms of the airport there in twenty five percent we have the first right of refusal to buy that back in terms of the port I mean the reason we bought that back is because we wanted to have control over the future direction of the port the problem is we had a shareholder that had a blocking stake mm-hmm actually had no interest in doing anything with the port it was actually there in a way to block our port actually improving its at the performance of getting better partisan but also it was true and because of that it actually traded at a discount to the market and if we had gone to and the questioners sorry well this is an explanation no opponent but we 're running out of Dodge I mean this is this quite important because he 's asking the question in a way and I 'm trying to answer if that we would the open market now the actual value of the of the port in an open market at the moment is around 20 times in a doll which is about 30 35 million which is six seven hundred million those trading at 300 million so it 's actually on those terms was actually undervalued so and I think they should probably if you 're going to do something move quite quickly because returns for some of these companies was definitely declined he we saw that with feed drop off only tonnage of coal going through the port and the most certainly Airport out there is losing a lot to Queenstown I just make one more coming as far as the airport he is concerned why don 't they go an investigate buying a stake and the likes of Brisbane Airport of some other major airport in Australian flip the airplanes here because that 's exactly what opens doing two grins down we have a number of very significant challenges as you 've nailed one of them so thanks very much Robin good to see you thank you cheers Cheers Julian Newman _"

    "text": "set of hearings on the Christchurch City Council draft long-term pain 2015 25 we have relatively strict time frames to adopt given the number of submissions we have had a few drop out during the course of the day but we 're seeking to to fill those in order to complete the number of hearings that we need to complete we 'll hear the number of submissions that we need to hear before five o 'clock on Saturday and we complete so could I invite paul pierce to come forward Thank You Mindy see ya yep well good day to you all and i 'm here representing formally myself that i suspect in the essence of what i have to say oh well have a lot of other people who are not here present there will be other submissions about the value of fundamental assets that I think morally the responsibility of the council representing the public matters of communication power supply infrastructural maintenance and repair transport and the like these are precisely the areas where there is a proposal to partially or fully sell now those are fundamental assets view and that is the little matter of democracy this council is a representative of the public of Christchurch and as such it needs to know that what it is representing is precisely what the public of Christchurch want Isis suggest that that 's not been done so far when it was proposed that there be such a sale there were some amongst you who were prevailed upon to sign a pledge that they would not be party to the sale of items that are of fundamental structural importance to citizens and there are others who did not make that pledge for those who do then it would be dishonorable if they renamed on that to my knowledge they 've not done so to those who did not I put it to you that they have no mole right now to make a determination on the issue without consulting the public and if the public are to be consulted then it is surely a requirement that the public be fully informed I suggest that they 're not really so there ought to be a full public disclosure including assumptions not the thumb of any accountant if counts will forgive me but they know that that 's true but they need the public needs to be fully formed there needs to be a campaign to inform the public and for those who have not pledged a position before the last election there needs to be either a withdraw or an extension on the matter otherwise it is in my view and I put it to you quite dishonorable on a matter of such substance to vote on behalf of the public of Christchurch given that they are supposedly representatives of the public of Christchurch there are matters that need to be taken into account which doubtless will be addressed by other submitters for example the suggestion that this matter has been ideologically preordained by the appointment of Cameron first of all to advise you to sell and secondly to be the beneficiaries by being given the contact to arrange the sale which seems to me rather dodgy and I put it to you that that matter needs to be addressed because that company is ideologically Predis toward privatization it is not the state sector indicates that that 's the case so without further ado I simply reiterate that if you have not campaigned on this issue to sell then you have no moral right now to vote that way I 'm quite happy to answer any questions Tim Tim what are your thoughts and if it comes to their Europe you the thought of leasing rather than selling but it depends because the track record on leasing there was a council in Auckland at least its water supply for I think some 30-odd years this was the prior to the amalgamation in orphan and you 'd have to look at the turns and specifics of such a lease but I think in Aucklander from that area would have told you at the time that it didn 't work for them what really matters is ownership and control in the final analysis you 'd be right and that ownership is ultimately controlled but if you assign that control away for say 30 odd years which is what happened in was a pepakura pepper bring somebody I 've been then the answer is yep 10 but you kind of knocked it on the head then you win you you right when you see that comes down to the contractual agreement of thiet lives yeah but a contextual agreement there for what turn 30 years that I mean that 's totally iphone I 'm just suggesting rather than you know there 's an option or needed it 's all I 'm sorry but you might think that but I disagree it 's fine but thank you very much for your time no appreciation All Right see you at the barricades I think Steve Steve Connor has Steve Connor arrived no _"

    "text": "not least to speak quickly Oh II do you are 10 minutes ahead of time so oh you don 't want to give me more time than I 've been allocated I don 't know you you 've still got five minutes thank you thank you and thank you for the opportunity so give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime I 'm sure I don 't need to explain the wisdom and the Satan proverb and yet the people of Christchurch have been presented with a plan that appears to me to be sell the fishing gear and why are we being asked to do this where I said it seems to be to plug an imagined budget shortfall which only occurs if we stick to a self-imposed and hastily agreed timeframe with regard to the rebuild but I just like to touch on a few kind of major issues or areas in the long-term plan and in no particular order really horizontal infrastructure do we really want it back just the way problem to be flushed away rather than a resource to be harvested and stored and used sewer systems that took half of our pristine drinking water and added puto it before sending it into the history systems that mix grey and black water that 's more than doubling the treatment burden to bromley potable water regulations that prohibit the use of rainwater for both drinking and bathing surely we can do better than what we had before transport cities based on mass transit systems spend about six percent of their gdp on transport car base cities hemorrhage at more than twelve percent gdp active transport modes walking cycling etc not only reduced GDC gdp spend they also recycled that money within the city 's own economy while increasing health and well for all its residents acta for mass transport should always be the priority for transport budgets and we have just endorsing what you 've put on the plan their housing and anchor projects there was a really big adverse approached process the community visioning process where the community had an opportunity and took it with both hands to give important and it lets just ensure that the long-term plan is actually cognitive of those views it would appear that anchor project time frame just like the last speaker said is one of the most effective tools council has to balance the budget and free up building resources for all the little projects because it 's the little projects that are in fact rebuilding the fabric of the city when repairing replacing council housing assets the goal should be to make these areas complete communities by allowing affordable commercial and other properties hopes to deploy it on the land one of the keys to affordable housing from where I sit seems to be making land available without private ownership council as much land in good locations via car parks or abandoned facilities and these could be used in this way I suppose really my key message is that quarter infrastructure beard energy water transport housing community facilities or waste needs to be appropriate to a future not our past thank you okay questions yeah well he 's big time for it dude hey panic up respond no no oh I you 're already known to Vicki I am right okay our falling thank you I 'm good submission I 'm just wondering that deferring or requesting to cancel some big projects those are a risk that we could be seen as a council that 's slowing down the recovery death you think that 's a risk I 'm sure that there are some people who would like to try and spin it that way but I think you know quote from the previous submitter I think there is a very strong economic argument that says by making it a longer play with the rebuild rather than a short sharp and an hour you can actually achieve a much better economic spin of money within the community so yep I 'm Ali I totally understand your rationale behind that but what does that actually do for the amenity for P who have been the way they have been and living in the city the way they have been for for nearly five years don 't you think we need to get on and do those things what I 'm asking i and loving here versus the economic argument that you 're putting up to how much longer can people live in this kind of environment without the amenity of those key facilities no no about without footpaths and without roads that are reasonable I met the Emir the gentle and amenity of the environment and if people live walk and playing I mean one guy said what 's the point of having cycleways if I can 't teach my kid to cycle down the street that I live on yeah so hey you balance that hmm I I think on balance most certainly I view it but I would think that there is a reasonable time that would view that the quality of the amenity that you 're getting enough so that the quality of that future amenity is communicated well and I have strong buy into that then the idea of waiting a little bit longer for it it 's it 's not an uncommon theme to the good things take time and you know you need to be patient for for quality and all of those sorts of sayings the same applies I mean everything got broken at one time what do you fix first I mean you got the the water running and the the sewage kind of working and what appears to be working but I know I know how it 's being done in the background and you know that 's that that was the immediate stuff when it comes to how you feel about having to walk along a broken foot path to a library facility or something like that I think I would rather have the library facility than footpath but this is what if you can 't get there I mean look we 've had people for more than four years who cannot cannot walk down there footpath because they 're on a bit of pram or they 've got a motorized scooter or they 've got a kid on a scooter or a bicycle you know that I mean that I don 't know if you 've hit a look over the East but the street suggest i read over there every week all right so I 'm gonna you know what just you know I really have had my eyes open and I lived there too I think I 'd become immune to it because I just because I see it all the time it 's just impossible for some people to get around I don 't know I 'm I know it seems to me that what you 're saying is that good things take time and yes I grew up with that expression ringing in my ear all the time but I think what you 're talking about is things like you know the Metro sports and stadium and conventions in it centres although I do think that we do need a convention center it might be too bigger than the wrong place but it 's you know we do need one yeah to give you an example on something like that covered Stadium hmm Denis tins got a wonderful one I don 't know if you 've ever been down there and used it no you know but it 's a fantastic facility mm-hmm that 's been filled on three occasions and they were all rock concerts no that 's actually filled it completely I think Elton John came really close but you know that that 's a facility that 's completely under used in the context of the South Island or New Zealand hmm so do we need to have won the same and straight away when you could actually no utilize that one I don 't think that there is a single submitter I don 't think we 've hit the rugby union and we 've come here and ask for the stadium at all I 'm in a every submitter who 's mentioned out has asked for it to be put out or touched right always one yeah I 'll play as bus ticket to the needy and you know yeah well I mean you know it 's a or animal facility that they can 't afford you know so at least inform yeah I think oh I would prioritize as an active transport mass transit over so you know your path would get a repaired in front of a road and and I think you know by viewing they were just taking a moment you know the the way we 've dealt with stormwater historically yeah and if you view that you know as as a fresh water resource and then you know maybe you 'll do things differently yeah I think earlier from a housing point of view I don 't know why we don 't do that as a matter of course but the other thing is is that we can use the residential red zone opportunity to actually clean up what goes into our rivers to through natural wetlands so that there are things that will will be able to do because of some of the things that have happened as well yeah anyway thank you very much and it 's taken us two there are you doing I 'm though so we have hit a very long day but I 've tell you what I 've actually enjoyed today and maybe it 's positive yesterday it 's been a really interesting day of submissions yeah I love yep it 's what 's come clear to me is that people with we 're thinking high-level strategic is what we 're thinking flex things that ought to be fixed I 'm thinking there has to be something better a bit of way of processing this but people work she like coming along and they like the fact that it 's live streamed as well so you know maybe it may be but he 's just said you know why don 't we have saturday fix-it sessions and and just put on a morning where people can come along and just raise their issue to be great _"

    "text": "babies community board member nice to see you nice to see you good afternoon to the councillors to the mayor it 's always nice to be in here before i 'd like begin i 'd just like to state on record that the views expressed in the small speech are purely my own and have no reflection on the hagley ferrymed community board so how did we get here how did um how did this this plan come to be i think we 'd all agree that the fundamental driver behind this is uh is a reaction to a crisis in the past five years they 've put enormous strain on this public institution on elected members on services and i 've heard comparisons of this this council being compared to a war cabinet and i can understand why we 're living in extraordinary times and in order to meet the council 's obligations of services which rely on capital enormous decisions need to be made i do not believe that the proposed approach to address the 1.2 billion shortfall is the pragmatic solution that is presented to be because in the 1980s and the globalized market economy that we live under today the fourth labor government began the mass privatization of the state and many local authorities followed suit but as we know remarkably our city the christchurch city council held off from the fire sale adapted to the times and it 's why all of us here all of our citizens own a share and successful revenue generating assets today that bring in 46 million dollars per year proposed long-term plan is a continuation of the neoliberal experiment in the belief that the market is the answer to all questions posed by economic difficulties but this is more than an experiment on the trajectory of economic growth this is an experiment on the future of our city selling 750 million dollars worth of assets is a short-term solution to plugging the whole but where do the future costs lie the rate player will carry the burden i watched campbell live yesterday and um i was pleasantly surprised to see rath speaking on there sounding more like a politician than a banker and you 're absolutely correct and saying want houses made available they want security before the erection of a half billion dollar stadium to me the solution quite clearly lies in the relationship between us the ccc and the government the council needs to stand up to the government and say the pressure that you 're putting us under is unacceptable in a time of crisis we need support we need time we need flexibility to sort ourselves and our books out and to provide for our people in the way that we see fit the current authoritarian manner of sarah and ekuc are harming the fabric of the city and are causing us to have to find radical solution with no thought for the future now as a young person i urge you to be the council that will be remembered for standing up to the government and demanding a complete renegotiation of the anchor projects to be built that 's where we can find the capital and that 's when we can regain sovereignty of our city thank you thank you we 've got time for questions ally you 're saying joe you talk about 've heard that and there are two sides to this and those are clear as well what i hear though sometimes i guess from the other side if you want to call it that is also rooted in ideology how do you differentiate between i mean you can 't have your cake and eat it um well i mean we the ideology that 's presented is is clearly following one strain of ideology i mean we 're not coming along from maybe a left-wing perspective and talking about like nationalizing you know more assets to bring in more revenue like it is it is a an ideology that is based on the belief in the market and the fact that we need to free up some capital um and the market can deal with these assets in the same way if not produce more profit that than it can under the public model owned by the council but joe we 've had an earthquake and a massive earthquake and so i mean i 'd love to hear this question answered how do you pay your fair share you know and government and look i don 't want to hear an argument about you know the fact that the blueprint wasn 't consulted etc etc let 's just pretend that we didn 't have the blueprint and the anchor projects weren 't there there are certain things that we need to build as a city so how do we pay for it um one solution could be you could stagger rates um for properties worth over a million dollars you could raise rates by a hundred percent on those properties that would uh yeah bring in quite a fair amount of revenue because effectively rates act as a wealth tax it 's a flat tax no no no no somebody in a in a very expensive property i mean we had a guy before who 's already paying 14 000 a year that 's way more than i pay and and and he increases um he increases to 17 000 under our proposed rate increases 0.5 on a million dollars is x amount more than zero point five percent on four hundred thousand dollars of course if you have a more more there 's going to be cost more in rates but it 's still a flat tax of 0.5 no no no no because it 's a percentage it 's actually the opposite of a flat tax in christchurch rating system of the uniform annual general charge is changed it 's a tiny tiny amount of the total ratio 0.5 the total rate is based on the value of the property yeah it 's like as if you uh went into a petrol station and bought your petrol based on the value of your car which we don 't do um but that 's actually the rating system that operates in new zealand but leaving that aside i mean that probably in terms of million dollar properties that probably wouldn 't bring in enough to pay for the shortfall so and and i 'm i 'm recognizing the fact that there are components of the shortfall that are part of a blueprint that the community didn 't feel that they had a say in so so but what i 'm trying to say is what is what how do we got a lot of rebuilding to do yeah um how do we pay our way if we don 't look to some of our releasing some capital from our asset base yeah the the brics development bank has just been set up i think uh a month and a half ago which has been set up by the brics nations which brazil india russia china south africa and they 've they 're putting 100 billion capital up for development projects um throughout the world and you know a diplomatic mission to to meet with certain parties within this bank is a solution because although we could the argument against my argument is borrowing more is never good i there has been an earthquake we live in exceptional times we need capital we can either borrow more we can either ask the government for more flexibility a bit more help other sources for capital or we can sell assets so yeah thank you thank you thank you very much and it is great seeing young people coming along and making submissions um on the ltp we 're very pleased about that yeah thank you um robert alexander _"

    "text": "good afternoon sir go 2gether Thank You each for taking public submission seriously and being here in a said afternoon we 're joined householders I 'm speaking because i have a bit the geographer in the family there are three strands and our submissions two and three are linked together to is an affirmation of the work that you do with mayo new occur at IL we support this and we also support the things that you do to bring other Walker into the things that have in their City the larger one for you though is the funding of capital works as citizens we believe in council ownership in control of key infrastructure I 'm going to elaborate on one part of our submission larger capital projects need to be planned sequenced budgeted and built over a longer time span so let me unpack some of the benefits for doing this rebuild brings economic and social benefits to our city rebuilt expenditure flows into our regional economy and rebuild brings skilled capable work as an adze cultural diversity to our city the Filipinos and the IRS are just the 5 10 20 year time span workers will come short term and they will leave fewer economic benefits those things will not be so well captured very local economy do it in a phased way over 20 30 40 years more economic benefits will be captured and more skilled workers will settle with their families and become permanent citizens so don 't do the flagship projects all at once and in parallel do them in sequence that will take some of them out of the medium to him budget and it will free vacant land the short to medium term projects we have some magnificent examples of vacant land being used for short term revolt we 've got the restart mall we had for something like two years the pallet pavilion and we 've got the black IT complex on to a street down something up a slow rebuild will capture the economic and social benefits it will create new opportunities for innovation on some of the land that 's vacant it 's like we 're as we 've got to go I 'm sorry I wasn 't sure whether Sydney one got any questions yeah Phil god I just wondered if you 'd comment on it because it 's been a bit contagious but you refer to you know citizens retaining air see it 's like including libraries and almost as if that was necessary for us to have to do and I guess it 's come about because of other another submission and submissions but i 'm just wondering would you know that would do there is it 's been an analogy drawn that you know it would be a bit like count council say well for council say de lys libraries will be a bit like a private home owner deciding to cash up at least they 're home this wonder if you would agree with that analogy I 've enthusiastic about council operating and running the library system I don 't see that it 's any more essential for council to own the library land than it is for the crown to own the land of the police station or the law courts located on I think there are other systems but the key thing is is a profit to be made there 's a council that makes the prophet and the ratepayers benefit from that profit I think that we had another submission that I mean I think the submitter that that made the original comment was misquoted in the paper what he was saying was that sure the council has to run the libraries but they don 't have to own the buildings and and we 've had submissions in favor of the lease arrangements that we hear that eastgate mall for example where the library has really been brought into the heart of the community and not a separate building that they have to navigate their way to across the shopping mall carpet but so it 's a it 's an interesting point but I think that your major point here is that if ownership was to be divested you 'd rather that it was divested to the citizens by way of a reclaimable bond or something like that so it wasn 't you weren 't selling it to private ownership as if I read that right that 's right yep all right for the day is Christopher free _"

booklet it was an attachment to the genes of it supplementary but we just off the cuff go into Australia next week so we would have missed out on our spot so right just coming today to speak to you as a family and a business operating out of you out of New Brighton we 'd like to formally voice our support to the following projects to be budgeted in the long-term plan the legacy project being the hot water salt pools the promenade increased budget for operational costs funding for Council to complete the new brighton master plan we also want to support Eastern sport and Rec avonside bills and surely boys to be located on the qe2 site also supporting the keeping of roughly golf course and the South brought into um campground if it was operated under without i 'm using christchurch rates yeah rights neutral yeah we countless groups and associations fighting to the new bride at the moment including the new brighton business and landowners association serve renew north beach residents association and we truly believe that you the catalyst for changing you brighten has start from Paul 's Arnhem yeah are we move to New Brighton 12 years ago and we don 't plan to leave here and we have found our home here at scenario oppositely that we we want to live and play and socialize start our business and make lifelong connections we see huge potential and New Brighton and we want the council get behind us as a community of very enthusiastic people now suburb might might be broken and but I think you guys are aware that there 's so many people color came to work with you to get writing back on its feet yeah as a couple we 're super and be still bryson and our children our toe and we just hope that you guys will get on board as well so I just want to speak for a moment about from a business perspective we started their worked in the cafe we 've now grown to a size which we employ 33 people we pay over a million dollars in wages a year and we 've supported our community through earthquake folks and really tough times we 've given them a place to support each other share their stories and connect and we 've now opened two more sites in the city and we 've actually moved their coffee roaster into town and this was partly due to difficulties in Brighton so we leave bright and every day we come back into Brighton every day and we see the difference we see the roads we see it in the footpaths we sent in the bridges the amenities and the big thing is in perception so we experience negative perception fraught on you brighten every day the negative perception which makes it harder for us to work on our industry year the roads are broken year there 's a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed but we need to be backed by a council to rebuild our community and build the respect of our city that bride and we believe that account if the council invest in new brighton business will quickly follow so we want to say thanks for hearing us today we 're really passionate about you brighten we 've invested their family until you brighten we 've invested their business and you in program we are now asking for the investment from the council to New Brighton we 're asking for an ongoing commitment and we 're looking for private budgeting in the long-term plan thank you yep I was that well I wanted to ask about community coming together what council and a more of a partnership that that 's really been a theme for today it 's come through from people who want to rebuild Gigi 's to people who want to you know sort of invest in time bank operations you know the cold complementary currency concept you know the idea that you can pay it forward but you can do things and partnership so skill sets come to the table from the community and but also come from the you know Fred come from the council as well as as well and New Brighton because I mean the more used to be swept by Liz you know every Monday it was cleaned but that was paid for by the local business association I 'm not sure when you Lizzie used to come and drink a coffee would give him a deal because he did such hard job yep not sure and I think he ended up going to home and then um but what we 're seeing at the moment is this huge connection within the community I think it 's to do things like social media and how everyone can be so connected and a conversation can start and spread so quickly yeah but what we 're seeing is incredible work from different groups and like that we may be a broken community but the community itself is really strong so and I think you 've seen it in the matter of submissions and they 'll want to speak to it the passion is very strong you 're not just asking the council to do stuff for the community it 's work with the community yeah today you or yeah yeah yeahs knee say I 'm think you two probably for making submissions and probably want to say anything about new bride yeah what you like about it what is needing we mean what she loves about

    "text": "good afternoon okay so I 'm on the general rapes qualification and you 're most welcome to sit down if you want to be so yep and thank you for this opportunity to present a submission to receive a letter a few weeks ago suggesting our rates may go up twenty five percent after rates increase of six percent for the past rating year was not amusing their rates are already high this is happening during a period when inflation in New Zealand is not point ten percent there was no prior publicity for the possible changes and the reasons given in the letter were rather obscure the march two thousand fourteen revaluation the first after six years shows residential values were sixteen percent while commercial and rural properties rose only by nine percent increasing the rates on these small blocks I believe will increase the demand for further subdivision this in turn will encourage more commercialization and limit the production of the rich soils surrounding Christchurch these soils require little if any irrigation to be highly productive here is five hectares or greater could simply be land banks and so I believe that those making productive use of these top quality soils could not be penalized with higher rates we have few services and high maintenance weed control drainage problems to contend with and I would like to point out that on this land at the moment at this time in present time even harvesting grass from these soils as a simple way to contribute to the gross domestic product and I don 't know if people are aware that him that is quite profitable accidents to say that you can 't do anything on these little blocks is really quite as that negatively but some back to the drains I 've got dreams almost around my plate right around like now Vegas so the cost of that is quite a quite enough but into the bag and the drains under air makes seven is row now both blocked and we 're negotiating with your counsel to time get them get them repaired so when we get that prepared we might be in a different mood I 'm not sure thank you the question that I 've asked it mean it 's called a rural differential but it was to favor farmers so are you actively farming your over the off sense right so if the brawls will remain the same then you would feel confident if we were assessing whether that rule was being coming I mean I mean these people aren 't the real reason for this is that there are some people we 've got lifestyle residential blocks who are claiming a differential that they 're not entitled to agree I agree it 's a good all right yani I 'm thank you for submission um it 's great that you 've raised the issue of highly productive soils I just want to check are you engaged in the district plan review process and making submissions no and I mean I 'm just really curious wipe it because it 's an issue that hasn 't been raised oh and we are resigning a lot of that land for for how other sort of thing productive it 's true but it 's not really related to the LTP might be a point that you won 't really that yeah nice trying to be helpful in terms of encouraging you to make a submission honor on the district planners you want them what I 'm really interested in is that we 're losing a whole bunch of productive sources that ltp I know it 's a lot CP but the LTP matches the infrastructure with the land use so we 're spending millions of dollars providing infrastructure to enable the land use and we 've got submission saying they are concerned about the incentives for land use but because of our rating system then I think it 's an important question to explore which is really should we be doing more work there are levels of service or activity management plans at understanding the value of those productive soils when it comes to decisions around our spindle infrastructure and a piece of land use oh I think so I mean they 've got all that land out yeah do you stand which to me is top quality land I can add it beer to think that 's being well at the moment at auction just to meet Franklin you know that 's what yes how I see it good on it man oh well it 's yogi you could grow grass what 's done as I see it um you could fit and fit and stop in no trouble him plenty that could be done thank you very much okay thank thank you um councillor golf I 'm gonna send you home now that I brought you one are you are you happy to stay all right I did no I just thought I just I just I just want to I just want to say that you know he is very sick and very committed and thank you for here what that 's what that 's why I was going to send them home but anyway gene even famous even send papi even _"

    "text": "oh it 's arrived right Howard Livingston I risking her no Morris forum it was you God you want to say it all over again you can tell I wasn 't concentrating just on your name just on your name Julia Edom 's I 'm going to tuck you now so I don 't do that again firstly thank you very much everybody for giving up your time and the weekend to listen to your citizens or as you are and I 'm extending on my online submission on asset management and complimentary can 't see if I made on April the 24th there 's been much public discussion about the suggested sale of the council 's money earning assets in order to help make up the shortfall in the budget many citizens are opposed to such privatization the rising tide of debt worldwide nationwide and in Christchurch demands fresh thinking there 's plenty of that in the community library that I manage in littleton and in the minds of citizens who read and think and act on alternatives in june 2012 three people were invited to speak and Littleton who needs no introduction stimulated our thinking about debt and weighs around dealing with that problem including complementary currencies he later suggested civics and Ken tabs as currencies paid to citizens and companies which would then be used to pay their rates a great scheme they can speaker in 2012 was Tim Taylor and adviser on sustainability who focused on it not simply as an economic matter but more importantly on social well-being and justice he has also worked rough on the matter of complementary currencies tim has detailed the suggestion for you already the third speaker was Margaret Jeffries who discussed the power of intent where we have countered a gradual decline in people 's feeling of well-being by behaving more holistically thinking longer term and planning for more sustainability because it was Margaret who brought time banking to Littleton and then helped the system spread throughout New Zealand she is respected as an initiator who brings to a community strength and resilience we will speak to you next Wednesday about new possibilities with cane banking all three of these thinkers emphasized alternative ways of managing challenges which would relying totally on corporates whose profits could go elsewhere and bureaucratic systems which tie up large numbers of employees and dealing with paperwork the introduction of some kind of complementary currency is proving it 's worse worldwide and would benefit our city and its citizens but it would take quite a long time to develop it involving much research and planning which would cost money this made me think that existing community groups would be ideal to handle the day-to-day running of such a currency scheme Christ Church since the quakes is full of socially responsible and enthusiastic groups who work for their localities and communities consider the recent chatter same with edible Cadbury as just one example the option of time banking on the other hand is already well established here in Christchurch with 9 local time banks all convinced of the benefits of encouraging encouraging citizens to cooperate and help one another and the community without depending on actual cash beyond a relatively small expenditure on co-ordinators to keep the system running in conclusion it is my belief that it would be a relatively quick and easy way by building time banking into the council 's systems without totally depending on the sale of valuable assets or borrowing more money while also investigating the possibility of developing a special complementary currency that would make Christchurch less dependent on a financial system that has major weaknesses and so become a world leader in resilience and sustainability thank you the timings perfect thank you so much ya know all women just um that 's yeah I mean I just I just love the fact that people were thinking about how we can do things together rather than what we can do with for others and I just think that 's such a powerful message out of erath quite experienced that you know we can all take on board I think be great and it 's so many of the submissions that have come have actually come with joint proposals they haven 't come to ask for us to fund something or fix something they 're saying we 're setting up a trust we 're going to fundraise we 've got skills in our community we 'll do it together yeah what a legacy there would be thank you _"

    "text": "right so um Eve well so so oh sorry mr. woodham apparently some of the others haven 't arrived yet so we 're can 't believe we 're ahead of time we 're not we 're not ahead of time I think they 're not coming madam mayor councillors thinks of the opportunity for me to present my point of view on a subject that 's not very much discussed but it 's the qualification criteria for the lower rural rate which is a is I 'll go through it but I attended the community board meeting at software library on the fourteenth of April there 's some local ratepayers from the olders addressed the suggested removal of the of the 25-percent differential for rule and it was basically she gave is a great hero actually she was a Chester Council of rookie back was told of our concerns and she said honestly I didn 't know anything about it it was sort of just one of those things that slipped through and she gave us a good hearing very that 's exhale that 's right but the bottom line and sort of said hey come along and tell us the story so we all have a story to tell so I 'm issue she she actually sort of put it on context the meeting was fantastic and it sort of gave me a bit of a new hope that democracy was alive that mean it was fantastic for me I went on cific area but the whole meeting was everybody else is consumed and one of the things that I left will I think the earthquake took 100 the years to get to us but we 're trying to fix it all up about 10 or 15 years and I would suggest we need to spread it out make it a bit longer we don 't want to bankrupt this generation for the future but so I left that meeting so it was great I would in Norwich the openness of the meeting and all issues by Vicki and capsule staff there was a guy there that I 've been dealing with on this a guy steve bell adheres the funds and Financial Policy Manager the council gaudry with is transparency he was fantastic to deal with and it was just I 've had lots of dealings with other things on through the oldest residents association that was nowhere near as open and I want to acknowledge the work around he was fantastic my submission as a sample case study based on my 2.5 hectare farm which is the basis of the removal of the of the subsidy and this is what this is my summation only one a4 but it 's the guts of what I want to say i believe the suggested changing criteria for the removal of the 25-percent subdue on the general rate for my property 2.5 Hector 's is fundamentally flawed I believe the basis that changes that was based on capital staffs personal judgment on what farm should qualify for the rebate no reasoned analysis on land usage but only council officers gut feeling that 's on the horse 's mouth to move from my current 2.5 Hitler rebate 25 hectares based on gut feeling as unprofessional unfair and indeed an attack on a single doubt rate per group over 36 years my ponies and hacks new machine and kettle with many cups of hey I am indeed a working farm with subdivided paddocks hay barn and horse boxes to support my farming activities as an ovation if I had the proposed qualifying five hectares to get more rebate all that would have changed was the amount of high ground and the stock numbers the nature of my farm would not have changed one iota so much for gut feeling to remove my rule subsidy I 'm told this proposal for the counselors text neutral but in reality you 'll be charging the existing smaller rule Holdings more to give a reduction to another group of ratepayers hardly fear or professionally researched proposal that is initially based on gut feeling I strongly suggest based on the points of myself its efficient the existing criteria for the rates be retained thank you and you 've clearly clearly you 've described yourself as running a farming operation that the 25-percent differential was to support farmers that it wasn 't because the property was rural it was for farmers you know if the criteria were simply criteria you 'd be quite happy with that um the reality is given nature breeding horses and all that by law I can 't make a profit off the place because it 's not I 've a lot allowed to have a lot of that the side of the holding doesn 't preclude me to farm it as a to take take flosses of net so really the reality is I would argue strongly the shifting of a 2.5 25 hectares as the basis doesn 't make any logical sense to me right but but if but the test for us yeah it doesn 't matter for tax purposes but the test for us is that we 're supporting people who are undertaking farming activities you would qualify under their oaths it suggests over yeah yeah yeah okay that 's great it 's just most probably all I 'm trying to say I can 't see the point in the criteria from two point after four yeah yeah thank you for your talk and it has a betray you 're quite right so it is our it is it hell sort of went through this some out sometime bed and they took the photo of the house and the leg and the most surroundings and said because I got a nice house and I 've spent a whole lifetime actually bring back the birds fantails more lat so I 've got a fantastic orchard mall that I level the fruit on the trees of course the photos looked lovely and look their passage that qualify for the rebate I find that totally illogical because I had a nice house without a broken-down old bloody but then it would that be all right so I 'm the same as the criteria is the issue yeah yeah thank you very much no thank you very much now his if _"

    "text": "Barbara Martha Stewart I 'm afraid there 's another one of these submissions where I thought why haven 't we got a process where we can just deal with these issues one but one rather than the ltp but you know the processes that may have been there in the past but one of my favorite things so useful of the annual plan did hear what people really brought yeah I think annual plan this is good that long-term plan and I 've been picture stuff you know so she 's never win your problems you know hello everybody and especially to those of you that I know and remember with great fish and this is my son markets because this is a teammate it we 've both been battling what this problem but it 's actually his land we he lives and they are big just a little indulgence at the end because the whole situation of your structure of your counselor comes up and I might be the oldest one here that was here 1986 I might be right so I would tell you how good it was oscar before right well all the oldies are being wheeled out of the grave bring in the big guns IE that 's right i think the boss by son Marcus was it 32b Aurelia his property on one side is board is entirely by the river and while i 'm talking like if you had that picture down then I 'll just have a picture down here and also somebody all come come on did it to hear some vague idea of what we 're talking about this is his land with a square around it but most of the trees have now gone but there 's a square as to where his masses this is the lands and some province and that 's a picture there what it 's like most of time and this is an air picture that gives you some idea and fifty year flood so it just gives you a picture tells a thousand words over the past four years and even before but it 's got so much worse since the earthquake he 's suffered frequently from Friday 's right right up to his year we 've had numerous surveys done and reports commission from cod roe whose representatives come just to just to see what happens in this council today but overall has been no satisfactory solution because it 's a difficult one we 're here also because we represent several other property owners right along this part of the Styx River it 's not just Marcus 's issue we 've met with own southern of the City Council we 've met with Iran in 2015 we had River cleaning just as these submissions were going in but up until then the river we chopper had not been for a long long time and what occurs is for two reasons because of the earthquakes the whole lay of the land and the river has changed I doubt since that marvelous woman was here in my day who did the source to the sea of the Styx River which was very effective science another one done to a very imaginative plan Mary might remember bidding way there was the source to the sea and it started with the rough rush and the source end is literally thinking peat bog muck that is oozing sideways across the road there 's no definition of a river anymore it 's all gone so the idea that there was one day going to be a walkway a public walkway that was in the plan I doubt you could do it now but what 's happening to everybody in the area is this that you 're like quicksand your animals just would be sucked down if they got in there and it is your land that your pain rates on it 's a significant area as far as Marcus is concerned I would say some roughly where we 're here roughly to that ward at least as deep fog the whole of one side of the property and number one the weed cleaner doesn 't come frequently enough there is there is a difference the land the water disappears quite quite significantly back into the center when he comes along but he doesn 't come often enough and nobody seems to have the same answer they say there 's just one machine because another one fell over and was laid up for weeks not working well it seems to me in a city of rivers that that one a machine if that is the case one machine should be constantly cleaning the weed cleaning the rivers a mantra and there 's no clear answer about that so that 's one question what does this machine do how often does it do it and what are the results from its work seems an article question another thing is in one of those photos you can see that the the photo is old but you can see the line of willow trees will those willow trees have seeded and grown far across the properties and there but they all started on council land but they have moved sideways across the property so we ask that these questions be looked at but the long-term management of the Styx River be looked at it 's being ignored because there are not many people that live in this area and you have bigger problems however it is a river that 's causing a lot of problems to all the people that live along there Marcus 's virtually his door it literally in there happens if the rains are bad three or four times a year and that all the land around it so it is very significant I ask that you look at that because I speak for many other people that have this problem and I think it 's an issue and I think you should look desperately at cutting you can see the mists and those pictures are for and willow trees that 's that 's council land and because it 's out of sight nobody commits that it 's a problem that is actually a major issue so I also that legal good there 's my time 's running out can I just say one last thing about your management of the council amalgamation was in 1989 and that because of the argument and the passionate time it was the the director of what it was called sir something brought in the community board scheme right cross the city now that was near to being bits and pieces in other cities but not covering the whole city I have to tell they were given proper work to do and they did we had a marvelous man called Tony Carol and everybody really did work locally but slowly slowly the powers that be the administered starters Council and a few other people definitely didn 't like not having all the eggs under their feathers so they slowly stripped the pass of the community board and have made them ring function as really if you could look at how well they were run and local is coming back into the local even government departments or realizing that local is more important than this than the arts as out of Wellington it can work you really don 't need any more people around this panel you have enough people here to live yeah what you 're not working on possibly well enough is really good functioning community pool instructor yeah I say that because I saw at work but it was taken away some years in it so I would like to ask we were also prepared on this land of Marcus 's which is considerable if you can see the pictures and we well at the source ends and you know really do something with it but it 's quite beyond that now its possibilities of gone but the management is really bad and I think that willows have pre cut down and the wiping of the weeds cutting of the weed and the source of the side and the structure of the river has to be seriously up to a tree rigid and reading and the driven and I that 's what we 're here to ask you for to look at them thank you very much well behaved come to the indiv the sister reassurance that from the public meeting we are really following up in the staff have admitted that they 're going to pick up the cutting regime so if it 's any comfort but one of three or four things yeah and they start our cus staff like Owen and yourself have been great they 've actually come to us yeah and stood in front of us and taking the brunt of a few passionate people so thank you very much about meeting thank you very much and our totally agrees so thank you _"

    "text": "Tracy cook hi there yes thank you for listening to my little saturday afternoon that 's alright boys got other things they could do I 'm just here to in support of my submission which I 'm actually wanting to oppose the council 's proposal for changing the rule cattery flow rate differentials Stephen valid i think it was has come out because I changing it from our current system and putting in different providers and one of them is through up at 25 Hector 's to be considered rural I think it 's a little bit unfair because at a time that subdivisions were done and these 20 years ago we had to justify use of the land to them to support the fact that as a rural and this was done back then and even now in the next proposed plan they 're talking about still using for Hector 's as the basis for rural so I find that quite interesting that and I wanted to change it to five Hector 's so that 's my first unless you I have rural block owners also have a lot say that we need to pay the residential rates a little bit unfair I mean if you live in town you don 't have to worry about stock you don 't have to worry about stop constantly damaging your fences you don 't have to worry about disposal of any shelf abouts gosh you know stop management as well to look after we also have pest control possums being our latest thing and we get charged for possum control and possum maintenance but haven 't yet seen any of it and get woken up on a regular basis at one fitting and wanting a possums so that 's another issue so to turn around say we want to charge your residentials like we 've already got other expenses involved with having rural block and I think for Hector 's is probably quite a justifiable size to say that it 's a working farm well that 's hard to prove on even a five Hector block I think so I don 't think that would be Liam useful a more importantly on my street we 're on walls lease and it and Wolsey spur has been earmarked by the council has been a significant rural outlook for the city and we have got a lot of restrictions on what we can do in our property we can 't subdivide we can 't put buildings on the rural block because its own rule and also too because anything you do on the hill affects what nice if he looks at so based on that and in fact that the council has said that we are a significant rural outlook for the court hills and we 're restrictive activities I think it 's unfair than to turn and say we want to charge you a residential rate for that but you 've got all these other restrictions that are rural block has also to the road at some being done as a rural road many many years ago by my neighbor and a lot of it hasn 't actually been touched or improved by the council over the last he moved in in 60 in the early 60s and some parts of the road are still the original part from the 60s and any sewer or wastewater disposal essentially we have rural facilities and yes I realized that we don 't get charged that minimal amount that other people in town in the urban areas do but the significant difference between changing our rates from rural to residential far outweighs the difference that we 're paying in our rates so I would just like to run finish up and save it if the council could look at another way of charging or perhaps put into existing people on a grandfather system because we have up for Hector 's we are consider all and on my particular Road we are all rural and it 's considered point for the city to have that rule outlook then I think you 'll be fair to keep it away is and perhaps look at future subdivisions in your next plan which you 've really got some in place about perhaps charging those people a different rate or something in between do you know what the discount is for you know but you know have we 've got it 's for not getting the same sort of services being used for active farming practices the real test is in that girl here you 're a farm or not yeah but you don 't think that 's a fair what would you define as a farm because we have a pine lot we r restricted as to how much we can plant we also have olive trees which is the justification on our particular property we 're not subdivided 20 years ago they said you have to justify it as rural then she planted a whole of olive trees on the property we still have them okay so it so it has to be tied back then it 's a question I can 't answer yeah but one of the one of the propositions that that we 've kind of been putting to be because we 've had a number of submissions on this I 'm aware of that is is if the alternative is that we actually review the individual properties outside urban areas to make sure that they 're being rated consistently meaning are they are they used for active farming practices and what I don 't for that no I 'm not qualified to answer that question but us use your dispute to go down that track then to have the the 4 acres are the five acres such as the hypodermis five hectares yeah that 's okay rtnagar block I had suggested to Steven valor that perhaps instead of using it as a the five cases of benchmark that you know in your next plan of Phase two you 're even saying rural plans and you 're still working on the fight on for Hector 's now you 've got me saying it as the minimum size for rural block still so in phase two which I 've got some copies up here which you will all have because you 're aware for the whole process yeah it 's still working on for Hector 's rural land and yeah but it 's not the reason for the discount the fact that it 's rural land is not the reason for the discount if you have a lifestyle block you pay and your residential essentially you pay residential rates there is a discount for people who small blocks yes exactly and it 's fine if council want to spend at a time and the resources doing it to check on each person that 's fine but I think then we don 't which is why we 're just very nice and I think you do need to taking stress I just say to Steven Bella perhaps instead of looking at a percentage job because they said that the house is worth you know tooth in lesson two years that 's really hard because on the hill I would be pushed to find a house it 's worth two hundred thousand dollars on my section ya can 't build a house on a hill for two hundred thousand dollars no and it 's impossible so to say that you wouldn 't even get a farmer with an old farmhouse on it I think I 'm for that for that divisional you know I 've situation the thing is is that I mean that we 've received a number of submissions on this and I think that this is something that we 've taken that I 'd be suggested to to steal perhaps they can look at the percentage of curtilage against the rural activity the real and it is the cooling a discount for farmers so that that 's the history of it and I 'm assuming that we want to continue what that discount for farmers every because I just think see the definition about farming is then correct and I can 't offer that to you today if that 's the case then is a pine plantation farming I don 't know and so therefore I would maybe we 'll get Steven to follow up with you to because I think there 's a few things that they need to work on before they suggest that change we 're good we 're going to have to talk to staff around this particular issue emissions have Yeti series no question that we have received the sessions and we 've we 've listened to them and we will certainly be taking them into account yet just on that note there were at least two neighbors of mine who have for Hector 's yeah who weren 't informed they may not they may not have the differential either if they 're not are they doing I had looked at it we 've got it up since then and unfortunately we were only talking about us last week so they missed the submission time yet so just to note you probably would have had more submissions opposing Liz if everybody had we 've hit a fight a few so I mean that this issue is signaled a are clear and we would be I 'm taking one solutions and all right then well hopefully we 'll see some positive results on our part thank you very much okay thank you I 'm Darren Newton _"

    "text": "in a bowl to court hello everybody thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today you are also welcome to sit down if you want and join us yeah so I 'm comfortable to stand that 's fine just thought my voice might be projected a bit better and I 'm presenting on rubbish burns submission that 's not particularly exciting but certainly essential we learned brinton I my fiancee I love living a new residential complex called Jinian court from the CBD it 's situated on Cambridge terrace in the northeast corner of the frame there are 10 owners the majority of whom choose to live in the inner city for similar reasons is us we 're all passionate about our surroundings and the development of City and I add that they feel the same way about rubbish the rubbish as sure as I do a rubbish has collected and placed it begs read one here some of you may be me any other one to reduce the daily rubber and the yellow one is for these playful rush material which is weekly there is no clicking the council building this is all very well but the opening hours are not conducive to working hours and if you work full time it makes it very difficult to purchase beds as you can see they have a limited stability are pretty small and they 're very thin and easily torn frequently which the pace with this one the recycle big pieces of cash and poke through again so how do we dispose of cabins especially larger sized ones and a both the site the reedbeds hitter take that daily a delight to passing dogs in red which were quite a few earth and the inner study consequently our rubbish bags are constantly broken into and rubbish has drawn across the footpath and rubbish is also blown until the river and onto the green area which is becoming a healthy so what are we to do about this I was advised that we have to have rubbish bags cause we live in the inner city and the inner city residents do not pay the waste minimisation charge on the erase I used to live in gloucester street across the very close to here it 's even closer to the inner city we have funds are used why then do we have rubbish bags and not burns when we are further out of the unexciting our neighbors on Commerce Street who beg onto our property we also have an entrance on Commerce Street but our address is Cambridge terrace hair rubbish bins we are considered to be in a different song that is not designated to headphones and apparently pay with lease rates and they blew all they were unable to ascertain this why then are we not getting the service we hear rubbish bags for day-to-day rubbish and for recyclable material material but not for green waste and we do have green waste not only from our food and daily rubbish but we have it from our garden in our courtyard what are we to do with our garden Wes why do we not have rubbished reaching for green waste I was told that we needed to have a designated area for guns which we do but apparently our address is Cambridge terrace and not chemistry where our designated gene in court we are all prepared twill Evans around Cambridge cheers conclusion wyd theme do we not have this rubbish bags are unsightly and cumbersome I 'm sure you 'll all agree on this something but David really on some days they required a stack of theme on our footpath then as I previously mentioned frequently in duct torn with rubbish displayed out of the bed around the area an area that is particular pretty and enjoyed by many why do we care unsightly and practical rubbish bags and summary the proposal for rubbish bags is supported by several practical in aesthetic reasons rubbish is essential for our day-to-day living it needs to be efficiently and effectively handled they need cleats niraj bags proven to be anything but first like many of our neighbors we have decided to stay in the inner city and support the rebuild a process that is mostly disrupted to our lives which I 'm sure you agree with we do not need the added hindrance or rubbish bags something small but really important to help make in a city life a little bit more matter I just want to expand union court it 's an apartment complex situation diagonally opposite where the Sentinel pulleys to be with a Margaret may he playground is proposed to go it 's a really lovely sweep of the ADA River working on body poplar trees and we are at the stage the only reason living down there it 's quite a large complex next to us our neighbors are building a house and there was so supportive of this idea that put a proposal in truth and I don 't know what 's going to help him down the risk of language tears but there is a group of us that feel this way so thank you for your time I 'm sure it 's been a long day I appreciate it it is and it 's been quite interesting you know obviously reading all these submissions before before you came I sort of thought gosh you know it 's such a shame that something like this just couldn 't be fixed rather than having to make a submission on a long-term plane but we 'll follow up yes I know all right thanks thank you _"

    "text": "yeah afternoon session could I invite Robert taste to come forward thank you greetings to your worship near the end l0 and honorable councillors and ladies agenda more present you 're most welcome to sit down and join all I 'm happy to stand it 's absolutely fine anything anything part yep thank you first of all my name is Robert eighth of a powwow and I thank you for the opportunity to discuss christchurch 's navigational signs now I want you to imagine a sheep in the hope that you will relate to its behavior to the issues of navigation these lovely beings move well disciplined if they are guided by a dog however if they 're not they mill around willy-nilly human beings as distinct from needing a dog need signs to point them in the right direction my focus for this destination a dissertation is on signage to be read by citizens navigating their way around the city here let me say that the council will really provides for this exceedingly well but I 'm hoping there might be a little bit of room for enhancement if have a test which i hope you won 't mind my inviting selected members of the council to perform and i 'll give you the test in a minute i 'm picking three councillors and when you get the test I want it face down please you can you can select this side is t aside a and is it yes three people side a and just any of them and then this side is side B and streaming kind members I hope we 'll be happy to up the formless till now what I want you to do is yeah whatever thanks I want you to when I say go I want you to read the random letters grouped together and I want you to memorize them and as soon as you 've memorized them I want you to raise your hand as quickly as you can and i 'll say stop at some stage whether you 've finished or not I 'm happy whoever does it is fine okay I like that I like that as you have remover all right you really see it go and put as a side B you 've finished and you 've memorized it right stop interesting I 'll come to that later and I want you to tell me Team B the third letter it turned your page over I want you to tell me the third letter of the first group of five digits or five characters huh anybody on the side that no physics I want you to tell me the fifth third digit of grid 2 he is right ah what 's the right answer okay um we connect the chair over I 'm betting ugh the tryst in demonstrates in an informal way and experimentally how a motorist needs to cope when navigating around the city by reading the street names if they 're present now there 's a difference between test paper a and test paper be tears paper a was in a difficult font to read because it didn 't have sir reefs now Sarita the curly little things on letters which help you unconsciously read and interpret littering quicker side be this lovely lady here was absolutely miraculously first remember the litter but he that and I 've done experiments and I 'll tell you about that in a minute it proves to me that lettering with Sir reefs are more legible more quickly interpreted than lettering without Suri 's tell me Oh pass it around if you want just so you can see now the City Council uses littering for its street name plates that do not have cerise so therefore there is a longer period of time for the motorist particularly to be able to read and understand the litter now christchurch going to some history inherited street signage of various kinds from the five or so different authorities that used to be when it became a consolidated entity and since then i have to say that it has very bravely and progressively standardized the cited so that they 're much much better than they used to be now the current practice is that there are two key people if i understand on the staff Bob Pritchard is concerned with the determining the names of the streets and just by the way he recalls with amusement the township near Lake Tiana which miners that came back in the 1800s and bearing the name obviously with chinese wrong way if you get that wrong way anyway leave that now the council already I understand has promulgated these rules about naming deciding on the names and this is functioning very well subdivision developers pay a fee of five hundred dollars per street sign and they end for the consent and the cost of mounting it by a contractor now Vanessa not all I understand is the other council officer and her team actually engages the contractors to install the name claims however I discovered if I 'm right that the council does not have any regulations relating to that aspect of the process and probably i 'm not i 'm reluctant to interrupt but music we 've got to time so Ryan I 'm nearly finished yeah just the main final point that you 'd like to make alright thank you my recommendation is that I hope the council will develop a set of standards for the mounting of street name plates it will use a Sarita typeface in future and that it will at bring yours name plates and you 'll see how much easier they are to read and also the final thing is standardizing the height pointing direction in relation to the street geometry of the name plates and make sure that every intersection has a nameplate present and thank you for your time thank you very very much oh I have photographs which you want to pass around ah yes showing example nowadays of absence of street names and showing the good quality of some of the silence that the council already does great thank you very very much thank you and _"

what are you would oh you 're the judges mm-hmm I might sing a mandarin though Thank You counsel for the opportunity for us to come along today and put a voice to our submission which is to help and for the repair of the avery park pad and hall and toilet facility and we represent that Avery house and mothers and babies coffee group we meet on a Wednesday morning and that 's run by Rachel curry as a volunteer for those of you that are unfamiliar with the location of Avery parking house we 're in the inner northeast of the city beside the River Avon and Avery has dates back to 80 and 85 and is a ground Victorian house currently operating as a community center in an english park setting and was owned by the council since nineteen forty eight the children 's Paul 's pretty established and the pool of play area was a focal point for many family gatherings throughout the summer therefore is an established canceled facility and heritage institution and it should be the council 's responsibility to restore it to its former glory and in doing so will reconnect our community we got onto the submissions at very short notice so literally within the last week of the submissions closing online we managed to rally ran and get over 100 signatures on a petition we had twenty long-term submissions made online where he had lots of support via various wait Facebook sites we also joined naval a website and support through there and support Jess generally from word of mouth and getting out there and talking to the locals certainly when I went out and did the petition signing I 've found that there was many a multi-generational stories of Avery house fond memories of people going there as children with their own children or their grandchildren even so by saving this Paul you 'll not only helped build fond memories for a new generation but you 'll also our community our we believe that memories and connectedness build a sense of pride in one 's neighborhood and community pride helps build safe and bought five neighborhoods Oh other research bring out the reasons that we should have the panic or fix is that it and brings the community together it gives the children something it helps me to do there 's an increasing number of young families in the area and the development of housing New Zealand in everything cousins avenue and the richmond as a wider area there are low-income families which need local facilities busing is not easy with young children and the bus routes aren 't necessarily direct and it 's the cost and the hassle so you really need to have somewhere within walking distance in the richmond area mother will be able to pram over absolutely along the bumpy river we 're also there is a bigger picture here at avery house as well we 're currently creating a community garden on studying horticulture and permaculture at the moment so this is a bit of a slant on that the community garden is volunteers that come along and this brings together again local residents enjoying the outdoors we get to chat and learn educate obviously grow vegetables and there 's lots of preschools and kindergartens in the area want to come down and enjoy the house enjoy the grounds the playground the community garden and the house is very very accommodating as well allow us to use their facilities because the toilet block isn 't operating at the moment in the playground and we can have cups of tea so they 've been great in making us feel welcome and so the possibilities of the avery has and parker endless we believe this should be an opportunity that the council should embrace it 's a sound investment for very little input you will get maximum output and the vision going forward could be that Avery historical house beside the River Raven is linking the city to see corridor connecting communities along the way and utilize this landmark to bring together the energy along the river and the evening communities I do nicely with things like the food forest sidewalk where the river greening be a physical hub to represent the river corridor and I think if people can see things happening in our neighborhood it 'll create enthusiasm and I think that would be infectious people it 's well overdue in the east now that people want to see momentum and see things happening so I think I 'll facility works in hand in hand with the metropolitan Christchurch City and plans going forward to regenerate the city we 're not an isolated community we 're quite sensual so and I 'd like to see us with a brand side in the future we should be in a trap attraction we should have likened ourselves to the likes of Mona Vale and vikatan bush and we are historic and you should hold on to the fact that we are an old historical building with with memories and great Frenchman and great fruit trees got lemon tree walnut trees trees and as I say there is a bigger picture here so the pool is just something that can branch out to many other projects along the river tie it all together and we 'll strengthening communities and we 've had grace come out to see us and we 've got an appointment to go and present in front of them in a couple of weeks time expert well I 'm sorry but we 've got where it C so quite a small parts not a much money to fix it we I haven 't seen any geotech reports or reports as to what what it costs to fix and believe that 's something which we can we can look into but I don 't think it 's the same sort of costs as some other facilities actually fairly major yeah I know Avery Avery house very well yeah beautiful it is beautiful yeah and my sudden y 'all_''_420.929 had a wonderful time playing in that pool hate to think that my new one would miss out I 'm sure we can arrange a working be to get some other work done towed to help yeah yeah absolutely we had a number of community organizations that have come here and they 've said look we understand the financial situation but we you know but actually up a trust we 're going to fundraise we 're going to put on our own labor we 've got actually we 've got assets in the community we 've got husbands and wives engineers and no fears other covers yeah so I mean there 's a lot that can be done in a community anyway and then the council just simply becomes a partner rather than a funder and I think that 's much better I think so the geotech thing is the important thing you won 't want to fix things until you know what you 're standing on them absolutely yeah excellent well thank you very much and I 'm not sure it 's jessica to hell here no so it was our last presentation before afternoon tea so you will just have a shop right here we had a short lunch break so if we we break now and if we 're back here we could start a

geography I was told that the central part of America would be a desert in 50 years that was well over 50 years ago and it isn 't they got that wrong another thing that the job has got wrong social of big blocks of flats in central London being blown up blown up because they didn 't work socially they became dens of iniquity and crime and children could not be supervised in there in the playgrounds that were sort of meters below and parents couldn 't look at them I 've given you this front page of the addington times which I actually produce but I didn 't have enough time to give you a whole copy we 've just got the front and that 's an example in christchurch of a decision that 's gone horribly wrong for us in addington it was a decision to close access along lindt lincoln road into Hadley Avenue and I haven 't written follow up yet but the follow-up will say things like the traffic problems are so terrible and they lack of signals and crossings and so forth are so bad that you stand there any afternoon and they 'll be a guaranteed accident every hour half hour somebody saw three accidents in half an hour at the at the crossing road where there are no lights and it 's no access straight up the road and if you look at the third paragraph I 'm looking at the people who will not be here who will not be giving their views but who I hope to suggest are many and varied in the background there they 're suffering from ill health they couldn 't get here because they 're on Walker 's they can 't walk very far they have to be driven and they aren 't they don 't have cars somebody has to drive them some volunteer has to drive them some examples from addington of the people who are really suffering because of what 's happened businesses are going bust a nerve three in the last year who 've gone bust of the people in the magazine shop who who came from central city where they had a shop there that was doing very well they were pursued by by the people who were the landlords there who still wanted rent for a business that wasn 't there then they were pursued by the landowners in addington who wanted to put the rates up the ripped-up 've gone hope they 've taken their business home with them they hope it will still run but they were living on their old age pension they were making absolutely nothing from it because the last council not you thankfully allowed so many bars to open in lincoln road and didn 't insist that they had parking they magazine shop who used to be in a little sort of area that had parking around it found that all the people going to the bars would park in their parks which they were paid for and leave Rhea cars sometimes all night there 's one person I 'd like to tell you about who is an ordinary middle-class not a poor person middle-class person who has contributed all his life he 's lived in Christchurch a long time his wife died not long after the earthquake his beautiful house was compromised I don 't know to what extent but he was living in it for three years suddenly the powers-that-be got round to deciding that they would fix it they got to the point of knocking everything down except the framework can see the outline of the house but there is no house they come across a problem they didn 't tell him about the problem for three months he suddenly found out by which time insurance for his rental property has gone he has no money left he 's using his savings and he is one of those people who is going to be hit if Christ Church has to put the rent rates up and and make people the ordinary people of Christchurch pay and he 's unfortunately he 's been saying I hope I don 't last that long he 's about 85 now so I 'm asking you why are you making these decisions think very carefully who you 're making them fall and how are you going to write the responses and there 's something about how the responses were ranked in this little episode and i think it was really badly done i 've also got a background in research and I 've spent half my teaching life teaching people how to go about doing a research and how to make sense of it for at the teachers college it 's all your fault he didn 't do any research okay so I think you 're doing this for the citizens of Christchurch hey target out hey Dante hey danica and who do you consider that to be to the citizens of Christchurch is not the government the government has an agenda it 's not the property developers developers they are trying to make money out of this blank canvas that somebody is creating it not debris rebuild intimus I moved from addington I was very happy there until next door a whole load of Irish laborers came and had continuous parties day and night when they weren 't working not very pleasant it 's not a consultants the consultants are in it for the business of making a name for themselves and obviously getting a lot of money because you get paid highly as a consultant it 's not big business from overseas and another thing it is not the university lecturers who come along and tell you that this doom and gloom is about to before they are also into making a professional they can manage to grab a headline and it can be relayed on the news that you 've done this research even if the headline is misleading then that puts your status a bit crazy during I really am reluctant to interrupt but we 're well over the five minutes and I had allowed that because we didn 't have an eczema to hear but an eczema they had arrived so like is there is something that you just like really final message I would like you to help people recover from the earthquake and stuff at the bottom and go up not stuff at the top and go down I would like you to make this a viable city to live in and don 't think of bread and circuses all the time in the short term don 't aim to make this a city with world-class set of buildings that so-called center convention center looked to me worse than anything I 've seen in less radiant Vegas don 't enhance politicians prestige don 't make developers rich and don 't make land or property rental owners rich either charging exorbitant sum from the ordinary bottom layer of Christchurch going to cause a lot of misery thank you very much for your submission and it 's very much appreciated could I could I invite kefi is it Kathy Alden _"

    "text": "hello I 'm just here as a resident of New Brighton with a few complaints I wonder if I 'm at the right place but however first of all mineral maintenance of New Brighton is practically nil it was a volunteer group picking up rubbish in the shopping area and the general state of the streets and the side channels isn 't the best and also with a bunch of freedom campus packed up by the pier or they were I don 't really think they should be there but to keep the place a bit tidy and the side channel site selling my street it 's got a little cabbage tree growing in it one outside my house I don 't know how I 'll never be before they clean it up and also that my main complaint will not complaint my main problem is the bridge which you 're not going to rebuild I understand well I really feel it should be rebuilt and be prepared to plaque pay seven million dollars to do something to Victoria Square which really doesn 't need anything done to it and of the main exit entry to it to a suburb so I can 't see why that money can 't_''_108.109 be spent on building the bridge anybody who drives over it all know what it 's like very bouncy and horrible and also there are an awful lot of old broken-down houses around you brighten that that I don 't know them along Marine Parade they were brought up I think a lot of them by people who are hoping to put in high-rise apartments well that 's gone by the board to ever be any of those built on anything and so can 't the council do something about getting rid of them or making people tidy them up and I just wonder if it should perhaps be a warrant of fitness for houses it 's the place it 's a great suburb to live in your brightness it 's warmer than the city it 's got clean areas parks and and lovely walks or set view beautiful views from the Sandhills if you get up on top of them plenty of reserves which I hope nobody 's going years and I hope to spend the rest of my life there and I hope to see a new bridge before I die thank you that 's about it thank you and has anyone got any questions no I don 't think they will have 93 and I won 't be there much longer but we know that frightened people are tough I 'm just in relation to the general maintenance and tidiness of Brighton and you mentioned the cabbage tree growing out of the stream little one little get bigger I know they get bigger and would it be helpful if we just plan or schedule a regular maintenance day in Brighton or something like that that actually gets deals with those issues because we 've had that told to us a number of times yes I I don 't know who 's supposed to look after the places they usually be a depo council meeting at us not now and I just keep the place tidy somebody should be doing the work but nobody is it has anyone feedback to you why the bridges not been dealt with I asked for a report on it because I thought that they 've been a lot of you know commentary about it and the different submissions that we 'd received like the one that you filled in there was a a full replacement bridge scope and done but what they what they discovered was that well what they decided was that and this was the three client organizations which were basically the Christchurch City Council the transport authority and the and Sara they decided that the trouble was and aligning of it the rebuilding of it was going to realign it but through residential red zone land so until they know what they 're doing with the residential red zone land they 're not a hundred percent sure about you know that you know the proper approach and and everything so what they decided was that they would do a minimum repair to keep the bridge going so that 's they 're going to spend four hundred and sixty-six thousand well we 've got that on budget for repairing the bridge and then fully replacing it I think I think no no no no no she 'll be still alive in but the point that I 'm making is is that I mean if it 's better to repair the bridge in the meantime while you decide what is going to happen to the shape of the roads and everything on the other side isn 't it better to repair the bridge now rather then actually replace it with in the ten ten year time frame if you don 't know yeah if you don 't know where it 's going to go so the bridge will be repaired but it will be fully replaced at the end of the ten year period which is not on the LTP does the heavy did they have a area where they were going to put it before the earthquake so they had landed they scoped it not before the earthquakes after the earthquake they scoped a full replacement and they were going to a completely realign up with the road so they 're going to close access to what Broder 's are them you know the roads no they were going to pages road which would improve safety by minimizing the conflict between road users so but none of that 's been decided yet because we have to go through a full community consultation on the future of the roads and we have to have discussions about whether we 're moving the stop banks because if we can move the stop banks further into the residential red zone then actually we can lower them which is actually less costly and actually creates a new flood plain which actually increases the capacity of the river and flood so none of these things are simple Angela and none of these things are the novel being decided because of cost some of them are being decided because actually it 's better to repair and keep the rest of the life of the bridge and play while other decisions are being made about what we 're doing with the residential red zone and the stormwater management and the realignment of the roads all of which require community consultation yeah then you know try to get a Denny something on it just the few i 've represented draft plan but that submission didn 't include those interdependencies such as the future alignment a talked about the safety of the bridge along with the two-foots trio we 're definitely making the bridge safe and i don 't want anyone to think that the repair of the bridge will leave that bridge unsafe yeah it has absolutely been closing lot more uncomfortable and unsafe it is absolutely I look I used to live on big city and I used to cross that bridge every day and in fact I cross that bridge on the twenty-second of febri and it was pretty bad it yeah so but thank you very much and I think everyone 's heard the message about the quality of the environment and you brighten our sure that we 're going to be able to expiry a most attractive suburb if he got busy on it 's a great suburb it 's fantastic we love New Brighton now that 's the whole that 's the whole hat thing you know the slogan that we have four new brighton yeah oh well thank you very much thank you Kathy _"

    "text": "raymond Clark isn 't here am i right so that means you Oscar it 's your turn ah scalpers I 'm rather used to things taking longer than they should also wait you 're only just slightly ahead of time i am here really just too I 've voice to those who urge the council to follow a slower course and hang on to it that some vestments and it 's an effective argument that you put something aside for a rainy day and and then in drawn upon a rainy day well but sounds appropriate but it wasn 't actually put aside for a rainy day it was the acquisition of strategic assets that were important to Christchurch and if the rainy day was the earthquakes I kind of agree with that as well but it 's the rainy day really the management failure here at trusted City Council to adequately ensure the council 's asses and it 's not a cause for which I would care see us losing what was brought up over quite a number of years I particularly wanted just to to mention one is port company something I 've had a long association with I think I was a director of it for eight years as a City Council of pointy but my first involvement with it was a seagull world casual water cider back in the 1960s when I was university student I my father was a close friend of Mr cash on who was Ward engineer who I 'm Cashin key I i was on the transitional committee in 1988 probably most of you don 't know this but the the port was privatized and the littleton port company established and i think it was 1988 and the transitional plan initially prepared what did provide for the shears to beast and the local authorities but in the meantime they were held bud lyttelton harbour board and the littleton have ward thought that the local authorities were the worst possible owners of the port and in the Harvard Ward had a plan to to sell down all the shares in the port company prior to amalgamation of 1989 and I think I can honestly claim that it was due to to John Gray us we argued that the Littleton how Ward held those years and Trust for the the new councils of which will be formed on October 1989 and and the harbour board abandoned us has planned to sell down those shares I was involved with quite a significant effort and the mid mid 90s I 've just had been able to research exactly when it was but the the port company after making capital distributions actually was short of capital and oshiro she was raised and in the course of that crash at City Council decided to take up all the required she is the extent that other local authorities wouldn 't_:_318.73 and it was a smart move at the time and and got the city council into a position where it held a clear majority of the shears only on the port company and it 's been a good investment and will continue to be a good investment I I felt proud of the council that got its shareholding and the in the airport up to seventy-five percent was originally fifty percent the government agreed this is back in the government 's share and then I see weddington with that SIA port now effectively in the hands of them fertile but it 's not as if that relieves the brat pairs that the Lincoln Airport company has its hand out the survival parties for the money to extend that see it 's runway and increase the capacity of at the airport I think it was a tragic decision made here not to retain that see a port so I can 't offer you any wisdom on the solution there I 've really picked up what those who 've been arguing that strikes a fontes of chord with me that they just just taken at a slower pace because I think I think we 've lost a lot of opportunities for quickly restoring Central City and doing putting things back together at a slower pace asst is the more logical thing to do thank you very much much appreciated always good to see you and it was interesting to listen to that today history to I 've I haven 't heard the word seagull for a very long time it 's the UM Margaret Coghill _"

    "text": "Oh welcome good afternoon yeah calculus thank you this opportunity to speak to you um in my few minutes i have i 'm here to talk about two governor 's by jesse and the fact that we 're going to save it exel currently it is an asset that is on a spreadsheet somewhere that says that the council is not going to spend any money restoring it but um I 'm part of the fur the border of a new trust governors of a jetty restoration trust and you will be hearing from that trust later in the week but I was so compelled a bit about the needs to do something about the jetty that I 've put in a my own submission and I have my supporters here with me it 's that yes so the governor 's very jesse is an icon and is unique in its 300 meter length into the lyttelton harbour it 's an icon of Governors Bay it 's on the badge of the school it 's on the fire service emblem it 's an icon of the lyttelton harbour and there of banks peninsula now of course many things have been damaged and lost to do the earthquakes but it is to me it 's not an option to dismiss the jetty as a written off asset there 's a huge swell of support from the community and across the suburbs across the peninsula and across christchurch we have I think near on a thousand people have signed a petition we have a website I 've got a lot of support and a lot of people wanting to help with funding and the chassis holds a very special place in thousands of people 's hearts locals and visitors and is also now um you know part of the head-to-head walkway which is being promoted and yet if we don 't do anything about the jetty it 's just going to be this fenced-off dilapidated ugly thing that isn 't going to be a very good reflection on on you know them what what we can do as a city in a community to restore things and also personally I have pledged to my children like we overlook the jetty house looks to my children that I will save it save the jetty and hence you 're forming the the trust which you will be hearing from and then the idea of course we all appreciate that times its height in terms of money but often hear that the council has no money we hear this expression which is clearly not true because we all pay our rates so what we 're proposing to do is to form the part in agreement with the council and we think we 've got a very good submission in there some very good structure and we 're looking forward to presenting that to you but like i said i 'm here today on a personal basis and it 's it 's it 's a case of the more you hear from different groups about about something then i guess for you all the more the more you can understand the importance of you know of saving the jetty okay well you know what i loved about your submission I like the checkbox I 'm prepared to help the governor 's Beijing restoration trust raise funds a partnership to counsel to restore the GE I mean it just sounds like a when one doesn 't it yes good pauline and you could on you um I assume you 've got quite a few skills over the unit community who may be able to what who 've you got em all names what kind of yes that 's a very good question on the on the on the trust itself there 's about eight of us there 's myself am a chartered engineer we have a lawyer we have communications people we have people that are involved in management people that there 's a person who 's sort of led their main role is the fact that they 've they 've lived in the bay or in the air about 40 years so they know everything and everybody you know about the about the area and when we 've when we 've gone to say littleton market and we had a stall to raise the race fans the people they 're like magnets people know them there 's a one of them Sir the CEO from living gotta give e whose night you know the Gabi 's valley is a the family neighborhood so we 've got we just got this multifaceted group of people that came together and and it 's been brilliant so far the way we 'd be able to coordinate and manage to get the trust set up and the website set up and and getting that getting in we 've had submission from Robinson 's Bay GD was it yesterday they don 't know yes um and there 's also charged us by a church base re yeah so I suggest that maybe all you off you people get together as well and and compare notes and in progress and you might be able to help other network as well yes it 's real we are learning from I 've got some friends who are associated with with one of the other jetties and they 've they 've explained how they enough to set up an arrangement with the council to do with them covering design aspects of it so yeah this site as I each community in their own jetty they 's slightly different ways that people have been able to coordinate negotiate that journey yes well thank you very much look the trust is coming later in the weekend there 'll be more time for questions on that I 'd like to thank you and I 'd like to think your support team for coming along today in presenting to the council but perhaps the support team would like to say how much they support the GT you very keen for dads trusters to save the GT yeah yep and do you love it too yeah yeah okay that 's a big grown up on this get your names or even offer them in session and setia well thank you ruben and setia in thank you very much for coming here today thank you for listening okay so i think i

's here really I just wanted if there was tight yeah because this is a really important topic and we 're going to seminars and later as well as the main battle for this so important oh good now sorry I 'm I haven 't turned to it yet so page 139 all the integrative a statement yeah I 've found this submission very interesting so yeah I 'm just going to make a unilateral decision to give you 10 minutes said all right ah is that all it wasn 't it was gonna be it was gonna be five thank you very much for hearing my submission I take it that really scans what I these several pages I wrote yep my name is dr. matthew hughes I 'm an academic and research at the University of Canterbury by training on the climate change scientist and the earthquakes have deformed the ground in Christchurch and damaged all the pipes under the ground I 've been working very closely with your technical staff here at the Croatia City Council and also very closely with the stronger Christchurch infrastructure rebuilt team so I know a little bit about this general field around climate change and earthquakes and natural hazards in general and I 'm particularly concerned about the potential effects of global sea level rise and how that 's going to exacerbate the relative sea-level rise that 's already occurred in Christchurch and will don 't talk about this in a minute how it may impact into the future it 's quite a bit of detail of my submission also I provide references in there to the work of contributed to and the public we 've been working on around these issues I won 't go into most of those any detail but there are two things that wish to reiterate or emphasize from my submission the first one is the proposed asset management information system so this is the information technology that is proposed to manage the other things like that as I say in my submission this isn 't just a data repository for normal day-to-day operations from the council and doing the financials and costs of day-to-day management and those sorts of things this is potentially a fascinating and valuable research tool that be in the research community can collaborate with your dignity at swith to do detailed spatial and temporal modeling of the interdependencies and vulnerabilities of the city 's infrastructure we at the university already have access to some of your datasets we 've got agreements with the council to access those the current system is extremely unwieldy and we hope to make certain improvements around that I think in the infrastructure strategy that you put out you made you had a particular section on this I can I gather that that reflects the importance that you place upon this I want to let you know and also I will be speaking to your staff around this as well that we in the research community very keen to collaborate with the development of the system at least from this perspective of how the so communities will benefit from such an integrated system simply because we hope to make any understandings of interdependencies between systems for example the Act rissa T system and the pressurized pumped water supply those vulnerabilities in inter PMC 's the more we can realistically understand how they 've been maybe knocked out in future earthquakes and tsunami and future flood events and those sorts of things hopefully it will provide some resilience to the city system going forward or at least we will be able to inform managers and decision-makers the best we can about the realities around these things it 's an IT thing it has a potential to be blowout and being insanely expensive I think we all understand that around IT systems that 's completely unnecessary I am part of a team at the University of Canterbury were based there that recently was warded 22 million dollars for a five-year program to understand the impacts of earthquakes in New Zealand to make New Zealand a safer place to protect our buildings communities part of that is around data and confusion systems and I am the lead 're very keen on delivering editing some cut through around delivering information and technology systems to understand data so we there 's a lot a waste that can occur with 13 projects we 're going to try and cut through that as much as possible and I 'd like to say to you today there would be very open to having discussions about how we can integrate some information and data you 'll be managing into this wider program and we can feed back into it the second thing I need to talk about sea level rise the suit is dropped through earthquake through liquefaction and subsidence when going to the details of that yeah around the world coastal communities are facing deep issues with relative sea-level rise historically and up until absence from now these issues have occurred in the absence of sea level global be called climatic global sea level rise because of many coastal communities and landscapes the ground naturally subsides and sandy and silty places by rivers around the world I 'm just the way to the sediments so they sort of compressed themselves and landscapes and depositing sediments in these areas naturally replenish the ground surface and so when people sensibly build stop banks and flood protection measures they actually stop the sediment going into those landscapes as well this can actually enhance the subsidence going on can 't really criticize that because it 's also stopping the photograph is getting in stat home the other things that cause landscapes to subside on coasts as people extract in ground water and oil and gas and so that 's a expert jeanette human-caused subsidence that increases the enhances the vulnerability to flooding and coastal flooding to these areas we now know through the canterbury earthquake sequence that earthquakes also caused landscapes of science so this is a natural process and those areas where we build cities on these areas are vulnerable to increase flooding and civil risks so if the ground drops that means the high tide is going to penetrate further inland and that 's what we call relative sea-level rise so that 's what we 've seen in Christchurch the plants plant communities around the ester ER telling us this we have quantitative data by all the relevant people in Christchurch my concern is looking ahead within the time frames of the lifetimes of the new pipes and other pump stations going into the ground is that the communities living on little coastal landscapes might not be viable within the time frames or the lifetimes of the infrastructure itself we don 't have any information around this I have to say this is largely conjecture we play the movie in our head are the information we have suggest that this is going to be the case but I am part of the wider team of people who are seeking money from funding agencies to research this in depth we 're going to monitoring the saltiness and the levels of the ground water under the city over time you 're going to integrating that with detailed computer modeling of hell June 's and other landscapes going to change through time and try and understand how that 's going to inflict influence sorry the pipes under the ground I won 't talking you more about that here because i understand through christie williams that you can with you people along with the econ commissioners i believe that 's going to be in early june and so we have a couple of hours to unpack these issues in more detail and where we can discuss the strategies and approaches we 're going to have to try and quantify this a situation I will say though that a lot of these issues at the moment are largely speculation and as I say there 's a frustrating convergence of certainties around certain things and complete absence of information around others so you guys are in the position of having to make decisions and information vacuum and by the time we have any scientific certainty about a lot of the things I 'm talking about your decisions around infrastructure maintenance and development will ever wear even made and will have to live with the consequences of that so let 's talk about this in more detail at another time thank you very much for giving me ten minutes but I guess we 've got a moat and a half way up anyone has any questions thank you very much okay 't have time beyond that okay thank you very much and we are going to have it you 're going to come to that session oh I 'll be there yeah I appreciate the depth of work you 're involved with my concern really ice person you 've used a couple of words around here subjective come member what the other can 't accept consider in the future and and and some things are question am I concern really i supposes around the science that we need to have actually some some dippin obscurity around it because we have a whole community that are getting very nervous very upset very whole hug the other words about their 10-year their future and their community and when we are discussing things that such as this that have a high degree of of long-term effect on on our communities I would really be much more confident if we had a lot more certainty around these outcomes and to be putting this of information out now that 's that 's an issue for me if I wasn 't a question it was a statement I 'm earlier on I said there I was going to try and share questions around because it was such a you know narrow one day but I think that I think David 's right to raise the issue because every time we 've had people come and make submissions on different components of how the city 's planning around brighton which is the coastal community but i 'm talking right to the spot of south shore and right the way up to the really the Waimakariri river there are huge tensions around the the fact that you know people think they 're going to be forced into a position of off and they use the phrase managed retreat which is a phrase that tonch and Taylor used in one of their reports when in fact we 've got to start talking the language of adaptation of living with our natural environment but also learning to understand the science and what I took from your submission is that there isn 't valuable signs that the University of Canterbury is very very willing and open to share with the people of David was saying was that there are so many uncertainties out there and people fearful of the impact that will have on their homes I think he was just asking for it to be for that to be taken into account when communications occur and I think that 's fair enough I I completely agree with everything you say don 't shoot the messenger though no no no no and it 's a and so we in the scientific community there 's a well-developed body of research and understanding now about science communication and conveying uncertainty but I am a natural hazard scientist fundamentally I see this room has its perspective so there 's a wealth of information of approaching this particular climate issue from natural hazards perspective just like we do with liquefaction and earthquakes in general and other natural hazards like that we do not want to make people scared or unduly worried conversely the last thing we want to do is have people being complacent yes and and to have business as usual approach to market forces and regulation which puts people at risk Bixley yeah so completely understand your concerns I also understand how messaging can influence insurance and markets around certain things but again we are very at cognizant of this and and certainly I am but that cannot be an excuse for not putting information out there so you wouldn 't repeat no that 's right and and how we message there and work with our communities because there 's a lot of local knowledge you know I remember the first bexley meeting that we did since you use bexley after the September earthquake the number of older people who said it should never have been built they knew more than the developers did yep yes that 's right and as a final message we this is not about pointy-headed ivory tower types dictating information expecting the plebs to respond but it 's not how we work anymore used to be like that I 'm each chemical couple of mentions about the arms broker of policy alternatives is the philosophical scientific approach we try to have and socially controversial issues and so we are part of the other community as well I pay taxes and but what that what that means is that we have to acknowledge your own biases and imperatives and the things that drive us all of us and sit around the table and Thresh the information out and empower comparisons about forcing people off their land or managed retreat it 's about getting people to at least be aware of the universal choices which they now have and if I can do any anything around and cruise increasing people 's choices that they have then that 's why I 'm yeah well your comment have justified the choice that I made but I also understand that phil has a question too so I 'll just let Phil us the final question thank you and that is very helpful what your comments just now as well and with you and like I 'm clean impressed it 's a collaborative type scientific research that 's being done with other disciplines and I heard your presentation that they were the cross imagens organized for the one but i just wanted in terms of that i wonder if you could answer this now or prefer the presentation but it 's what 's been raised at different times by submitters is i guess it 's the aspect of the sand dunes and my question really is how can we check out the importance of those in relation to future prevention not only of sea level rise it 's a particularly tsunami now i 'm not sure if you among among the team of presenters with it you 're because i personally qualifications you 're a natural hazards scientists but so no question really is should you answer that now or should we work too let 's unpack those issues at our workshop very happy to arm i 'm not an expert in specifically june morphology but my colleagues are ya and so we can unpack those things then look that excellent maybe thank you very much thank you that very very helpful submission thank you i 'm nick howard _"

    "text": "yes so if we could move on to William whole be good afternoon good afternoon welcome well that 's bill unpaid bill that 's not very important right now suburban rail I 've had the advantage or disadvantage of having all expenses paid trips to European and Australian cities all expenses paid by me and I pay attention to railways because in the 1950s I was engaged in fitting automatic train control on British Railways for a couple of days so I know a little bit about royal what amazes me is that round all cities of the size of Christchurch and the size that Christchurch is likely to grow the railway tracks that our predecessors very kindly late for us are in use and round Christchurch they 're not in use hmm we have towns like Rolleston for example which were built as a satellite town when you see people coming in to work or going home from work to and from rolla stand there stuck in traffic jams very very inefficient and I just hate waste and inefficiency because it means money is being handed over to someone because I couldn 't let myself get horrified when I saw that the council had had a report saying that to fix up the line from reggae or and kaiapoi would be ten million dollars it 's a joke ladies and gentlemen we don 't want to build a world-class railway for a start we could even get the people from ferry meet to show us how trains could be run between rang e Ora and Christchurch the developers here are saying that parking in the city is going to be a problem when the central city is rebuilt why on earth not let people have what the now the phrase is ride and puff park and ride you have to set up car parking air is at the satellite towns towns like springston if you like Sheffield rolleston all the way outside there and put in rail units don 't buy new ones test run it by buying second-hand units leasing them if you like put it up to tender Auckland they 're going to have plenty of second-hand diesel units which we can make sure they give us of fuel efficient as road traffic and it produces one-sixth of the amount of co2 that road traffic does New Zealand supposed to be clean and green it 's one way of sort of working in that general direction why it isn 't being done I can 't imagine we don 't need to build railway stations at these satellite towns that 's 19th century we just simply have holtz platforms we don 't even have guards and ticket collectors on rail units which simply have a machine you put in your money your card get your ticket out when you get into town there are turnstiles when you 're getting off at the Central Station if you haven 't paid you have to play there it works perfectly in Adelaide I 'm a great admirer of the Adelaide rail system when you go in there in the morning there 's all the kids are on the way into university or into school it saves an awful lot of road traffic obviously the roads are still full of cars and trucks and stuff like that but it does take something beast making a start a small start don 't spend a lot of money but make a small start on suburban rail for Canterbury I think it 's absolutely essential it 's cheaper it 's more efficient let 's have a go of it I 've given this talk to sell when Annie can 't and God why baby I just clicked having lived I thought you were saying he can 't you know I used to live at occur we and I was amazed i see that railway track passing there with nothing on it nothing hello don 't you questions if fellow thank you Bill by suburban rail do you mean light rail rather the wider Gaugin know you usually existing I 'm not interested in light rail frankly that 's an inner-city that 's fine but I 'm doing our separate suburbs within the city safe from yeah Saudi or frost use the existing tracks make us start with their yeah and as I say don 't use new rail units use something that 's already been tested so long as it 's well guaranteed when we know like we 've talked about that the new station at addington you know that big butter lane land on more house at the moment that 's actually available where do you think the train should come too well as near the center of the city so that it can pick up city you know commuter buses or whatever when it gets there yep yep we 're so lucky that the layout is it already love this Jeep it wasn 't even shattered by the earthquake go to the bus interchange thank you very much yeah thank you very good very helpful thank you Nick Howard _"

    "text": "pet broker hello Willis won 't take five minutes I 'm doing this just for experience for ya so but thank you for this opportunity to speak to my very brief submission that I did he not so my name is Pat Brooke I 've been involved in the central city since 1993 I had a small restaurant south of the border for 13 years and I 've been living in the city since 2001 so I 'm quite committed now I do believe in the old adage of saving for a rainy day and certainly the earthquakes could be seen as a rainy day so I 'm not against asset sales per se but i do believe any savings we 've made should be use very valuable things and not just squandered on fans which i see a new stadium considering our existing one is seldom filled or ever filled or a big convention center which is unlikely to pay its way so please be very careful about what you do sell existing assets for it 's always seemed to me very good that we 've ownership and therefore at least leave Orion a line and it doesn 't also seem to me to be making much sense and selling this valuable assets prior to knowing exactly when we 'll need the expenditure when and how much they little exact it costs us and i just added an extra I noticed on one of the plans with going to do big at heart enhancements on the council 's IT system got anything about that but this is really necessary I ask you so we 're a small town so please let us consider smaller projects first after of course the essential horizontal infrastructure which I would think was worth selling it seats four just like to add two other bits and one of social housing I 've always been very grateful and proud to live in a town which kids the people who could not always pay their own way in a very commercial world so please consider what we doing to ourselves as a community if we sell off social housing simply to fit in with the current government 's agenda market forces theology and then finally is the forever news I 'd really like to express my concerns over what life will be like for us here we love the initial drawings of dwellings on top of officers retail and general the mixing up of business retail residential but they 're now the things be a real reluctance on the part of developers to do this because they see the high costs of doing fireproof and and other such things installation so a couple of projects have fallen by the wayside and of course we 're also very concerned that parking will be impossible in this area there 's no on-site parking requirements for all new developments new residential developments and the area just isn 't served by public transport it 's very poor and I suppose we would also hope that maybe the area would develop sort of organic tea if it 's the word naturally not these big artificial precincts we can 't see how that 's going to make it friendly and the final thing I just like to say as I really do miss the Centennial pool but to go on now so my husband he reminds me every day so yes so no please stay because sorry might have solutions for you well I don 't think so i think was very general submission but we all have to add our you 're on foot ok now look their best fine thank you very very much much appreciated thank you for reading now I think Clive cousins as he arrived you _"

    "text": "boswell hmm we actually should have had the South Brighton team up together I think it 's a lot of us who had a coat oh and thank you and mia leone and my original submission was originally about what was printed by the sports ripped apart the department about the land that the camp sits on in fact that they needed to close the camp down so you can imagine the trauma that caused to a lot of people when we read that because what they had put in their submission was complete and their proposal was completely wrong so we have done our research and we have worked really hard and actually bringing forth the important picture honest the fact of there at once again saying about the closure of the camp is a real concern because the first time that that came out from the council there was a letter written by the Commissioner of Human Rights who wrote to the council to say that this was not a productive or a respectful way to be dealing with this situation so common sense has prevailed and thank effort to find out what was really going wrong and are listening to what we had to say so the ones that came out and brave the rain well done and I noticed that we 're also talking about they did trees and the hedges that within the council that was not caused by the sea level coming up that was caused by the flood that we had and the flood was actually caused by the council workers who stuffed up the drain so the land is good and this is why we sit on it now I 've talked about common sense because smart business is about common sense so why would you close down a viable business that has ten thousand tourists nights a year that does not make good sense why would you close down affordable a place where affordable accommodation is bare for people who are rebuilding and building their homes this is sometimes the only place they are able to go to because every time you can guarantee the build is going to be or the repair is going to be longer than what they are able to use this and many times they actually wanted to stay in saleable you know I 'd rather be living here than where i 'm going to be going to live and why would you dispatch 21 families back into an arena where there is a housing shortage both rental and for buying houses that doesn 't make sense and why would you put people out of a job who already have one so congratulations and the fact that the decision is made at this point to close the clothes the camp but I would also say that because of how the sports and rec of written things up there 's no way we trust what they 're going to do next so we will be very vigilant and keeping an eye on Don as this goes down the track so I 'd like to give you the picture of why I am at this particular camp because we are subject quite often to a lot of covert prejudice of being somebody who lives in an ER and a camp I 've had the privilege of sailing around back and and to our beautiful new zealand I suppose surprises me and de-stresses me when I see people who have no concept of the ground that they 're walking on of what they 're looking at and where they 're living and how lucky that we are and in the area of the world that we live and in the country that we love so part of my looking at staying in a camp I actually went round every tenth in the Canterbury region I hired a care of N and did my research property because this is where i was going to retire in the lifestyle I was going to choose another reason for choosing this is I work presently as a district nurse I visit many homes where there 's a senior in that home a 23 and sometimes four bedroom homes by themselves and to me that is such a waste when those homes could be used for families they have every right to do that please don 't get me wrong it 's not what i was going to choose to do my most important four children of my 14 grandchildren and great-grandchildren occur in the country region and I promised them once I stopped gallivanting that I would be at their beck and call for children who are sick at school children to pick up children that could stay with me for the day put a meal on if it needed to be bringing the washing whatever I was going to be available to them and at this point in time I 'm able to do that and I would like to continue if you don 't mind and also i have it on a six year olds authority that i 'm the coolest grandmother in town because when they come down to stay to stay at my place they can go down and turn over rocks and find creepy crawlies they can go spot lighting in amongst the trees we can eat lunch on the beach and include sand and our sandwiches and these things are very important from beer perspective or go kayaking on the river or go swimming from my perspective it 's important from an environmental point of view to it as an environment of teaching them about the birds and the things that we have of how we control the piece so that these things continue so as a grandmother you know it 'smay it 's important to me that I am able to share that with them and it 's important in a community that we are doing that that this isn 't just a little piece of land in the middle of the peninsula it 's actually a very important part of a wider community and a whole environmental thing going on and it would be seriously foolhardy for us to consider shutting something like this down heaven forbid that we ever have another earthquake or an aftershock because I would more concerned about my children 's homes who will have busy rebuilding and building you know they 're going through how like most people are because my travel trailer just rock and roll 's so I don 't have that Prime afraid I hate to interrupt the coolest grandmother on earth but I was afraid I mean this is the trouble with the with the five you all afternoon well we 've had we have to we have heard the pleas of the South brush and motor camp residents and I hope that I mean I hear what you say around confidence on the process going forward and I 'm sure we will be as vigilant as as you will be but we are very grateful that you will be too so thank you very much and please note that we are number one on the wiki internet for the camping grounds and the Canterbury region did you realize that no okay that 's very good excellent thank you _"

    "text": "could I invite Mary Brennan forward please right good afternoon everyone I 'm actually here to talk about a very basic thing and that 's the increases to the general and rural rates and I 'll try and go as quickly as i can because been practicing to about 15 minutes and the remote that proposed nearly forty percent rate increase over four years and seventy-five percent over ten years the successful and a financial burden that ratepayers cannot afford ratepayers have their own earthquake expenses problems and a budget that they must live within many have a fixed income and most do not have the luxury of regular increases that keep pace with or surpass inflation or the proposed rate increases tenants to will be affected already high rents will be forced up even further the reality is council proposals and it came are asking that ratepayers go without to fund many schemes and dreams that are optional or can be delayed most do not have a spare a thousand dollars two thousand dollars or five thousand dollars each year and you seem unaware of this or the impact to believe that you are removed from the average person 's clothes that you think an eight percent yearly increase cumulatively closer to forty percent is okay the proposed increases to rate synced had been minimized by the media eight percent and fallen under the radar of Millie ratepayers my curiosity was piqued so I canvassed everyone I met most were unaware of the four-year rate increase proposal and when made aware thought it too much why did they not speak out two reasons really one didn 't know they were absorbed in their own lives and problems and would they really be heard would it make any difference a question I indeed asked myself while most appreciate councils predicament and insurance ways they are not in a position to fund counsel or Sarah aspirations council needs to live within its means like ratepayers have to I have seen two alternative budgets that show that this is possible a longer view 20 30 years is perhaps necessary the existing wish lists non-essential items and new spending needs to be cut significantly and or delayed the proposed changes to the rural top of everything creates a heavy financial burden rural properties are not urban property not be rated as such rural landowners should continue to pay a lower rate in recognition of the lower level of services provided by the council no footpaths sewers streetlights bus stops adjacent Park Service 's community facilities etc OHS criteria of rateable len value being more than two-thirds of the rateable capital value is not a transparent or a reliable marker of rural land use function in fact it is discriminatory towards new housing in smaller lend holdings on our eight acres it would allow us a maximum new world of two thousand and no two hundred and eighty thousand dollars not it 's quite unrealistic in today 's climate the age or relative value of the house is not an indicator of rural use a proposed changes to qualification criteria for rural rating differentials do not reflect the rural status all end use of a property five hectares is to arbitrary cutoff point this is unfair on smaller Holdings where farming activities are similar in our area these smaller holdings medium-sized 2.8 hippies are family body farming land use is a more pertinent measure and does occur on 224 hectare holdings the proposed criteria do not effectively reveal actual rule and use the proposed criteria are also inequitable the changes would see some neighbors living in the same area or road receiving the rule differential and others not for example one and a half million dollar house on six hectares would get the differential a 450 thousand dollar home on three point six hectares would not the cumulative total general and rural rate increase for us amounts to a hundred percent increase in rates over four years this is a financial burden which ultimately cannot be absorbed and will force people off the land that they have worked and lived on the decades is that the intent our rural ratepayers being overcharged for planned services works that seem to predominantly benefit the urban community in conclusion there is scope for considerable savings in the budget these should be explored council is too reliant on ratepayers for funding and needs to minimize future or age increases the general public needs to be consulted more directly prefer in common see it 's applied towards a need and a wish the existing proposed long-term plan creates future financial problems for ratepayers another way forward needs to be considered thank you thank you very much and I think you 'll find that we are listening and in making a submission does make a difference so thank you very much I think Sheila base it hasn 't arrived is that right so _"

working for so long as a sheer I will be selling at musculoskeletal these out of but Uncle epic things are going all right I never damage to the grounds in the liquidation of a minimum the ground showed no signs of lateral spreading cracking only more spots a bit location not a reason to close a Kent there years only once and that has the history broken its banks and flooded camp that was in March 1940 or one on one hundred year event the only reason the water broke the beach was due to the heavy machinery being used to fix the stormwater system and competitive and of course it would very unusual storm because of terrific sub early and that we 're making waves are without and norah 's hub and we were at that and it was absolutely looked like the peer down the end crashing over the top well there was no you know no we 're stopping but that there is a simple remedy because I 've done all sorts of work bulldoze riverbeds put in stock banks done all short now well it once it 's a meter foil any three on the back of that camp very simple job to do and it doesn 't have to go all around because the sand use that we connected into and that 's all it needs to stop the water coming in that camp is a very simple operation are being at this little life synchronously and she would rest homes up here I 'm from eshe good pride of adipose in this camp every year when wife and kids now I 've been there since nineteen sixty with my wife and children and I 'm bear to the state I wouldn 't be there from this was a good ten those times when you look into that camp and install the same when it comes around big holiday period times you have booked 12 months in advance to get in there you just can 't get in there it 's so popular that can and it 's been the most popular camp in Christ you I 'm going to camp avanta my own or ivory underwear in the South Island always a pleasure to come back to my camp which of the it 's the best camping crossed you so open them free and we 're all read about not chat on top of one another this lovely place woods are in summer you want to see it in snow time its list of wood or under lyne you know we ski don 't see it really at its best all time it 's a beautiful cat that it should never be shut I can gestures can 't imagine it a sign on the front of that gate so this campus flow they just believe business well that 's a problem business it 's destroyed in business and yet Brighton doesn 't need any business closed it wants them opening and you know Brighton are going to suffer because there 's a huge amount of tourist spending the dollars and tell my guests people you know that you know there 's going to be jobs lost to the shut now you just don 't do that merits sir let 's and I 've got be normal petitioners i 'ma talk to a lot of people there very badly affected by what 's going on this is called a great deal a distinction dream right that 's the sort of thing it was unnecessary I think as for the pricing of the fixing of that can see us greatly inflated and it 's actually looked as if you 've got built in six it 's going to be done over a period of time and it can be split up into the sections of oak make it look attractive enough to do not just say you know heap of money into something now sure nuff year you could put that anybody another if back tomorrow a ruling on board time there yep as far as the security of the camp you know we 're we play set clip yourself and we give a strict your honor and there 's a lot of you know things go on up back of us there 's women and kids and the people you know around the rule of time there we see some pretty shady character about the other ones out there there they 're everywhere now we get the police on that pretty smartly and it 's tied it up quick if it 's not we 're not there there 's going to be a sheer shoot a big risk the people of self right you know break-ins Tennis Club we were absolutely trashed they were worried about it they tell us about it they like the school is sort of mean to take into consideration now we kept getting boards the current management we 've got them now they 're absolutely breathing because they 're right up with computerization they have their contact all over the world they are tourists themselves have been and their business people now that I 'm here with money and like what 's all if you 've got money you want to make me you won 't you get your money on of business unless you 're making money they 're no different or anybody off but they are the people you want their if you get somebody awesome but they contacts all over the world that they on the computers going all the time they 're run very up with it the ideal people for you you know I think you should deal with them properly and get it all

    "text": "rich and Boyd hasn 't cleaned up so it will move to now refi Thank You Gretchen hi um my submission is about the South sprite in Holiday Park since I first what my submission in several weeks ago the situation has changed dramatically as you will be aware especially as of last Thursday when John pill sale was going to present his document that didn 't actually get to because we are also a Suzy asked about actually coming to terms with the situation and actually addressing the situation of doing something about it in the shorter term which I really really do appreciate some part of me that feels quite frustrated about the eight weeks of huge effort angst emotional etc etc that the residents of the camp have gone through to get to this point but certainly do appreciate all efforts on behalf of the counselors and the media and everybody else that has helped us to get to this point which is wonderful I 'm going to now just just one or two issues in John 4 cells seeing which I think a document which overall points that don 't really make sense item 2.3 this is that they 've been changes to the lens the camp is currently operating at limited capacity with the council providing temporary buildings now there 's two elements here at one is that it 's operating at maximum capacity or has been through the whole summer maximum capacity to the facilities available and also that the cost to the council of the temporary facilities mas could well have been interpreted as being quite unnecessary when the existing facilities were within three percent according to one engineer of the required percentage anyway moving so item 2.6 it says here in order to make a decision on the future of the camper council needs to fully understand the nature of the damage to its building excuse me how can you put forward a things saying it 's going to cost this much to rebuild something or remediate something if you actually net still needs to fully understand the nature of the damage surely they should have known the nature of the damage long before this document or even the little bit that that it would have been better to be a little ahead of her eight ball there given that the where am I sorry it 's I 've hit her I 'm sorry okay yeah okay going to item 3.2 oh sorry about this okay I 'm no that 's right my husband a big operation is today a little bit tired no Cheers mmm yeah yeah you 're tired yeah we can the council offices I have recently recently obtained an estimate for a quantum from a quantity surveyor that puts to reinstate buildings infrastructure and raise a portion of the campsite to mitigate some flooding risk as estimated as 3.4 million i 'm not sure witness was done was this report done sometime between the two points 3 23 million figure that was put into the draft long-term plan if so nobody living or administrating around the camp has any idea of when this report was done also the point where it says it 's the raising a portion of the campsite to mitigate some flooding risk and further down it does say that there has been reported significant South New Brighton Park were not new brighton park with the South New Brighton Moto camp and the geotech report that the lessee 's had done a cup of you weeks ago showed that there was little or no and a minimum a maximum of 100 millimeters up or down the nine hundred millimeters may refer to one building towards the back of the camp which was built by the previously seized at their own expense which is up on a great big to hi mita sort of bummed that it was put on that nine hundred mils of it did fall that much is still the highest point in the camp so I don 't see that that 's particularly relevant it 's also this 3.4 million doesn 't include the building 's owned by the operator or and it says it doesn 't include features such as trees hedges the pool the pool is a paddling pool about yay deep and about twice the size of this that has been operating perfectly all right for the last four summers I don 't know why I know it 's ridiculous to even think that it might be included and there 's nothing wrong with that right 3.4 I think I 've already covered that that 's pretty much what i want to say i think it is wonderful absolutely wonderful that the Leslie 's came back from their holiday on Thursday yesterday they watched last Thursday morning 's meeting and they were absolutely over the moon with the tone it took and the support from the counselors and from yourself the end and I say thank you very much and also special thanks to those counselors who made it through the thunderstorm and came out and visited us last week because we put an awful lot of effort into making it look good so thank you very much and I look forward to never having to talk to you again and staying living where I am yeah well take care and pass on our best wishes to your husband as well thank you um _"

    "text": "so look thank you for your patience and if we could have Cameron Bradley come forward please yes sir and please sit down yeah thank you it 's like join us at that hey all right thanks for the opportunity to let me speak today from my submission I 'm going to be kind of focusing on reshaping our city with a particular focus in mind so the rebuild of Christchurch has become a bigger interest to me as x flown by my two seams are going to be a little bit more towards the rebuild in the long-term plan but that 's because the rebuild is going to be a big part of the of the next 10 years I 'm not going to be commenting much on the financial stuff because I 'm not qualified to but I would like to tell you about my vision of Christ Church in a few years I 'd like Christchurch to work on over the next 10 years to support the development of a high-end business and tourist destination and so one of my two wants is a green city and to big changes around the world I 've just spent two weeks in China and there has been a big ironer to the fact that we really don 't know how lucky we are first there are items on the surface like the boat anak gardens in the frame we 're already doing really well with these but I 'm one area I 'd really like to see the community make any fit on as with the avon river one of the defining features of our city especially now with the avon river precincts revolving around it then those things below the surface namely our amazing water supply I think it takes however minor would be a good way to put the idea of water conservation to enter our heads and perhaps even generate a little bit of victory venue for the current shortfall I really like the idea councillor menti mentioned in Ebury about the quota system which would keep the keep who the techs might hurt the most relatively unaffected and the second item I believe is important now and in the future as entertainment this is industry too things like travel becoming easier and cheaper the natural human need for social interaction and more jobs having flexible working arrangements Christchurch lacks 20 good 24-hour spaces an attractive safe 24 hour zone could do wonders for Night Elves in Christchurch and and could include things like food outlets an internet cafe time zone a pool or snooker venue relaxing areas spaces for buskers or even a basketball court the square and some adjoining buildings could even be encouraged to be twenty four areas and help create the square into an area people could go day or night the proposed local alcohol policy concerned with unlicensed as an area i 'm particularly against now i am under the impression that more harm is caused at home than an establishment with security and more enforceable consequences for one 's actions I 've also noticed that in some types of venues namely dancing Clutton dancing nightclubs most people don 't leave until they 're either sobered up or forced to leave so later closing times would actually cause these patrons to leave more sober sorry i 'm not i should have the local alcohol plane okay yeah i can skip that section yep that 's a yeah well that 's all I 've got um I believe our beautiful environment in and top entertainment options can support Christchurch really well in create an environment that both us in the wider New Zealand can thrive them with high in business and tourists coming from a fire thank you great look I really liked your idea about putting more effort than to you know getting people 's ideas you know and and and feedback you know do you want to talk a little bit more about that because I mean you made the point that you know you 're one of few students who have actually taken the trouble to make a submission yeah well the the the sort of point I was I was coming it with with that one was being sort of students everyone 's all really really worried about what everyone thinks and so you know like getting out and actually talking to you guys to the council going to recently and you and a thing at uni coupla just not something that students like to be seen it so I 'm I think that may be there maybe it was just being rave just being played because it but maybe something which isn 't so obviously council related or anonymous or something some way to get the to get these people kind of talking with without without knowing that with that everyone else knowing that and yeah yeah I didn 't know but if that 's okay I mean it Ellie 's Elly 's got a quickly yeah don 't you think it lessens all weakens the position that someone is taking on something if they do it under the cover or in a secretive way I mean I wonder where the social media and the internet and things like that has meant that your generation is less comfortable with as you said put in your name two things how do we encourage you to do that because it 's important that you own it and that we know who you are and you know you 're weird yeah well I mean the reality is we all know the council and what they do but a lot of you know a lot of the people they won 't just won 't do anything about it and and I don 't know that yeah I don 't know the solution today on it i 'm sorry i don 't know i don 't know that in an embassy I don 't know the inner nemec 's the right answer because I was describing the fact that I never read the little points under the under the stuff articles anymore because they 're populated by trolls who seem to have one objective and life and letters to remove my will to live but thank you very much Cameron it was it was great very helpful thank you _"

    "text": "Chucky 's in the audience right hi so thank you and it 's good to see you all here today I know one or two cases I met Paul at the SP fest good to see you there a few months back and I know a number of the other counselors as well so thank you for being here and giving me this opportunity I understand from the information Saturday by the officers that you would have read my submission and in this verbal presentation I should focus on the main points so I 'm going to start by saying that I 'm opposed to the sale of up to 750 million dollars worth of assets for two main reasons and I want to talk about those later on but before I do that I just want to say something about being here today I 'm not speaking on behalf of any organization and I 've never done anything like this before I 'm representing myself and my partner but we 've been motivated by what 's been happening in the city to make an effort and say something and that I try to do up front with classes is to explain the importance of speaking up I use are the number 14 which if I remember rightly is the fact of the BBC uses to multiply complaints about particular programs for me this means that about a quarter of the class is not understanding something I say you 'll have your own ideas about how representative what I 'm saying is but I guess you 'll have all watched the piece on Campbell Live yesterday and I also remember LeAnn at speaking when she was empty for Christchurch Chiefs speaking really eloquently about how it 's important that the community owned the recovery so this brings me to my first point which is related but separate it 's not about who should be in control of the rebuild which I think we 're all agreed on but about your role in representing us you were the first council to be elected when the nature of the recovery was becoming apparent to ask the citizens so I think that gives you a mandate that the previous council didn 't have is of not selling assets so whatever you think of the pros and cons of the specific assets I think it 's very clear that there 's a significant proportion of the population which would prefer to keep them if at all possible of course we are in a very difficult situation and we need to make compromises but as a starting point I think it 's clear that the council should continue to look after and husband and husband these assets which have been built up over many years which brings me to my second point which is what is the situation that we are in well obviously difficult but the 1.2 billion dollar shortfall is only the best estimate we have at the moment it is actually very uncertain as you state in your own document given this i would ask wouldn 't it be better to be a little more cautious about budgeting about what we can spend over the next 10 years on page 16 of the consultation document it is stated that you 're proposing ambitious spending plan and i understand your desire to get slowly than people had planned for and even the crime is pushing out delivery at some of its commitments selling assets might be a good proposition if the capital raise was going to make a significant contribution to the overall budget but in fact the proposal is to sell almost half the assets to cover a mere seven percent of the total which is itself very uncertain this seems to me like somebody 's selling their car and all their furniture to pay for a big house which they can 't really afford the better solution would be to build a smaller house or in our case to take longer over it this obviously means making difficult decisions about priorities but i think it 's there 's a pretty clear consensus over what those items are that we need in the short term and those that we can take longer to to to to to to achieve in summary i believe that you 're as a council were given a very clear steer about preserving the city 's assets and that given out the uncertainty over the true it would actually maintain these and leave at least until the true picture of that financial needs is no thank you thank you anyone yep just on the these selling half our assets that 's not quite true a total balance sheet has assets of about 12 billion dollars so you mean half of our commercial assets hey I was up I was using the figures that I found in that in the document is 140 tally was about forty four percent yep he 'll think you 're all under the other thing I think you refer what we 've been front of us written down on their page 104 is about scaling back the program at work you need from your understanding any any suggestions or carry it 's got hella might be there oh well and that 's a really difficult question and really on I haven 't_''_317.289 been elected to answer this happen that 's your job yeah um I mean I think I think it 's pretty clear you 've heard some good submissions today I 've been listening in from the back there bits and good submissions and they are about people about what people want and that people can make use of and people can use in their day-to-day ours it gives meaning to their lives I mean I was at the court yesterday I don 't know if you 've been to see the constellations if you haven 't go to it was excellent that was that 's what gives meaning to people 's lives of those sorts of things it 's not necessarily about big ticket items I know we 're not paying for all the big ticket items but it is about meaning and effect and about giving something to communities so that so that those communities can thrive bringing joy to people 's lives so I think that 's what we should be focused on anyway and we 're at the lunch break but we 're behind time so sorry yeah I know I know but there were a couple of things that happened today that we weren 't expecting that that submission should really not have got through the system but anyway but we yeah we had a very sad earlier this process anyway so now what are we going to do team what time are we going to come back because so we 've got food out the bag so we 'll start again at one o 'clock so we 're back on back on track we 'll start back on track on time okay yep yep but there is food out the back so people can help themselves _"

    "text": "I was going to say good morning because i was jus on 1155 but other sorry good afternoon i 'd like to thank you Velma the opportunity to be here note that I only have five minutes I 'll try to be as brief as I can I 'm a regular recreational user of the port of littleton and also the Vice Commodore naval point club and littleton and as such i 'm keenly interested and the various planning matters currently affecting the recreation they 're affecting those recreational activities there seems to be a significant overlap between the littleton port recovery plan the Christchurch City Council long-term plan and the Christchurch City Council proposed district plan and I 'm struggling to get my head around where all of these bits and pieces fit my understanding is that Clause 6.8 of the material directive for the draft littleton port recovery plan requires he can to develop the plan in consultation with the Christchurch City Council and other parties not presumed that the draft port recovery plan was developed on their basis and I note that that allows for rezoning of and you 'll see on those documents that I 've given you on the second and third page where that land is located the port recovery plan allows for that to be resigned to special purpose littleton port zone which effectively takes it away from being boat harbor zone which is for recreational use that would take approximately 1.4 hectares or sixteen percent of their land away from my reading of the city council submission to that brought recovery plan the the council submission was silent on that there was no comment whatsoever on that and also we 're facing a situation I 'm not quite sure which planets under for a 60-meter setback resigned from the cliff face so all of these things sort of fall somewhere in amongst all of those those three different plans and I 'm not quite sure how the jigsaw fits together but the one thing that I am sure on is that they have a severe impact on the available space for recreational boating activities and that this appears to me that there 's a lack of engagement between Christchurch City Council of to develop a coordinated plan for the area should the little from the port recovery plan be adopted in the LPC Lynn will be resigned and lost to recreational users for a significant period of time naval point is met with LPC and live indicated they did not have any development plans for their land in that area so the crystal willingness to be involved in the development for coordinated plan for the area including the land owned by LPC and I would urge the council to engage with the poor company noble point club littleton and other stakeholders to develop a coordinated plan for the area to achieve the best possible outcome for recreational users you may be interested know that we 're collaborating with the Coast Guard to build a joint facility will require a major investment to replace their damaged buildings and to provide safe all-weather access to launching ramps the City Council could assist greatly and facilitating the process without necessarily being a fun day we have an amazing opportunity to turn the sad and neglected part of your city into a facility that we can to speak and would welcome any questions okay does anyone have any questions sorry yeah we have had a submission already on this so he 's been at that point you were submission to the long term district the tilton port recovery plan wasn 't available to us on the I find that you guys were silent on it yeah i mean what will have to take some advice on that I don 't have that in front of me at the moment but I mean basically your submission is not not in conflict with the requirements of the long term plan you want us to work collaboratively with Littleton port and with the users in their area to get a an integrated plan for their area that works for everyone let 's be fair summary good thank you very much right thank you very much Trent I 'll _"

    "text": "thank you and I do apologize to those in the audience that there was a mistake in our agenda so organizations are given 10 minutes and individuals are given five minutes so that there was no running over time with that submission auto her nuit grace what now Tina kk tik tok tena koutou katoa good morning my name is aloha nui grace and i am a ratepayer and resident of christchurch i returned to christchurch last year having lived in the north for over 20 years I 'd like to begin my what I want to say this morning with a fur coat okie Hootie artery Doherty had a Kiki k here to call McCorkle ki my kia ho he had to me a new ETO mikuni kia to hear tangata he tangata he tangata not a dirty no koto this Toki roughly translates thus if you cut out the growing shoot of the Hanukkah key or the Flex push the plant dies in these no be nowhere for the Bell bird to sing you ask me what the most important thing in the world errs and I reply about as a system of interconnected parts which when you change one part of course the rest is affected however the last part of this Toki I believe points to the way ahead and it 's about people it 's not money and it 's not business that makes the real go around its people and I believe that it is people and not buildings in that need to be at the very core of we you invest our money in this long-term plan I think in the 21st century we are now entering the age of working together not working hard or not we think smarter but working together and getting that one plus one equals 30 feet that only comes when people actually do work really well together and a friend of mine who is an electrician uses a really good example to illustrate what I 'm talking about he says it takes him as a sparky about three days to wear up a house on his own but it only takes one day when he works together with another Sparky and I 'm sure that all of the satisfaction of working together with others and creating something which you know is way beyond what you might have created on your own it might have been in a working group it might have been in a sports team or it might have been working with people in the community shoveling lip perfection after it quakes not only is there that feeling of a job well done but there 's something else that happens is the factor that comes into that which isn 't really miserable and when I try to label at the closest that i can come to as these a sense of joy or fun that comes from working with people and it 's the Sun miserable and really fleeting experience which has enormous impacts on the well-being of the people who are involved in because it 's a system is the flow on a feat I 've often heard has called the fluffy stuff this is the soft skills if you 're talking about it in a business context but actually it 's the hardest part if you want to try and consciously create this have and it 's the icing on the cake and it 's the first thing that gets cut when times get tough yet when we work together not only does the job get done faster and more if Utley actually that will be in factor that immeasurable thing that sense of social connection and cohesiveness Haswell been proven to improve health health statistics it lowers crime it increases a productivity just to name a few of those things so when you are looking at beast investing our finances in this long-term plan process I 'm suggesting actually that you start number one with yourself we rate pairs are invested heavily stood interest and you working together you are our leaders you are our role models and you 're a microcosm of our wider system and we need you to X together an hour have to push back we have been decisions that you and we haven 't actually been involved in secondly in your staff I think it 's really important to remember that if your brief in the past has been to ensure that the rules are kept and and learning and development is necessary for something that has people focused to actually start to happen the staff our residents and ratepayers of the city and they 're worthy of this investment and then in our communities and not last not last because the least but actually because there is getting it right for over fifty percent of the people who live in the city and a thirty thousand dollars is not a lot left after rent for food transport etc so when you 're investing our money I 'd suggest that you invest and local things local infrastructure activity invents that people can walk to that people can do for free things that people can participate which actually consciously grows the contribution I 'm not saying that the big stadiums aren 't important but actually that are nice to haves that icing on the cake and not the other way around and I go over for a couple of seconds couple of thick and thank you and I think there if I was to follow a hunch that a huge number of the people who 've come and from badly affected areas in the city they have an experience which cannot which is that which is an opportunity for this council to actually take advantage of they know what it feels like to work together to create something bigger than you then then what it is that they could either create on their own because they 've had a disaster and I think it 's that those exciting and pellet vote pavilions and end innovative projects which have brought people like me to come back to this place and I think we people are will in thriving business always follows and I think you can trust it so there 's an opportunity that 's unique here in Christchurch for you to invest in and build on this experience that people have had in this place so that it remains in continues to grow in place that we want to come and live in to be in do business nor data Tina Kotek you ought to thank you very much I 'm call on lock _"

    "text": "those familiar to myself and Paul lonsdale she had the mural candidates meeting and the akaroa it was a great night it was a great day good morning everybody and thank you very much for the chance to speak i 'm david miller i 'm here as the president of the Friends of akkad or a museum and I I want to say for myself congratulations on this process and in for the evidence spirit in which I 'm conducting it it 's really nice to see and I would also like to express thanks on behalf of the Friends of akaroa museum for the support that our elected representatives particularly have given the rejuvenation of the museum we know that you 've worked hard on our behalf and we 're extremely appreciative thank you now i 'm here because foam is seriously concerned about the activity management plan which was published on 25th of September 2014 in which we became aware of only in march this year the activity management plan for the museum 's is an especially poor document in terms of its quality of content and presentation committee of our local community board and so i won 't go into the details of Wyatts of such a calling the quality if except to say it 's unfinished and it 's inappropriate and it looks like a cut-and-paste afterthought especially have compared with other activity management plan documents like that for the christchurch art gallery it has a foregone conclusion in it that it makes good sense to ask canterbury museum to manage our khadora museum once the building refurbishment work is completed having a foregone conclusion within a planning review process indicates clear bias in its preparation and keeping with the poor quality of the document however no evidence is presented in support of that recommendation secondly there 's been an evident lack of due process in the preparation of the am p we know of no local involvement and developing the activity management plan which represents an our view an unprecedented new low in the preparation of such plans it was conceived without local or historical consultation and it is no way to plan for the future of our museum it 's supposed to be a museum and we take responsibility for that obviously far more seriously than the authors of this amateurish document the desultory authorship of it represents an earnest and a front and an insult both to the museum the Friends of a crow museum the acharya way we were community board museum Advisory Committee and the wider community so in summary this activity management plan is an offensively inadequate document with which to determine the future of a greatly treasured community resource and service it has been compiled and accurately in completely and ineptly and it remains as an indictment of substandard civic bureaucracy it has been developed without consultation and in the context therefore of bad faith supposing an event of a proposed review that will give a Revere of aeneas excuse me for a stated foregone conclusion the Friends of the museum also note that whoever produced this document is funded by ratepayers we strongly recommend that the substandard work output of the authors should be noted on their annual performance appraisals we pay their salary we recommend that the activity management plan be revised correct and improved by appropriate a review of cost-effectiveness at the moment because there 's no justification for it and of course the museum 's being rebuilt it would be an awkward time to do that we also recommend that in future no planning document in relation to the acro museum we prevent prepared or published by the city council without the museum and its staff and supporters being consulted we will not have planning about us without us the Acura museum has a unique and central role in the life of our community our comments reflect the seriousness with which a corona views its museum and its place in our community thank you I was tempted to say why don 't you say what you really mean that 's the annoying thing about democracy it does involve robust debate I know but I cannot overstate the way in which this activity management plan offended our community yeah and the thing is is dead though we we are the governance body and we reviewed all of the activity management plans I 've already said from the outset that the process was not good and it again and successful but I 'm yeah but so we have to take responsibility for this because we allowed it to go through I certainly didn 't notice that part of it and it 's ridiculous we can 't actually ask the canterbury museum to do anything and on our behalf because we we don 't own the canterbury museum to answer from under under a statutory arrangement which we don 't also have the opportunity to walk away from either and not that we would want to so this actually does require rewriting and I think that it does require rewriting before the final LT he has signed off not that I 'm pre determining my position she says looking at legal kind of people in the room but it has I mean there 's been more than one error I mean like for example the the two percent you know cut to the to the community funding which hasn 't wasn 't agreed you know so there have been some errors but this was our oversight so I know I 'm my own behalf I 'd like to friends that came on on monday that we will be reviewing this particular activity management plan but it does raise a bigger issue and biotech she confirms my view about the bigger issue which is that long-term plans really aren 't designed for work programs for for council staff they really are about setting a high-level strategic direction for the city for that 14 years and so you know i kind of feel for you know people like yourselves traveling all the way over here to make a plea to write wrong that should have been picked up in a different process this process doesn 't belong here I 'd rather be so so can we take what you see it as a given and now I just want to ask you sir invite counselors to ask this wonderful person some big picture questions about some of the big challenges that we face as a sitting and how banks peninsula as part of that because you know the part of this is about banks peninsula coming into the city but now we 're a nun two grated whole so what has anyone got any sort of david 's an incredible resource and i just think that you 've made your point on this and I 'd now like ref would you like to put some of the big picture questions to David Oh what process here I 've got to say don 't timing you know he 's entitled to 10 months yeah no absolutely oh yeah is it representing an organization sorry it was wrong and the agenda it looked like five minutes but he 's actually entitled to ten minute no this vessel right maybe I misunderstood was awaiting him hmm you but he 's entitled to 10 minutes sorry there 's a mistake and our agenda yeah the museum the Friends of the museum represents about 220 people which a substantial proportion of which will represent a substantial population from Ecuador itself yeah all right but if no one 's got any questions in I 've can can you pass on our apologies thank you your members I will met a Marin that 's a pleasure to see you and thank you for allowing this robust contribution precious nut submission thank you thank you _"

    "text": "not here oh I 'm sorry I knew that Dave Hudson Madame mayor and councillors why would be the first person to put my hand up and say that I 've not really taken too much unjust in local politics it is with great concern that I feel compelled to come here today to explain from what I would describe as a middle-class perspective the damage and financial hardship that 's being inflicted by the ongoing rates reviews following evaluations and constant rate rises that we as residents are totally powerless to try and alleviate of them and selling up downsizing into a low socio-economic area renting or live in Christchurch all together following both major earthquakes our property and boom were closing cashing it was a total rebuild Ezra single-income family with four children three still at home I am an effort to smooth out my cash flow pay all my bills monthly we move back into a rebuilt property in late March last year and shortly after started receiving rates demands with a substantial increase from 282 dot 52 cents per month prior to demolition to four hundred forty five percent increase in less than two years and what equates to nearly a hundred dollars a week for the pleasure of living in the city while I understand that there 's been a revaluation of a regal property and subsequent rates increases over the last two years and I 'm fully sympathetic to exactly why the council is needed to raise rates of any thought to try to cover some of the horrendous costs involved in the Christchurch rebuild I just want to make it very clear to the council that these sorts of increases are not sustainable for the average resident rates have now become my second biggest expense higher than house insurance contents insurance health insurance and death of insurance and also power in fact the only expense that we have that surpasses the monthly rates bill is what I give to my wife to cover groceries and running the house now I would consider it sells very fortunate we 're mortgage free at the 408 dollars is really starting to buy and it 's my understanding that rates are going to increase a 26-percent next council simply has to understand that these sorts of increases are not sustainable and there would be very few people working and living in the city who would be getting anything like those sorts of increases in salary to put it into perspective my employer PGG Wrightson a large respected public comes and gave us up two and a half percent salary increase last year and we were probably pretty lucky to give there in 55 years old and projecting out ten years to what hopefully will be retirement I can tell you with absolute certainty that there is no way we could afford to live in the house that we are presently living in and we will more than likely be driven from christchurch by the rates burden which simply will be unworkable on retirement income in fact i have no idea how many pensioners and people and lower income levels of managing a prison let alone being able to cope with the proposed increases this disturbs me greatly as I love this city having lived here or hit strong roots here most of my life and after travelling and do not want to be forced into having to leave it yet I see very little option of things do not change now while the purpose and intent of the submission is in no way intended to criticize merely to give what I would describe as a middle-class perspective I 've read that the mirrors asked for ideas and submissions well not being up to speed with the workings of the City Council or its assets I 'd say this cut your cloth to suit your means in other words structure the proposed rebuild in a way that the city can afford and event means waiting another 10 years for things to be done in so be it better to have a few rough roads than no one using rebuilt ones as they left the city to live elsewhere in other words any rates increase is higher than inflation or the CPI are not acceptable and budgets and other hips need to be reworked to reflect that I think you for your time and I hope that the contents of the submission will be taken on board in the no revaluation of our properties done at 2010 so actually they were 2007 that 's why they jumped quite significantly after they were evaluated last year yeah look I 'm the sort of came about through a letter to actually yo a phone call to Vicki that and it was never intended that that I were the attention of the the letter was never to actually tie up this hearings for the long term city plan it was really something I promised myself that I 'd do for a number of months and finally found a spirit moment to sit actually do it and then sort of on thing you skated to another which is exactly why I 'm here but look good and your diet yeah I 'm back yeah in my view it 's out of control and I think we need to do something about it and I just really wanted to give you guys saw like I see it a middle class for speak that the more you this is going that 's great no brief thanks for coming and I think that perspective is important chamber I think it 's great you 've come in I mean I think what people don 't realize is that the the cost of the council and to the Ray pairs of the earthquake has been enormous now I mean rough numbers I 've got six and a half billion dollars I mean that is a huge amount so i mean we 're actually having to pay a huge amount for this disaster recovery rebuild I mean that 's around forty thousand dollars per repair now a lot of ratepayers don 't have any savings so you can imagine the financial stress the council is under and therefore the rate pair is under and i mean i think you 're right i mean it 's i guess my question to you is do you think we need just a hard stop here and just say hold on we actually just need to start again from the beginning that actually all these plans just don 't make sense they don 't add up then they 're not affordable food for the average rate there shortly yeah yeah I mean it anything higher than sort of CPI or increase or inflation is just really not workable because very very few people in this city and this country that i 'm aware of a getting salary increases that could sort of cope with those sorts of increases and certainly you notes and i 'm lucky on sort of a well-paying job but you know pinching those people in the lower income levels it 's just I have no idea how to managing so I think yeah to your question you do and as I said if it means waiting for things to be done all things not to be done in Soviet if I mean selling assets maybe that 's what you 've got to do I don 't know as I said I 'm not privy to the weakness of the other council and but again as I said it 's important I think that you guys realize just what 's potentially going to happen because people have been going to be driven from this study and that 's something I care greatly about okay thank you and thank you for you 're most welcome thank you

    "text": "any and thank you good morning everyone I have just recently come back to Christchurch after 20 years away in marlborough and I 've settled in South Shore so my contribution is going to be a little bit parochial if you 'll excuse that and I 'll just summarize what i was going to say in case I lose track I 'm concerned about the large area of X a residential Rebs own land and how its maintenance is going to be paid for and whether anything to be done to ameliorate that I am concerned about the continuing slow rundown of the new brighton area shutting down any more facilities like new brighton campground and rafi tee golf course and not building new ones such as the saltwater pool will be distracted long-term I mean I know at the moment we got a problem because you hardly can able get to Brighton because pages road is such a mess but eventually that will clear up and people will be able to get to Brighton again and let 's hope that they move in and settle people need to be have something to go there for now as an aside to this here 's about sea level rise should not stop recovery they should not be ignored but they should not stop recovery just make all the new buildings relocatable I 'm sick of seeing these little houses a traditionally built perched up a meter are they going to be little islands when the sea Rises pull the other one anyway um I think that 's for most all that I had to say unless you want a little bit more detail if there 's no room when the great zone has been deducted to build houses this could be flats that way is the council proposing to reduce the size of New Bratton 's commercial so little feed into the district thing their residents need work as well as somewhere to live now with a passage of time it 's been a long time and it 's a mess and there are other places that have been a Miss for a long time I know with a passage of time scruffiness and demoralization increase and crime increases now perhaps should be rated as if their lambs already built on this could be a win-win situation I know that 's a bit fatuous but something like that I support the proposal for community management of some facilities especially the new brighton camping ground and rough ET golf course now people are very passionate about keeping the campground they find it useful and one of the things it can do of course reduce the number of freedom campus who clutter up the beach side car parks and hang their washing in the trees you know not very nice now for example the when the water front properties on the estuary side of south shore were demolished and most of them have been there just a couple left what is this done well for a start there are only about 460 of the original seven hundred households left in the area I am told the other thing is that the better off people who lived on that water front side have gone they 've made new lives elsewhere they 're not going to come back something really needs to be done to got to get the better of people they 're happier people the successful people back in there and we do not want we do want our pub back and if you can 't give us our pub back we want a cafe or shop um okay I think that 's about it oh yes does someone have a question we gotta do you think well there was a thing called the batch at the intersection rhinos road and espeon street right which is now a builder 's yard he couldn 't he couldn 't make it work because of the because of the retaining only mathcast is obviously much too many customers yes something has got to be sorted to get people back Dan 's a tie yeah mmm very challenging very challenging no yeah no it 's not the fist we 're definitely not in the business of running pubs but but anyway look thank you very much you have highlighted the the challenges around population and service provision because there is a connection a direct length between the two yes thank you very much thank you excellent and could we now have Valerie Everett _"

    "text": "um raehwan Hughes good morning and thank you for your con for your bullet for my ability to give my contribution here I 'm really picking up where Tony left off I 've got a question and that question relates the fact that this council has realized that the rebuilding of the new ami stadium that 's not on everybody 's popular lust and so your understatement of the day so you 've delayed it to 2025 I come to ask we were we the people of the inner suburbs Lynn word philipstown those who who bought her on the southeast corner of the new anchor projects where were they when consultation was include appears to me that the decision was made by Sarah and the council without any consultation will leave the council out of that counsel was okay was made by Sarah and without any consultation and so we are in having foisted upon us a new stadium which from my understanding was something like 110 million and I thought the existing patent no no but that 's our contribution that 's what it 's on our butt the existing stadium now I may be wrong off because he could be mopping 464 that 's native insurance you know and we still haven 't settled our insurance and if there 's one asset that we 've got a major dispute over it is the stadium yes so you need to ten years to fight with two to three million 253 renew by vibe 3 million thought it was bad but it 's luis they 'd see your voice to be is tricky i totally understand and i just sort of like to compare some of the other cities in new zealand who 've got stadiums in different places and Wellington 's with out in the industrial area you can get to it easily it 's not disturbing the neighborhood whereas people who live in near the Mount Smart Stadium and Auckland always have problems around parking and all the rest of it those who have been living sista side the existing AMI Stadium have had bought a house knowing there was a stadium in their neighborhood you know the one issue that I think is so vital for have housing in the same way that the northwestern and northeast North sorry the northwestern northeastern quarters have and if the land is there 's an opportunity to look at how to improve housing that could be affordable housing it could start a start a movement and they will be there still quite a bit of land tucked around that southeast corner whoo-whee people may be encouraged to do bring housing and to say comparison I stay with my son and Wellington I could walk to everywhere with clothes plus and what the center Wellington you can 't in crisis well you can go to hear blood leaks when we got there in ascending we 're going to have a grasp belt nearby we 're going to have parks nearby in that area just seems a waste to not use it for something like affordable housing so is he on kanino and ask me why how he came to get the decision for the stadium well it was ref just declare I 'm glad you asked that because there 's so many people come in here and think so don rates that is not the case at all so the stadium at the moment is in the budget for the years 20 23 to 20 25 the extra that we 're budgeting for is 110 million not 253 it 's 110 plus and potential insurance payout of 143 now in the article reasoning Civic said it could be repaired for 50 we don 't agree with that and there are issues around who actually does the repair and who the risk so it 's not as straightforward don 't do that new save X amount of money that being the case we could certainly look at not spending 110 million but it 's out in the budget here so it 's not actually going to help us today well the council at least consult but once you start to get a clearer picture of who 's paying what because it 's obviously still unresolved well the council come and consult with the community as to whether they really want the stadium cited we the decision is at the moment and this is the other element that you 're not aware for the purpose and under the central city recovery plan and under the whole year the central city recovery plan there is nothing that we can put in our plans that is inconsistent with anything that 's and the government 's plan that 's the effect of the blueprint and the location of thing but that can change but it can change by negotiation yes check yes I mean that 's not certain to happen in that place we have written to government and we have asked to meet with them over a number of issues not just the anchor projects not just the cost year not just the horizontal infrastructure not just the land drainage recovery program but a number of other issues that all flow directly from our earthquake experience and various agreements that were entered into with the previous council so we it is hard because it is not a negotiation that can take place in the public arena but the results of it should be in my view much more consultative much more collaborative and much more engaged in a way that the public are involved and where things are going to be rebuilt and when they 're going to be rebuilt and what that means for the city you know we 've had a lot of conversations about convention centers and various other bits and pieces that the council doesn 't have anything on its books you know so not doing the convention center we 've heard people talk about the scale of it that it 's too big for our city but we do need a convention center so saying no convention center is we but we but but it location and scale yeah that 's that 's the debate rather than do we actually need somewhere where people can hold conventions we 're a host city that 's always been part of our history we had a very successful convention center before the earthquakes so this is the debate that I would love us to be able to have it 's actually more of a conversation with our community and I think the public are really up for that kind of conversation so it 's really a politic national national political issue yeah you know to negotiate in a way enough you know maybe I haven 't got the balance right but I 've always felt that negotiating on the front page of the newspaper isn 't necessarily going to produce the best result for the city so working behind the scenes trying to get a good result and I have to say that previous decisions you know before we were elected weren 't always consulted with individual counselors so individual counselors did not see the blueprint before I think the two days before it was publicly released they did not see the terms of the cost share agreement until after we were elected I remember sitting in this chamber we had a informal completely confidential meeting with all of the lawyers present I remember Vicki bucks sitting there and saying you don 't but don 't tell me that 's not tell me that 's not true tell me we haven 't signed an agreement that says that we are liable to pay our share of the anchor projects regardless of the under vidual insurance recoveries that we get for the asset that well it was signed wasn 't that lucky no but you see the and it 's the thing I 'm yani and Jamie and Glenn and Jimmy they were all on that council and not one of them saw the cost share agreement before that day not one of them as I was I was there the counselors deliberately voted to not have a comeback in front of the council and deliberately voted to do it in secret not an open and so that was a very clear choice I know because I moved the amendment to try and get it in public and to try and get it going back to council so that councillors could see it so the council voted for it can explain why they did that but I just wanted to UM just make the point that one of the things that the mayor has expressed previously but she hasn 't mentioned today is it cabinet go through a secret process to make decisions we go through a local government process so if you take the metro sports there 's been no public consultation and we haven 't been able to talk publicly about its scope which i think is a real tragedy in a lot I mean there has been a public process to a certain extent but the conversations are happening at an office the level with the different codes that are going to be using the Metro sports facility but the Metro sports facility replaces public assets like oh now I 'm having a mental block because my husband still brings me up about it its centennial pool you know and given that it replaces a public asset like there 'd you know there has to be a degree of community involvement and and you know that the community doesn 't have to sign off on the decision they just have to be involved and I mean nobody 's expecting things to happen overnight my experience is that as long as people know what the planners what the time liners people will accept delays from time to time because they know that they 'll be told why and I think that the the frustration that 's kind of hit the city have been announced to a timeline they 've never had any sort of kind of line of sight on and they don 't know why the delay is happening so you know there has been yeah a sense of frustration around you know the fact that people come to this table to seek a delay on something on one of the assets that they can 't see is being delayed but the things that we need the most are being delighted you know so anyway we we 've got a long way to go but I think that what we do need is we do need the public to better understand the position that we 're on and and you know and i will have to accept that that perhaps we haven 't communicated that in the and as good a way as we can but we will continue to try to do to do better because i do think that understanding we 're the political which part of the political processes of making the decisions i mean we do have an election coming up eventually so but it 's to do is to is to capture the moment that we have now and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act ends on the what is it 19th of April 2016 and given their end point that is least that is less than a year away so we 're in a transition period and it 's during the transition that we as a city can ask to be part of a shared transition process and not an imposed transition process and I think if we have their approach then we will end up in a much better position as a city and i think that the city will come with us once they understand that they 're part of a shared process with a shared vision between central and local government nobody doesn 't want the city to recover nobody so we all want the same thing we have different ways of getting there and as Jonnie said the two processes haven 't missed very well and we need a new process to take us forward yep thank you so thank you I don 't mean to give a speech but you in it Marshall _"

    "text": "thank you could counselors please resume their seats I 'm sure somebody 's listening to me yup and could I call gram Creech for thank you hey gram deco dope couture made a mere counselors and rest of this assembled company as I was driving in I was behind a car which had a personalised number plate cursed and I didn 't know whether that was a reference to my submission or whether that was in fact the plight of the City Council or the city so having said that I my focus of my submission was really just on privatization issues and I had six reasons why the council shouldn 't resort to asset sales and I 'm going to skip through some of those very quickly and just focus on a few points which I thought might be of interest to the council so the first point I made was no to big ticket items and there would be considerable savings by sort of abandoning those and also looking at alternatives like raising capital through bonds development bonds or something like that when I was doing research for about the English carpet of councils innovation network and I raised this as the possibility that the council might explore not looking at amalgamation of reducing a mega city in the way that satin in Auckland and could happen in Wellington but looking at the possible cost savings of more collaborative effort with other local authorities involving with more involvement of the people so I might actually read this here because the people sitting behind me won 't know what I 'm talking about and one of the characteristics of this network sent me I gear a better procurement for so you 'll gain so it talked of a collaboration between local authorities committed to finding better ways of working for and with local people for the benefit of their local community at this point I would speak strongly in favor of the People 's Republic of Christchurch so better way to working for and with local people for the benefit of the local community a new paradigm where traditional models of top-down governance which we 've seen taken to an extreme really by Minister Brown Liam the government and more local leadership genuine cooperation and a new approach built on the founding traditions of the co-operative movement collective action cooperation empowerment and the enterprise and then I 've got a quote from an American who lectures in at the DePaul University privatization says people with money where 's the public sector serves everyone when private profit is the main driver service quality and workforce conditions are likely to decline the same time money moves to the top so that CEOs would be remunerated at seen at obscene levels Poldark item I quoted earlier actually teaches economic inequality at DePaul University the argues that the private sector has an incentive to fail all know that incentive at all and describes how the American structural foundation is deteriorated with grids and pipelines neglected by monopolistic industries that cut costs rather than provide maintenance when you think of the way what happened when the railways were privatized in New Zealand we saw that scenario played out and that 's happened even more in Britain reduced maintenance of infrastructure to continue with this example is likely to have health and safety implications like at sech cetera imagine the situation of the port company was in foreign ownership from the owner decided the Lyttelton was an economic or two decided to run down report to focus on business elsewhere supporters a significant part of the regional economy providing were generating employment for local people which could be lost overnight of another owner had no loyalty to the city and province sure it makes better economic sense to keep profitable businesses like the airport and littleton port company and an income from them to reinvest in better local services rather than contribute to shareholder profits most of which would be likely to move offshore the practice of English conservative councils of selling off profitable operations and retaining only necessary but loss-making functions seems to be a no-brainer and go back to Paul Buchheit oh my quota Julia public beats private in almost every way only the height of the free market media keeps much to America believing that winner-takes-all is preferable to working together as a community and also make the point that local ownership should mean greater responsive responsiveness to local needs and council imagine the situation at the time of the earthquakes of the council had contracted out its call center operation to say India and call has had no direct communication with people with local knowledge and private has not necessarily mean better and I pended to my submission a number of references to disasters privatization disasters in Britain I actually didn 't bring that with me but you 're welcome to follow that through a few 12 some councils and Britain have at considerable cost had to bring services back in the house because private companies have failed deliver and I specified to hear Somerset County Council ended up an expensive litigation when they contracted to Southwest one which was an IBM company to provide back office functions and services the contract went sour and in 2012 the council was sued the council ended up with a legal bill of 2.6 million pounds and overall cost of five million pounds and Swansea councils full IT contract would have cost the council 40 million pounds more than its IT budget over a ten-year period though long-term contracts awarded on loss leading bids been helpless to do anything about sorry which councils have been helpless to do anything about particularly where equipment and plant have been sold off then there are the problems for the community if the alternative owner or supplier of services goes into mex addition however finish my vitamin years Graham Rio yep but I mean you 've made your point and clarified some of the elements of your submission so thank you very very much not at all okay thank you I 'm Derek kick _"

't mind I 'm going to drop the formality a little I feel that I 'm amongst friends because although my criticisms are criticisms they 're from a friend I guess what I 'm saying is hey guys I get it you 're tired I 'm tired we 're all tired we 're tired of roadworks we 're tired of fighting insurance companies we 're tired of hearing about delays I get it but this this draft plan you just won 't do it 's not right it 's obviously not right it 's got bugs in it it 's got gaps this is Microsoft Vista this is Nova pipe take the proposed capital works program it 's flawed it it can 't_''_76.979 be delivered not because or or just because it 's unaffordable it can 't_''_82.47 be delivered because there 's too much too soon the contractors aren 't available it can 't_''_88.049 be delivered or writing parking tickets take the proposed asset sales the discussion contains all this emotional baggage it doesn 't belong in a discussion it should be quite simple am I the right payer getting good value out of the investment or is the arrangement really just a money go round a construct one step removed from laundering money either the assets are strategic because their fundamental to what the council is delivering in which case don 't sell them but drive them to produce more returns with it for the owner or they 're not strategic in which case get rid of them though pussyfoot about with any cell in a little bit or keeping a little bit this is not a business simulation it 's not monopoly it 's real and I know it 's hard it requires leadership you 've seen my written submission and appalled this is an organization that plans to put 4.2 billion dollars into the local economy by purchasing labor and other resources but doesn 't want to talk about it this is though it 's no cut no consequence at all there are capital works and rightly so but this this 4.2 billion commit billion dollar commitment is buried it 's tucked away not for discussion move along nothing to see here what plans are there to improve the efficiency of the organization to reduce waste to work smarter to outsource I want to know all ratepayers want to know why should we be content to fund a poorly performing organization and money pit we want we need a high performing organization efficient and lean not inefficient and flabby I want the plan to tell me that you care about efficiency about delivering value added services if I 'm going to commit my family my business my future to the city and need to know what does the council plan to do to avoid another consents debacle when are we going to be able to pay for our dog licenses online it 's not just about closing early either this year sorry I just what some are doing it now we just started that on what end um so it 's not just about closing early either what with what we 're facing a core council activity why can 't it be delivered by somebody else some other organization these things apply to all organizations take the district health board 8,000 employees you think David mates doesn 't have to go through these discussions all the time it does it every year he doesn 't have the luxury of a three-year cycle I don 't have 8,000 employees I 've got 75 but I have to consider these things several times each year the size of the organization is not the factor the industry sector is not the factor all leaders need to tackle these tough questions and be really bold not mediocre the plan should befall with plans and ideas to reduce or manage costs to improve services and processes to improve responsiveness it 's not it 's over filled with departments puffing themselves up saying what a good job they do and why they should keep doing it what 's the same keep doing what you 've always done and you keep on getting what you 've always gone is that what the city reads needs right now I don 't thinking of the city the council its staff councillors speaking as a friend the windows clear but the thinking is not there are logic traps and there are bits missing I get it you 're tired tired and overworked but this this planet is not good enough it 's got bugs and gaps and it 's too bloody long I know it 's a draft good let 's make it better fewer gaps fewer errors more vision be more bold thank you what do you think of a strategic assets of the city purely on the financial information that 's been presented there would appear to be only two that would appear to have any real value will return to the to the owner frankly and the rest of them I don 't see there 's any value in keeping them at all okay okay but how would you define strategic well as I said earlier if it 's aligned with delivering so I I mean city care happens to be one that 's returning a reasonable return and obviously there 's a large but there are other competitive contracting that we own it not necessarily night ya know okay see amount of time but it 's a but I just wanted to clarify that because you you did ask that question yeah oh I 'm glad that you lift a little bit of smudging it is time for a question yeah No thank you very much for your submission on and thank you for presenting it as a friend thank you very much and about it _"

which is adjacent to the Styx River and I haven 't them hard about putting the submission because I realized the council has much loftier problems to deal with potentially than our particular issues but we feel to some extent almost betrayed by the council certainly let down and we were promised some things in a planning hearing and what 's proposed with the rating change it 's completely the opposite so just bring that rates we have had a couple of submissions on this already and having some more so I don 't know if you were here right at the beginning of no I arrived thank ya so I was kind of reflecting that it 's a shame that the people they have this issue weren 't here together as a group because I think I think you would have took taken some comfort from the discussion that a this they 're from our particular area no i don 't i don 't think it matters what youíve from what it does it because we 've been zoned bourbon now as a result of a private plan change dry which is never going to proceed and my lifetime living up there yeah and we had these concerns during the Commissioner during the commissioners process right okay we at far away okay so that 's us we live in a little rural in the house he on three and a half acres and we run cows so we run it really and you can 't see from the definition but the cows are in that paddock which they 've almost eaten and they 'll move into the air and so it is actually run as a farm we use hey and winter time to get the stock to progress we break feed with electric fence etc etc so by any definition we 're a rural activity and so finally I bring up the next one and so we 're up here cut them against the Styx River now almost the 's where the North materials going was part of a private plan change which succeeded and our submissions against that we were convinced that in fact as I said it wouldn 't proceed for a variety of reasons you might say well it 's a bundle of nothing laypeople but at the end of the day the efforts now broke and there 's some good reasons I serve why it 's going to be an awful long time hi that 's correct yes in one of the submissions we see it possible we we don 't believe it 's going to proceed we want to stay living up here so we 're going to be lumbered with rates associated with urban rated land when our users going to stay rural and we were assured by the council offices or the council officers assured the commissioners that in fact it was the use of the land that method not zoning for its rates and so one of the I guess mitigating factors we get we were given a list of rural activities we were promised we were allowed to continue like would stay rural now if we changed the way that what the proposal is is that it 's less than two hit deer so we listened to eat deer so we fail here and history your own zoned rural and we 're now zoned Irvin high field three or Debrett 's cool and so we foul on that count as well and so we 're now lumbered with effectively urban rates and even be out on the rural differential so that yeah and you have an important quote here directly from the commissioners reporter it the important factor for determining rates is the use of the property not at stoning such that a property used for farming purposes as rated rural irrespective of it sailing correct and in our case it would it would also we would fail on the two hectare the which is in the proposed changes so our proposal would we lose two ways you 'd lose both ways because of the zoning and because of the number of hit deal correct create at the moment you 're above the hip dear no we because we because ago I think yeah there was no doubt that what we do on our property was considered rural and so we 've been we 've had the advantage of the rural differential some seen if the council decided not to proceed with the proposal but to instead do an assessment of all of the properties to it because there are some properties there are literally residential lifestyle blocks and they counted already our neighbors for example don 't get the rural differential wrong would merely adjacent to us we were judged as being not rural activities yeah but so if but if we were to as an alternative to what we 've put out on a plane to do an individual assessment of each of the properties then you feel that you would you would qualify as rural under an individual assessment well we run cows we break use an electric fence to break feed them through the winter we feed them hay we rotate them around in the summer I can 't see how that would fail to be rule and that clearly the Commissioner relied on that when would assume so yeah um what sorry how much time sorry times up so yeah thank you very much I think that that 's a it 's very compelling thank you very much thank you so we now move on to _"

    "text": "Mets a mentor then Monty month is sorry I know your name so well and I 've suffered I suffer from quite brain now so look and if it even sounds vaguely like it is I answer to it so no problem Thank You magic oh and I have I 'm sorry i 've got a touch who 's the short or come down quickly um well that is being distributed if I can explain why you 've got one that is fairly different from what I submitted I 'm an active member of the Victoria Neighborhood Association which is the central city association north of the square up to Armenia and our intention was to make a submission and we did talk about quite a few of the aspects with remarkable agreement given the size of the group and for all sorts of reasons which I 've said in here are the things that we were responding to objecting to etc all of a sudden we went oh my goodness this is one of the most important things and here is a central city association that didn 't put are alluded to and my embarrassing Lee brief and even ungrammatical submission I just want to quickly expand on I 'll just point out the the things that we did talk about as a group and even though it wasn 't ever formalized we spend enough time together that I feel confident that I am speaking on their behalf as well this is however just my submission so just to give myself I guess a little bit of credibility I have lived in New Zealand since 1971 almost over half of that time has been in the central city gloucester street worcester street and and much longer my current residents own grace-filled avenue so everything obviously that happens in the central city it affects everybody in the city but it 's our neighborhood and it 's where people who live so close to the CBD used to do everything so I guess we take it really personally the just the the things that I want to highlight on here and I 'm really sorry to give you yet another thing to read but we did spend quite a bit of the plan and people were very and myself as well impressed where 's the efforts that are being made and we think they are we think that they really are quite effective they just need more time to to get people to use them the way they 're intended including things like the open mic and engagement officers and so on one of the things that we did agree with which I found in one of the papers was the pudding making more things even more things accessible online so that it 's not having to come in get hard copies are you spending all the money on yep I mean take Emma 's read really we also many times not just for the LA te have talked about wanting more delegation back to as it was I love the back to the future thing that Janet mentioned but greater delegations to the community boards and I honestly don 't know if the other community boards are as good as hagley ferry made community board but if they are or too safe pair of hands are they no I 've the kickboard issues we 're here on behalf of anyway so that was in the long-term plan and some place the reference to community board so we 're just saying that we do we do support that and an increase in counselors I don 't know but I think something we have a representation review to deal with that so yeah I know I just don 't want you to run out of time in 30 minutes okay I 'm sorry the cycleway is very important and I 've highlighted some of those things here and particularly in what we 've talked about as a groat is moving people who live in the central city around the central city instead of a focus on getting people in and out of the central city which also is important but we want to make it attractive for families and other people to live in the central city and you do not want them driving around in the central city if at all possible so I 've had that listed here the goal of more people more people including families living in the I 've got four bullet points there of not only do we need to encourage people to come to the central city but we really need to encourage them to stay and there are some things currently some under council control and some not that are discouraging that and it 's just trying to mitigate I suppose where possible affordable housing we 've even had tears over when we have seen affordable housing in our own neighborhood disappearing and million-dollar-plus townhouses going up in their place on my own in my own block there are examples where it did not it does not even make for greater intensification which is one of the goals of government as well as local government and I 've given you some examples there and I could give you more the red zone we did talk about a bit and my own personal opinion obviously it wants to be used for something there are some examples there covered market yes have we put in many submissions on that wherever possible and I want to finish by just stealing burnaby i believe was the name Burnaby that one in two here in the covered market as well markets there I 've got that one in here we love the cupboard back that wheel of the car right okay no thank you magic it 's um I 'm sorry that mean this I keep apologizing for the process but due to the number of submissions we have five minutes for investors in team of other organisation to thank you thank you very much _"

feel free to sit down if you like oh yeah okay oh it 's good to see progress in the city and there 's a lot of good things happening the bus exchange I notice the Brits are the entire boat sheds excellent and I think we we do forget that a bit I know there 's massive problems but there is good progress out some of the bridge there and here 's my bullet points christchurch cathedral don 't demolish at all not for Warren 's plan or anything just fix it town hall fix it rugby stadium give the green light to civic assurance to fix the existing stadium or have a rebuild at lancaster part nowhere else that swept should be and possibly build a lower profile modern stadium capacity 25,000 littleton port build a terminal for cruise liners we 've got a very high paid they should have got onto this long ago bill determine for cruise liners with people friendly waterfront areas the old T kiosk in the Botanic Gardens fix it this is being done great um Victoria Square fix the bell curve fountain one of the prime attractions of Christ shirts when I first immigrated here mm-hm do not read this redesign the skip the victoria square which is an award of winnings winnings square its internationally famous and it 's part of Christ it that has not been substantially damaged it 's one of our beer for green spaces it 's not a 4-quart to some massive convention center okay just keep it as it is save 10 million dollars it 's an obvious on found convention center this is justice seduced and redesigned to half the size and don 't start for five years this is one of these ones that 's not even nice to have in the present scale its dominating the whole central city like a massive big city more bit stuffed full of shops and and it 's not really benefiting Christ benefiting Christ chips initially no council financial or other support and partly and by ivan river the red zone yes great Metro sports facility put on hold and discuss its design and our actual needs the earthquake memorial that is spend 11 million dollars worried the people in the city are a memorial but we need to have maybe we definitely need something that we can remember these people who are part of us I suggest the fountain in the square and a bronze plaque with knows we don 't necessarily want Jerry 's choice you know you get six options narrow it down we met to discuss it and then they rubber stamp the one they wanted in the first place with a Slovenian designer with big massive Italian marble you know it 's it 's not a good idea it 's like the flag issue give you six options pick one of these scrape the old thing no um so so we are a memorial pin it 's up to us not to Jerry Brown need to bulldoze us into some expensive option the Art Center it 's being fixed and that with the cathedral now we 've got extra lean bacon because we might have a great big white elephant stadium so with all that land we can use this land for urban housing and populate the central city so breast fix up high street it 's the link to the politic this makes is that he come alive yep there 's lots of good things happening around the the stadium you know it could escalate the way it 's happened like in Dunedin we 're looking at maybe five hundred million dollars you know you just take that off the bank we don 't need it so we 've saved that money no crisis no need to sell assets no need to jack up rates too ridiculous proportions this is just a big vanity project put on us by John Key and Bob Parker we don 't need it I 'm a rubbery thing I regularly go and support the Crusaders and Cantebury and I love our teams but um this is a dumb idea okay to move the redbury Stadium as we know we 're dealing with Tony Mary got reappointed but nevertheless if you go ahead and go to a new site and we 'll get a reduced payment you 're losing money it 's it 's like the bishop spending money and the transitional cathedral which should have been spent in the square so basically on the city assets do not sell any of the crotchet city council assets they are our future earnings it was brainless to split them up and lose control of them so i 'll just quickly go over the city assets no no I 'm sorry it would come to the end of your time so but but you you 've spelt them out in your submission that assets and you 've been explicit about what they include so okay I do appreciate this I just like to make one less you can make one last comment thank you this deal was made by Bob parents council a team with Prime Minister John Key to build big expensive prestige projects such as the stadium and the giant convention center this council is not bound by that shonky deal we are not burn we do not need to have deep piled on us for things we don 't need and then this is used as an excuse to sell our assets okay so I stand by the counselors and that group of councillors it suggests an alternate budget I don 't see it splitting I think it 's providing an alternative view and not just those Curtis but all accounts was good on you for putting the time into our city thank you thank you very much much appreciated Marjorie _"

    "text": "erotic I don 't um I 'm gonna have a bit of a rant personally and then I 'm going to talk a little bit to the Center for Christ 's into the city making an architecture that we 're part of I realized just on the way here that effectively most of what I 'm going to say comes n is in this book yes I might actually can I just make this mess admission sorry can I just make this the submission squishy seasoning ma 'am we 've got about 50 essays together last year which was a particular of the recovery plan so I massive amount of what we 're going to say is considered and thoughts are in there you can 't cancel a brief mangie wrote one of the chapters so I will circulate that two colleagues along has anything McLeod run to certain Rebecca McPhee David Shepherd lots of people yeah it 's a fantastic as a round of you I 've got a copy of my am officer fini my monster borrow it um so firstly I 'm Barnaby I am an architect including this one about the transitional city and i 'm doing a PhD looking at temporary architecture in the public firstly thanks to the council for i guess i 'm getting attempting to get your house in order and and being honest with the public i really think the the sort of secrecy is probably the most destructive thing that 's happened in the last four years and amazes me these delays to the anchor projects without any reasons why so thanks have been honest and in terms of my recommendation for the asset sales de can you continue to be honest I don 't have an ideological issue with the idea of asset sales but I think each case needs to be made and the idea that there 's either a yes or a No sort of seems ridiculous i think a JC it needs to be considered in the argument made to the public so with that in mind I don 't see why most of them can 't wait three years till the next round of consultation and then will they have a lot more confidence about is that maybe a few things within the three years but then the three years when this happens again is probably the time to go back to the public with some really strong ideas I think it 's time to push back against the government and following refs comments on Campbell over last night I think there 's some key points where it 's time that now the council 's got some serious understanding of its own numbers and I think there 's a real unwillingness and lack of capacity and the government to really consult meaningfully think the council needs to push back on the metro sports on the convention center on the stadium and I 'm also thinking about the residential red zone with it in 20 years I think it 's really going to be the residential red zone that defines the city and the council needs to be leading and the people need to be leading they 're not the government I see there 's six hundred million dollars in the budget for suburban infrastructure development and I wonder if some of that shouldn 't be some of that a mess of a manner that will be as a result of the red zoning in the population movement and I thank the council 's been six hundred million dollars a lot and that 's the real cost of suburban development I think the council needs to be careful not to just this is very hard than you know it 's an extraordinarily difficult process you 're going through but just not to fight fires and really put some vision in place for the next 10 15 20 50 years and not get caught an endless arguments about things like convention centers so I think participation is a huge thing I know there 's been a lot of talk about participatory democracy but we need to see some action on that and some real real progress and some expertise bought into that around ecology I think there 's that I think that 's the story of Christchurch to me as the ecology and environmental and all the deep knowledge and the communities here transport the cycling 's great but I 'd love to see the the an at in the next few years so it can be built in eight or nine years and happens rather than its thought about nine years and point off for another 10 years the council 's actually been really lucky to have yarn girl and air Phil architects in the last four or five years looking at the city and I would recommend to go back and see what they 've said they 're both incredibly well regarded very high quality architects and urban designers who have thought a lot about the city and a lot of what needs to happen is encoded and what they said one recommendation I 'd heathers don 't believe the developers about the parking crisis developers were always want more parking and it 's actually a really poisonous thing for a city to endlessly follow that and I think what they needs to be is more stability around the parking it 's hard to orientate around the city at the moments of people don 't know where the packing is but it 's there and also there needs to be parking I think four groups people with children may be there be a permit system where they can come into the city and park easily so people over the age of 70 or kids or something but the idea that free or completely free easily accessible partner to be there for everyone is incredibly destructive and we know that anne-girl architects would say that so at the center of a city making for architecture let 's emerging this year and it 's based from the transitional movement it 's going to be much more broader and permanent it 's going to be independent it 's going to try and bridge between expert knowledge and community and local knowledge and we 're going to be doing a whole lot of kinds of conversations workshops festivals exhibitions with hosted one Christchurch conversations and there 's an exhibition opening in a couple of months called people building better cities which is a coming from global studio which has done a whole lot of work with communities around the world and there 's a big exhibition it 's going to be launched in late July very quickly the two support for transitional funds it 's critical and is becoming more critical not less as time goes on and then there needs to be an integrated arts plan has been too long without one or anyone yep look perfect timing wish we had time for more of a conversation but unfortunately that 's what the Centers for so we 'll around yeah and and look forward to that people building better cities that sounds really good so thank you for everything that you do for our city battery and and for all of the people that also are making our city what it is at the moment and that transition stuff that you 've mentioned us as I mean that 's what 's putting us on the world stage so thank you very much i carrying part of that _"

    "text": "I 'm not sure if we 've got robbed beachy Eric smart Rory Jones no Janet big if you could come forward good morning all and thank you so much for the consultation document which I really thoroughly enjoyed reading every bit of it I don 't get to the great big thing of course this I would love to see this wonderful picture of a giraffe and a crane together on the wall somewhere big bold it really spelled out for me what Christ reaches its full of get up and go and do it wonderful now when it comes to selling the assets I just want to repeat up to on hanlon sleep wrote in his song for the New Zealand values party and nineteen seventies we do not inherit the world from our fathers we borrow it from our children thank you so rise up christchurch till next victim is thinking right now proven to help sorry on page 3 i 've talked about keeping our assets and I 've just sort of repeated all the things that the green Carter you have said and that has i agree with everything that they are saying I really do and I think we 've got some great ideas of how you can keep the assets and still have still be afloat now my major passion of courses public transport and so I yes I 'm really talking to the people who are on the mayoral forum our own wonderful mere and our own CEO I think that you are the people who who will be able to provide for me my one wish which is that we should have a and integrated independent a public transport board i 'm calling it a board rather than authority it 's my way getting around it because we didn 't have a great christchurch transport board which worked very well and even though the union said it worked well with a rien bus only so i guess i really want to go back to the future you 're here and that 's probably so so please will everybody support the idea of having it integrated I think it 's really really important because every time I try to speak to somebody a TK my right to win canon EK months later they all know that 's not as it should be the council heartless and don 't sell real bus but heaven um as a partnership with the three greater Christ groups council this so that we can own our own transport own public transport I have some problems with the my next-door neighbor which is the crisis of the council 's own pseudonym symmetry it 's got a dictator for it for an arborist who won 't even allow the the lovely landscape architect to say what she wants and I 've just been talking with mr. pyramid as well about Varrick trees etc we would many of us would like to have fruit trees and nut trees in our sibling symmetry which is going to have a new escape plan coming up but Abigail tells me know that the armor of seeds we can 't_''_228.66 do that because we 'll get rates are set for when we 've had we 've got 20 we 've got 20 walnut trees they 're already those been here for about 40 years we could have some good fruit trees around Maria there I think it would be a brilliant idea how do we do over having somebody who 's a total dictator about an area that would be part of the community help and I think I 've made a bit of a blue about talking about them the poor little cell when street here I see that I 've got an idea that I would like to see a council swap the area that they 've got that just right alongside Brown Street as a reserve it for another part that 's now up for releasing with lithography I 've enjoyed that would make a much better area for you and put shops etc against wrong Street I don 't live there but I go past fear every day and I just feel it it really would like to have something happening something nice Jenna can I ask you a question before you run out of time oh yes please please i just want to know what you and your neighbors want to adopt the sudden I 'm sent symmetry I through it has been adopted by the summerfield Residents Association right so so you could work in partnership with tried right right so so we no no no we can 't talk about people that work for the council so I 'm and I 'm sure you meet that in a lot of adorable but a loving way and and in the set but what you were saying was that she 's utterly passionate about about the type of tree that needs to be there but you 'd like to work in partnership as a community with the council to reflect on whether with proper management and care in place you could actually change the type of trees that are there there is a new plan coming up right we 're not privy to you oh no no no no but you but you are the Friends of the cemetery you should be proud of it thank you so much I forget I think we can find a solution to this and I 've been to the community board and asked them and they don 't know anything about what thing ok well the chief executive is writing it down so it 's not a secret anymore it 's a lovely area and it 's you so much we 're for walking and taking their dogs and and it 's very friendly places I know we had a similar conversation with people who live around the cemetery in the center of town so and we 've also were they even he 'd Residents Association exactly the same conversation about the cemetery there so there is a there is a close association between cemeteries and and their local communities because yeah for lots of obvious reasons but look thank you very much and I often see you at the back of the room and end you you are always smiling so I just wanted to say thank you so much for presenting and thank you for honoring their immature artists who were the photographer 's for this this was a competition this was the winner and the one that you chose was was in the final in the finalists so yeah thank you for noticing and for bringing pleasure to our Barnaby Bennett and I expect the same from you having read that

    "text": "First Community Network lender Godric and I 'm only muy cállate I 'm the manager of the Belfast community network but I 've kind of been away over season he just got back on Thursday so just saw the emails to come along so well I 'm representing our own organization I 'm also here to represent the neighborhood trust northgate services freedom trust to Anna ho Shirley Community Trust papanui youth trust and Bishop Dahl Community Trust so we are a group of North called Northwest collective who are working hard to work collectively together as group standing on our own doing our own thing so I 'm imagine you 've had a lot of community groups in here overpass since you bet I am doing submissions and Messick concern around community hunting you know about the mistake though don 't hear that it was a mistake that the two percent cuts were put under the budget we 've decided not to proceed with that recommendation that came through the activity management plan and it was a mistake that it went through but a number of groups have taken kind of associated because we have a review that we 're planning well which is being undertaken at the moment which is to build resilience and a number of groups have actually taken the opportunity to talk about community resilience and the context of funding is a partnership and some have mentioned that what was called the neighborhood matching fund from Seattle and others have talked about a sort of a cooperative relationship where the council funds part but the community contributes and you started off by talking about how all of your groups have come together to do things for yourself said you want to talk about where I will talk about that so we 've been doing this for a year now and it 's through funding from MSD through farm family community services and it 's it 's brought our groups together our managers particularly because we don 't have a HR departments and we don 't have legal firms to support ourselves so what we 've found from this work has been absolutely incredible for the support towards our organizations and their professionalism and making us 're trying to do when it comes to budgets and we know we know the road ahead for the city and you know maybe you could get some tips from how community groups have run forever on the smell of an oily rag and still give the good stuff out to the people and to those that you know were there for so this work has what the seven groups has we 're all got you know there 's youth group says community development groups there 's all sorts of groups with earners collective so we are working really strongly to just be better and become more professional in our organizations in the northwest of the city while we understand now about the to defend and I 'm really pleased about the whole funding thing but our costs have gone up and considerably for lots of groups you know there 's so much increase in our in our costs so we 're trying to find ways we 've all put to get an out and instead of it costing around 12,000 to bring all of our policies together for example group and then we all added our policies together so it only cost us around 3,000 instead of crossing of 3,000 for each organization to do that cost us three thousand all up we 're going to be working under the same kind of templates in the future which means that when we want to do other we don 't know where this is going to grow and image they are pretty excited about it but it just means in the future our Stephen organizations which is probably ated to Center for the northwest of the Shirley papanui ward we 're all going to be kind of working the same and we hope that 's going to make things better for the future for our organizations but I really just wanted to be here to say you know our organizations that I 've named we are supportive of the work that is going council we know how tough at us because we 're the ones out there at the coalface working with the people that have elected you so we know the pain that everyone is still suffering hmm if would really assist what would what would that be I would we 've talked about this what we would like to see is more decision-making coming from our community board and from our local staff I think that 's you know we work so well with our staff and they all work across we know a process city you know they are the ones that know the local staff that knowing people yeah brilliant answer Glenn thank you for God if I could just ask a question just to change tack a bit then then thank you you 've been around a long time right from the word go with Belfast Community Network pre and post quake could you give us an idea of some of the more noticeable kind of social trend become apparent so there already were yeah stresses on people prior to the quote so what we 've just got we 've just had the crush each community you know its recent Christopher 's go and doing the door knocking so that was just done before i leave to go and leave what they quickly came back that I 've door knocked every house in and Belfast and I 'll get the update when I get that to work next week but they 're just saying this just angry people they knocked on doors to say how are you and people are angry this is angry I 'm Ellie coming from I mean we all had day think maybe isolation that 's loneliness it 's just over things I 'm not putting words into your mouth and again I 'm not doing this for political yeah is it to do with broken roads as it to do with earthquake and eq c claims as it was that coming through yes it is it seems to what it is yeah stage of grant yeah and I mean I 'm Belfast isn 't a particularly broken community so if it 's like that here I don 't know what it 's like crossing the Civil Ward 's hmm and the tired yeah needed juniper question I just I just um you kind of said no you understand we 're not cutting the community funding but then you talk and that you 've also going to comment on CDC and see it in the tourism and you may not be a with their inflation adjusted every year saudia grats and real terms go out do you think we need to inflation adjust the communities grass because we have progressively been cutting them not even allowing to Indian absolutely on it and I mean we 're really sick of paying our staff peanuts for the work that they do you know I don 't think anyone would hear would work for it and do the work and we can 't just all keep doing it for love but it 's because people still have children to put through education you know and hard to find me into working out and our sector because there 's some enough money for them to raise a family yeah and so our funding has an increased fit well I 've been around searching know every year council this color yes and even the other funders you know you 're finally out with all other funders we 're not the main Thunder nice no buts across yeah community work seems to be right down there yes Jermaine hey the question a one question yo group olympia 1st committee may work on represent a 15 real fast cook your kind of service all the information the provision have whether or how to coordinate with the counselor community development coordinator and also you mentioned earlier would like to have more dedicated to the local community cision making you know I hope for the implementation of how to make it take well I 'm not sure what the processes are completely but I can 't understand why funding can 't_''_524.19 be brought back to just totally done by the staff at and you know in each ward I know it 's it 's split up and make it 's not a huge amount i 'm on that you know there 's cogs which is a community organization grads dia funding board you know they have about three staff that manage it it 's got a fantastic system going at the moment we can be making our own decisions amongst ourselves as well has small branches to be wrong pauline good community garden up the main Lestrade what 's the State Attorney 's bottle no we 've moved it to the school yeah so we 've moved it to the school now so nice and disrepair a wee bit but you know we 'll get on to it I think when we when we live where it was it just kind of really hot all over we 're a true does no good I know so we 've moved it to the school now so yeah got big dreams for it you think it 's cool absolutely so would you find there might be a benefit in having a ward a community garden coordinator perhaps too absolutely someone that could actually get some time to pulling things together that would be fantastic yeah sure okay well I 'm afraid it 's um we 're at the end okay thank you very much our doing a great job and you know lots of our groups to appreciate it is think all the recent decision making thank you _"

    "text": "I 'm married the order everyone on I 've got a small group 82 themed around I would shun shun will come and take that off here and pass it around okay I 'm writing the food groups for people to pass to each other I did prepare a powerpoint but I won 't use it because I want to be more brief of America pen as I was sitting there the edge you win some you lose some came to mind as first of all several people went over time and then a couple of people weren 't here so I was feeling good when they weren 't here because it mean I wasn 't going to be who delayed I was born here a little over 70 years ago and many of my ancestors made contributions to the city that I benefit from they made those contributions from their commerce and from the way they lived and from the things they left for us over and above the fact that they just paid their own rates so I want to make comments about two of the issues i all I believe we must retain significant assets in public ownership we 're talking about the long-term here I 'm happy to answer questions about that the returns need to be for the public good and not the private few and policy changes need to be free of constraints to give a profit to shareholders some of you are on the environment committee now we 're you say all sorts of good things about the air but how about a district energy scheme actually getting underway and you can have your private public partnerships with that and at present because things seem to be going slow I know of at least one large organization that 's thinking of putting a cold boiler and when they were considering something more sustainable so I 'd like you to get on with their when I was growing up here and 10 years old my grand board me a bicycle wouldn 't be unreasonable to say that I 've been passionate about cycling for the last 60 years I own five four of them were second hand in fact one of them was bought now the thing out of Brighton I cycled the hospital and doctors appointments meetings I cycled here this morning I 've taken four of my grandchildren to and from preschool as they work their way through basically I cycled to get around cycling contributes to a healthy population saves on climate changing emissions takes up less parking space in town not to mention leaving more roading available for public transport and those who really must use a private car but over the years traffic on the roads has increased in the roads have become much less safe the number of cyclists killed by vehicles has increased even when they 're trying to do what they should with high visibility clothing and so on and my partner who 's equally concerned about the future really cycles on the roads because she doesn 't feel safe so my plea to you make provisions for cycling a priority you must do this to make cycling and all the other advantages that brings a reality for the city I 'm mindful that there 's a group that have started the Christchurch coastal pathway project won 't personally benefit from it where I live but i think the will benefit from it I was interested in that last submitters talking about gardening and community gardens I think it 's relevant to intensified housing sorry I took up more time than I mean time for one more question Phil mainly that we have started a district a district in in the scheme we have started that done and we could talk to get offline but also if someone 's going to put a big cold a coal burner you could perhaps talk to me offline to be up there too cool thing like thank you excellent good look thank you Thank You Don sorry to keep you waiting um it 's never easy to message these no I think you 've managed most of it fairly well so far thanks Don thank you _"

back with my phone 's not charged right ok so now we 'll call forward eight it should hurt does it sorry just anyway Adrian sisson good morning i 'm sorry i only made up my mind late this morning to come in and you wouldn 't want clapping by notes because i can have you reading this is not the first time I 've spoken to counsel regarding what I believe unsustainable rate increases Vicky buck was me and the first time I spoke I came along for my mother frankly she lived in a very modest fled up Salieri 's avenue in who rates at that stage or about fifteen percent of our income in nothing 's changed along it 's not just the Christchurch City Council 's all capsules around New Zealand every year rate increases way beyond the inflation rate put him and I the website just just to have a look what the increases are going to mean for the emotive the next few years I 've got some friends in mccord straight there presently paying 50 right just over 5 grand x 18 they 'll be paying eight thousand four hundred and fifty percent increase team street which was a summer house my son owned a dat screen reader house and marry her now it was revalued so that the percentage rate there they were paying 27 it 's going to go to 440 61 percent increase my sister 's in a very modest house in newland street and she 's unaffected income over in newland street in hoon hay presently paying 1545 so who rates are not high but they 're going to go to 2255 this is by 2018 forty-six percent increase another another friend again in a very modest house but the house was revalued presently paying 7 8 17 86 getting to go to 32 dear rate increase by 18 will be 79 descent my own property I 'm lucky I 'm quite wealthy live in a very by 2018 my rates will be 19 green going to get five thousand dollars now I 'm more than aware of the effect that rates are having on people around New Zealand I run a small finance company we have mortgages on people 's places in you guys may or may not know that if borrowers don 't pay their rates we have to pay their rates you make demand on us and if we don 't pay we get a judgment against us so there will be very few days of the week and we don 't have a big loan book where I don 't have accounts for somewhere in New Zealand make demand on me the bank of new zealand in auckland have four full-time people handling rate demands made by councils around New Zealand on the borrower 's that 's the situation and this I mean you gotta lean brown up in organs working team percent increases on on rates it 's just it 's unsustainable and I want to measure over the last few days that there 's been any number of groups individuals a to do this please mr. council do this everyone 's got and all you guys have got special interests we you 'd love to see the council spend money Vicki you 're well known before you was Gary Moore but social housing over there council Livingston Everett DMSO rule he wanted this big bus Fenian hundred million dollars it everyone 's got the especial thing they 'd love to see that I think I think councils are no different from a family mom dad and two cats in most of us had children kids won 't won 't won 't won 't want and money only goes so far and I think councils are no different you 've got a budget council seems complete and not just crush at City Council governments anywhere in the Western will I completely just cannot budget they 're just the weed lived in a world where it 's a western-style world where we tax and spend it 's unsustainable I mean basically the whole Western world is deep funded and you all know the music is running out Greece is bust Italy as bust that are insolvent they 're not being run by councillors they 've been bent run by statutory managers and long term and it won 't happen in Christchurch over the next decade might take two or three decades but it 's some sage this council if it carries on the ways at the moment it will be insolvent kept over these are my right he knows this the ability of of ratepayers took to pay rates his plant out look what happened bar got Thatcher which in boarding the poll tax you know she got beaten up very badly and at some stage if you guys don 't think there 's going to be a race revolt in this in this city you 're dreaming there will be a race for evolved in two ways one people just won 't pay and their people aren 't paying in New Zealand now they 're not paying the right step all there will be an actual rates revolt where people just say stuff it or give you my rates and one percent i 'm not paying nine percent you can 't keep not earning an extra nine percent each year and you 've got a damaged city this city is as beaten up as cities were off a second world war in Europe it took I mean they still doing repairs in some cities over there now we can 't fix the city up in a decade or two decades or three decades going to take a long time and that 's the message you 've got to give to all these people who want one thank you very much if it was pretty loud and clear thank you I 'm _"

    "text": "so our gym trippin more than one morning I 'm glad you opened with that thing about the five minutes because I 'm quite very unhappy about this as it is because I believe you would move have not engaged properly in your own policy your own policies about an significance of engagement I only discovered on this report today that you said that you would engage and I 've only found us today and you didn 't with all of us and democracy really demands which i allude to in my submission several times demands that we should be things papi by allocating five minutes you 've reduced us all to the lowest common denominator now I may be that with regards to this thing but if I am then you fail badly on the time that you should give us to present our cases the system itself doesn 't allow me to question you to engage so I have no idea what you think I have no idea where I 'm going wrong you don 't have time to question me because my five minutes will be up so all I 'm going to say as I as I go ahead and try and highlight my seven pages it took me two or three days of research and the preparation that you may limit me to the small amount of time to try and do something if you don 't ask me anything all agree I 'll have to accept that you agree with what I say no that 's not appropriate I 'm sorry that we have got five minutes and I explain why can you answer a question for me though before you use any more time did you receive a letter from the council 's management and relation to and the proposed changes after they were published in the LTP and were you invited to a public meeting in any way shape or form I was invited to one for the whole general crowd is said women I was invited I got it I saw it and something the newspaper something and I went to the rickland service center right and Vicki buck was there and she told me I didn 't even know it interesting so you did receive a letter and did not individually oh I don 't recall individually that I looked up there are things and paper weren 't there and things like that so it 's going to be public meetings here this is just the whole things right right and I 'll read along so it was only to discuss the LTP not to discuss this was a gross the old TV it wasn 't a special meeting for the out for them it wasn 't a special meeting for the rural differential I should know it wasn 't three times now no no I wanted you to say it three times if all here said okay no no so it 's just that because you 've referred to this document I 'm not taking this off your time so can you just stop the clock from enough management plans to write to all identified property owners in advance to ensure that they have an opportunity to provide a submission to the LTP you received an individual letter ah dude and I haven 't_''_200.19 I haven 't seen a draft have you got a copy up to what was the one who should look was that with a little raw n tastic if we could get a copy of their got to read it now and in consideration be given to holding public meetings where there are material number of effective rate pairs in a neighborhood but you weren 't invited to a meeting in your neighborhood specifically for this purpose it was for the purpose of the LTP generally yes and you went along to talk about this issue at a general meeting on the LTP right and was that really the main reason that people turned up we write but we had the same restrictions there if you recall Vicky the Chairman or the facilitator there was a guy idea who is outside the count Giles the facilitator or something like that he said if someone 's already spoken please don 't speak we 've got to go through a lot of things so I didn 't for because some two or three people got up before me and said that 's spoken so I actually spoke of the city assets but I and I said something there well I agree forget the stadium that can wait for many years you know what I 'd like to submit it on a lot more but I had this in front of me right okay all right so I 'm we 're gonna get a copy of for this earth and a whole lot of Moore 's crawlings over if we could start the clock all over again is it all right be fun I 'm gonna spoil it for years no no I got back to the game can you go back to five yep reset we go oh ho enjoy I seek removed with that part of the plan the reckonings changes to the rural differential Reagan policy is shown on page 9 + 86 the smart choices this has been heard before the council many times before the latest in 2002 and 2004 and the good reasons they were rejected then I rejected down I believe they still remain today this was a staff initiated policy i believe which is supposed to be riven revenue neutral our time doing it when you 've got so many more things to do with the critical to the city than this I 've presented some figures of the air to say that it 's effing too small that was effect as if it is revenue neutral whatever how to fix as other people it 's based on a contestable an arbitrary land the area which the council has over many years put out contradictory things on it when they 've looked it up and as I say and as we just talked about it 's done without prior consultation and the group I believe that we would have fit it into your significance and engagement policy because a thousand residents over a million dollars with the thing i believe is significant so I believe in not Racine has been being taken to knock on the head here and it 's quite contrary in many ways to have our law operates there was going to be in mandatory introduction of this so we 're guilty before even denison now law says that we should be proved guilty before before we going to be embracing overall on everybody and then they 've got to do the other way around now the differential rule rating policy I think most of your counselors here and certainly staff won 't know the background to it well it came in about nineteen eighty nine when about four or five different things were merged into the greatest city and it was to reflect the mainly rural aspect to those other things other counties other the City Council other authorities than that and that seems as I say I somewhere you 'll find that there 's supposed to be 548 properties and I see in this thing that Ross presented today that they 're all going to be charged rates again that 's a misnomer I think it 's misleading but when you look at that it probably fits in with the policy of five acres being the lower limit not to hit there 's not five years and it 's quite interesting I find that where the queer included in this policy I 'm I was referred to a residential primary residential thing in 2006 it who presumably had taken the not in 2004 when it was proved when it was found that the existing policy was correct what is clear though that rural activities that cannot happen in town do happen on rural properties and that 's what defines them now I 've gone on to explain why the differential I won 't go through it again and I 'm not allowed to ask you know if I 'm you disagree with them so I 'll just passed over I do list a number the other of your irrelevant Weehoo Ross say before something about why shouldn 't why Mary and sell when and all that pay pay rates if they use the facilities and we 've been asked will you live in the country it doesn 't matter what you should still pay for the sillies in town if you don 't use them well we pay for them every time we buy a cup of coffee every time we go in and get a puncture appeared on our 30 every time everybody plays rates even people who are in their houses who aren let 's don 't come back with that question for me I won 't dwell too much on the arbitrary selection of the criteria Bruce five acres 10 acres 100 acres whether it 's operated on a full part time basis but with regards the capital value you if you do things on a capital value and I don 't know what The Rock Creek thurs you penalize people for bettering themselves so so person gets their property and they get a nicer house they work hard they do that so they suddenly rise above this mythical figure and so yes a bang you 're out right you can 't_''_570.42 do you stop working stop being a good citizen and anyway for interests sake just say rape Perry out in the country is predominantly residential they shouldn 't they should have it anyway they miss all these other things that have itemized out there before they are in the country they are residential now the disproportionate burden on rural ratepayers you 'll see my analysis I hope at point five where I 've analyzed the general rating system and the rates they pay on the general rate and you work out too many variations as you like but you can see that rule rate payers who represent 1.9 for one point nine percent the total rate payers at the present time even with the differential pay two point five percent of the rates they 're already paying a huge burden advance if you remove this this this thing and put the 13 cents a week back on the resident the town won 't ones they 'll be paying 2.3 times the amount of rates average of a residential down intent now that 's persecution in some ways now I know that you 're burdened with the system of rating on property but really people use people use the services people use things and this is only on average as many people in a rural property as there isn 't as a residential and town property so it 's hardly fear and so I 'd say leave it alone in now the auroral property is already precluded from the differential and you 've heard that there 's 548 and if you look at the analysis that I 've done of those properties at my point six where ah well I won 't go through it again you have a look I believe only a hundred and eight of them may qualify not the 500 for that so there 's been with some misleading things given to you in my view it 's best leading in your smart choices list where it says they 're all going to get it now having said this I do understand that the council staff and you guys as well have been under immense pressure with the earthquake and everything and these things can be missed and and I 'm sorry but still not a very good look as far as I 'm considered ah I I have allowed you know plenty of extra time to make up for the interruption which we are analyzing and which we will certainly feedback to you it is the council 's attention to feedback to all of the submitters we 've got written submissions as well as oral ones the points that you 've made in your submission you taking all of these matters into account as we deliberate on what is as you 've identified on your last comments a a pretty hard set of decisions that we need to make but thank you very much I think you 've you 've presented the case on this extremely well we 've got a much better understanding of the sequence of events and fantastic that you are able to bring the actual letter to confirm that it didn 't reference a particular public meeting for you to a team so I think that 's been a an excellent submission and but I need to move on to the next one we 've got people who have been invited to present as well they need to be given the opportunity to do so thank you I 'm sorry I didn 't have a lit time to engage with you all I know and we reduction but but actually actually you did engage with us and you have made a one shorter than guys you 've made a very significant difference no we asked you for information you gave it a good _"

    "text": "thank you very much for shuffling your order unfortunately I have to go to a friend 's funeral this morning and I am a pallbearer at that so you know I 'm really sorry about that and thank you for coming in anyway you know and I want to cut quickly to the questions you 've got my submission at the end of that submission that talks about the future cathedral square things might have to be done I 'd be quite happy to use the five minutes or the four minutes and heart but it 's left for questions and I would then respond to those it 's time of FL thank you Chris thank you becoming circumstances to view and Dibble points1 you refer to delaying repair of heritage buildings rather than knocking them down and starting a new in any particular buildings or areas that you would like to use as examples there there are buildings suit you I think you 've already indicated that you 're going to put on hold and I would agree with that with that process that the old government buildings and up against the elements and they won 't deteriorate too badly if I was representing Christ it 's difficult up is saying we really miss the heritage buildings that have come down we want to minimize that if we can minimize it by delaying the process so that they can be repaired that is all all to the good we 've lost too much of our heritage already tentacles yep Ali but and crosses area of expertise transport yeah i was reading your opinion editorial personal around the time that the e can review or investigation into short-term rail transport particularly for the northern I stitute show isn 't about februari I 'm awful I hear from people who know great deal more than me that it is it is cost prohibitive based purely on the lake of population and so forth however in your opinion editorial you do say from memory that you think we need to yes I am absolutely determined that you 'll pee someone is going to look at that he was in a decision-making situation to me it 's quite a no-brainer that we have can push a lot of people through that corridor on the rail system without come conflict with other forms of traffic the capital costs for changing what we got there to what we need to be able to get a commuter service going compares very favorably when you start looking at building many ways mm that 's a short answer I can give you a lot more I ask because of our ward particularly in the North being affected by the northern arterial and the Lannisters and the cost of the road of national civic listen to me to me the idea of looking at a temporary improvement to it to put a passenger rail service on then can it again when you 've got the motorways back is very very limited thinking I 'm wonder what is between the ears sometimes anyone else got any questions Yanni thank you relevant to to that um to your submission in terms of fearing deferring things um just and talking about the this anyway so excuse me while I get my G Anita Gary um no it 's just I was just in the city but a number of similars have said that they 've said just renegotiate with government but that doesn 't involve the community that doesn 't that isn 't necessarily done through any public process and so if you go back to the cost yet was done in secret so I just wonder with a use you feel that there 's a need to actually reengage with the community over the future of our central city and the prioritization of of the costs I do and in the process if we 're looking at Cathedral Square in particular I think it 's time for you as leaders of our city to perhaps engage with the public again and maybe a focus share an idea on the on the on the on the cathedral square if you are going to countable go along with shifting the primary focus at cathedral square as a meeting and greeting place and civics functions space and putting that into Victoria Square and to change Victoria Square to do that you are consigning obviously concerning cathedral square to a very uncertain future and you so yes please re-engage listen to your public and and talk to them to the government that 's great I don 't think there 's anyone around the table that would disagree with it so thank you very much I did do a little supplementary which you can my yep really just saying what I was going to do yeah go for questions we 'll have that will help it but thank you very much for that I mean this is not a satisfactory process and I don 't think that anyone thinks that it is so we will see what we can do be when your officers have been gauged with other professional bodies like the institution of engineers and others like that we have a forum downstairs and we have a good half an hour or an hour or so of discussion that 's pretty well we wanted to have a forum to deal with thought of the new brush and ones that it was misunderstood as being treated differently from everyone else so unfortunately not everyone is in the same head spaces of others but perhaps a much better idea you 're quite right thank you thank you very much _"

    "text": "okay so i want to get underway straight away o course that is really good ok so maybe crystals yep yep yep it 's fun ok so we 're going to have a bit of a change around with some of the order but we 'll start with ross mcfarland and and then we 'll move on to cross kissling who is 129 64 which has clear the down the submission page so on your submission page at 9 45 will go straight to their so i 'll just give a preliminary introduction there there are none of us around this table that think that a five-minute submission process is sensible but it is the only way that we can get through the 600 submissions that we 've got i think that a number of people have kind of regretted not grouping under particular issues and and and presenting a combined submission because you know sort of 15 minutes with a group of submitters is actually a better way of getting a point across but we have what we have and i 've been saying to people that are in take a little bit of extra time but actually present so that we 're not hearing the same submission over and over and over again you know sort of you know i don 't think any of us are particularly stupid and we do get points and they don 't need to be repeated but we have what we have so i 'm going to hand over to you miss MacFarlane and far away aight committees for the drainage in the area my presentation today is on the twenty five percent rural rates differential on asset sales and briefly on another subject wishes and my submission the 25 christine rural rate differential increases one line of our ratings 48.2 five percent from two thousand three hundred and forty seven dollars to 3482 dollars i 'm unsure about that people are presented on the subject looking through the agenda today six other people will and quite a few people later in the week rule i take the miRs point that maybe collectively we should have grouped together unfortunately we were never given that opportunity I 've had circulated the briefing papers was followed up by the notification of the largest go back briefing papers to in page next sip published the proposed changes right to all affected ratepayers and organize public meetings of appropriate at five to materialize following the notification belong to plan draft affected ratepayers got a letter on the rates division and that rapes letter at Sid your property may be effective clearly at that point the rates of people knew that one line of the rates built was increasing 48.5 percent the difficulty for this policy as its proposed I come down the street I 11 my neighbors will not pay this rate increase because they are over five hectares I am below five hectares so i will pay the properties beside me are farmed and resided in on a similar manner to what i reside and far more the whole policy was taken from a former policy and quite simply two wrongs don 't make a right on this one it is a huge increase and you will be notified by many other people over the next week or so regarding us I found the policy following the content of March later on the twenty-fourth of a call I received an email reply 24th of April was the friday before Anzac Day submissions closed on the Tuesday it was only when I got that this information I realized the extent of this change and the financial implications on us personally and other ratepayers in a rural area of prestige I gave to the reitz policy manager a number of examples which I believe are a ferret way of approaching us and these were properties in our area also which pay a split rating charge in other words that portion is rural they pay for that this caution is residential they pay for that the statement was I 'm interested in the split rating system of pride for properties you meeting which is something how I have not seen applied to rates before but it 's in our rating documents already although the idea has some appeal I can see it has drawbacks I will say though this frankly would be a significant improvement on the present situation so there 's a policy in place the funds weed with this unnoted bide sorry and consulted policy change I said to him it 's opening a can of worms he said the can is already uncle I said let sleeping dogs lie as with this change 548 people have been overcharged their rates and will require a credit their credit goes back for five years a can of worms as leaders of open two wrongs as I say don 't make a right this whole policy needs to be redressed it is unfair rates are about fairness no one likes to pay rates but all we do and all we ask as we pay their fair share my submission further goes on to capital raising and asset sales another timely topic I put a how would you say a different approach to asset sales as such I believe that the rate payers as owners we own those assets and we if there is sales should be given an opportunity to acquire them if they think if we think there are a significant value similar to how the government sold off her shoes recently we 're also very concerned 80 million dollar payment from Orion to this council to help were too sorry our council to help with our rates is in fact borrowed money the same applies for eight million dollars of red bus money we are borrowing from Peter to pay to Paul I don 't think that 's a good policy at all just another quick mention I 've put in there and my submission and you 've read the greater region there is a lot of services supplied by the city that are used by I 'm a courageous counsel and Selwyn District Council I believe a super City model may enable us to share the burden over a greater number of people over a greater area obviously it 's a top of a wish you an Auckland I 've also mentioned I 'm unlikely to get government how would you say help for us because unfortunately the Y meant district and the selvan District Council that 's two largest majority National Party electrical in the country so I don 't think they are going to be to the of it I 'm just going Peter Garrett midnight oil and helmet to yourselves all day the time has come effects effect we 've got to pay our rent we 've gotta pay a share going back to our issue here is a fair share of the right student which is Miss appropriately applied across the rural sector thank you for your time automate questions no I 'm afraid there isn 't time for quest on sir you went well over the five minutes but I allowed okay we should start with questions allow you to complete well yeah that would be a good idea but I mean we will talk to people that are submitting later in the week and suggest that you know grouping and allowing time for questions would be a much better way of handling at that fire distributed debt briefing paper because unfortunately we didn 't get that till after submissions are closed that 's why we 're coming as individuals I 'm not sure what briefing paper you 're referring to when it was circulated there your briefing paper of the 19th that outlined the initial initially to the council it 's just I didn 't get coach three when it right okay thank you that 's lovely thank you very much cross kiss like _"

    "text": "and our last submission for today is the Canterbury and West Coast branch the Public Health Association Rachel ear and I think Rachel you 've got somebody else with you as well I 'd like to introduce Lee Chucky highly tena koutou katoa firstly I 'd like to acknowledge you all councillors me and stuff it must feel like a very long day and we have a lucky last thank you for the opportunity to talk to our submission and Lee Chucky is the chair of our Public Health Association country West Coast branch and I 'm a committee member and past chair so first I 'd like to talk a little bit about our organization who we are and then just talked to three main themes of our submission and so that I don 't waste your time this evening and the themes are equity or fairness for all healthy environments and future focus so first of all the PHA is a national organization we 've submitted and to the council many times before and we have local branches around the country with the diverse membership and in our improve the health of communities and we contribute to the PHA in a volunteer capacity so for example I 'm a qualified public health specialist and I 'm here on my day off and Lee works for healthy Christchurch and also works in workplace well-being at the DHB so as PHA we 're mainly concerned about improving the conditions of health and wellbeing for the most vulnerable groups in society and we seek to be a strong informed and influential voice and both from an evidence informed research and backed and perspective but also from a values perspective in taking equity as a strong and stand point issues of child health and poverty housing and climate change or among our top priority and we see that local government has a huge role to play in shaping the conditions of and wellbeing for communities healthy places create healthy lives we also see that the rebuild creates a unique opportunity for health to be given explicit consideration and both from an urban design but also from a community psychosocial recovery perspective so I 'll now move quickly to our three themes the fairness for all we acknowledge the challenge this council faces with the first ten year plan in the aftermath of the earthquakes and meeting the costs of a massive infrastructure repair and rebuild with uncertain revenue on the whole we understand the rationale for the ax balanced approach the council has taken however we are really concerned about the impact of future rate rises and the costs increase of everything on pourra individuals families and communities so firstly we urge the council to really look at the expense as part of the balance sheet and think about the big-ticket items such as the anchor projects and question who will benefit and who might not for example it would be awful to see the community suffer death by a thousand cuts so we can have for example a splendid Convention Center used for a handful of events per year but not per year but not access but might buy many of our residents all the more galling when the community was never consulted about these anchor projects in the first place so we would support you to go back to central timing we 'd also like to see more consideration given to expanding rate rebate packages and not mentioned in our submission but an idea well worthy of consideration is the introduction of a local complementary currency for Christchurch as suggested by councillor rad man G which could be used to pay a portion of our rates we don 't want Christchurch citizens paying for things they didn 't want with a diminished ability to afford essentials like power to heat their homes or food to provide an adequate healthy diet or for doctor 's visit the second thing is the council 's ability to shape healthy environments and we 've made a number of recommendations in our submission about how you can create a healthier environment at relatively low cost again if health is given explicit consideration firstly I 'd like to mention tobacco and you will have heard from smoke-free Canterbury earlier today of whose submission we support communities and central government at large support the goal of a smoke-free new zealand by 2025 and currently tobacco is the biggest color soon to be surpassed by obesity and we extending the number of smoke-free public spaces this establishes smoke-free as the norm for our young people growing up and supports an increasing number of ex-smokers to remain smoke-free we hope you will continue to be a strong partner with smoke-free Canterbury and applaud your leadership similar examples on how council can create healthy environments apply to alcohol and obesity can we not do alcohol we won 't yell great for obesity we want to see the cycleway projects completed as soon as possible we want to see a truly integrated approach to travel planning around our city that includes both active and public transport options to all areas and housing is another healthy environment that 's critical to health we support the council 's move to encourage energy efficiency and warmer homes through initiatives like Ross on rental housing and like to see wider use of the Builder back build back smarter program to promote energy efficiency and we want to see the council retain its level of involvement in social housing provision this is a very important safety net for our community our last theme as future focus change has described sorry climate change as the biggest public health challenge we will face in the 21st century how will our communities learn to live with lower emissions and be resilient to the impacts of climate change that are already assured when I moved to Christchurch with my family and twenty 10 I was very excited to be moving to a city which had just launched its climate smart strategy I saw christ church as a progressive place but with future focused and a place where I wanted to bring my children up a place that wanted to be part of the solution and not part of the problem post-earthquake I would hope the council can still hold to the strategy and the moon need to move swiftly to a low-carbon future that we all depend on we already know what sea level rises means of Christchurch we 've had a taste of this with a regular flooding and parts of our city where the land levels have dropped post quakes and we know about natural disasters and the impacts on mental health and general social disruption with climate this has health consequences for example during hotter weather we 've seen more admissions to Christchurch hospital from diabetes we applaud the mayors of stated commitment to resilience and this includes food resilience and community resilience to though we argue that the climate smart strategy should over arch and shape all the other plans including this long-term plan council needs to consider carbon reduction in everything it does the future will not be a continuation at the past we also need to ensure a just transition to a low-carbon future where equity is built in so our least well-off are not further disadvantaged by any changes finally we congratulate the council for being food to focus through its clean green smart district energy scheme for divesting from fossil fuels through christchurch city holdings and for declaring itself frack free the health of our environment and the health of people are inextricably linked and the future has been shaped through this 10 year plan now thanks for creating healthy city for now and the future for all of our sakes thank you thank you for thank you I 'm just on scheme it is well underway and i 'm sure people i 'd be happy to talk with you and staff staff were too and there 's a development to with the request your hospital in be part of a scheme to what i want to ask you about is housing and it 's sort of like like if you support for us around them and I just wondered if your association might also talked with the dhp around forming a partnership with us in it in our social housing just so we what you know keep actually had that conversation and maybe you people could be part of their because clearly like a lot of health patients mental health patients and clients particularly benefit a need our social housing so this is the public health association yes service one outcome on you sometimes they 're not part of a dhp know in our so I 'm just wanting is that something that you could also talk the ghb about worldly as a member of the country dhv and we 're also in a workplace that has experts around has housing fed into this into our submission so really happy to take that suggestion back yes thank you yeah okay um oh I just did a mental block yeah thank you thank you for your very detailed submission I look at page 136 of our book and point five you say you applaud the council 's commitment to developing cycleways any accessible city projects and you want those to be a priority and complete within the timeframes just if you take separate the cycleways from the accessible studied we 're proposing to spend 160 million on central city writing projects on top of all the earthquake repairs and when I when I hear the kind of tone of your submission one of the things that comes through really strongly as how do we address the inequality that happens so I just wondered why you think that that 's that 's a priority like you know there 's the 16 million for kill more street for five blocks to two-way edge and then I kind of wonder widow in order to give effect to what you 're asking for whether you think assessment which I haven 't been able to find a single one done in terms of the recovery or the blue plane but is it something it possibly is a tool to understand and select where the priority should be a bit of those expensive central city transport absolutely I think you 're absolutely right in terms of looking at where you know where their current issues are I mean I 've heard some of the other submissions here about children who can 't scooter to their school you know and in some areas it 's really broken and I think why can 't why are we not prioritizing those places you know for simple everyday activity children should be able to cycle and be able to scooter to their schools in the low deprivation you know the higher deprivation areas as much as the lower deprivation areas so I think a social impact or any health and social impact assessment is just the kind of thing that would be really helpful to drive where the priorities should be yeah fixing fixing leur that the footpaths on the way to much that 's come to the end of the day and I wouldn 't say but well I would say last but certainly not least very important submission to hear from the public health association a really positive note to end on for the day thank you very much _"

    "text": "the South Shore residents association I can 't see bill Simpson in the room so somebody else is going to appear on his behalf we had lots of different faces turn up for with different names attached the submission you 're most welcome thank you good afternoon mint verdict in sexual residents association in those absence and assisted by four worthington ok so the South Shore residents association represent about 480 households and south shore and our aims at the progress of South Shore and to promote and protect the community and the natural and urban environments and so everything that we are discussing has this in mind to support our community and the environment that we live in and the first thing that I would like to make our submission on is rocking horse road and the repairs which are scheduled so the southern half of the road will be resealed as part of the scope renewal storm water pipes curve channel in water main and and this work will be finished by the end of the year however the northern half of the road from penguin street and and patched to the driver and the average person going up and down the road every day there 's very little difference between the state of the road from one end to the other there are a lot of raised manhole access height dips and bumps from earthquake subsidence and this is a continuing issue someone does come along and fill it all in and it 's nice for a few days and some heavy vehicles go under and it 's subsides again trucks and buses are the biggest concern for us being larger heavier vehicles when they travel down the street at about 30k it doesn 't cause too much for a problem where you 're at 50 k the shaking and rattling is absolutely horrendous the vibrations been calculated the equivalent for magnitude for earthquake and living in a two-story house I can attest to the amount of shaking that it will actually rattle things across a table when you get a large truck go past or a bus traveling too fast for the residents particularly the roadside residents this is a an ongoing thing and so we arrow repaired to a good level and that 's fantastic but the start of the road which everyone must go through is the part that is not really going to have those those major appears to get it into a decent condition as the roads improve obviously the speed of traffic is going to increase and the traffic will be traveling up to the 50k for mitad and so that we see that with this faster and heavy and large traffic and with the rebuilding our area of really kicking off that traffic is going to be an issue and a lot of homes will continue to get quite minor damage but there are houses being repaired where now it has to be looked at again because plaster has cracked things like concreting round wall so on there are fine cracks appearing and this is attributed to heavy traffic on on the street so we would like council to possibly look at the whole of the street and addressing that issue for us our second key issue is with buses and we realize that the schedule n is not within we 've had some massive changes in scheduling and what that has meant for sales sure is that most passengers traveling from social now have to change buses to get to various other parts of the city and this has generated quite a lot of problems passengers obviously have to wait for their connecting buses and they are waiting in an area for those of you aware of the area outside a liquor store and a large liquor store it 's a pretty open area it 's open to the elements we 're demolished sites we have dust and the wind just cutting through it 's not a desirable place to have to stand it 's not great in the summer and in the winter and rain it 's going to be pretty unbearable there 's one bus shelter which you might get four or five people and if you 're lucky the other issue is that to connect to the yellow line buses and people have to walk about 150 meters around the corner on pretty indifferent pavements and roading and again very little in the way of shelter look quite seriously at what kind of facilities in terms of security lighting and a degree of shelter I mean obviously a small bus exchange would be fantastic the reality is anything could actually help alleviate these these problems for people sometimes people have to wake up to an hour and that is an awfully long time to be standing in the open a third item is the proposal put in a title barrier now we don 't know great deal about this proposal and it has appeared but this would affect South Shore enormously and obviously across to was on the side of the estuary our concern obviously about construction phase and eroding issues again service in traffic and so on and the key thing the the environment and the Knox report in the late 60s early 70s had suggested that a tidal barrier was not suitable because of the danger to the environment and some considerable risks so this this concept has already been rejected as a negative effects to the estuary and this is a key reason why myself and most people actually live at South Shore protect it and make sure that it exists for the whole of Christchurch we 're interested perhaps ins looking at moving that title barrier similar to Walston cut gate scraps up to bridge street perhaps further up up the Aven and what we 're really asking is that a feasibility stage that we actually are allowed to be really involved in this process and let it be notified to us if this is something that will go ahead that 's their presentation if you have any questions thank you yeah thank you I 'm to two quick questions hopefully um one is we hear that people being asking for a title barrage but I haven 't heard anyone have you do you know anyone that supports the tidal barrage okay second question is how do you know that the streets in your area aren 't going to be folks we have been told that I 'm currently we have a repair program which is the end of the speed back to penguin street and that isn 't a program which will be completed by the end of the year we it but we have been told that the the penguin street to caspian street is repair only as in patch it up to make it tidy and not the the full reconstruction right so do you think it would be useful for us as a council to get a map of where the repairs were happening and what repairs we because your but the third submitter that 's come and told us about things that aren 't going to be done but i don 't know how anyone through this process could look it out to implan and say my streets not on the list of moisture is on the list and it 's in this year for this time frame this was advised by skirt to all the residents in church all right ooh linda and i just on the feasibility study though it 's a pre-feasibility work piece of work that 's currently being done and will come to council soon um look I just want to ask you about issues like the bus shelters for example and I just wanted have you taken those to the community be on that the whole interchange is supposed to go into new brush and ages ago it 's been on the council plan since before you guys read on the council I 'm specifically asking about like the state of the bus shelters like I would have liked since that up by the community board if and I 'm not sure whatever I mean there 's nothing wrong with the bus shelter there but it 's a small bus shelter here it 's not suitable the truth is is that it 's the end of a line but now it 's even worse because the South Shore residents have to get off the bus and there is nothing to transfer under you know it 's it needs a bus interchange and actually I personally thought that the liquor store would have made a much better person to check what I was it was big enough to it 's big enough to have buses go both ways you know you do and completely covered and are a little anyway there 's nowhere for the bus drivers to go on you know mean they can 't you know take their their us money off the bus because there 's nowhere for them to go securely it 's just it 's hugely hugely problematic so you learned I 'm glad you let us know today in the community board I would like to have heard from this issue raised not what yourself it has been raised on 100,000 times at the community board it would but they need a at the community board has been raised but they need a bus interchange they need a more than a shelter a shelter is not enough and abrasion absolutely not I 'm sorry I 'm up to I 've to attendant course impossible I 'm gonna beer I 've been submitting I 've been submitting on the path on the recounts on the Bible as well well you know any way up yeah I 'm sure that they would assist you wouldn 't know it would thank you thank you thank you very much and give it bill my regards dude _"

    "text": "re on to the Summoner community residents association Brian now i 'm going to pronounce this incorrectly i 'm sure as a cashola is it close not an anion counselors and I 'm branca Shula chair of the Sumner residents association and I 'd like to say that according to the Sumner master plan Sumner can expect over 500,000 visitors per annum when the coastal pathways to be completed and further visitors can be expected when the Sumner littleton road is reopened this adds to the numbers as you will hear from cath Gracia from the business group and Peter Hanson from The Residents Association some is inadequately prepared for this big influx of people we therefore recommend that the council set up another Sumner Council joint venture team which has been very successful up to now to ensure that these issues are addressed in the context of the master plan as well as ensuring that there is adequate funding provided love it to Cathy go down he encounters the points I 'd like to raise today a view shared by not only those in the business community but it up to speak today 's i feel pretty strongly about the future of sumner and the viability of the businesses trading there at the moment in the long-term outlook as we make our way down what seems to be quite long road to recovery sumner is one of the top attractions for visitors to our city and one of the most preferred places for residents of christchurch to visit recent research conducted by the opinion opinions market research limited looked at Christchurch residents interest in visiting Simoneaux Bay 's area and also identified the sorts of activities that interested them when they came out to see us the research found that eighty percent of Christchurch residents rights sumner the most preferable destination in the city attracted by activities like walking along the beachfront water sports cafe life and the likes nearly sixty percent of Christchurch residents claimed to have visited examiner in the last six months and more were interested once the road works for complete so when the road works are completed in the coastal pathway is flowing and tourist numbers are armed we need to be prepared which thank you infrastructure a central village footpath and streetscape improvements in a summer summer master plan look fantastic the connections from the Esplanade will surely improve the beach village integration I do hope there is the provision and support for the upgrades to the eastern ad and each side infrastructure there are many issues around excess paving seating and amenities much the same as within the central village area just so I can locate myself is that the picture theater down the bottom Thanks yeah yes what about yeah yep that 's right yeah they 're the highway ever yep so you coming on there so the beach is on the left and that 's the yeah I 'm know exactly where we are now yep we 're on richmond hill yeah actually looking down from richmond it 's that implement my second point is facilities within the village the central village needs some form of community green space or central area that could provide a much-needed central toilet block which we currently don 't have the likes of rubbish and recycling bins pizza drinking fountain but information boards for picnicking and perhaps even a continuation of our sunday markets once the community centers up and running I believe the site at 22 24 nail and Street could replace the village green it will all come to love and need for community engagement my third point is tourist information we are a tourist destination but we certainly are visitors down with little information upon our arrival we would like to work with the council and providing permanent signage in the central village the likes of net boards which could include the mini walkways sacra treks beach access historical sites which this midi in a business directory it 's too topo isn 't it the one the picture that you 've got their toe calls what 's that sorry tavo and it 's the picture you 've got the errors taupo isn 't it always the trial yeah the top one okay I 'm just examples it 's an example yeah but the sort of thing that could work that could be a permanent structure yeah mmm so is a business group we are able in willing and really keen to to the branding already which is currently working but we just need you as our number one business partner and stakeholder to work with us it 's very important time in our recovery so my question to you is if we are one of the city 's top destinations shouldn 't we be leaving a lasting impression shouldn 't we be impressively hosting the visitors to our city thunder bay area as an air suit that just needs a little bit more investment and it needs your backing in this long-term plan at the moment things that pretty shabby but we know with it we 're not alone in the city but we also know that recovery is hastening and we do want to be prepared for when that happens it would be really great if we could be one of the jewels in the crown of the city in bolster the local in the greater economy as we return to what will be a normal thank you mayor and councillors my name is Peter Hanson Sumner is beginning to buzz again after the big downturn and visitors after the tracks and cafes some is a top destination and Christchurch and not just for city residents but visitors from elsewhere in New Zealand and overseas and it 's a place where people can chill out and people can really feel revitalized it 's already feeling pressure on us on its existing facilities and infrastructure some of which are quite rundown and an adequate to meet visitor demands and for instance parking in the village and see France Orey Orey at a premium especially at weekends and holidays sorry and so we hope that the planned off street parking or neyland street near the new sumner community center library museum will happen and that the village green can move to 2024 neyland Street which is opposite which is currently are in red zoned land your although the popular sandy beach down a cave rock but you may not be aware that the main beach Thunder Bay between cave rock and Scarborough Hill has had a huge increase in usage in recent times it 's a very safe swimming beach quite a source of fantastic for surfing and family is in groups and run cycle skateboard on the promenade that runs right along the beach there and it 's a really highly valued for visitor experience but you know local people we 've noticed the need for facilities along the beachfront that do meet visitor devons not necessarily we need them locally but really for the visitors coming in there at the Scarborough end of the beach there are plenty of toilets and now there 's a fantastic fabulous new children 's paddling pool and we thank you very much for that happening and are lots of visitors to the pool but there are no changing rooms actually for those are using the pool or the sea and then going down to Mariners street which is near the village near the proposed skatepark it 's a highly used area whether it 's busy surf school business there and there 's a no-no limited number of toilets there are no changing rooms for the many surfaces or swimmers there lots of surf is up and down the beach frontier smart they changed by the vehicles you see a lot of beer bums flash we do know people would appreciate more toilets and changing facilities there as well as more fresh water showers swimmers and surfers some bike stands some doggy Doo bins even some fitness stations pest control there 's been quite a big increase of rats on the foreshore there it 's a real problem so we 'd really ask you to address this and also that you would retain money for a pest control in your budget the maintenance of roads and footpaths in the village and beachfronts is paramount and these are in various states of unrep air because people visit some nerve for a great experience and we don 't want to repeat of an incident a year ago that reflected badly on a saw there 's a coach load of elderly people from the north island were touring the south they visited sunless waterfront this elderly lady and she gave us permission to use her photo she tripped over a damaged unrepaired pavement which is down by the Mariner street area well she smashed the glasses she got her face she went to the toilets to to clean and these pictures have actually been shown to this council about a year ago and also to our community board and we have phone council staff so people have been made aware of this incident and yet one year later nothing has been done to appear bit of pavement I had look at up two days ago at the very least why not a patch up of asphalt which we really cheap something could be done sumner is a positive proactive community it 's thankful for council repairs to a broken wastewater systems and flood mitigation and a new bridge and a nice seal road that we 're getting there which is going to bring lots more people and appreciation to for the planned new community facilities the library and theatre and museum the Joint Working Group that was set up it 's been a resounding success paul was honors as well and we have very vigorous vigorous discussion but it was a genuine collaboration between council and community and there was a final design that wouldn 't have happened otherwise so we thank you it 's been about to 11 quakes the summit community initiated its own urban design consultation the fruit of this is the summer village master plan see on the air which is here and our chairman referred to it at the beginning and it clearly shows some residents and the business groups wish to have a better integrated link between the summer village centre and the beaches and some of the things detailed in that plan what we 're talking about today however as a community we feel concerned that nothing appears to be happening with this council approved plan some has had master plans galore before that have been quietly shelved and forgotten and so we ask you today that council ensure that the summer village master plan is acted upon and finally we ask their council set aside money in its budget to ensure that soner village and beachfront infrastructure and facilities meet the expectations of visitors and tourists and secondly we ask the council consultant partner with the summer community on these local projects as our chairman and was saying in a structure like the Joint Working Group the community facilities rebuilt something like Jim deers and Seattle with his son neighborhood matching fund something like that as well we 're very open to doing a partnership not expecting counselors do everything but there are local projects that we could be above them so thank you thank you that 's a good timing the ethics that will come to the end of the of the presentation but ending on that note is just you know music to my ears I 'm afraid oh I love that neighborhood matching fund and it 's probably part of the driver that 's behind the review of our community grants scheme as to get to the point where we can resource communities with the support of the communities to do a lot more together so yeah so thank you something like the changing sheds could be something that the local community could exactly it 's really the sort of thing well you just I don 't know if you heard the previous or anything yes it 's the one down by the Marin Street toilets which is Marin Street runs romps at the Hollywood cinema down we just got a new app that would we 're trialing at the moment called sling a snip snip since solve so I 've taken a picture of it but I haven 't_''_921.399 downloaded the app year so it 's gonna it 's going to be yeah that 's right and I 'm sure she 's she 's actually written it down so that 's even a secure but I mean yeah I don 't remember seeing the photograph before but I suspect I might have blocked it so um yeah your money can 't our community advisor yeah sure yep no thanks very much I 'm sorry but that 's the end of the presentation so thank you very much and we 'll move on to _"

    "text": "right Robinson 's Bay ratepayers and residents association and lee robinson combined with Robinson 's Bay reserve thank you madam chair and we just ask the two submissions be heard together because they basically linked yep and I think there is an over hidden I think peripheral way would be to hear from the Delaine reserved to me first sir richard love it then i can follow from that submission we should not need the full 20 minutes for the levy thank you we have our PowerPoint whose yes who 's in charge did you bring that up i emailed it easy way it was supposed to be a good to go we were asked to email new after four phone calls I was assured it was here hey no wait it 's up okay good afternoon I 'm solovet the secretary treasurer for the Robinsons they reserve association and retro glove at the cheer and lead is also on the committee and he 's representing the ratepayers Association Robinson 's pay is such gracious at the North End of egg harbor between devotion and Tecna tour the school road star and the Blue Star War were all within easy walking distance of each other the reserve management committee is responsible for the reserve the post office and previously until amalgamation for the war the bay contributed significantly to the building of Canterbury the story of the saw milling the Oxford seeding the dairy and farming has been told through the reserve on a school road and a series of hearings along the bush walk representing the various activities and for some reason the tix that was on there has disappeared the current Wharf no okay we 're coming at one other sorry the current wolf was constructed from materials from other wolves owned by businessman and Bay it was repaired in 2004 by community using donated materials and later there was something drastically wrong offers powerful build timber from trees planted by the domain board in the 1950s and local fundraising major fundraiser on 2004 led by Damian who because you will see in the middle of that group of people on the wharf combined with donations and labor funded significant repairs to the war from the access road is a huge amount of goodwill from past and present property owners the council have done a beautiful job of depicting the old schoolhouse on the reserve and will be a photo of it coming up however we still have the original wolf and it 's part of our story and rather than having a depiction of it as part of the story of the bay it 's preferable to maintain the structure itself especially as such a popular acid the Wolfen reserve are used as recreational areas for the community and gatherings and this is the depiction of the old schoolhouse council expertise and elements such as steps that are required to conform to standards has been invaluable and the committee is delighted with the schoolhouse the signage and the stairs since 2000 the robinsons Bay reserved managed government committee has replaced the boundary fences removed a large number of exotic trees funded and consulted with Lucas and associates drawing of the concept plans retrieved the old school bell and installed items such as old gate captures and pick up fencing donated by the locals worked was the council budget for the reserve 39,000 has been estimated for the design and location drawings for a car park and a further 111,000 for the construction of the car park we believe that by consulting with locals and making use of local labor equipment and expertise a suitable end result could be achieved for a fraction of the cost allowing the remainder of the funds to be used for repairs to the wharf council could be best employed in determining compliance with any relevant regulations and there is currently a car park being used by locals on the opposite side of the road to school road at prison working bees have been well supported in the past with community pack max being held annually up until 2011 at some visits but now the preoccupation with earthquake repairs is diminishing we can re-engage the wider community with the reserve in the war that one sorry and this is already apparent and the numbers attending the meetings in the support being shown including at a tree planting last spring with three families of the current and past generations were involved in and planting don 't need our car park ivory engineered to please we respectfully suggest to council that between the reserve management committee and the ratepayers Association there 's sufficient experience expertise and goodwill to achieve a much greater being for the back than currently proposed in the budget it seems somewhat ludicrous to fund neighborhood week activities so people can get to know each other when there are projects such as the wolf on the reserve which always fulfilled this role and with sufficient funding will continue to do so while maintaining significant community assets for residents and visitors to enter would thank you council voted to speak to that you 've heard the council has provided significant funds over the last 15 years to the reserve management committee and a magnificent job is being done to the pic the history of the bay in terms of the old reserving or the reserve in the old school site but part of the history of the bay is the wolf the wolf was that domain for exporting product as you 've heard editor the place where people actually are drawn to probably irony yearly period our visitors to the area and with the linkage to the divine the reserve the appropriate scientist has been that has been budgeted for in the current plan we believe that will bring the whole thing together but we also believe that you know there is a there is a six to eight meter boom at the bottom of school road which is used for school buses to the children to a light they don 't need across the main road with a bit of ingenuity sending or shingling top course that there could be an adequate car pack at the moment buses do not go there because the reserve is not adequately signed it would be with science below it and at the wharf there would be adequate room for car parking in the area and with the 80 families in Robinson 's Bay many of whom are holiday makers but have permanent residents there there there are engineers there are construction people there are people in for example one one of the owners is a might attend owner there 's another hem tins itm owner provide certifications to the council that comply with the standards required and i 'm given to believe the same thing at the moment is happening with the church bay wolf under the auspices of the council so a community is very keen to provide us expertise to reduce the cost spread the load and ensure that all these provisions maintained for the benefit not only of this local community but for the benefit of the peninsula and for the benefit of christchurch businesses I mean the peninsula is the playground for the city and we 're very keen to see it 's maintained and these infrastructures that are deteriorating can 't we believe be let go and we 're very supportive as a community of assisting and being paddled a joint venture with the council to make sure that they maintain hmm great um there quitting 's at Andrew no so just to make sure I 've got this right this isn 't asking for any more money this is just asking for flexibility around the way that the car park for the reserve is delivered particularly using local expertise use the surplus funds to the left because of that local volunteer input to repair the wharf to go towards the repairs on the wharf and I know that you mentioned 80 families and I note in here there were 72 submissions in favor of the wharf been repaired so I mean that 's a overwhelming majority of people in Robinson 's Bay that are supportive of their so no extra money required it 's just really asking for some flexibility to run the to your project side but surely not seeking you more money and we believe that I mean we believe the priority should be in terms of in terms of finishing the project that the car park should be should be proceeded with and we believe that can be done expeditiously and under the right authorities within the bay to satisfy the council 's of the various requirements but we believe with proper management of that budget the remaining families could be put towards some significant repairs required for the wolf that is difficult in terms of piling for the community to on saying there oh um good a good deal of local community input which is a voluntary work would go into the project to its weakness one of the slides these shows the working fee you wouldn 't think so if the weather it was actually the thirtieth of December but it was very cold subtly over there but there was there was 40 people on the wharf that day replenishing the T part of the wharf at the top now the 80 plates that were milled for that that part of the wharf 8 meters each and links were milled from trees on the road reserved just along the GT road and an her some minutes of a council meeting in 1933 we are a forensic version is about found those minutes and they they three locals one of who was responsible for building the war from 1914 sought and obtained permission from the council to grow a standard metric hours on the road reserved for the future replenishment of the wharf wow so there was a lot of foresight really and when in 2004 we obtained the permission of the vena banks traditional ax then milden treated them and we put them down and they form the T part of the jetty that 's there now hmm brilliant there 's a fantastic story you want to continue that story because we love the place here Pauline so the council would have done an assessment of the wharf yes and what of the what 's the value of their appears in the caf I 'm probably between three or four hundred thousand dollars of it 's done by local by contractors employed by the wall okay and Kim in some coppers an engineer who lives in tech materials done a lot of work with the council he 's provided us a a plan which he believes he would certify for the improvements we have already approached both kinetics in the harbor board for top quality secondhand piles which will be provided at minimal cost that Cuban has engineered a program to drive more piles down the outside of the existing path that can be done from the deity is that all the players are so that at the moment there 's a livin that we in keeping with this whole thing we would like to put in place a five year five to ten year maintenance plans and as things are required we can do and and then we take on that responsibility and provide the appropriate certifications the council now would you envisage that you would be working alongside some council staff at all yes we 've spoken we 've already spoken to andrew rutland had a meeting with him and poor devil and i think it is who was dealing with the church bay wharf we 've spoken to herman 's and we in the process of putting together a labor and materials plan which we would put to the council and they would approve that in conjunction with required certifications along the way from the license building practitioner and get some coppers engineer great sounds like it good mind I 'm just wondering is this the kind of example of the sort of thing that we should be delegating to the local community board so that they could sign it off I would almost suggests I mean a part of the is actually a really good example of the way things have been done on the peninsula vs in terms of the reserve management committees we 've talked about communities taking care of their own assets and here we 've got three motivated people representing 72 other motivated families that want to do exactly that thing so whether it 's for the community board or whether it 's actually for the community through the reserve management committing right is another question we 'd probably want to consider yeah but I mean is it to me it 's just a like a kind of no-brainer we want more money and we want to build our community at the same time as preserving that 's wonderful but I just but if I just make one more point never cheer I mean the GD has been closed for four years has been a gate across the front of it and Christmas last where that magnificent summer and the earth you know that at any one time to be 10 or 12 cars pull up and couldn 't get on to the wharf despite that the gate and in a rather on safe manner but at the Samoan family turned up and a beat up old car with about seven kids and fished off the road it was probably the only day out for the year came over there couldn 't get on the GT and fished in about a foot of water caught nothing but I mean it is a community asset people who don 't like the possessive ecker come to these little bays and want to use the facilities that have been provided yeah if I could also mean you know Lee has done a huge amount of work on that with Richard and one of the other locals and stalled the carpets for the the access road and then council came along and gravelled that after the repairs were done in 2004 so for it to just go now yep there 's a lot of work and a lot of effort and a lot of money has just gone yeah no we don 't want that we don 't know very good well thank you very much for your presentation and well so we appreciate it very much thank you thank you very much it is a good thing about it I 'm here as we get to hear all these stories though _"

    "text": "the North Shore residents association Vanessa Scammell you are not Vanessa I just tell me you 're not Vanessa I think there 's a little bit of confusion around this one because it was it said do you wish to present your submission at a hearing nope yes we yes lady mirror counselors staff and fellow funders um perhaps a personal intro a chair North Shore residents and North Shore sees themselves pretty much as gatekeepers and caretakers for our to beach and forest assets alongside of course the Rangers for a bottle lake forest park and coast care and so anything that enhances the area and of course we 're lucky we 're in an area that wasn 't part is anyway but we see the relative deprivation further down the beach and we see the promenade as really an economic game changer for the area because the thing is so visible and more sure as a Residents Association I think was probably instrumental in putting through the board Pegasus community board the the motion of the consideration of a continuing line item for this and I think we I 'm correct 2 2 million and so the first point I 'd like to make is that I think the funding is largely already there if that community board line item is in fact accepted i don 't think it 's additional on top that was the whole purpose of getting it through the community board well prior to the formulation of the LTP but i 'm hoping to be corrected on that but I just make that point the second point is that I think in the other submissions which I 've reviewed online and congratulate you for doing so and I 've also booooored Pegasus brought submissions I think the the linkages to the other tracks the other facilities and the notion of a network really needs to be pushed this would help the the whole thing and i 'll make the additional point which if i 'm not mistaken council mangy had made at kims presentation on wed and say that should this be widened and i think the point we would make about the the widened scope is that it doesn 't all have to are narrower and different character as you move away from the center but the notion of a definite track should be there and of course this ties in nicely to Mickey 's walk the christchurch perimeter track that sort of thing and it becomes a destination in his own right so one of the issues out in the east is that there 's no obvious destination you know you go out you walk on the pier you have a coffee now what and and effectively there 's there 's business linkages can come out of this obviously I think Kim and her dissertation mentioned going out to New Plymouth and riding an electric bike up there promenade now she didn 't take the electric bike with her she hired her if you look at the seed ways that you can hire up the Kaikoura that sort of thing I mean there 's lots of small local livings to be made out of a facility like that and when we look at the facility itself and I refer back now to my very young background as a as a roading person cl new CL every year and a little rural county and Southland I don 't think you need to overthink the construction even at the sort of promenade that Kim showed you sand is a wonderful base for anything if you can confine as injures sufficiently and the sort of ground pressure is you 're going to put on it are skateboarders the occasional sweeping vehicle that sort of thing it 's not it 's not a highway it 's not a road so that we 've got tracks up and adjacent to our merry built just on top of the sand hill that are nothing but a little bit of rubble a few fines and a binder on top and they 've been here for 30 years and they 're still nice and solid they still perfectly adequate for walking on we use them every day so that again I say we don 't we don 't need this sort of mess of engineering proposal throughout the gradients that the levels yes but i 'm not sure that there 's a super-duper construction project in this and finally and to end from beach road right threat of brighton as a public transport route so this means that you 've got assured access so that for example of a gold card holder in the middle of the day wants to travel off-peak free to the beach the there there similarly there 's good links to and from even if you extend beyond that and this is I think an opportunity for for the east it 's it 's a small project in the overall scheme of things but it 's a very transformational one and i think you know having chemic talked to some of the developers in our area i would like to see this fall down the hole of a mess of feasibility study in which every possible objection and the world is raised I just don 't think it needs it needs to go that far I think for example we don 't want to hear staff talking about we can 't do this because we 're into managed retreat you know that 's that 's a mean that 's been Peter deserves policy but we don and we really and we never will so we just say the promenade is a place to recreate build it and it 'll come you very good question Oh it 's called the promenade so yeah and what 's called the promenade in fact your view too is that it doesn 't need to be a highway in all in all places and in fact the most simple path in places would is something that your reasons Association is asking for so I just want to clarify that in comparison Satan 's means in different views presented I think we would support Kim 's proposal in its entirety in in in the sense you know the nunnery trust the 900 meters of unknown meter y promenade I 'm making I 'm simply making the point that if that was extended sort of north and south to join up with the other proto tracks that are there the extensions need not be to the same design the same standard etc and hence the thought that you don 't need to overthink the whole the whole thing in terms of the scale there 's merit and extending it to Brighton because that 's an obvious leaning point I think that was the point that counselor mangie made you say that well the day before yesterday was that it just seems so obvious to link it to the pier yes yeah until the Ivan okay Rose cycleway networklyra but that 's going to end up sort of thing yes that 's right yes yeah I have a question but I don 't want to offend anyone no well it 's just that just the comment around managed retreat because you 're the second person to use it today and the first person to use it raised it in the context of the Tonka and Toyota report so there is going to be a consultation begin won 't it 's more of a public engagement around the development of a natural hazard strategy which will start shortly after queen 's birthday weekend so the idea is not to go to the end point it 's to start at the very beginning which is understanding the natural hazards that face our coastline that face our subsequently will be in stage two of the natural hazards chapter of our district plan review so there is no intention of going straight to a position which is the absolute last resort position and a position that we don 't have a policy on so nothing like that is being proposed it at the stage and you know I 'm hoping that we learn to understand what our risks are and how we live with those risks and how we adapt our environments to those risks but I think not grunting up to the risk would be worse than I mean well excepting I mean pretending that they 're not there because they are I think I just think the simple point that staff are inclined directors oh vs. policy already and I 'll give you a classic example the board walk around the estuary from roughly it 'll be from bridge street really teach tariro that that 's it it goes around the edge half of it is track through an area that 's now being felled half of it as boardwalk it 's not being maintained and recreation facility but to the east it just feels like the death of a thousand cuts so where is that which side of yesterday um east side of the history and it runs the south around the main literally the edge we 'll see what each of these three but the earthquake that it hasn 't been reinstated okay and before does that it may never be because it managed retreat oh now you see this is an example of you but you 're going to the engine oil it may be that it 's not in the right place due to the exposure of new risks because that land has has dropped you know I mean we 've mimicked what is it productions on sea level rise and less than a minute with that with the drop in our land we 'll check that on to the top of it just coke for 20 centimeters of Siros you know this is that 's what I say this stuff doesn 't need to be over cool yeah but moving a ton lean might actually do the same trick without you there is a reaction but there is a lot of water to go under the bridge there I use that phrase before we get to an end point but look I mean your residents association and all of the residents associations all the community groups all of the trust everyone that we 've listened to from the east will have a big part and working through the development of that natural hazards policy so it 's not our staff are not going out there with a predetermined position they 're going out there to engage communities in a real serious discussion about the science and about the implications of the situation that we 're not faced with on our own the rest of the world is looking at the reality of sea level rise and and increased storm events you know over the next fifty hundred two hundred years so it 's a long-term view it 's not a short-term that 's what yeah we 're all aged residence we accept the risks of thing on an each absolutely thank you very very much thank you _"

    "text": "david ivory you 're not David ivory I know that urine district eyes John Sullivan you look exactly like John Sullivan from the temporary workers educational association I think it 's definite on on the new David ivory thank you for hearing me Erin counselors cure akuto i have handouts please but just to introduce the Canterbury workers educational association we 're a nonprofit organization we offer a wide range of educational courses for adults we are based at 59 gloss to sleep right in the city center and we 've just recently had our centenary we 've been around for a hundred years and he worshiped the mirror tended very graciously and so we 've got a stake in Christchurch and many of our participants are elderly some disadvantaged and we operate on principles of fostering equity and social justice we 've we 've put a main submission in and I 've just handing around the transport submission we also put a brief submission and on transport which was recommending a frequent shuttle bus for the northwest of the city of the CBD but this this paper that you 'd like just like to speak briefly to that first and that is thank you I thank you and that is that we we have previously made submissions on this to the Hagley pyramid board and the so the first recommendation in terms of bus access is we we do ask for a shuttle service of frequent shuttle service running from the bus and a loop that services the museum the art gallery and the would allow easy access to our own rooms as well we arrive right opposite the christchurch art gallery so when that reopens the the same problems will be had by the by the art gallery so that 's the first submission the second one is on car parking and there 's a bit of an analysis there with our submission and we note that in the that area around about gloucester street it 's anticipated w need for a 100 to 250 short-term car parking spaces in the near future so there 's a shortfall and we know alternative parking is being considered and that that 's sort of tied in with art gallery parking council to focus on the delivery of short stay parking rather than them long stay commuter parking to elect to allow the functioning of all of our organizations and within the within that CBD area so that 's just a summary of what 's just been handed out now I 'd like to just now move to the main submission which you will have received electronically and the first part of that is that we 're very anxious and we urge that the strengthening communities fund be maintained and and not reduced there 's a huge impact on the disadvantaged neighborhoods and the vulnerable residents and you may not have picked up but we did advise a number of people but obviously didn 't get through to the WEA that it was an era and the and the printing of the activity management plan that it showed the reduction we actually decide as a council not to reduce it because we 're reviewing the whole way that we provide funds into the community to get it a more resilience focus so okay and that 's a process that 's going very that 's very helpful to know I had I had heard a rumor about that but I couldn 't substantiate it yet so but as i doing I don 't apologize yeah thank you ma 'am we do it as that is that is a an important matter for the council to maintain those those community organizations and links and the act of citizenship and the building stronger communities is all part of that the and our second part is more on the on their assets and so on the financial side of things and we do appreciate that the council has to operate in the real world and not an idealized world our preference is that that the and I know that there are legal realities to face for the council but that the annual planning process makes adjustments at a time when the whole financial situation becomes clearer and we understand that the pig debts around 2019 or 2020 and we generally recommend that that council as its be retained until that time and the situation be property reassessed for them because things may have changed significantly big expensive anchor projects for some for some time yet to to allow margin in your and our revenue and we ask that the council continue to negotiate as we know they 're doing with central government to keep getting you know a better arrangement for Christchurch and we respectfully suggest that and encourage as far as practicable that funding for a renewal of capital assets be from depreciation rather than dead would expect that that 's that 's a that 's a mostly a practice but and I appreciate there 's more to it than that and that when there are new community assets created that 's it is there there 's inflation factors and there are enhancement factors in connection with specially post-earthquake requirements with that but that 's the general recommendation for future sustainability of assets that depreciation be considered for and there and we also ask that community related funding the urgent community-related funding especially from needs coming out of the earthquake situation be given priority over the the anchor projects at this time so and we so that 's those are my submissions ladies and started on the bus question because I have to say that the change of Bruce didn 't really suit me very well either and I now have to walk four blocks whereas i just used to get dropped off at the corner on I 'm Wooster but right by Wooster Street on on Cambridge terrace so I mean we don 't control the roots we only control that well not much really we 're just sorry we just pay we just pay for the shelters and the bus stops in there and the bus priority lanes and the and the interchanges that this hub and spokes model that was approved the foreman is that part of the problem because people have to get off buses and on buses and they better plan this whole route you know sort of mother ahead of themselves as certain is mama there are two examples in there or PM making a fairly short journeys you have to really jump around there was an idea that one of the one of the submitters made because the question was asked around the you know the yellow free but the suggestion was was that in the in the meantime why not make every bus trip inside the forever news free so if you park out at one of the four evah news you can basically get into town for free from their merit none yes yeah certainly although i 'm particularly enamored of our suggested shuttle service of course I appreciate that probably the other councillors responsible for instigating something like that but I 'm sure there 's crossover in recommendations but it would seem to me that a free shuttle around the main attractions yeah what would have mirror right I just got I cannot for the life of me Staind seeing well I can 't stand seeing empty buses you know these great big mess of things trundling through our demonstrates with no went on them or one or two people anyway does anyone have a question yes ajami one crazy on you and suggest the one of the ankle party the new children playground to delay postponed but do you have any idea regarding the current existing facility can provider to the children or CBD at any existing one okay mr. Chen they the the it 's a matter of priorities and we feel that the money should rather than to a central city pregnant where there are very few people with with children in that living in that area should more go to perhaps places in the east children 's facilities and so on there rather than a big playground that would no doubt come into its own and time but maybe the that is not yet that 's great lovely thank you very much good to see you and get um yeah well it 's david still involved yes you 're still yet still on the council oh there 's a god to pass prison okay we just give us give america as won 't you thank you very great _"

    "text": "and the next one is the cleri appears from the Northwest Richmond residents association good afternoon love to me so on Clara clears some of you know me from my day job I 'm here today is a resident of Stapleton 's road and the coordinator of Northwest Richmond residents association we were formed this what we call a motley crew digging salt in early februari mid-february and we 've carried on since then doing helping people with this quake recovery and similar problems in the neighborhood as I go through our presentation I 'd like you to sit there and think what is normal for me this is what is normal for the people that live in this neighborhood so this area is own special category 1 and the distress trip plan and that 's why I put a picture of a nice filler up there but to us it 's really special right that 's what special means to us though the issues the footpaths are dangerous trip hazards for all but especially the young the elderly and folk with health issues IE those recovering from operations and a fit young person is at risk outside of daylight hours they are not safe for young people on tricycles all those trying to learn to ride bicycles so I made an obscure note in my written submission about the MC ours being of no use if the kids can 't learn to ride a bike at home in the first place it 's not possible to walk with a wheeled shopping basket or a pushchair without frequently going onto the road and obviously this applies to mobility scooters as well we feel we shouldn 't have to drive to send organs or mere avail in order to walk the streets for exercise we want to be able to walk in our own neighborhood the visual impact it just won 't just tell this on a story really this area looks like a ghetto made worse by enable and Lee graffiti the few grasp boons that we had which were not damaged wood dug up and never fixed properly the driveways and footpaths made even more unsightly with multicolored graffiti do they leave this mess in the middle of fennel things up and if you think I 'm being a little cynical about that let me note that after the fever earthquake two days later there was a city care crew of 10 hand sweeping Mansfield Avenue while we were out with shovels health issues there 's a physical danger from Falls and accidents there are physical dangers from dust insult the mental health issues from living in a ghetto and not being able to recover from the earthquakes the new normal for us is depressingly awful so what do we want we don 't want anything extra we don 't want any gold plating we just want our share of the funding that was allocated to fix our neighborhood and to be told when it will happen and we want this to happen before others get improvements or new stuff we don 't like the proposition put forward by Minister brownlee that we might have to wait 20 or 30 years but we also don 't like council 's proposition because it has no visibility and therefore to us it is Emperor 's clothes skirt has money in the dollars and 23 million dollars a year after following that the LTP only has resurfacing funding we need significant rebuilding and repairs not resurfacing we don 't want any more patching we don 't want stitches sorry we do want stitches and plastic surgery not sticking plasters so surely if you 're going to approve 101 million dollars for roading next year there should be a schedule to support that funding and somebody should therefore be able to tell us do we even sit on that schedule we don 't get report we don 't get provided with any information on our recovery we currently have two roads closed while skirt thinks of what they 're going to do next so they close the road send out a notice thanks very much we 'll come back to you many of our houses have been fixed and in the past this has been used as an excuse for inaction and delay any subsequent damage that is done has to be fixed by the builders and in fact the best bits of footpath that we have at the moment are the ones that outside a house that 's just had a council consent signed off our water and wastewater ejaculation have been fixed perhaps with the exception of any rework required that we don 't know about this means that in an open and transparent prioritization of work our area should look the same as Western Road and similar roads to the west of hills road where 's all the money gone we aren 't asking for and indeed don 't want temporary solutions we want to be part of normal Christchurch to have our roads and footpaths fixed not patched and to be able to look forward to leading normal lives we don 't want to be fobbed off anymore and while I said we aren 't asking for anything extra I couldn 't let the opportunity go by it would be nice if you considered some form of betterment and that the roads could be narrowed the booms made wider at the ending result would be that will cost less for council to maintain ongoing and would improve the field of the neighborhood we haven 't targeted the line items we actually get something but i 'm sure you can really identify projects that are intended to produce significant improvements over and above priya 's quake situations the suburban master plans being an obvious starter for 10 most residents in area don 't submit on community centers libraries sports stadium swimming pools major cycleways there to mentally stuck in their own ghetto their normal with families growing up not knowing better I flipped over a page on just as a couple of points I 'll go back to the roads are not safe for cyclists we can 't avoid driving on the broken roads because in the resulting damage to our car ie not to take some photos of broken roads but in fact it 's very difficult to take a photo of a broken road and demonstrate just how broken it really is I was going to use a dash cam but I thought that you fake a capable of driving down these roads should you wish the grass and grass booms and gutters we have tall weeds growing out of the gutters these recently got sprayed so now these don 't get cleaned properly in fact they 've still got salt in them for years on under the driveways are often blocked and residents can only clean them to a certain extent because your average garden who doesn 't go down very far the state of the edges of the road is you swallows previous photographs such that even getting in and out of a car is an issue for people and also follows that the storm water doesn 't flow so those of you who think I 've been a bit strong using the word ghetto because it was cut to me that perhaps that word was to a motive it isn 't we 're a minority group in the city and the neighborhood that we live in which is bounded by Hills Road northaven road north parade and surely road is for us a ghetto so thank you for listening unfortunately it 's not the only one there 's right through the East is like that Pauline what 's your theory and you mentioned a road that 's been closed on notice ask you which one in Stapleton 's Stapleton 's is closed officer so chance was pretty much permanently closed off there was no consultation on that except with the immediate neighbors ok see you think it wasn 't bored enough so it 's some Stapleton 's your statement this wasn 't it the North Haven not know it done randall 's not Randall 's year Randall street they closed it off to do something with a main that goes through there and they were going to provide a slip line they on the day that they did it they closed it closed it and then said they discovered they didn 't have enough room to put slip lining and in a couple of days later they said that they 'd found unforeseen conditions and they 'll come back whenever meanwhile it stays closed and so you 're really pretty much appreciate an update on what 's happening the UN win at life in the overall scheme of things that doesn 't matter right it 's about getting everything sorted and getting our neighborhood back to normal but you need a tournament I felt you so that 's something you want to address as well yeah clean thank you cleary and thank you as a staff member I 'm occasionally we do have this coming fall and Thank You Carlene that freedom exists it hasn 't in the past I can say so I hope that continues and I think it 's fair to say that roads equals social well-being I 'm hearing it 's been four years I think they I think it 's definitely about social well-being I mean I was unwell myself for a while and I had to walk up and down the driveway because if we doubt the driveway there was to higher probability i was going to fall over because at that stage i was reasonably young well but I work my granddaughter who lives with us in a pushchair down the road and we continually have to go out onto the road it because you saw some of those forever if she can 't walk down a photo a road like that but my I would a bicycle for my granddaughter in the December for Christmas my oldest ride that bike through until mid-february she hasn 't been able to ride at since he can 't_``_633.79 let a child ride a bike now onto those roads and footpaths I 'm at the Times finished but I 'm just said I 'm not sure where the footpaths are in the scare program are you able to just I mean I can ask you offline but just I mean this isn 't the feast submission and it won 't be the last it 's not a priority of the Spirit program but we do replace them where we have to dig them up because we 've destroyed them for but which means that if they 're been damaged by the earthquake they 're still damaged four years later okay right they 'd answers that question thank you very much thank you right _"

live streamed if anything as must they can always play it back presentations on two subjects the patrol cars road speedway as unusual it may see we 're actually don 't put formal presentation that 's going to save the count your money not cost the council excellent we like those I haven 't saved you that much money already if it had been made much money it would have been champagne I think so no think you do you want to just click that to back to the ten minutes please thank you right you can start again okay I 'm here to represent the RET a Residents Association and this here with me is case Tyler and we 're going to do two presentations today and it 's basically around the cars road Speedway and the aware road trail and I 'd like k to do here presentation first which will be on the years exhaustive investigations by council staff have been made and respect or several potential sites to relocate the castro rage way to a site suitable for a permanent facility to allow cart sport canterbury to grow the sport of car in Canterbury after 20 years it has become obvious to the ARA that major difficulties and financial constraints have been evident for some time and alternative zoning for South I would here which will allow the club to it main at cars road and development of the surrounding area area which will complement the amenity values with the principles of good urban design and be compatible and sympathetic with the surrounding residential areas is required an appropriate zoning such as a small business part for South our tear or Part B role will provide a noise buffer to the subdivisions being successfully developed at present and potentially reduce significantly any Revere sensitivity created by a noisy activity and businesslike industrial zoning should also ensure the potential for noise nuisance is mitigated there is support of a small business park as a appropriate buffer from the development balances of the affordable support of many landowners and south or tier cart sport Canterbury remaining at cars road Raceway well one necessitate inappropriate zoning to allow developmental south our tier be a buffer to surrounding residential developments the moon is the council 's obligation to fund an expensive relocation and will appease the community of the suggested location sites who have already clearly shown disapproval of the plan to relocate the raceway and creates a tangible solution to a difficult problem and saves the potential of years and years of valuable administration costs the ARA will be submitting to the district plan review phase 2 and the regional plan reserved Environment Canterbury as planned change five is a council generator plan change the Ala or quiz that funding be made available for administration 's costs to investigate the most appropriate zoning and rules for south or tier to allow much-needed development as part of the rebuild of Christchurch and growth and southwest Christ at present the vision or the council 's vision of our tia is not been realized and said south our tia is stuck and avoid very good well you might and then we 'll have questions at the end okay well my ones actually on the aware trail yep and at the prison time the council have identified they want to bring the wrecker trial down cars rate and what it really comes down to is the true position of the awake of trail is not cars road it 's called a wacker road and what actually the background behind that attached to the submission there 's two reports there 's a report done by archaeology assessment this was by the Christchurch City Council for the urban plan change for the RTO block and in that it 's been identified actually by the own counsel researchers that the electro went down away corrode the second one attaching it is a report from Trenton New Zealand when the southern arterial was put in it also identifies as the official wacker trail went down a wacker road at the prison time the Council of negotiating to buy five properties 20 meters of five properties down a wacker oh I 'm sorry down cars road if the if the trail is moved to an incredibly wide Road and it was made that way originally to allow the awake a trail to go down the side of it if the trail follows its true natural course there 's no cost to the council it doesn 't have to buy 20 metres off five properties the council already own the land and that 's a way to rope so all we 're asking for is we have no problems with the awake otro we support at one hundred percent but all we 're asking for as it goes in the right place where the council is proposing to put it is not the right place right thank you straight for questions Jimmy you know the cake and based on your reputation your particular mention if counsel you know reconsider to make the casual Raceway in the current location council only need to add Heather funding for administration costs to investigate a part it is only but how about you know regarding to the potential for noise the new sense is mitigate who pay a list of Andy for the certification well if you put a noise the subdivisions that are at the arete present are not within that noise boundary of the of the car club which is about 300 meters the the other ones like Night 's Dream Park be a further over and at the pro at the present time you can 't develop loving G was around the car club because the constraints are just a sudden economic and so that all all the land right around is just stuck there no one can do anything with that yeah yes and the southwest area plan and the UDS that area was business and it was to mitigate the noise for the kart club and everyone had agreed to that but was the you needed a housing for Christchurch and housing and and but but now with there 's no housing the it can be put there so that 's out of the equation for the housing for Christchurch so unless unless it goes business then then then you 've got to spend up to while we calculated our 10 million dollars to actually relocate the card club yes to turn the cleanse AGM that they don 't want to go there anyway because they fear that the kart club will die they want to be Leandra punal is the main motor sport so the obvious answer and we have been speaking with cleaners who say that this is a solution that it makes sense is to resign that to what it was going to be originally to the business zoning I 'm Bucky and thanks very much with it invita we had a deputation couple days ago Dave some day from the cat club is certain to them about this now barnard gates so but they are they are very aware of all of what 's been going there was there were suggesting a different solution they were suggesting to go to the planes Island which they the car club since elves invited they didn 't want to go to but however there will be real problems going there look for 20 years extra they 've been going around all the different sites and every time it just doesn 't work it doesn 't work and so if you 're going to be still sitting here well I might not be over Wi-Fi well no hope yes they got such a long lease if this has been looking for for 20 years when did it get signed up for a 30-year lease oh that was a 1988 and the car club were given the 33 year lease the kart club were informed that they were given a 33 year lease and yet when the wind staff actually drew up the lease that had a a rollover clause of 33 years and they 've got a mandate for the 33 years and that was on the reports of staff saying that visit residential and kart club go to give er sorry but sorry and so they got a foul there easily yearly yeah they had 93-88 yes and the dark club were informed and I 've got a copy of the letter that they that they have 33 years and yet they got a rollover clause in the contract at sears an extra 33 years but that 's illegal you can tell ya what that 's why we don 't worry I was up to staff they 've run for hills because they don 't want to deal with it but so that means that it actually runs out on 20-21 not yes immunity is ty I 've been right through I 've been through the archives do you notice Vicky 's yes I 've here and mike is taking copies of all my and no no no no butter but that 's it seems to me that all of our discussion is has been predicated on the basis that we essentially had to buy them out of a 33 year lease I thought they had 33 years to run they expire in 2021 yes analyst and you 're saying that their contracts is they 've got another a ripe for another thirty three guys I 've got a right of you renewal but that was never that was never the government can 't renew contracts that long i 'm sure no well I sort of look at that I bet no we have I mean we 've got caught we had a paper that went to council yesterday and council determined not to the community board for further advice and to bring a recommendation back so the two counselors are sitting here I 'm sure that they will be raising this matter at the community board in what I 've pleaded and consultation with michael kors and I 've given him copies of the letters that leaders went to the car club actually saying they only had 33 years and and we 've always said well you know is the mandate for the extra 33 years yeah it never was and I 've been through all the all the minutes of the council meeting in 1988 we know we never met and that was that I was very young mean yeah yeah wasn 't me Vicki wasn 't yeah yes she was nearly me alright so lets you actually resigned a round up in all of us is a relevant that really because then that doesn 't hit you know they can stay sorry Alicia and it yes absolutely that 's great all right well you 've given us a lot of food for thought I saw people nodding around the the a good look at that as well i would i would suspect the the relevant committee will will want to welcome at each year will want to have a conversation about their but look thank you both very much excellent submission given us food for thought is is everyone does when they come thank you thank you than that _"

    "text": "the horse will residents association Ron Benson hi welcome I 'm not Ron Fensom hello I 'm Ron 's not here today so I 'm David hawk I 'm the horse or resident Association secretary right okay that 's all right where you need me you caught me out so yeah I didn 't know yeah well we just identified this last night as what is that they 've got the wrong person but anyway okay only going thank you very much for the opportunity to present our submission you know we 're really encouraged by the level of community interest in the long-term plan and we imagine that that you are too we really acknowledge as an association they 're difficult decisions faced by counsel with encouraged our local folk to put in their own submissions on the financial side of the long-term plan and so over the next week or so you 're going to be hearing from three of our executive in a personal capacity and I think you 'll find they will bring you quite contrasting viewpoints in this presentation we want to highlight three projects the youth facility so if we start off with the library we want to record again our appreciation to the council of the new to have her pulse Walt library and community center I think you will all know that construction is proceeding apace and we 're really looking forward to its opening we 're really encouraged to as construction is proceeding that the council isn 't actively engaging with the halsell community and setting up displays and so on so the facility becomes more than just the building the location of this facility in central horse Walt is close to other community facilities and so it 's spot on from that perspective and we 're confident that the facility will be well used and will be a key contributor to the Horsell community if we turn now to the choir man 's trail cycleway our association strongly supports the whole cycle way but we particularly in support of the quirements trial we appreciate what in that context it 's high priority within the council 's cycleway project some people notably in the press a week or so ago have we would say that this cost is actually an inevitable consequence of a retrofitting approach to this sort of facility prior planning is always less expensive in the long run and we would say that council in past decades hasn 't served as well in that regard you will obviously know that horse wall is not a compact community and so one of the key issues facing us as community connectedness and general livability community connectedness and livability are fundamental to a thriving community spirit and to happy citizens and by giving people a safe active transport option to get a reap to get around we envisage that this cycle way will help Halsall to move from being a suburb to being a community Paul saw was a community in the old days of 1995 but I think that 's faded somewhat now I 've already noted their appreciation for that library in the community center but one of the points that we make in our written submission is the importance of linking their quarry man 's trial to other community facilities and it would be an absolute tragedy if hundred meters up the road so I think that they 're linking thing it 's not just going to be the quirements trail that 's going to be an issue that crops up all across the city but in halls will we 're particularly aware of that we also think the choir man 's trail will be a fundamental contributor to the proposed Meadowlands housing exemplar by providing an easy active transport link to both halls wall n to the central city so it 's really important that this project move ahead fact I think I saw the bulldozers there last week and that it fully provides for people who want to take that active transport option we turn now to finally to the horse will you facility in the long term plan this has designated a skate park and I have to say that that made us shut up somewhat that project wording is somewhat ill-advised and if we look at what 's happened in some that in the last few weeks I think skate park is a little bit like red rag to a bull so we always brought the issue of a youth facility to our community board in 2006 and it 's taken a long time to get this far we originally brought the issue following the trespassing from Horsell school grounds of one of our young skateboarders and he is now 24 something that really bothers us is that council has consistently ignored young people unless they become boy racers or taggers and this project to me or to our association suggests a glimmer of change so that perhaps as a city we 'll start following the lead of a lot of small places like reefton or Featherston or twice them in providing for young people so again we strongly support this project and we look forward to opening day thank you very much very good questions Jimmy chin only one question you know your particular comes on the news subdivision in the area the metal lender community facility my understanding actually the if new subdivision the location not too far away from the new community center in the library sh 0 so whether they can share those are the community facility oh if you you know spatial neighborhood community what kind of community facility in any two steps by the developed it 's an interesting one first thing is to me the sort of scales of community facilities and so I don 't think we would say you need that meadowlands needs to have its own library that would be so it but if you think about things like playing fields then if you think in the existing walls will occasion there 's a small playing field in scotts park which is between chicken save in nottingham f now that 's the sort of small scale community facilities that we have in mind we 're not suggesting there the likes of a library or a domain or something like that needs to go into Meadowlands it 's very much those local scale things and actually the Wayne Francis Trust is moving all the time on the way that they 're looking at developing community facilities and I understand that they 're looking at something in the Heritage Park area of Medellin so yeah it 's a it 's an interesting question but to me good thank you very much okay thank you much appreciated _"

    "text": "residents association when it rolls hi welcome our end thank you for having us here from the island up and records and residents we just want to focus on two main concerns and the first one which I 've outlined for you in this some hand up is coming around is that in the middle of midwinter of last year July we held a seminar for which was organized by the alum and upper riccarton residents association on student urban villages that was at college house and it involved architects transport people Student Village People Social Welfare and and so on we were looking at the whole thing we had 23 speakers about this and after the seminar which we wrote a report back to the Wigram and record upper riccarton community boards and one of the main wrecking recommendations are net and we had quite a deputation from our area go to the community board we squeezed in there as Vicki will and also councillor Chen will recall Peter da was asked and has subsequently put our alum and upper riccarton request in the form of their in their for the alum and upper extant area for the alum area which surrounds the university to be included and developed by the as a master plan now we 're trying to work in a to take the initiative and work in a very positive manner with the University of Canterbury as it deals with their earthquake generated and future issues particularly in relation to student accommodation and the we ask the City Council and our community board or assistance we want to be a contributor and ensure that the development in their area is good development let me spell this out a bit more the element of her occasion residents believe that we need similar assistance to what 's being developed in the master plans in other areas particularly on the east of christchurch want to make sure that these plans are developed and the most important thing is that we get the right process going in the proper engagement process this is not happening at the moment and we want to get the support the professionalism and the expertise that the urban design team can bring to our situation and they 've done this before in littleton i 've listed their signum lynnwood village Selwyn street shops and main road Ferry Road some new village and more recently new brighton now and in also the Edgware village so there 's all of these master plans have to be in develop we 're asking that the island upper riccarton area be included in that I 'll tell you why the University of Canterbury currently has 1.1 billion and their total budget for the buildings on campus and this includes their insurance work the government investment and the UC investment and you know that 's a huge in amount of development and work that 's going into our side of the city the alumina para cotton area has also a large amount of money going into V insurance and business development into the creek Rhode Island shops the uper risked home on the fill Tech 's site there and there 's a dementia hospital there there 's the bush in all the development in that area and the total is certainly 2 billion or over so what we want is the with a process that will lead to a high quality urban design particularly in relation to the student urban villages we discovered in our seminar and as a result of all of that that much of the University of Canterbury 's workers very ad hoc for instance some of the dovedale development that they had lined out and their payer in their books were simply cut and paste from the breathe competition village we were quite alarmed just to see this cut and paste stuff happening because residents in our neck of the woods are selling their properties believing that what is being put out in these high glossy brochures is for real and it isn 't really we need to have a proper engagement process with professionals such as the city council urban design team the also the element upper riccarton residents have asked through the Official Information request for the University of Canterbury to release information about student numbers and as I speak to you today we have gone back to the Ombudsman requesting that the University of Canterbury treat us as the other tertiary institutions have and hide what the student accommodation future needs our in Christchurch we are quite concerned about that and we 're glad that the Ombudsman is helping us about that now the second area that I want to talk with you about is the in particular your long-term plan and what it says about the dovetail campus and how residents are very highly agitated and consumed that this is going to be the new party central for Christchurch and you will have seen recently on 60 minutes I think it was the Otago residents around the university in Otago being really concerned about the old alcohol-fueled activities that are going on around Otago University in Dunedin and also we are very familiar here in Christchurch with what 's happened in rectory street and around the streets of riccarton these are of high concern and we understand them around the dovetail campus now I want you really to look closely at what the City Council is doing about the dovedale campus I think you need to be following the advice of the Otago vice-chancellor professor Harlene Hayne and also professor Doug Solman and alcohol free zone and the alamin upper riccarton residence our concern that is going to be overridden when the City Council allows any long-term plan for their alcohol to be sold and supplied on the dovetail campus up to 11 p.m. we have very closely the New World we have henrys we have a whole Western a whispered drift of all the alcohol outlets and in the woods and we don 't need a big party central in dove Dale campus so you 're referring to page numbers the nation I can 't I can 't relate the page number to anything what page of what i believe it 's out of the long-term plan no it 's a bit District Planning if you 've got this mixed-up of the district then maybe the district there I 'm sorry if I put a little mixed up yeah it 's not something if it 's the district claim we can 't really deal with it here RK it 's a different process I mean it goes to your submission i guess around the idea of a master plan for adam and adds to that I guess but i 'm pretty sure that what you 're what you 're wanting for hearers relates to the district plan but i 'm not sure what well it could well be because the we 've got a small work group in within our group that has been working specifically on this yeah and they certainly have tied up you may ask for me to raise this here yeah do you know where it 's up to which pat as a stage 1 or stage to it I mean maybe it 's good yeah I 'm and I just want to I want to kind of point you in the right direction so that baby will do that by email afterwards okay yeah but i guess the opportunity here is to tell you that we 're really shaping up to be Party Central in our neck of the woods and we 're not pleased with it yeah and we do need some i mean the the thrust of the main part office that about the master plan we really do need a lot of money is help from the urban you know design team in order to be able to help us get something that 's desirable and safe for residents out there I 'm retention by city may be so many pie with hang the liquor ban areas and upper riccarton where we extended the liquor band area but the university made a case for the campus to be excluded from been basically citing the premise that they have their own controls internally to manage the university campus and any liquor ban would be restrictive on some of the activities within campus so that perhaps where some of the rest and maybe we need to need to be further consultation with the university itself how they manage that program within their own campus yeah we couldn 't you couldn 't progress '_''_730.589 this without consulting with the university either so but a lot good thank you very much more I take that on board I mean it 's perfectly in order to raise all of these matters but offline we will make sure that we get your second element and to the right and to okay man thanks very much _"

    "text": "I 'm John Goodrich from the summit road society did I not get that right is it not right um I 'll sir no sir sorry sit down sorry I made a mistake i thought they said they had 4,000 people at the meeting sorry right right thank you for this opportunity to talk to our submission on the long-term plan I 'm John Goodrich I 'm Secretary of the summit real society and this is jeremy agar he 's vice president you 've seen the written submission and uh nothing really to add to that I just like to highlight some of the main points the submission was in 33 separate parts a bit about the port hills parks and reserves in general something about the summit role and then something about funding for some of the local conservation groups the summit road societies no suggestions for any more specific projects or changes to the way the City Council managers of all hills what we would like to see is business as usual the council should be very proud of this fantastic asset on our doorstep where we 've network of walking tracks we 've got some world-class mountain biking and road cycling so we urge the council to continue to recognize the importance locally nationally and even internationally of the poor hills and to ensure that the sufficient funding to continue to do everything that makes the portals what they are which is to continue to plant native species which are important both for the biodiversity and things like slopes the stability to continue to try to eradicate invasive weeds which affect the biodiversity to continue to carry out animal pest control for opossums mustelids and rats and to ensure that the network of tracks is maintained I think another important thing here is we we need to would like an assurance that council can continue to support and advise Rowland tears and voluntary groups such as ours particularly through the port hills ranges and just an example there as I understand it in the last planting season there was something like twenty three thousand trees planted on the port hills and of those four thousand were planted by volunteers now our submission we are the summit road we do have similar concerns about similar work on biodiversity tracks and that sort of thing across the whole of the peninsula the second part was in respect to the summit road itself we feel that there 's an opportunity and I hate this word to brown the port hills and their importance and the recreation opportunities that there are by the way that the summit road itself is managed in 2009 the summit road Protection Authority produced their paper a new vision for the summit road in the port hills a heritage rolled through a park in 2009 and it suggested a single management plan for the administration of the road and all the associated parks and reserves we did urge the council to look at the authorities paper again and to consider its adoption we think there 's a great opportunity and this is a first step for the council not to reopen the section of a summit road that 's currently closed to vehicles and open to the pedestrians and cyclists the feedback we 've received as being incredibly positive about the experience that gives people a experience up there and the feedback is being very very very good and this could be a first logical step to this sort of heritage real concept the final part of the submission is really a respective funding and we the summit roll society really appreciate the fact that we 're now funded from the council budget and this is a major contribution to be able to continue out to carry out our activities but I spoke about business as usual and it really only is enough for us to do business as usual and there is much more that we could do even with a very modest amount of funding and as you probably appreciate we 're one of five groups that are funded in in this way by the council for instance we could increase and improve our animal pest control we could increase the amount of planting we could even recruit more volunteers and we like to feel that we can support the range it 's particularly in a time of decreasing budgets and we could spend more time on education and advocacy about the port hills a number of council objectives related to the environment and to biodiversity recreation education and volunteering and just another for instance in the case of the summit road society we carry out around a thousand volunteer hours a year annually on council parks and reserves plus another couple of thousand on our own reserves so we would request the council to consider increasing the funding to the summit roll society and the other funded conservation rules and of course we 'd be prepared to sit down and discuss in detail what what that would actually mean in terms additional work in our activities and I just give Jeremy the opportunity to add anything if he wishes yes as far as the road is concerned and that would obviously be very according to what part of the summit road it is and we 've come the very very very deeds of people we don 't necessarily envision to complete stopping of cars because people have very will enjoy somebody drives and things like there but certainly an emphasis on cyclists and pedestrians as John has said is very much the feedback I think the the merits of our case really speak for itself they meet all the council 's main policies just like to I just haven 't bit of mental arithmetic doesn 't like 50,000 portillos visitors a year and the funding we get is equivalent to two cents per person per year so you know make it three cents maybe you I 've been gathering support for your submission not to reopen the section of the summit row currently closed with Ilya submissions from other cycling interests and personal representation from my husband first thing this morning when I read it to them so I think that I 'm we 're going to get some information on that Andrew a term and in relation to that proposal presumably the maximum part of the road that you would be looking at closing would be from I think it 's broad leaf lane near Mount Pleasant Road to victoria park would it would it be that whole length and just any information on the type of traffic and the amount of traffic that the road carried pre-earthquake I 'm guessing it we thank you when we were just picking up on on something that we 've we we have discussed on and off over the years and this paper by the protection authority I mean there are no proposals there accept the proposal to manage the road in a way that that showcases the port hills and what the opportunities are there I understand there is some support for some limited closures and restrictions from some of the landowners up there too to which would hopefully prevent the boy racer element and that sort of thing so but as Jeremy said it 's nothing it 's not about closing it 's just that we have a section that is closed that is probably going to cost a lot of money to get up to a standard that will suit vehicle access and we feel that the money will be far better spent elsewhere yeah there 's no real need a cyclist lovett there cyclists are loving it antam in England and victorious with Victoria Park we have a huge amount of vandalism etc and then we 've closed the road there to enjoy victoria park early in the morning in those gates that the toilets aren 't kicked too smashed or anything like that with the extra work is spit and recreation use especially so at the top of a and others would you or see support at a closing the summit road at a certain time of night at both ends too because one of the issues that the Rangers keep telling us is that to try and keep the services like toilets etc work and working order they turn up in the morning or for an early walk or whatever and they vandalize anything up there is pretty well destroyed on a regular basis so to improve the asset of the for the people of Christchurch and using the asset what do you see support for closing the summit road say from it a certain time at night to reopening in the morning there was certainly one of the main reasons given that people have told us to stop all the vandalism and and there 's no problem actually with them the residents there there 's all sorts of won 't be an issue I wouldn 't thought yeah very good thank you very much much appreciated with the ILA man up _"

spreyton neighborhood network or SN in four short last month yes in in leaflet at 4,000 sprayed in homes and shops inviting them to a public meeting there we discussed local issues and your proposal about asset sales keep our assets canterbury or car for short made their presentation we agreed with their arguments and letterboxd 2300 homes in spreyton with the car leaflet we fully support the submission on asset sales made by the spreyton heathcott community board in addition we agree with all the submitters who oppose the sale of our council owned assets the three of us will now comment on the 21 reasons that we have submitted as to why you should not sell our assets Sonia hodder thank you for the opportunity to speak to you as a spray tan neighborhood network secretary I would like to emphasize points 10 and 12 of our sub our consumers on behalf of all the women from the earthquake so we are still dealing with housing issues their needs will not be met by the anchor projects being forced on us our council by the cost sharing agreement with the central government many of these can be delayed my secret winters with regard to number 12 we particularly object to the sale of part or all of city care who are to be commended for the way they had maintained and restored our beautiful botanic gardens and park areas this is one thing that has brought solace to suit so many after the earthquakes and continues to provide peace among the demolition and construction sites and empty spaces for visitors to our city as well as our locals we do not believe we could rely on such a response in the future the set was sold I just one of David hotter and I 'd like made a comment with regard to us suggested sale or partial sale of Orion I don 't think any other commercial company would have taken the effort and the responsibility to improve our citizens will have been improving our system system stood up so well and it 's been mentioned in the press but also I got stuck in and they repaired our systems right throughout the city and got them back much faster than any commercial firm would do because this there won 't be a profit motive in the arrival but it 's for our own benefit we get the percentage of the profit that they make but unless it took in a case it was when you think about it all the staff involved with that company would have pressure from all quarters personally to get their system back particularly when it affected them in their family so there 's great motivation if the council can have owners of some of those service companies and let 's face it water and electricity are the necessities for life and even in the build-up cities and this is one thing we have with a riot if we give away part of the responsibility of the ownership of Orion will lose that percentage of the profits out of the company 's books and we will not have the personal motivation city and therefore strongly against the idea of dispensing with the asset value which is probably quite considerable because the only simponi they put in it 's built into the system it 's there on the asset books for all the copper that goes into the ground and stuff early in the year as well so it 's a very valuable asset and it has that shall we say home ownership of all of us in the city and all of the employees of that particular company so would not like the sea in this situation that we have here are trying to find money of selling that particular asset in the city spuyten neighborhood network or SN in four short says Christchurch International Airport must be retained by our city to the extent that it is now owned by us while the airport charges us like wounded balls for our car parking we see that its revenue is making our city a destination in itself rather than flying out arriving tourists to Queenstown or to other tourist spots it 's in incest of our port of Littleton that this working hard to ensure that locals will have a port area that is a social amenity and that diamond harbour ferry passengers won 't have to endure a forced march from their boat to Littleton sprayed a neighborhood network is it in says that our city-owned red bus although forced to compete with other bus companies is known to be the best employer of its drivers compared with other bus lines that are privately owned in the city s in in says that our city own strategic assets are companies that are generally good employers who are trying hard as we speak to ensure proper health and safety for their staff he sent in wants to see that Christchurch workers are properly treated by our city owned companies and that we never have to injure the situation in which kiwiRail finds itself today one of having to make safe a dangerous track signaling and rolling stock which favorites right and American owners so shamefully neglected while Gutzon down any profits SN in has no confidence that private buyers of our assets would do any better the Cameron report says 106 we are not financial experts but we fail to see how this amount becomes 1.2 billion anchor projects are not wanted let 's defer them or cancel them and please tell central government to stop pressuring you to pay for them finally SNN says the teen are saying there is no alternative is a lie to bully citizens into the sale of assets the City Council has several hundred staff with plenty of brain power if you allow them also to be bold as Chamber of Commerce told you to be bold and let them present you with creative solutions for paying our way in difficult times without selling assets then please come to the spray tan neighborhood network and citizens with real alternatives they disguised your decision making this should get you out of the hole of asset sales which you have dug for yourselves thank you for your attention best wishes for some honors sauce soul-searching be strong for courageous decision making for the people of Christchurch Thank You Jamie thank you for that and those create creative solutions and suggestions and that 's what the long-term plan when you were touching on strategic assets what what in your opinion what makes a strategic assets strategic analyse in fear I 'm not very good and hard of hearing maybe my colleague our baby I just don 't make a strategic s its strategic in your view the council lists five strategic assets as you know the port the airport city care Orion and the rear does so that the council has the right to pull them strategic assets and I think in terms of some local government act which defines how council could describe strategic and non-strategic assets so I don 't know if I 'm answering your question but I 'm telling you what I know about the process it 's great look thank you very much that 's um it 's very helpful and it 's great that you went to so much trouble to get so many people to come to a meeting up but I think we 've ever had 4,000 people at a meeting before and it 's amazing that you are able to get so many people to come together fantasy well done _"

    "text": "thank you now could we have the mower neighborhood group Barry blocker hi well I 'm odd Jellico doh um and mini thinks the opportunity first to put in a brief submission and now a chance to speak to you as well you 'll be pleased to know um my little presentation will also be brief ever you 'd sit on Barry brooker idea the mower neighborhood group I 've done that for some time em I also currently cheer the Peterborough village incorporated and so I 'm coming from a spective if someone who actually lives in the central city and someone who would like to continue to live with ear I think one of the challenges for someone doing a presentation in living here as it just so many issues to address which is also the problem that you face so I 'd like to start with just a couple of deal all comments and then in the first is as a community and for me personally just to acknowledge the difficult task the council heads a new zealand 's history there wouldn 't be many councillors who such as a Christchurch earthquakes but unfortunately for you you 're pre-deceased as lief the city under insured but I 'm gene sure even if it being fully insured it would be a really difficult job and seek early youth quakes provided the govern with an opportunity to elect emergency powers and these are mowed me up necessary at the time but it appears that regaining a normal powers for the council and returning the different democratic rights of the people of Christchurch there 's not quite such an easy task and for those of us looking on we 're in sure just how much control just in some cases the council hears over what we 've previously been the demesne and a chance to make the decisions on their own which brings me to the point of asset sales um and again even without the earthquakes our current government 's made it very clear that they wish to sell a new zealand 's national assets and they seem to think councils should do the same and so the local assets and once the city 's assets are sold however and for controlling the rights and i found that your recent breakfast workshop at hacking it ball scene there was really worth I always great to be be with others and really good to hear the planes and the issues that you raised but it 's not disappointed that in the main document the only options in there were four asset sales there wasn 't something in the ax saying well if we keep our assets this will be the outcome by believe there are in the supporting documents but not in the main documents that went to the population my own view Ahmet of many of the people in the mower and Peter oh groups as the S itself should be the last resort and we also believe it renegotiating the Inca project of the government is essential but I wouldn 't like to be doing your job doing that it seems like a difficult task someone living in me in the city um I also like to make a distinction which seems to sometimes be lacking and then is that um when planes are formulated and often when between the central city as a community and its own right so for us this is our community but at the same time it 's also trying to do the job of being a center for greater Christchurch and for keen to be in some cases for New Zealand and for those of us living here we see these is quite different quite different things to achieve and sometimes they counter each other as well and the other thing that sometimes we little just creasing is media items and even some your own counsel documents at times forget there are many people living in the central city we 've been the arrival of the earthquakes were still there now and most of us are committed to residential life in the central city and in terms of your goal of trying to get more people living under central city probably the easiest stiffest icky vast Lea rather than get others coming in which is a harder way and then leads me a wee bit i 'm making a contrast and ralindi meant to the anchor projects the large and costly anchor Kim in the King debris economies and probably New Zealand 's economy but i don 't think that project selectee attract people to live in the other city and they 're definitely not always attractive to those of us who live via these are expensive program these expensive projects to give it with attempts to force development under precincts seems a far cry from the exciting miss mixed-use development with the focus on people pedestrians and cycleways that were portrayed in the initial concepts with those initial discussing and the discussions following the earthquakes and I do understand that a lot has happened since but we were full of these great hopes then and perhaps some of the realities of at home and making the distinction between the local and the bra dios i think a good example would be something like this interior pool and a half on the felt fear which is now gone but the Centennial pool played a really important part for those of us who lived in the community it was a community asset whereas a big pool in a new stadium is going to 'd like to also just comment briefly on building and making it easier fit of but as we see it anyway making it easier for developers to build with limited concern for those who already live in the area and not having to have parking for those of us who live there just in terms of parking I can see why we prefer not to have cars but I don 't see how they 're just going to disappear so the Warriors we 're gonna have buildings without parking in the cars are still going to be here but there 's also an insistence near on high density of housing which definitely has a place in our city we acknowledge the need for high-density housing in the central city but we also see a need for quality in variety and were not too sure both those will happen and the present plans commenting oh I am one thing a hundred percent agreement and with the council 's written letters and horror and the horizontal infrastructure and we really realized how important that but also that 's very expensive and that and more expensive a later date and then just on on transport it 's an enormous issue that you 're facing the year and I think particularly we are a relatively small city and we 're a country dominated by cars so really by commenters good luck on getting price to its residents to use public transport I 'd be great if you can I don 't think it 's going to be an easy an easy sell cycleways and a lot of people in the inner city are very keen on these but being realistic they 're not a panacea but they should be part of your planning I was also reading in the 10-year plan document and the long-term plan I mean just quoting from it we believe the earthquakes have provided us with the once and a lifetime and opportunity as their city in communities are rebuilt we can build a safer resilient more sustainable and efficient transport system and I think they rider to go with it we can 't_''_500.19 do that if we keep rebuilding so many of your robes just to say we before you need traffic to flow and movement within the silly but rebuilding them actually executives that we were prior to the earthquake I think reduces the chance of having more cycle pedestrian and bass friendly roots in the future what we do now obviously the cost of that these things are staying in place long time and one local example for us a salisbury street which initially had some exciting things going to happen there and now it 's just a busy one way road and the mix Ria 's is more of an aside and there is they 'd love to see when it 's feasible be in the city electric buses back in place you know they did add some vitality to the city and keep people moving around it that we realize peps you need a a critical number of businesses in place before you can do that and my final come is just on affordable and social housing the current government wishes to divide and divest itself of social housing stock and I think some of the responsibility that goes with that and it seems to the city that were the quality of life in our city isn 't measured by expensive homes and their new big Latin large stadiums it has to be measured against how we house and care for the least fortunate and houses in our city um and I hope many of the group hope that the idolatry ideology of the current government and is not forced on the council and that we can continue to be a city the keys for its residents there are many things i can say that i 'll finish it leah and just thank you so much for the chance to speak but also feeling people would you do on our behalf thank you thank you very much there are some time for questions but i think you spoke to what a lot of people have been expressing as with them listen to these submissions so thank you very much for taking the time and please pass on our thanks to your group thank you very much thank you _"

at can 't society canterbury west coast so stretching the whole patch right down to the west coast there thank you for the opportunity to present our key points from our submission to the long-term plan for Christchurch Cancer Society really values the long-term partnership that we 've had with Christchurch City Council as we firmly believe that health begins where you work live learn and play and we do feel at the long-term plan as the potential to bring about real improvements in health for our community and citizens we can just introduce our chief executive elizabeth testament to say a few words thank you for the opportunity to comment on your long-term thing a cancer society recognizes that where we live work learn and play does have a significant effect on our health and well-being it also helps reduce the risk of developing an illness and clothing cancer every day 'd kill cancer we value our partnership with you and helping shape our communities so the Cancer Society would like to offer the following points to highlight the ways in which local policy can be how see the next few years will be challenging key is the demands and your district are considered against available resources however working together along with our colleagues and other agencies we think is a great way to support community well-being health cannot be separated from community which is why we have given our submission the title our place our health thinking we just like to emphasize the can society places particular emphasis on the community outcomes set forth by Christchurch City Council and although the long-term plans are heavily infrastructure based financial strategy based and really about asset management we do feel that health can not be separated from the core services that you provide so we know christchurch 's change in you expect a population grow for 23,000 over the next two years puts Christchurch City Council in a position unlike no other council to maximize that place shape and well that as hike like some of the opportunities to shape health within our communities as the city moves from recovery to regeneration we applaud Christchurch City Council for their commitment to smoke free community spaces over the years and now how that has been sustained of course these help reduce the visibility of tobacco especially around children young people and contribute to the government 's overarching goal of a smoke-free new zealand by 2025 our own research conducted across Canterbury West Coast indicates as mercury counter we have already said high degrees of public support for smoke-free outdoor community spaces we also know that green spaces and have a niggly a green careened city or valued even more by the Christchurch community post-earthquake we welcome the opportunity to work together on options for extending on policy and asked as smoke free Canterbury did that council consider endorsing the 2025 goal as a framework for this partnership the City Council would not be alone in this across New Zealand there is growing support and councils are moving to extend in smoke-free environments and particular progress has been made with our Australian counterparts as hi my name 's councillor richard Foster and I 'm a counselor with the city of Melbourne about two years ago we started implementing smoke free zones across our city had started with a three month trial in a place called the causeway since then of course we 've introduced a number of further smoke free zones the result has been quite outstanding initially the public acceptance and support for smoke free zones in the city ranked at around sixty-two_,_294.88 percent but it 's truly amazing to see now the public support is willing to the 80s certainly not going down anytime soon businesses are benefiting to businesses of reporting increases in their takings as a result of having a smoke free environment to offer their customers you know when you think about creating smoke-free areas and smoke-free environments has to happen on a number of levels in Australia it 's happened through the federal government and their encouragement removal of branding and cigarette packets and of course the restriction on displaying cigarettes in retail environments d normalizing cigarette smoking happens on all levels and at a local level we a broader across our city there 's three more smoke trees earns coming to moving it around july this year so wish you like as well with your vote for initiatives we all had just to say we are hoping to bring councillor foster over later in the year in September and to help us move forward in our partnership in terms of smoke-free environments as well as showing leadership in tobacco control over the years we really do congratulate Christchurch City Council with being one of the first councils to develop its local alcohols excuse me could you just flick over this one because we we can 't receive submissions the local welcome opening so in terms of physical activity we know that New Zealand is now the fourth most obese country in the OECD that means that nearly two-thirds of adults are either way overweight or abuse obese slip the tongue councils as planners for recreational residential commercial spaces play a key role in helping communities be active more opportunities for sporting activities play equipment in new residential areas the development of walkable neighborhoods and strategies from tentative place shape and roll over the next decade similarly in managing those recreational spaces we ask that the council give consideration to adequate shade cover both from natural and built perspectives the Cancer Society have a vision for Canterbury that the long-term health of residents will be improved by the public having sufficient opportunities to safely seek out the Sun and enjoy shape protection through September to April this is particularly important in the rebuild of Christchurch as these two clips from one of our Sun smart schools diamondharbour shows hey guys where your son hands ah come on I 'll go take you to your classroom and we can go for the morning okay guys you have to remember your hats when you 're up good now let 's go play hi my name is Isabel and I am senior student from dying to have school we are some smart school that means we sit in the shade and wear hats SAS matt is important because it prevents us from getting hurt getting skinned person we 're rebuilding Christchurch we need more sun protection like sunshade for me and leader of the volunteer group and diamond harbour and it 's something that we all enjoy very much being able to help the school children for one thing we supply heads to them in sunscreen through our fundraising efforts and we help people with cancer in our in our particular area some heads are not enough night absolutely they need and sales up in trees thanks very important things and playgrounds and everything like that we 're children in particular concentrate they need to help ease some protection the rebuild of the city is a great opportunity for the City Council in their planning process to bring in new areas we there is plenty protection especially programs in areas like there was lots of lovely trees in San chain we need be it 's very important for all of us to protect us from student visa just to say our Cancer Society support groups are our local base of people who are affected by cancer supporting each other through obviously the impact of that diagnosis over half of our schools in Canterbury west coast our son smart and this means will recognize the importance of sun protection with the rebuild just like to thank you again for the opportunity to present to the long-term plan to present our perspective our place our health thank you for your time thank you not sure where we up to this time Oh three seconds bright it was very good timing thank you very very much and thank you for what you do to both of you _"

    "text": "matam wets from smoke free Canterbury is it right yes at a mad as the council thank you for the opportunity to address you this afternoon my name is Martin wit I 'm from the cancer society and I represent the agencies working as smoke-free Canterbury we 're working together to support a smoke-free air terror by 2025 briefly the question of what is smoke-free at RR it is a goal to see the population smoking population under five percent New Zealand 's the government endorse goal came out in 20 20 2011 it 's a vision to see our goal to see our children or grandchildren will be free from tobacco and enjoy a tobacco-free life and it will be a country in which it could be very difficult to supply so tobacco what is the relationship between smoke-free Arturo and the council the first thing is that let 's put some context in it it 's a vision or it 's a goal whereby the percentage of smokers are served it 's down to five percent or less for Canterbury in Christchurch we currently have the census 38,000 down to something like 13,000 clearly it is not a ban it is some of the parts working to reduce those taking smoking up protecting our children and supporting those two quick smoke free category has an in excellent relationship with the City Council you were one of the progressive councils in 2009 to adopt your smoke free outdoor areas which covers all green space you introduced smoke-free housing in 2014 for which you want to a health in all policies award two weeks ago from the dhp you 're joined by all your photo councils in Canterbury which all have similar policies and canopy west coast I believe it 's one of the most progressive regions in the country in that sense councils are key to progressing however the 2025 goal and the LTP we believe is the framework around which we can continue to work in partnership the first question that we ask is with the council consider endorsing smoke-free 2025 I 've you 'll wrote it already doing it as we indicated it is a continuation of the partnership in simple answer to the question why endorse report in 2007 it refers to local authorities being placed shaping and whilst the for wellness a-- 's have been changed from the local authorities act we believe that none of that has changed you do shape place and you can 't take health from community the question then is the extent to which smoke free outdoor areas are supported many of you will have seen from these figures when i visited the community boards before christmas the survey that the can society did in partnership with the DHB indicated and telephone survey over 400 people a high degree of support for your current policies there is resounding support for policies that promote not ban promote smoke free outdoor areas there is very strong support to see those policies extended extended into areas such as smoke free outdoor dining around the building parameters such as those managed by the council and indeed to other areas such as transport hubs when we look at the likelihood wood smoke free impact on people 's behaviour to visit community spaces there is a resounding no indeed thirty one percent of our survey and in fact smoke free outdoor areas are more attractive and people are more likely to visit this is particularly pertinent when we look in the business community wood smoke free outdoor dining detract from smoke from people enjoying cafes and indeed turning away no the question is and the literature is consistent that smoke free outdoor areas are popular with diners we 're aware that in telephone surveys we don 't necessarily capture the youth demographic some of you may well have seen when I presented the community boards we launched our fresh air project and through the summer using iPads in our community events particularly the Cancer Society 's Relay for Life we captured the views particularly of younger members of the population looking specifically what do they see their city in the future how consistent with their vision of the city would be a smoke-free city and I 'm very pleased to say that there again the views of youth are echoed by the ones that we found in older age groups and adults so I think we are confident that the vision from the population is indeed in terms of whether you choose to go to a smoke-free restaurant needs to be balanced by what the views of business indeed are and we have recently conducted and it 's now just being numb peer-reviewed a survey of business premises outdoor dining venues in some of Christchurch 137 venues were interviewed either face-to-face by telephone and these are the headline results from that the first thing that I think is very important that there is a very strong agreement that secondhand smoke is a public health issue it 's a public health issue in those spaces that we 're discussing this afternoon and when we ask the question would businesses consider smoke-free as an option that is not asking them whether it should be a bylaw or whether it should be voluntary simply the philosophy behind outdoor dining and we 're very encouraged the extent to which 61 percent of businesses said there were either could consider it or they would definitely become smoke-free what we believe the survey has done is created what we would say is a synergy there is enough grounds there for conversations over free outdoor dining there 's definitely enough to have conversations and we think that 's part of our partnership in the coming years the key messages that aren 't new council other smoke-free policies policies that you you have are popular there is a high degree of support and a high desire to see those extended and our redeveloped city presents opportunity to consider those extensions and that is exactly what we do with the partnership there with that we have in conclusion council we would ask that Council formally considers adopting the 2025 goal and I appreciate that may indeed be something that we need to come back to but I would ask you to consider it and we 'd like to work with you on that we certainly would like to support staff to work with smoke free can 't_''_451.51 agree on a strategy for developing more smoke free community spaces and we do indeed have an implementation group with the DHB and the council we believe the forum already exists and that 's encouraging and finally we would ask that against that we do indeed continue to such as bus stops outdoor dining pedestrian miles and the perimeters of your buildings the conversations are already starting and we congratulate you for the work that you 're doing thank you very much thank you I 'm Andrew given the work you 've done on outdoor dining areas and smoke free outdoor dining areas how would you explain the gap between what 's clearly an overwhelming acceptability or even desirability on the part of the public for smoke-free outdoor dining spaces and a reticence on the part of businesses noting that you 're 61 percent was including possibly approve how do you explain the gap between what the public would want and what the businesses are saying they would find acceptable I think straight answer that is that business want to see more evidence which is why we started this survey we don 't but we don 't for one moment suggest that it has all the answers but we think understandably business have to explore all the different angles there are questions as to well does that mean that my next door cafe neighbor will go or won to work through whether business want to have that as a single by law or voluntary policy so I think there are a number of questions which make the business caution understandable Tim thank you you know in our sports fields and playgrounds etc have got smoke free in it and almost every I 've never I haven 't seen smoking in a sports field or playground for I can remember how long so I think it 's working and it 's done on basically good faith yes so when we have it open morals whether it 's a bishop Dale or writing or whatever we I just cut how would you suggest we police that would have been the same lines I believe the current policy has exactly the same potential to work in areas like that 10 thank you so it 's not an enforceable and not an enforcement machine all right man okay our Phil work previously with the DHB so they 've achieved their policy of having their grounds areas smoke free indeed and the real tolerance so would I just want to could how impress said we achieved their to to achieve the overall goals exactly yes i would i would totally endorse that so you 'd work with council studying would work as partners partners it 's got a challenger thinking there 's a lot of people in this building I 'd appreciate that too huh anyway look thank you very much that 's some excellent thank you very much thank you thank you medicine _"

    "text": "and next up was volunteer guides and the christchurch botanic gardens mr. mrs. Fenning here 's somebody will come and collect that for you thank you and thank you for what you do while we 're waiting it 's a pleasure thank you kick capitol couture madam mayor and councillors we are Fey and Neal Fleming and respectively we coordinate and train the volunteer botanic garden guides overall our aim is to be add to the value of the our botanic garden guides bring it into the top 20 or 30 in the world and that requires at least two special components one is the botanic gardens have to be involved in research and they have to be involved in education without those all that you have is a collection of plants and you 're just a any other city garden to be a botanic gardens you have to be something special even though some of them New Zealand gardens call themselves pretending our aim is to enhance the education role to make our garden cities Gardens truly a botanic garden and we have some purposes and activities on the with those hello we 're the only botanic gardens in New Zealand that have a daily guided walk we operate from mid-september to the end of April every day except christmas day offering a 90 minute guided walk that leads from the museum because that 's where most of the Taurus sale we are a volunteer group currently numbering about 20 and we have trained two cohorts of about twenty guides in 2003 and 2010 were almost ready for another lot and we began just prior to the year 2000 training involves 45 hours of practical and learn skills in a course that takes over five weeks we are under the aegis of friends of the Christchurch botanic gardens and return funds to them these funds are used for special projects within the gardens and for rough mangie our ward member and our activities cost the council nothing and our guide you will pay rate we we work closely with the gardens staff and support their submissions that 's why we 're today we 're just addressing number two on their overall submission because they have their own submission as curator and the section curators are part of our monthly training programs we add value to the tourist experience and enjoyment as they become part of the large largest tourist attraction in New Zealand with 1.4 million visiting the Botanic Gardens each year we also offer local community groups specialized guided walks outside vs daily service ours we receive commend commendation and plaudits from those whom we guide and we recently organised and ran a successful five-day conference for australasian guides and botanic gardens and met a mere attended there and spoke at it 220 people attended ninety-five percent from Australia and that ninety-five percent probably also represents the figure for overseas tourists that we guide very few Christchurch local people go on a guided walk in what they regard as their gardens which they know intimately of course we don 't believe it but nevertheless our tourists make up 95% to fulfil our overall aim we would like to make the following submission we need a base and re request and the long-term plan that the old information centre is reserved is a multi-purpose site for community groups we monthly to go on training to extend our knowledge and to ensure that we offer a professional competent and skilled service for those whom we guide for that we need to store uniforms gear we need food and for presenting to community groups and using audio version presentations for it with our training and our groups we can 't afford to use a wonderful visitors center that you 've just built because it 's become a commercial venture largely dominated by V base and without any storage or meeting space available to us the garden staff have an allocation for a certain number of hours in that visitors center but we are not a priority and nor do we expect to be a priority for those limited opportunities we extend a warm invitation to any counselors in the mirror to go for a guided walk we can make it free or your ten dollars could be returned back through to the friends and then back to the garden so you would get it back again as it were yeah or we could charge you extra somebody 's that 's right else to make a big donation on top of it and I 'd look I honestly I hadn 't even thought about it but I will be definitely enrolling for one of these wars so and and I just think that it would be a nice thing to do when I retire which is no hopefully soon great we need some more guide so you could tell Gideon oh I 'd love to I 'd love that I 'd love to do the training it 's not my evil twin it 's my other twin Ray Ray Ray thank you hello down slow down thanks very much for coming in the question I 've actually just remind me what is the old Information Center which building is that it 's building currently occupied by doc between the kiosk and the new visitor center that 's not helping me so oh yeah yeah so you go over the footbridge footbridge where you park your car yeah go over the footbridge you 've got the teahouse in front of you that 's being repaired and it 's the building to your left doc and what we actually do use the back part of it for our training at the moment and so how many hours a week would you need it for do you want it as a permanent place we want to at least once a month but we 'd also like to be able to invite groups and four lectures to use there in the Friends of Botanic Gardens have some of the public meetings there also so what would happen with dog sorry what would happen with the only doc is moving out as far as we know it 's a new HP they just work in the front as we work at the beep we just pulled the curtain right we 're not asking for exclusive use of this place I mean right we think it 's a community education center would be excuse okay yeah I don 't wanna get in trouble with them there again but um you know this is again another one of those stories where history the purpose of the new visitor center was for exactly the work that you 're doing correct let 's work so I mean I just wonder whether we need to think about how we use that new facility to help you do the work that you 're doing rather than put you into the old secondhand facility we always dreamed of being in the new building but realize it 's not it 's not a reality because of the other commitments to the building and the size of the building so but if we went back to the original purpose for which it was built which was visitor information education yeah community engagement with the gardens yeah is there anything any things that we could do with in that new building that would help you it was extended right okay at all probably we are currently fixing the old t kiosk at the front part that gives the hexagonal part of that kiosk hasn 't you 've got a purpose is that something you would consider usable for what you want to use it for absolutely we don 't mind what you do mine we just want a space in the gardens yeah Tim lovely Ellen did of the old building is an absolute fantastic one it was used for education anyway by the Rangers you used to sell your flowers it 's got high foot traffic yo son Plan C propagated and grew and raised and funds for you guys yet as an absolute that 's probably the single best place to have plants and sales I think it 's a great idea using a building that 's already there we 've got to get other things from the other buildings yeah but I that 's a fantastic suggestion and should be soon be taken up with the management thank you madam chair phone just a different fringe of the planet gardens that chairman sitting behind me said that they have money to outfit that information cedar to suit the purposes that you might have for the older center what you 're talking about was actually they did run um education this argument idea it 's almost really tough for you as it is yeah well I did education see Bob things in 25 years ago so it 's going around on a whole circle right le yeah I may I know that very night i love the wheelbarrow marvelous oh how can you say that louder they don 't want to hear me count it your point that you making your submission about and I don 't want to point fingers or witch hunt or anything like that but the staff who are at the ilex it 's too much of an inconvenience to manage the plants and things like there is is there any reason why because you 've got a place just on its own over by the you know past the ilex when it 's there is there any reason why it couldn 't be placed more on the approach to the aisle exit or are you restricted and where you what we actually only was supporting that submission i think that submission is coming up more on tuesday night right and i think since for submission there has been some work done on that and there is some advance on that situation towards what you 're suggesting yep yeah that is true that is true excellent so do apologize that not people that have been here for a long time so what I got it up I feel really caught up on this and we 're definitely coming down on one of the walks that 's for sure I usually do a walk through the park and the gardens on a Sunday afternoon so maybe I 'll just come at 1 30 instead of 40 sorry it 's not low but I don 't know I don 't do it at a later time nothing I know your time thank you _"

    "text": "guthrie madam mayor and the counselors thank you very much for the opportunity to speak briefly to you I 'm really following up from submissions that were made early in the week by Phillip Richards Anthony golf and his support he had from Tim Beasley and he had to speak specifically about literal street car park building I know you 've probably got bored about car parking but and not well I mean it 's pretty obvious to all of us that the retail precinct is well under way there 's half a billion dollars or more are being spent by private enterprise on the retail precinct we 've got the justice precinct opposite that 's well under way that 's going to have something like 900 people visiting each day and you of course you can see the the new office buildings that are being developed within about five minutes of of Lee Ballantine sirs my position is slightly different to the others and as much as that we own part of the land that the car park building is on now we we appreciate that the building is going up to replace it but the point that I 'd like to stress here is that I just hope that the council doesn 't allow process to delay final decisions on the building as to who 's going to develop it and how big it is and how many car packers car parks is going to have there was an implication in the long-term plan that there were risks associated with the car park building one of the risks being that if it was too big it would be unsuccessful but it 's very hard to imagine how a building that used to be 1200 car parks and now is likely to be 800 compacts is going to be too big when the retail precinct is likely to be significantly more successful than what it was prior Thwaite that 's pretty obvious the the developments that are going head at the moment the demand for space on Ketchum wall is significant it 's possible that the that the space available won 't meet the actual demand rentals are now looking to be higher than they were pre-earthquake so it to be success now we appreciate that so there 's a car plate building that Carter 's developing and maybe in Tunis Gogh will have some public car parks but the reality is that there will not be enough public car parks to meet the demand so that 's the first thing that needs to be stressed again and the second thing is that it 's really important that this building be operating either partly or fully by Christmas of next year if not the start of summer and the only reason why it won 't be operating is if the council allows process to get in the way now I know that there 's an ele é o I process that 's out there that so you 've now got in front of you a number of proposals and I would hope that those proposals can be examined with with with a degree of haste clearly you 're right decisions have to be made but you own the land its existing user rights and I can 't see why process needs to delay things there 's no reason why there 's really no reason as far as I can see why a new car park building can be cannot be commenced at that point there 's plenty of time to complete the process with the eoi there 's plenty of time to to do the design work I understand there 's a good number of proposals in front of the council the options are there for you it could be built by the council and run by the council it can be done by private enterprise from our point of view we don 't have a problem with the council owning and running the car park you did that very successfully in the past that made money and there 's no reason why you can 't do it in the future but if it has to be done by private enterprise or possibly or maybe even preferably a PPP well they are so be it it 's vitally important for the success of the retail precinct it is going to be the second of the anchor projects completed for the city and it 's really important that we get embarrassed by not having sufficient car parking when all these developments are going to be completed by the end of next year thank you very much Paul Andrew thank you Peter that 's your fully understand and appreciate your views around parking on modern tend to agree that my question is and I just want to currently have actually said if I want to clarify that you are not concerned about the ownership or who owns will runs the car parks in the central city no we 're not concerned but if it is run by the council I would hope that the you do spend the money necessary to make sure that you you you use the most up-to-date technology that 's available there 's obviously no reason for arms to be used anymore that the significant technology that 's available to make that compaq open 24 hours of the day that it can be safe against uncomfortable as to who builds the car park and who learn to come back Andrew thank you we read in the Central City Business Association submission and the other day we heard street car parking from the list of council strategic assets that proposal wasn 't supported by the Central City Business Association do you have a view on that proposal there are moves off straight car parking so to remove off street car parking from the council 's council 's list of strategic assets I don 't have a problem if that is removed from the list of strategic assets providing a new car park building us is built to replace it so I don 't hit with you either way um Jamie thank you better um if the car part building the literal building was indeed down in October do you have a view around whether it be preferable to perhaps hold fire and have at grade car parking over the busy Christmas period or perhaps just track on whether Albert without parking at that space look with a band construction site clearly I 'd prefer that that wasn 't the case but I think the people who speak to really a Valentine 's but I do stress the point that from our point of view as as the adjoining difficulties that we 've got at the moment is attracting tenants and tenants need certainty and at the moment we can 't give them certainty as to win that car park building will be rebuilt and if it is deferred until next year the difficulties that we will have as to what sort of car parking is going to be available for October onwards from next year good okay well thank you very much it up cuz I 'll see you very much _"

    "text": "think it 's really cool oh but he 's got it on Facebook all really it 's all right oh yeah okay right so now the is it North Beach residents association Oh Tina cazzo couture good afternoon madam Mia counselors staff and community my name is Judy Bruce and I 'm representing the north beach residents association have an apology today 's match here in a ketchup man who is unable to be here and supporters also can money who 's an active member of the North Beach residents association just to ring in the Heike in the last minute we appreciate the time given to us to speak to counsel and understand the submission process is not to be taken for granted we wish to add our voice to the growing choir and ground swell of pride and our Beach suburb which sits between South and North Shore 's you 've already heard or will hear many submissions regarding the new brighton legacy project concerns over rafferty golf course the closure of the south brighton camping ground there a pair of pages road bridge and cycleway projects along association wholeheartedly supports all these initiatives which aim to improve the Greater New Brighton area both council led all those be heated by private enterprise and hope to see an integrated approach to future development the new brighton land owners and business association have the energy and willpower to get things started we especially support and endorse as residents association the promenade project which was so well presented to you by the members of the community connection and knowing how to trust and our North Beach residents we believe they presented to you a compelling case to add value to our beachside city not just the beachside suburbs with the promenade project to help make the 19 kilometers of coastline and to provide a starting point in a link between our communities North Beach specifically has been through much in the last few years losing our iconic ozone hotel kasbar hotel and the qe2 sports and rec facility but we 've already seen what a magnificent job a community working cohesively and in conjunction with the council can achieve the refurbishment and strengthening of the North New Brighton War Memorial upgrade to Thompson Park and the new skate bowl facility are further examples of what can be achieved when groups work together with a united goal we see North Beach growing and stature and with the merging of the central New Brighton freeville and north New Brighton schools to create rafferty school on a new site on lever terrace we ask that the long-term plan reflects this with the inclusion and the budget for improved roading safe pedestrian walkways and pedestrian crossings in the area and specifically on the north side of Libra Charis to Marine Parade corner additionally an efficient bus service to assist with school access is also recommended for inclusion in the LTP additionally before the earthquakes marine parade from long style street to beach road was earmarked for a curb and channel upgrade and if this has been shelved due to financial constraints we ask that this project will not be forgotten especially with the winter coming again and school children needing to negotiate flooded streets due to blocked drains on their way to school we may have lost up to 5000 properties in the red such as tomorrow Park Preston 's and white Gary people are returning to the east albeit north of central New Brighton we need to cater for this growth provide a location for easily accessible high schools and recreation facilities and return confidence for growth in the area we plead for a cohesive approach that will rinnai unite all community groups and provide a clear integrated approach for future development thank you David thank you for that fence I just like to to make one observation that was highlighted in the with the amalgamation of three schools into one campus to the old North New Brighton site and the traffic implications that will arise out of that particular no I just reinforced this statement thanks David um yannick yeah I 've got a question along similar lines have you talked to the moa about the increased danger of the school proposals and all the school decisions and what they are contributing to the funding I danger was and terms in North Beach residents association with signal versus our concern I hoping that Rafferty school as scoreboard is actively pursuing this with we raise this concern in philipstown because there was one the reason we thought the school should stay and we know about the same issues and walston so there 's a cost that we are being asked to pick up because of emo agency ani they 're talking about a completely different issue ellipse towns moving but this is this is about and I was wondering have you raised this with the community board yeah yes Chrissie Williams brought this up yeah bout at our feet II and ensuring we 're on top of the transport applications because she 's she is the cord is the Community Coalition transition your community person so yeah because I mean the reason that I 'm sort of kind of interjecting as that your issue is an issue that needs to be dealt with in the community board I mean look just on a bigger picture issue don 't you think that decisions like that shouldn 't be made in your local community at your local community board rather than having to raise it at a long-term plan hearing of the council I mean 's governance and what 's management no no it 's not go nuts amazement it 's not it 's whether it 's a local issue so if we gave funding as a council to the local community board don 't you think it would be better that they could make decisions that actually makes sense to the local community I can only say that we are actively engaged with our community board and we feel fully supported by them and we work closely together yeah and we 're those lines separate and I 'm not actually sure sorry no no they don 't separate there now the other point that I 'm making is is that there are some decisions they can make that other decisions they can 't anyway there are other questions yes to me thank you for your the deputation very good I just want to ask one question you particular mention after earth quaker they have 5,000 the property has been gone may be shifted to the different location para got into all those our facility or party etc how to use how you know that you need to make a proper decision you know some more people more area than little more facility also less area need more facility how to keep a balance just want to know well i think first out we 're very glad that we are sitting here and you 're sitting lyra making their decision thank you very much so it 's very complicated one when it comes to that so i don 't think you possibly have the answer no i mean in our submission what we 're saying is that we see growth in the new brighton area and especially if the high schools do come in our nose and we decided but we 're really concerned about ensuring that specifically in that North Beach window that there are adequate facilities to cater for what we believe is actually a growing number of residents as though as the population moves slightly north and to their era I 'm Glenn thank you thank you for this with what we 've heard just before with it 's the over thee which is an end end end and one of picking approach be an emerging theme overtaking a strategic approach to the whole greater brighton area obviously would that be your view that we need something kind of strategy absolutely too right yes cohesive united and as is to see it i just fully support that there is a huge amount of well both community and private well i think oh really and the promenade is a great example of that that there are so many motivated people in the community that what we need is this United vision that we feel like completely back then supported by the council we can move forward and I really believe that such an active community that we can really make something out of this mmm very good okay well thank you very much _"

mayoral statement coming out an insufficient time for elected members to comment but he 'd already gone beyond the five years i wasn 't going to allow questions and i 'm sorry for the indulgence of of correct i mean you know when somebody says something that is indicates that there is a misunderstanding about what i said or what i intended to say then i don 't see that there 's any problem and i would allow that to be if somebody else was misrep you know if somebody else was in that position i would allow them to have a right of um clarification they just have a balance of meryl comments and availability for elected members to speak but there were no questions available for that submission so i you know but i take your note on point a point so i i don 't i don 't 'm just making a point so sorry about that and simmons when the document came out saying what 's the smart choice my wife and i had a bit of a look at it we didn 't think some of the choices were all that smart and hence we put in a submission i want to address four of the topics that i raised in the submission the first one is asset sales i 'm going to say again this is a doctrinaire approach and does not make economic sense for the people of christchurch it is simply the current government being pushing councils all over the uh all over the country for the past six years but especially in the christchurch area since the earthquake it makes no sense for short-term gain we lose ownership and control of assets and indeed i just see the benefits of the assets we have leaking away from the city away from the area away from the country as has happened with the sale of our other assets doctrinaire doesn 't make sense okay the second thing i already want to talk about already suggested them but i 'll reinforce them right schedule repair and rebuild tasks to avoid duplication just ask gordon smith how many times the intersection of montreal salisbury and victoria was done up and how it savaged this business don 't repair roads and footpaths until major construction work has been completed lovely new ones going down in colombo street near the bus park all along the empty sections we know the construction crews are going to be all over it like a rash smashing it to pieces again wait reschedule the existing schedule of repairs and renewals for you know your 30-year ongoing plan because they 'll be occurring in places where the streets aren 't even majorly damaged save the money and use it where it 's needed right lancaster park if civic assurance says it can be repaired for 53 million then the council should take their word and simply say to them go ahead you get your people and you do it we don 't have that sort of policy then sit back and let it happen nobody if you don 't have the policy go and tell them you say it could be done for 50 yard million go and get them to do it but they don 't get to do it under our policy well negotiate that 's not a policy i had i had the insurance people say we 'll offer you x amount to do your backyard so i went and got three quotes and i couldn 't like even the cheapest one was twice the price so i went to the insurance company and says you do it and they are so go to the insurance company negotiate you 've got the lawyers you 've got the power and negotiate tell them now the fourth thing is something i think is really important ask naitahu to stump up they 've been given special status as equal partners with the council in the rebuild they have oversight of all plans final approval of all business cases and they have a say in the cultural matters but they haven 't stumped up a single cent yet they had a hundred million to put into a hospital in dunedin let them show million into helping this council restore our city now if you take the 200 million we 're not going to waste on the stadium because we 're repairing lancaster park and 100 million from naitahu there 's 300 million and that 's mostly problem solved isn 't it right reinstate developer contributions for inner city projects six years ago maybe the infrastructure was there and they reckoned they were getting done but they 're not charged greenfield developers the cost of providing running water wastewater the council opposed the preston 's development it was at 17 to the city council rates yet right after the syriac was passed bang they get approval and we still get stuck with the cost okay anchor projects dump the dumb ones car parking i made a big point about it so obvious and lastly heritage of course it will cost but why don 't we try something a bit different why don 't we try crowdfunding the revengeable chambers are unique in new zealand and probably the southern hemisphere we would get major support if we went public and said let 's have some aren 't cultural cretins most people don 't pursue the ethnically correct ideas about colonial and post-sky in your cities we would get the money and the second thing is you know the brick council buildings on the worcester street frontage may not measure up with the acres of uk brick heritage buildings but they are our built heritage and our local people want our heritage ask for sponsorship or crowdfunding very good yeah and perfect timing thank you i did i did rehearse it cheers cheers thank you _"

    "text": "Mac to puff good afternoon everyone hi thank you for this opportunity to come and speak to my submission today before coming here today I took some time to review submissions that you 've heard already particularly around New Brighton and there 's been many people representing New Brighton in our community so far I saw Gillian connie and paul Zenon speak eloquently about the strength of the of our community and how the council can help to support and develop the area over the next 10 years like them i believe that any individual project is unlikely to solve the issues faced by new bottom and its community the suburb must be considered holistically in order to develop a strategy that will support and benefit the area in the long term a prosperous prosperous ettore and vibrant seafront suburb will also benefit the wider city both as a recreational destination and a tourism hotspot but what I read in the long-term plan and what I learn from some of the comments and responses from council this week is the council may have other plans for for New Brighton in bleak for roughly golf course and the South Brighton campground funding may even be cut to simple amenities like public toilet blocks and bin maintenance New Brighton has been waiting patiently but with perhaps mounting impatience for earthquake recovery in the area to gather some momentum and rejoin our suburb to the city many of us wonder what has been the delay madam mayor observed earlier this week that 4,000 homes have been red zone since the earthquakes and asked how New Brighton can demonstrate a critical mass of residents I 'd answer that by saying the brighton is and will remain a vibrant and passionate this could be clearly evidenced by the number of submissions received from our area on this long-term plan population of New Brighton is approximately 16 and a half thousand which makes up only about three and a half percent of the city 's population yet forty five percent of all submissions on this plan came from our suburb nearly half from only 3.5 percent of the city 's population so what does the future hold for New Brighton and it 's active and engaged be put to tender and that the council will have intentions in mind for South brighton campground based on considerations of coastal hazards and coastal inundation we 're told work is being done around stage 2 of the natural hazards chapter and there are long-term views of this of parts of that area it seems to me that the council is planning to release its assets in the area and withdraw funding to all but essential needs why could this be brighton is currently a blank canvas awaiting the brush there hasn 't been a better time to invest in the area and see it reach the potential so obvious to its residence you 've already heard plenty of submissions in that direction already and I 'm sure you 'll hear more I believe the answer to that question might be found in Taunton and Taylor 's 2014 report on effects of sea level rise as it is directly relevant to my submission on how the long-term plan will affect New Brighton and it 's 16 and a half thousand residents I 'd like to read you a short extract rise is to avoid development and redevelopment in areas vulnerable to natural hazards the impacts from sea level rise on existing development can be reduced through managed retreat managed retreat is defined as any strategic decision to withdraw relocate or abandon private or public assets that are at risk of being impacted by coastal hazards manage to retreat can occur at a range of spatial scales from individual properties to whole communities and infrastructure links it can also be implemented over a range of temporal scales and should be considered as a staged response where assets are relocated or abandoned when the risks become intolerable the report goes on to describe various protection options and it might be summarized as the report recommends that ccc develop a christchurch city wide sea level rise adaption strategy the strategy should ideally be produced to in close consultation with all stakeholders including the local community and provide specific local plans to increase the community 's resilience to sea level rise my submission to this council is that the council sees the value in New Brighton and rather than commence a long-term strategy of report r14 yeah yeahs Tompion Taylor 's 2014 report effects on sea level rise yep yeah and because I mean it was a report to inform decision-making a natural hazard strategy as is going to be developed and we have an obligation under the law to develop one and we wouldn 't possibly consider doing that without talking to the community so that is something that we will start doing very soon probably probably around sometime after Queen 's birthday weekend so I mean that 's a process that we have to legally go through I don 't think that anyone who lives in an environment that 's exposed to natural hazards would want to not understand what those hazards are and not want to contribute to the plan for how we either a debt how we well enjoy and and and also live with the fact that we are in a coastal environment so strong artery that so strongly agree yeah so that process will happen regardless of the district plan review so that is something that 's that will will come soon I think that possibly some of would like to quickly clarify those the rough ET domain the council yesterday agreed that staff could put it out to tender on the basis that they talk well the HDI wasn 't tender was it that they talked specifically to the refugee Golf Club about taking over the running of it that way that we get a win one and the sense that the golf club remains but there is no cost to the taxpayer were the ratepayers of Christchurch and that is something that the golf club is very happy with and something that I hope produces a good result with the South Brighton one we have agreed to take it out to look to with authorized staff to go out to public tender but we have said talk to the existing owners first take legal advice and if you can come back with a a very specific proposal then that allows us to get around our procurement rules which requires to have a public expression of interest process then come back to us with that and because what the message that we got was that you should I agree with that because if we can do that we should do that now the ones who 've been on a month-by-month basis for the last wee while but we should wait until we 've got the second stage of the natural hazards chapter in the public arena because we couldn 't possibly expect people to make investment decisions as they didn 't know riskware so that 's all that is out there at the moment and there is no mechanism for managed retreat that we have an hour city plan at the moment and if we do have to develop one at some stage in the future then we will do that in conjunction with our communities that is not something that we would impose on any community very happy to hear that thank you very much but thank you for your submission thank you _"

    "text": "and could I now invite a mouse women to come come forward thank you hi I 'm Melendez lemon thanks for the opportunity to speak to us today and for all the great work that you guys are doing and I am an active and I live in Mount Pleasant with my husband and three young children and I just wanted to say and in addition to my submission that I made it and Christchurch has got some really critical challenge ahead not just around funding and affordability but also like the other speakers that I 've heard this morning I 've been saying that also around our carbon and ecological footprint and public health crises and demographic shifts and of course economic challenges so from my professional thinking I think we need new ways to achieve our goals of greater resilience and vibrancy sustainability urban health and of course economic success money is a big deal this time around and money for the wrong things is way too expensive so my category of wrong things includes some substandard development and design costly suburban sprawl which has been corrupting some roading and other counterproductive ideas you will know that Auckland Council are currently challenging the government to pay the true costs of infrastructure associated with some of the proposed special housing areas so just you know reading around young Americans are tuning against car oriented low-rise life now they 're flocking to back to the city centres where they 're renting apartments taking trams walking to work hanging out in coffee shops there 's this kind of change going on and that typical of the young people that we need to attract Christchurch to ensure our growth and reduce our average age going forwards uber was in the priests this morning that 's the car sharing app they come in Christchurch these kinds of things are going to masive Lee change the that we use our vehicles and live in the city thus and other apps a public transport they will reduce of course our subsequent means around rolling in car parking and I know that you 've also heard a lot around those issues and we know that we need to be offering successful communities with livability and quality future citizens to be able to make sure to smarter trips with everything we need closer and of course we want a family friendly city with great public places that people visit more often and stay and longer so to afford this I reckon we need not just to increase density in the city center and also in the hubs identified by the loop but to do this density really well great design walkability lots of amenities housing in population diversity the loop review tells us that the uptake and the Greenfield priority areas has been huge with seventy percent of those potential sections already developed it 's nearly 30,000 new sections on each of Christchurch that 's maybe 50,000 more commuters going to be coming in and their cars and the short to him because at the moment the alternatives aren 't necessarily there yet the loop actions supporting intensification and contrast have been in the words of the loop review difficult to implement and monitor I don 't think this will change it 's not an easy one to change you know but we hear a lot about help in my mind is policies and incentives to restrict the growth around the edges and future and promote smart growth within the current city limits this unhealthy war on the car rhetoric that we get a little bit trapped into sometimes I think it detracts from inspiring developers in citizens about what a true multimodal city would achieve all ways of getting around work better including cars if we go it 's working barking intrinsic um when Brent tottery and was in Christchurch month or two deck i know that quite a lot of you here came to see how much was great he mentioned the greatest urban design decision that vancouver ever made and yoni and ports are you 've heard me say this before but in 97 20 years ago then couvert changed their transportation plan it was game-changing they decided to prioritize the ways to get around instead of balance them so that 's the big difference the act of Health in greenways which is walking biking in transit they were prioritized first then it went on to Goods movements freight for the purposes of business vehicle Brent says that then cova still devotes quite a lot of energy to making driving a greener and healthier proposition you know electric vehicles policies and zoning and incentives that contribute to car sharing that kind of thing but the private vehicle vehicles still 20 years later remains the last priority it 's not NT car doesn 't Bend the car but prioritizing at last has had a dramatic change on that city and they 've had 20 years to prove that it works so this isn 't experimental stuff but it 's still cutting edge thinking so the model understands the law of congestion approves that when you build and multimodal idiots beautiful everyone 's an ex the city work better in every single way it guides thousands of physical decisions including budget allocation which is why I 'm saying it today and I 'll be saying it to the loop review as well and I guess that 's my main point really that rather than trying to balance the needs and promote public transport as the district plan reviewers currently suggesting we need to take a step a transportation decision yes but it 's also an urban design decision a city making decision today it 's a budgeting decision and the speakers that I heard before we 're talking about where 's and walkways em reserves and solar panels and all of that cuts into this kind of slightly shifted way of thinking it 's great q but thank you very much i 'm sorry there 's no time for questions and it 's not an ideal process this but we have hundreds of submissions to cancer no thank you very much as an excellent submission _"

supposed to well Diana and I him back oh really so just checking just checking ok I 'll just give you an extra tema at five minutes I need 40 not tell you what I 've got a slight identity I guess it 's because I 'm representing Travis weapon trust collenberg is our president he 's an open at the moment asked me to revert it he 's also done one with Ken strong man x Canterbury University and I don 't know whether Ken 's doing anything but Colin a cinnamon that and I was was also asked to do my own one so I 'm trying to get four of these into 10 was probably now nine minutes so good of a rush but first of all I 'd like to thank the council very much for that the support that Travis wetlanders head over I think probably the last 17 18 years when the land was secured and a lot of ongoing support and I think sorry whenever I say I I mean Travis wetland trust I think we have a very good relationship and we couldn 't have done what we have done without the council 's support and like when you mark students essays but I 've sort of split the rest of this into two areas one sort of issues and the other recommendations but they do fuse a little bit and one point we have the long-term plan the council will lease discuss with Travis wetland now i 'm not talking about sort of floating subdivisions or motorways flying over the top but we had a biofilter in for example in my railroad which haven 't seen yet and we did send a number of email to the council about could we discuss this and we didn 't get any replies so we 're a bit worried that this is like the thin end of the wedge but apart from that as far as I know there have been no issues with land Travis wetland being chipped away at or anything like that we hope the plan will continue to support us in pest management plant both plants and animals one aspect we have we 've been discussing is educating particularly the people in the area and although and we thought like in nelson lakes lately the locals sort of do a bit of trapping rats and stuff i 'm not sure about trapping local cats which a big problems is going to be a big great successful gareth morgan might feel throw a few Bob our way but we do want to get in dogs and stuff you know they 've taken for wolves and dogs should be on leaves or shouldn 't be there at all a very general one about restoring the water quality of avocado and a powerful rivers that 's a little bit peripheral to Travis wetland and probably the biggest thing obviously is is continuing to support us in restoring and maintaining the biodiversity of Travis web then I think in the 20 years I 've been involved there have been huge changes there by a fairly small number of people but it 's amazing what you can do if you sort of keep keep at it and I should say we do get quite a bit of help from obviously the council already mentioned but free for Canterbury dog or trust and they all chipped in we have open days like tomorrow a big work day forest and bird as well and the last sort of issue which I 'm not very up to speed with its been referred to already today about titled mario 's etc now I don 't know a lot about it but it be some discussion on that because there is a fear that in an ecologically fragile area it may upset things and I 'm sorry I 'm not gonna be able to answer any questions on that I don 't know much about it going on to recommendations I think somebody also alluded to the submission before last the obviously the physical and human landscape over on the east side of the city has changed immeasurably since the earthquakes and there are a lot of initiatives organ organized initiatives sprouting up all over the place images us there 's mango chi exemplar which some of us were on Anzac Day Monday whytekear e eco sanctuary the greening the red zone Colin Berg 's 360-degree trail all sort of interconnect there and I think there 's what so we travel and Trust thinks that there needs to be some dialogue particularly with the council about how all these different bodies are all doing things and colin suggested collenberg suggestion is it may be you know two meetings a year get interested people together at least to see what they all want we don 't quite know how we 're dealing with do we 've had a few the the y2 might a current is what to cure your white tiger ii eco sancta we 've had discussions with them and behind your kind people but we don 't quite know whether how separate or combined we 're all going to be Kenan strongman 's the mission was a little bit about the christchurch creative net late because there are a couple of sort of setups already in frozen in existence and i don 't know a lot about the christchurch creative network and colin also mentioned the christchurch biodiversity partnership which has been going for five years and you know those are two even a goal of organizations that are already set up to sort of start discussing anything so they would be you know maybe an area to start with and the other two other two points really sort of fairly obvious ones that all the people work in these areas have a lot of expertise and experience and I think save a lot of money i think if Colin of free time that he 's given to the city he 'd probably be a millionaire by now but you know using the resources we 've got there 's a lot of human resources out there with people not just with experience and expertise but a lot of enthusiasm and you know we have lots of volunteers my job is mostly sort of sticking plants in the ground I do that all the brainwork Colin and people can sort that out but again it 's free and if you go to the sort of triple bottom line stuff the amount of voluntary work that 's done by these organizations must save the council a fair bit but I know you pour money into it as well and I think making a kind sample has a good example of sort of social and cultural aspects being done i presume it 's night a fee is sort of behind that one economic side of it saves a bit of money i mean the sunday and Zach Dave of Monday eyes today I think 500 trees were planted you know not sure who doc and the ranges about who 's going to maintain it and they weren 't sure about that and I think the environmental and ecological aspects of it particularly I was gobsmacked you just the desolation out there of just no houses what you know in a few years those trees will be up and it may look a lot better and it 's restoring Christchurch to what or bit a bit to what it once was and that 's it thank you very much for listening I don 't think think your endeavor to answer any questions I 'm suppose it 's got a really easy question for you to start with because you know I love Trevor sweet lanes and I 'm a no big c wetlands was where I used to live the way around their area so I used to always go around them now I 'm closer to to Travis and so I go around the end it 's a wonderful environment just you know on some of these gorgeous autumn days that we 've been having it 's just fantastic to go around it of damage so I guess how long do you think it 's going to be before we start to really see the old Travis back the way that it was well it depends how far you mean the way it was so I just interviewed somebody other day who in the forties and fifties and of course it was all a farm no no no I mean the way it was before the earthquakes I mean we 're getting me I really don 't know i mean we chip chip away at it very very slowly landing treason and they take ages to to do anything I just don 't know how long that 's going to take because I think that there would be a lot of interest in and kind of ramping that up because I mean in this huge amount of voluntary if it goes on to the plantings but there is nothing more satisfying than then spending time planting and then going back a couple of years later and knowing that you contributed rare yeah thnkx got what kind of us say we 've got one but part of the walkway is now submerged began to earthquake and you know the cost per meter of a walkway that 's got piles going down into a wetland horrendous and apart from putting a sign up saying bring your gummies with you we don 't really know what to do because we just have not got the money to deal with it and so that kind of thing is going to take some time it 's a very sort there 's a lot of lot of companies making a lot of money out of Christchurch at the moment so maybe we should ever check to honor yeah well the mock me ideas great sorry very quickly I 'm you mentioned the pest free areas I mean is it too early to actually approach someone like Gareth and say would you be interested in being a pilot I only thought about yesterday when I was preparing this know it our next meeting next tuesday i might suggest that you 're trying to get the load I mean the local people do use it there 's a walkway a permit our planting is yeah sorry fell we are you ask a question since I God thank you one of the things you 've really too and it 's come through a number of the submissions around environmental issues is in fact how in fact perhaps two different groups who are doing terrific work in different parts of the city how we might all benefit if they 're joined up bitter and I guess I 've always assumed that he can have charge of these of these water issues in end like is the zone committed these own committees or fit been referred to but I 'm just wondering um would it be helpful if the group 's the Travis with yours your Travis group and the other groups pets were able to meet with you know council advisors and maybe solace from from a city perspective as well as when you hear you the yeah well that 's one of my own suggestions indeed quite fragmented and you know we have been in discussion with right with some of them and we just don 't know quite where to go yeah well thank you we can ask for them I think that they it 's inferior that I think there 's something some overarching sort of body needs to get a grip of it I 'm sorry fabrice wetland trust things yeah I think Eastern vision was you know the attempt to do that so but if it anyway well but and they are having a meeting here next Monday so it might be worthwhile raising with them but low thank you very much honored um thank you for presenting on on our behalf okay thank ya thank you _"

as here in his place Mary 's 19 I was looking at you and I thought gosh Mary 's lost a lot of weight and lost a lot of weight yeah but is he well I see if I 'm sure he 'll he 's seriously oh we are to hit that so could you give her my regards Rudy please do yeah yep my name is Gareth Keenan on secretary of the Christ Church History Association we were formed at the body in the nineteen seventy incorporated in 2001 to their object really since then have been to act on behalf of the members as a guardian and advocate for the aben haircut history we promote protection and enhancement of their Street and our landscapes and streams and channels that brain into it so that people are natural bike that can enjoy its full benefits and perpetuity and thirdly to monitor environment and seek to eliminate or minimize any adverse impact with regard to the submission that was drawn up actually by Sandra and confrontation with the members think it basically says what we need to say but really I came to answer any questions or yep so you 'd like to go straight to questions yeah okay I just want I was going to ask the difference between the Christchurch History Association and the avin heathcott estuary a hoot I trust so with who we heard from just before I mean that a number of the issues that you 've raised are you know pretty much on a par so I just wondered why the two organizations or fight engagement back to when Roger lusby to suicide from the Cross Church History Association informed the Friends of the s3 as a more or less as an educational tool or an educational department and from that the quiet I trust virtually developed out of the Friends of the history Esther Association stayed there if you like as a protection society or protection body looking at any anybody that wanted to set estuary or people that sort is we could put a slipway here we could put a jetty sticking out there we wanted to keep the s3 is substantially the same as it is and always has been and that 's one of the real reasons why we really want to see a hard edge if you like put around certainly bright and reserves and understood then of erosion that 's taking place in there it was quite phenomenal quite substantial and all that soap and starts its washing away from the edges just filling filling the Asturian if I may say here I mean David 's on deck trust i 'm on the other trust and i think there 's just a difference in approach i think the previous one peps looks a soft edge approaching you look at us up you know how to each approach just the difference of the street in was just asking the difference between the two is free trusts David so you might be able to alright so I 'm but but so I mean I 'm there 's a lot of obviously a next stage of the natural hazards chapter which will be looking at coastal erosion and coastal inundation and that impacts on that area quite significantly we 've had representations around the reinstatement of the sea walls but after exploring the issue with people the idea of something that 's further inland abundant to protect the houses as and the streets is seen as a more sustainable measure in that regard rather than the reinstatement of a seawall what what we 're really looking at Annette was one of the other parchment and putting a pathway from ferry meet around he was a Swedish Chef wind chef area past the draining Ford 's on a wastewater treatment plant and linking back over chef Brighton bridge to a pathway that runs from virtually from the bear or further north from Travis really right through to history but what we want to see is that past kept on the edge so that people can see the water and can walk along the edge of the water if you like not walking 30 40 50 meters and then I think one of the news been regarding flooding through South bright and reserves and through the campground and unreality if you don 't protect that that flooding is going to accentuate and spread further even than a campground it will be out in Westerly Rhode and gentlemen on the south shore will be through onto a rocking horse road yeah i mean the these are challenging issues you know and we 're talking 50 years you know in terms of look weary life rome wasn 't built in a day no no it 's Charlie natural financial constraints of paramount yeah yes we have to look I mean we 're looking at a ten-year plan yep and surely we can envision seeing incremental ages yeah I think that I mean you know you 've commented about the installation of a title barrier to and waiting with interest to see if the results of the pre feasibility report considered the increased flooding risk out outweigh the environmental impacts not to mention the financial costs and actually that 's exactly the argument the debate that we 'll be having about all of the other issues it 's increased flood risk the environmental impacts and the financial costs and they all have to be weighed up so I mean I think you put that perfectly really I don 't think you could put it better and it is the challenge that we face and all of these decisions well as the Association has been near since a flood barrier was lucid at the time of the woolston catch I know been around since we 've been around long enough to know and to know the impact of the Wolfson cat when it was left open and a surge that dug deep holes either end of it and had to be filled in with truckload after truckload of alders my mac and the gates shut so that the esket reverted back to its course and a cat sony open and emergency now too you know for short short term not left open like it was when it was first developed yeah yep so David did you have a holla gods I just wanted to add to the mix of environmental effects leisure and Recreation and I what really want that area for adequate flood protection which is I think something that 's been scale at the moment so I certainly want to see that L elevated yeah and at the point that I was making was that it may not be that the request for the seawall the hard end on the ester II a bond further and abundant agree that 's a distinct opportunity to perhaps provide voting protection for that area and perhaps also accommodate a natural edge to the history well I think you can get like or the South Shores but but I think in the South Brighton domain area there are there 's a conflict of interest there in terms of providing adequate protection for sport and recreation users without risking the silting up of the history in that area where you know which will prevent yachting particularly having a long-term future and I mean there are so many issues in that regard I mean and the one that sort of probably hasn 't been mentioned here but North mentioned i think the other day where somebody asked the question as to why the the salt water and under underneath so you know that they can 't say i mean that tells you the environment that has been created there since the earthquakes what are going to remember ilysm point yacht club for some 65 years and we wish situated near we noticed a distinct erosion in two weeks from one Sunday sailing to Salem fortnight later and that there 's a seat seat sitting there we 've had about that much land in front of it porn or later and had that much land in front of it yeah yeah we 've got very good measures of my damage that 's been done now another

    "text": "submission is the Kashmere high school students sustainability council dr. Lee cougar and I believe some students know just the students oh it 's good I didn 't mean just the students I mean great yeah the students I 'm sure you 'll be photographing by Bucky back and you 'll be on Facebook anytime soon isn 't that will take the photo anyway save it for later good morning we 're here today from the iphone Kashmere high school sustainability council I 'm Beth this is andy and Nola I 'm firstly we 'd like to thank you for the opportunity to speak with you in person today our submission is that the council includes energy saving programs for city council buildings in the long-term plan firstly we 'll talk about war energy saving programs we 've had at Kashmir and then talk about how similar actions could be taken within the council to make our city a more sustainable place few years ago we installed an energy monitoring system at kashmir high school so that we could track electricity usage across individual classroom blocks within a school this also displayed on LCD screens around the school as friendly reminder to switch off lights and heat pumps when they were not actually needed we also launched a fun switched off publicity campaign to reinforce the message in a positive way in terms of the savings this is created in the first year we reduced our energy consumption by ten percent and this is with very little capital expenditure by encouraging people to switch off we 're not using this is backed up by research which shows that ten percent savings can we be generated simply by encouraging behavioural change around electricity in the second year we saved an additional twenty five percent by replacing our old fluorescent lights around the school with energy-efficient LED lights and so over these two years we saved sixty thousand dollars and mrs. bearing in mind which the four years prior to our campaign our electricity bill had doubled and recently our energy saving efforts at kashmir high school received global recognition at desired future energy prize awards in Abu Dhabi we 're one of them three finalists out of 1100 entries and a sustainability week in Abu Dhabi and here we realized quite how seriously countries like the UAE are taking sustainability and energy saving if we want new zealand to keep our clean green and one hundred percent pure image we really need to start doing even more for the environment and we believe christchurch is the perfect place to start we think that some of the energy saving ideas we 've implemented at cash from high school could also be used in city council buildings and our submission to this council was that they 'd be considered for the long-term plan firstly we recommend the council runs a similar switch it off campaigning council buildings this would have minimal cost and research suggests it could save up to ten percent of the council would sell electricity bills indeed we encourage the council to be bold and set an actual target of ten percent electricity reduction in over the next two years the key to success we found is keeping the campaign positive installing smart meters so that day-to-day savings can be attracting each building and making this data publicly available online Council of this and sustainable energy over the next ten years this is certainly economically viable for new council buildings and rebuilds but also existing buildings replacing existing lighting or heating solutions with LED lights or solar would require some capital investment but these alternative solutions have a payback time of around five years so over so it would often meet long-term savings over the ten-year long-term plan we 'd also like to submit that the sustainable energy strategy for Christ 's Church which expires in 2018 is reviewed revitalized and cemented in the 2025 long-term plan christchurch has changed dramatically post-earthquake creating lots of new challenges but also opportunities we have the chance to include sustainable design and buildings in sustainable practice beyond 2018 for the next 10 years as the youth of christchurch we are passionate about building the sustainable legacy porosity following the earthquakes and we want to enhance our image as the clean green garden city thank you very much for your time today and we rehabbed it on to any questions you have regarding our submission or our energy saving programs at Kashmir I just some discussion around to store energy schemes because no you want to start with something else all right but I 'd like you to mention it yeah actually I thank you for coming along great to see you and but what I wanted to ask is if you were going to go beyond this what else would you want to do well at a school would like to go further into solar energy in May haskell more self-sufficient so that 's more of our long-term plan at our school and we think that and yet like the new rebuilds four counts of buildings could have had like solar panels in alternate and energy like ways of producing energy rather than just using like- pal so I just wanted like we the mere referred to a district energy scheme and that 's basically we 've got heat exchange with balls that go down to the aquifer and there 's a 25-percent saving for opportunity for council and other large very large buildings in the city look the question Ospital are also very linked lee so here 's the question really i of sustainable system for your school and especially because there is a lot a large wrist home complex nearby your schools as you thought about their there any one of them from the spot it is that something that we 're doing and pressure you 'd be very welcome to to you know have some general information about various scheme that 's all we hadn 't thought about it before but now that you say always open to more ideas on how we can save energy and also produce energy in a renewable way in esco a mantra what we think is the best way of making it accessible to people with the way we 've found monitoring it and so having LCD screens around our school makes everyone the students teachers can see day-to-day how things are changing hourly in different parts of the school so you can see where it 's coming from it that 's a big part of your submission and that 's what i talked out of it was that by being you know sort of proactive and positive but also feeding back the savings you get them and you can tell us how much money you 've saved now that must be pretty exciting and I presume how do you reinvest that money you know the savings because I presume that the school is benefit from that do you get to reinvest that and another projects lighting here currently the savings we made is going towards the lonely head for the LED lighting right and it 's free yeah we had an interest rate free loan for that and then in the future we 're hoping to reinvest that in like alternate energies like production like solar panels or we could look into like alternate options right okay Glen and then yani thank you for this pretty good like to ask you the same question I asked the person who offered to put solar on all our council housing units have you looked at some models to make the kind of buy back of that energy in the future more economically viable because at the moment it 's a hard model to crack so people can put power grid but actually getting it back some models these not currently really at the moment as part of the zeod future energy prize we 're looking at getting funding from that as part of the prize to install the solar panels in our school and so that way we wouldn 't have to pay in you that off as that 's all I 'm prize money from that and so we 've been talking with our electricity provider ending I think we 're in discussions about how we 're going to how it 's working that the money we save what 's it really going to like yeah on anything to it howa savings can come back to their energy production instead of just going into I know something else right brain so she could come up with some models here yonni yeah that would be what we are hoping based here in Christchurch where 's the LED light we 've got the logo this not takes five years to pay off you buy it back at ten percent less than the retail cost yani yep um I just think you for coming on it that you may be aware some commentators have said this is one of the most unsustainable recoveries from a natural disaster and I just wondered you 've talked a lot about sharing information it 's being the way in which you can help people with anyone seconds Yanni I just know that you thought would be good about the idea of having some sort of sustainability clock or screen in the central city that when people come in they can actually see the collective impact of all the different sustainable initiatives happening in the city recover that would be like that optimum things it 's all about really awareness of what 's happening around because students around us killed before our campaign then you nothing really and I just keep the lights on and turn off computers and stuff and so most of the change we make us through telling people about it encouraging people their behavior change rather than physical excellent that 's a really good powerful note to end on so thank you very much for your time and energy and thank you very much for making the the submission _"

    "text": "could we now have that a man here Curt history a hoot I trust and neither of you look like Bill Sampson one of you looks like Manhattan we did let you know that that that though that bill was unable to be here today sorry do we make it to my this Shh soon I know matin yes so we are weak we 're representing the a man Keith of SJ hoots I trust my Lamaze and I 'm a marine biologist at the University of Canterbury and some people know Martin let him introduce himself I 'm noir retired gentleman of ever-decreasing means trustee of the trust for about 10 years and immediate past year of the trust well some background first of all the Estrella trust is a charitable society set up in 2003 to promote healthy ecosystems associated with the SGA and its catchment our vision is that we are working together to promote clean water open space and healthy ecosystems after we have a key partners including the Christchurch City Council and work together on a number of key issues in the healthy and one the trust has a memorandum of understanding with the City Council which was set up in 2004 but expired in june 2014 so one of our first priorities is to hope we 're requesting negotiations to sign up a new memorandum understand standing throughout this town we 've appreciated the input of christchurch city council staff and councillors and we have also been grateful for the funding which we have used to implement our management plan we would therefore request that the council can sitters providing us with a grant of twenty thousand dollars annually for the next three years Christchurch is an exciting place from the point of view of the s3 the ocean outfall has has markedly improved water quality and now there is a way forward for increasing the natural values of the estuary and the rivers so we hope that we can put in place various measures to restore the damage wetlands may be applied to Ramsey status for protection and importantly improve my hangar KY so in relation to specific issues as part of the plan were you noting on page 57 and 8 managing we know that the whole of the catchment and effect of the end the estuary receipts contaminants and sediments trace metals microbial contaminants such as bird droppings etc from the surrounding area so we would like the council to put greater efforts into preventing entry of some of the sediments into the river there are options of pre treating stormwater we would like toxic spills to be fact prior to their disposal into the river we also have an interest in silt in the waterways and hopefully removing the salt replacing or retaining gravel to promote spawning areas for fish finally we what we would like to see the rivers and the s3 ecology improved so there is maje acai so in the solution to this we 're hoping is more investment in storm water quality repair the stormwater network and as well as sort of RIT repairing the infrastructure but also consider other methods of waste storage such as using swales and wet we have been involved in this issue for a long time and we also think that if we can be involved with the christchurch and west issues we particularly interested in the continued funding of the healthy estuaries and rivers monitoring program this is really essential it tells us whether there are any problems it shows us how the conditions and yesterday in the river and improving and it 's really important for future management we would ask that in the 2015 2025 time period we include the funding to cover the three-year cultural assessments the state of attack you are and which provides an important Maori aspects of the cultural values of the s3 and scalar both the scientific and social values can then be considered in the management the final aspect that we wanted to talk about is on page 63 which is managing the increased flooding after the earthquakes we 've been thinking about this a lot and agree with the proposal in some places to relocate stock bed stock banks in the red zone and the in this way you provide natural flood claims finally I think in our submission given the good relationships that we 've had with the City Council and our memorandum understanding we 're disappointed that the trust soon as this was on the table the just is opposed to artificial intrusions into the estuary and it 's well known worldwide that if any construction which is based in ER in an s3 will affect both the hydrology and the ecology of the estuary so given the current financial constraints on the council we 're not really in favour of supporting or spending any money on pre feasibility studies we go the tidal barrier and we 're urging the council to consider alternative methods to address the increased risk of flooding due to the earthquakes and also future sea-level rise which is a bigger much bigger problem for the future thank you I 've diskin I 'd start by saying that the counselors were equally surprised by the undertaking of the pre-feasibility study so and the reason we included in the consultation document was to lift it out of the morass of the activity management plan so that people could see that that was actually been considered as part of their overall infrastructure strategy over the next 30 years and and your comments have been echoed by everyone of the ecology of our city so I don 't think that it will be going much further so but I wanted to ask a question because this was the first time when i read the submission that i realized that we had an expired mou and normally speaking when the council has entered into emo use they don 't have in dates so i wanted to understand from your white head and in date and what we can do to put it back on the table i think it was just when the original management plan was and the trust was established it was established for ten years and that was the reason there was no you know there wasn 't a reason why it shouldn 't have been forever and I 'm sure the trust would welcome an MoU which was did go on into the future to assist planning for the future wonderful thank you sorry who had their hand up over here Phil and just on the pre-feasibility study years staff advised us to though that a lot of people had asked for the title barrier affecting that it would be it would be ruled out in terms of the science so we get to get that report and I just want to ask you about that you you your request really about having a link with the west melton zone committee because and then this is Pauline Syria particularly but um like you 'll be aware that 's there ek and committees but I 'm a bit surprised that you haven 't got a link and look at how we could support user develop one would you like well we have had a Lincoln and one of our trustees is actually a member of the zoning committee and I was appointed some years ago its inception but for personal reasons had to pull out but we have had several meetings with them blasts i suppose what we 're looking at is at a more formal relationship protective around the issues around the rivers and that feed into the history yeah thanks and my other question or e2 is if you had a view around it like you 've referred to the sea level chat aspects like the lot of local walls have been pushed over since the earthquake and they 've been some requests around restoration of those i just wondered if you have a view of you out there it was a different geographical changes not sea level two well it 's a these are changes as a result of the earthquake level differences in yesterday and in some places the levels of riot risen and in others they 've fallen in some ways it looks like there has been unusual and used your changes and we 're yet to understand what has happened so we really do need to make to understand better the effects in the short term we understand that the protection needs to be for the houses and so that the the protective devices that have put in place a meant to be temporary and we would be looking at at what a more ongoing means of maintaining those areas would be so does that answer your question it does really because we as a council we 're having two workshops soon on that very issue around the boat all those agree we 'll discuss it offline excellent thank you very much _"

    "text": "bakshi ronix bike Robert Henderson hi good morning I if my colleague even Jackson here today who was part of the crowdfunding campaign for crisis bloodshed mid l0 and counselors thank you for your time this morning we 're presenting today regarding public bike-share but more broadly public transport provisions in the long-term plan and the scope for new public transport initiatives just talking about like sheer globally bikes your systems have become an integral part of public transport networks allowing for multimodal trips and the completion of the last kilometer of public transport trips successful systems have been implemented in cities of all sizes however central to their success is the integration with public transport networks through both funding and physical integration public bike she requires a civil similar level of funding support to other public transport modes the fare box recovery and sponsorship can be combined to complete the funding mix after talking about this idea for the last 23 years we decided to get something on the ground so late last year a crowdfunding was run which successfully made its target with 450 individuals and Christchurch businesses employers the press is alive systems support from the art center and also countrywide property who have sponsored a first station of victoria street this funding is being combined with a branding partnership with spark who are covering the operating costs so in July we 're installing five stations on private land as part of a two-year pilot the first 30 minutes of every ride will be free with an hour free for crowdfunding supporters you can make multiple trips per day and it 's all about getting people exploring that Anna City and trying the idea out the focus of this pilot is to generate data and opinions on bike share as a future public transport option for the city but it 's very important and I need to stress that this is not a scalable model we cannot simply increase to a citywide system from this without local government in public transport funding local government support and public transport funding in the next two years we hope to see the city have further discussion about this idea as people try it out first and if there is no trim then it makes these discussions they 're much more difficult we know that public by car does feature in the cyber ways activity management plan however we we would suggest that there should actually be in the public transport activity management plan as it requires infrastructure investment and ongoing costs in the same way the provision of bus services do although a submission is not primarily about funding I 'm just going to put some indicative figures out there so we know what we 're talking about so Christchurch scheme with 300 to 350 bikes within the four heirs would involve around two million dollars of initial infrastructure investment and face operating cost of around 500,000 per annum but as mentioned the council may only be part of this funding mix that 's not it 's more of a partnership with with NZTA you can and a branding partner so just to finish we knew this idea had public in business support and the crowdfunding campaign has demonstrated this in meant that we can get this pilot up and running but in all my discussions it 's become very Christchurch it 's going to take strong political support from within this room to advance it further so thank you for your time and welcome any questions about that Pauline that 's Rob I 'm sorry I 'm please tell you what the capital cost was a gimmick figured past me yes it 's around two million dollars and it was for a 300 to 350 bike system that 's excluding any sort of public street works that would be required that 's just for the stations and the bikes but they are and solar-powered they can be placed pretty lightly in various places so Glenn yeah thank you for this I was quite taken with this submission in a rest overseas trip along with a lot of our colleagues have seen before we saw a lot of these bike to your schemes some of the bigger cities next to public you know Trent with hubs such as subways a secret so here 's do you envisage you could say in the public sphere locate something next to the new bus terminal is a pilot just to see what the in the next year the way we 've way we 've looked at that in terms of timing with the with the new transport interchange so we 've got five sites at the moment one of those is not the transport interchange but we can quite easily move within the next two years and we will have to do for some of the sites as construction heavens so we 'd like to has just been a little illness or a 2-yard basket at the moment but soon lee within next two years would like to look at that because it is the fact that we 're looking at long-term Paul thanks Rob great presentation look cam there are some bike share schemes throughout the world that actually have fully self funded and self sustainable have you looked at other models through it around the world did it you 're the only the only model I 'm actually aware of this well this city that 's fully privately funded as New York and that 's because and I may be wrong there because of there 's hundreds of thousands of them that is worth quite a lot to them to obviously have your branding all over Manhattan and in actual fact that 's gone into a little bit of financial difficulty within the last couple of years so we can 't see a model working in New Zealand where there is no public transport or local government support it certainly hasn 't there looking in the Auckland context they haven 't been out to find a way to make that work so yeah I don 't quite see working in New Zealand necessarily as a hundred percent private point and and cities where you have to pay you know from the first minute and it 's quite costly users drops right off that 's really about integrating it as part of your public transit more trips you could hop off the bus user metro card to use the bike for the last part of your journey and it 's all one journey so yeah there there are different models but this is how we sit there isn 't one I 've seen that does I should see you in the left-field ask a question then i 'll go to fill and just in relation to cycle helmets given the 30k within the central city do you think that we could work a central city component that that didn 't require helmets to be used there or in the Hagley Park sure yeah so we 're you know Sims of the bike share system we 're using the only system in the world that 's successfully included helmets so will our bikes come with helmet and for the most part that works really well on a personal level I 'd like to see the that would be really great we 've had some discussions around that recently and said that even if there was helmet-free we probably still would provide helmets from liability point of view but yeah my personal beyond that is they 're really great and yes certainly with the slow speeds and that sort of thing in the core I think they 'll be really good for ya yeah feedback from the community would also be that that would be something that would be reiterated for users as well choice yeah great Phil and then yani thanks Rob I 've got a couple of questions one is I just want to know if you 've got any connections with the recycle group in the inner city is a way of making it sustainable it 's the first one you know and the other one you the other one a question I 've got really is like you said look can you get some political support and clearly there 's a lot of support say at this table in other tables like when you present a deacon and it 's at ritz really how how can you progress your your your project really by having further conversations rather than you know only it 's kind of like yeah um serve over the last couple of years there 's been a lot of discussions I 've had discussions with people and from all organizations are all around the city I think it really it sort of comes down to having people are in a position to say let 's let 's explore two wee bit further and I haven 't sort I think that 's just the public transport you know set up in Christchurch at the moment there 's just so many organizations and people involved and it 's just difficult to navigate in terms of the involving the the recycling group so Nick 's bike in Glasgow has done is look at something like that where they 've involved a community group who do the maintenance of the bikes that sort of overhauling certainly looking at that as an option for the pilot as well and log assume there would be really good fit here I 'm in terms of personal context you yet yani thank you thank you for what you 're doing I 'm just um wondered if you 'd talk to Sarah and you kind of another was a Christopher and the bus interchange but given that all these anchor projects are generally under their control have you talked to them about making provision so a justice and emergency which has no parking for visitors which would seem kind of a logical phone and also about that they 're cycleway access into the central city I if I was something past the bus interchange with the faulty software system i 'd be really concerned not to have a lil and you know the number of us is going to us so yeah there 's only been discussions with Sarah and different people in different roles there was discussions around the AVA river precinct and making space available but we 're all the Scott do is having something on the ground that people can try firsthand and see this was kind of the next step to kind of just making that case that much more compelling and giving people trying it out so yeah there hasn 't been discussions of us hasn 't been discussions in the last few months but I 've certainly had some previously around that you and I think well there 's 35 seconds say quick first well thank you very much for your honesty about the cost and the reality of it for the future I 've been a great support for a while but to see it in action in New York I 'm absolutely convinced there has to be a run over almost three times by bikes in New you open so I think it 's only on encourage them everyone later in the year when it 's on the streets to try it out I 've seen your instructions on how that works and give it a go but yet i just wanted to stress the point that it 's a two-year project and going forward we need to have further discussions around that far how 's that for perfect well done thank you very much it 's good to see you _"

    "text": "this seems seriously weird with you sitting at the end of the table you should have been here I don 't need you if they do quake it happen five weeks later Jim yeah my wife is very pleased I 'm not to please Madame mayor and councillors I 've provided a background paper which i 'm not going to address the issues in that i 'm speaking to it but i 'm happy to answer questions but i 'd like to take my ten minutes and in the answer those if there 's not time by email or phone it would be disingenuous to suggest that i can do justice and ten minutes to the financial issues facing the city council in particular the sale of partial or partial sale of assets in order to close the gap between available council funding and its projected financial commitments I 'm there for requesting that at the time not of hours i said i 'll receive an answer questions by phone or email and my contact numbers have been given i must say I 've always thought that if selling assets I watched two successive governments cell 19 billion dollars of these little assets and end up with more debt than I started with if people who believe in selling assets to reduce their debt of mortgage had the courage of the convictions they would sell the most valuable asset they have their house and rent one instead Don Brash actually did that before he took up governorship there was a bank when he went to Wellington because he thought mortgages were too high and interesting after a couple of years he changed his mind and said he 'd made a mistake because of high rental costs but she didn 't need a PhD in economics to figure that out most of us have to figure that out without a PhD in economics grant Cameron former Treasury official now one of councils consultant advisors on these matters advised New Zealand Post and the government against establishing the Kiwi bank and saying is a bad idea with these words quote we believe that there are major uncertainties relating to the bank 's ability to secure the size and quality of customer base as fees interest rates and service combination plan to be offered to the customers we simply do not regard the value proposition as sufficiently compelling to produce the projective customer results all of which of course was complete rubbish history will search show that in return for the initial capital contribution of 80 million dollars from the government which actually was paid out in his own posts own dividends the publicly owned Kiwibank is now buried up between 1.3 and 1.5 billion dollars and this year made a profit of 100 million compared to 7 million for New Zealand Post an average increase in asset value of 108 million dollars per year since the bank opened in 13 years ago shouldn 't we be asking some serious questions about the advice counselors as receiving on its assets sales proposals today from such sources the council faces large social infrastructure and financial challenges no one could deny that but it must take a long and not a short-term view for the future of the city Christchurch has taken over one hundred and sixty to seventy years to build large sections of disaster and his Elms history we should not believe that everything that needs to be done can be done as fast as we all might like the cities of Europe took time patience and vision and money to rebuild after the first and second world wars but rebuilt they were most magnificently so but they took time once assets a soul they are hard if not impossible to get back the dividends they return are not lost for five or ten years but in most cases forever for example Orion has returned 1.1 billion dollars of dividends and capital returns to this council and at another council owner since 1999 an average of sixty five point five million dollars per year not to mention the increased capital value of the strategic asset I haven 't found any analysis in the long-term plan on this effect of the council and end in any of the council documents the liability one of the important matters it does not appear in any of the documents I 've seen is the liability that these partly privatized council assets will have to the minority shells interest during emergencies such as the earthquake private minority shareholders do not have to take account of social need or over financial return and this can restrict the ability of councils to require the enterprise 's they own to help meet social needs in a time of crisis such as a natural disaster okay the government found this out with in New Zealand actually in this regard it is instructive to read the recommendations on page 12 of the camera record to the council if it doesn 't send that she 'll up councillors bonus should our quote our recommended organizational architectures don 't they have lovely words of the stuff has the following advantages there the description one separation between political and commercial decision-making that sounds fine go and talk the orkin city council 's about what happens to the port of Auckland and the harbour developments that they weren 't even told about two flexibilities to invest in partner unencumbered by public sector constraints unencumbered by public sector constraints that is no powerful elected representative to intervene haven 't we lost enough of our democratic framework and Canterbury and dead in path sure shortening the time frame for the works program will put too much stress on this generation of ratepayers not people like you and me but those with low wages particularly with young families beneficiaries and the elderly those on fixed low incomes Christchurch is a low-income City look at the demographics and the details and you 're set and it is neither reasonable or nor even necessary to move in this direction urgent work specific flood protection rolling through systems and other essential infrastructure should be rigorously prioritized and what can be done within the council 's means should be done but other good to have projects should be put on slower backburner for example a new stadium and the convention center and and government requested and according the negotiations to work this through people understand the need to be prudent and sensible as long as they are told the truth this is a multi-generational cost issue not just for the current generation to beer it 's an impossible burden to fix everything in a short space of time and the cost being carried by political parties about the challenges facing crisis because are real enough I accept that and re-used and a revised financial plan over a longer time frame considered including lower no-interest loans under written by the government to avoid current local government constraints this is not a business as usual situation we face in Christchurch dedicated bonds which was the way in which most New Zealand 's infrastructure was funded in the first place should be considered central local governments are amongst the few institutions in New Zealand which can and should take the long view in conclusion mad amir selling the assets of christchurch reduces the ability of the city to make future decisions about what sort of city just wants to be it reduces the long-term economic capability of the city and it transfers wealth from the people of Christchurch generally who already have lost enough to the buyers of assets ask the proposals to buy us is to buy the parks and reserves and make them free available to the citizens ask them to buy the art galleries in the libraries and open them up free and pay only get people buying the assets that they want to buy because they 're profitable and if they think they 're profitable why shouldn 't they be profitable for you too instead of selling assets the city can delay certain activities and fund them through dead it 's not an ideal situation but its pragmatic and and it 's the most sensible in my view and the dedicated bonds I 've mentioned which is the way most of our infrastructure is built in the first place we thank you for your time Thank You Jamie no we tightened time soldiers came to one question i had a couple there thank you Jim nice to see you and thinking for the for the deputation and submission given that we do have a short-term cash flow problem what would your view be then on save an operating lease of a company so you like the highly regulated ones like an orion or report we wouldn 't to see really lose ownership but well you don 't lose ownership but you lose a certain amount of control it 's it would be just owning 40 plus of other businesses and not ever say plus is a and that 's a might not always agree with you or your owners now you can replace the board but you 've got this reliability to those minority shareholders and you can 't just do whatever you want which you can do if you own basically they are separated from counseling operational terms I understand that but the council appoints the board and they can act generally speaking in line with the owners wishes once you get a minority Cheryl and the larger it is the worse it gets you lose them so and the second thing is the people who buy it then share the capital increase in value of the of you look at the capital increase in value of Orion and or estimate if you had a private shareholder they would be getting half of their increase why should we hand it over to private owners who want to buy it for that purpose that 's what they wanted for they don 't want to buy because it 's that they 're all you of christchurch thank you very much I do apologize that it 's only 10 minutes but if it 's any comfort to you when I tuned up to submit on the annual plane I was told that I had five minutes because I was just an individual so at least things have been remarried or be treated as equals thanks a thank you very much _"

    "text": "good morning we 're not Darren cherish I 'm Tracy beckenham and this is a union so from the Kendra cycling Development Trust and we 're a group dedicated to the development of also in cycling and Christchurch with a focus on youth and industries about a background we 're a group that came together for the bird for the centre of excellence and that was subsequently awarded to Waikato so and our long-term goal longer than the royal tomb clean probably is to hear the velodrome eventually built in Christ 's teaching you know we hope that we could do that and conjunction with counsel with possibly engaging a corporate sponsor was that the qe2 proposal putter was it yeah yeah I know I know that very well yeah so we we want to also say that we totally support and reiterate everything that and spikes have said so we 'll try not to repeat too much noise lies but we totally support everything that they had CDs dean for right thanks Tracy yeah it 's very much about supporting the philosophy of a you know city of cycles don 't you be the city 's tasks that it has the main push for us obviously we are very supportive of cycle safety cycle lanes the design of those is critical some areas they 're actually more dangerous for someone up against car doors or they end in the middle of nowhere and people are more exposed the design so certainly very supportive of a good thought and consultation around that so the main drive really for us around the cycle networks inaccessible city is the connectivity to make sure that the things work particularly to we have the great assets in the city bottle lake Maclean 's island and the adventure park we need to ensure that these excess ways actually go to those places kids can 't actually get some acclaims island or bottle laker they 're all on the fringe of the city is very hard to get to you have to have a parent you have to have a vehicle to actually take our kids here so we think there are some opportunities perhaps of the Rings own to with the cycle ways to connect assets hagley park so great asset we live just up and said albans and my wife 's too scared to let our kids ride to Hackney Park which which isn 't great you 've got to go you know pepin or OB Liev so there 's some major hurdles here most of the roundabouts we 're talking before the roundabout by the airport you know you take your life in your own hands Tracy close their eyes and go through hard and hope she gets through you know these things are actually quite scary and often they 're a barrier to get to the place you want to go to so it 's a really the will just focus on a couple of points in our submission that 's really is around the adventure park we 're very supportive of that because it helps with sport right from introducing people to safe cycling in a safe area and obviously there 's some hopefully since spin-offs around economic benefit for that city as well so we certainly encourage and I think in the existing plan the cycleways network and the public those assets so it 's certainly like that to be looked at the Denton park the end of the sale TP Denton park will be 50 years plus and it has been mentioned before that it would be considered a replacement wiki would be considered in the LTP I think of this stage is really just around a bit of a patch up and repair so we would certainly like to see that perhaps revisited we think probably with some smart and innovative approaches to construction or looking at some of the assets the metro now pune why there 's lots of money and resource going into those we 're not talking necessarily him to add more money to build something extra smarter ways to construct and look what we 're doing that may make some savings most people look at a velodrome they think it 's 30 million well we 're not asking for a international class we 're asking for a regional level facility the other thing that the velodrome is much like Invercargill in the middle you got four courts that 's for basketball courts if you say that 's ten million dollars to build the velodrome by itself is probably you could do it for 12 to 15 so you 've got four courts in the middle all of a sudden the opportunity costs to get a velodrome not only be five million dollars maybe ten and that could be saved on some other projects quite easy and we 're actually not just part of the sport assets in the city a lot of it 's about rebuilding what we lost we 're actually trying to say what over the next 50 years what would we want what are we doing that 's different what are we going to do that going to transform our city for sport and recreation not just replace what we lost when there are avenged apart coming at you and different Washington fantastic washington park for the kids that 's brilliant council cannot great job there some of that could be we cover over that and it 's usable when it 's wet not just it 's not just drive facility so we think a wee bit of innovation we can you try and help not just ask for money we have access to some corporates that love love cycling that we may we would like to work and partner and see if we can help get some of these projects across the line which is effectively how we were set up initially to try and get the velodrome built and if we can help and use our networks and try and get some mentum behind these things we 'd love to do that well i 'm going to ask my other queen i 'm going to ask this question of all the cycling ones what do you think about the suggestion that we not reopen the section of the summit road currently closed to car traffic Tracy point of view mom I think it 's great the cyclist love it we don 't want to piss off the road users either excuse my French oh yes ma 'am but they will be the ideal would be that it 's opened just without without cars yeah I 'm not sure might be that cars have one lane go one way and just love the idea so I 1 i 'm trying to you know so do it out of one submission I 'm trying to conjure a lot of support anyway tell me and glean more just like he 's starting the grassroots and kids learning to bike I know you were here about the velodrome but it often Memorial if we have that park which is a like a eroding network you know as a week bridge and as a rear and about and things like there and everything and we know I used to take my kids see to teach them but there 's a I always kind of thought well we 've only got one and you were such a cycling silly we 've had the Nationals here views what do I mean would you support another one somewhere else in the city because it 's technically like McLain 's island i 'm at my kids to MacLaren 's island but when there are really small i took them there and we had a couple more around the city and raising that love for sighting at an early I just be interested in your thoughts yeah well the little pump tracks and things are fantastic and I was just having a couple of weeks ago and there was a weak pump track there at the bottom of the mountain by trial so for the young kids a lot of fun and they 're a very low cost and we 've got plenty of vacant land in the city and even some temporary stuff you know a working be can almost set one up in a weekend it 's a sort of thing doesn 't necessarily have to cost a lot of money it 's getting someone and that 's I think where we try and leverage can we borrow someones you know digger for a day and come here this block alone and we 'll just try and make something and you know little things like that and I don 't have to be these things don 't have to be high cost you know we seem to be focused on high-cost assets when we can do things and they 're done around the world you know relatively more things for the community to do a sport users don 't always want flesh they just sometimes I just want to be covered out of the wind and out of the wet yeah things like the Edgar Center and Dunedin great assets you know it 's a wall store all those sports indoors low-cost they 're not moaning because it 's not hasn 't got a marble you know front entranceway or it 's not heated they 're playing this sport sheltered and you know I think councils can look at low-cost solutions we don 't have to look at you know you know steel and bronze saw icons for everything thank you clean that you 're like to trade my question for Vicky 's and I can pay it forward later cuz she 's bitching to ask one okay know if you have a site in mind for this for the velodrome or me is obviously an option but we 're about certainly at the current one well you could do it at the current one I 'm not sure I could could integrate with nap una y it depends where you want your end or core facility as well I guess yeah we don 't have a firm view on it mean you 've got time quick okay on the other side Thank You Collin MOOCs perimeter walkway with you would envisage some kind of connection through there which would incorporate bottle lekha see-through sorry what was the first of all and mercs perimeter walkway view a little bit and his vision to connect up all the it 's a permitir walk around crash shoot around the outskirts yeah but it connects the wetlands all the way around i connected all those assets up and cyclin wolf we 're very supportive of all that brilliant exciting the promenade as well it was in the paper yesterday looks fantastic too yes piranhas_,_590.2 yeah yeah i thought we 're gonna give a thing no it 's 17 seconds to go i think we 'll leave it there but thank you very very much Jim Anderson _"

    "text": "now we 've got a very long day of hearings today so I do apologize but we 're going to have to be pretty strict on time frames I 'm going to try and share the questions around so if if people you know have asked questions and I 'm going to try and prefer other counselors because you know and if people people who are speaking do leave some time for questions we 're going to have to stick pretty much to the 10 minutes for organizations in five minutes for individuals so on that note could I call forward spokes Canterbury cyclists Association good morning good morning I 'm Dirk de loup submissions convener for spokes Canterbury thank you for doing your best to represent christ church and for taking the time to let people be heard when all is said and done i hope you will have found ways to make most of us feel like our participation was both meaningful and productive thank you for the major cycle routes funding if comments to the press article on the University of Canterbury academics failed assault on the have a great deal of support you also face a dilemma everyone wants something and there is not enough money central government is jump the queue with the anchor projects put on the pressure by insisting on not accounting for the insurance proceeds cut rebuild funding and insisted on a balanced budget not that they have managed one themselves in eight years the ratepayers don 't want asset sales nor unaffordable rates increases living within our means is politically popular in word only when it comes to taking steps to do so there are few generally agreed-upon quick fixes cycle infrastructure is one and it appears that many in the public think it worthwhile I can present examples from around the world of cities which have found that funding cycling has made people happy while reducing congestion and the need for expensive roading projects the draft lpt even acknowledges and i quote increasing capacity to accommodate increased traffic volumes is not desirable because it is expensive resource intensive and encourages further traffic growth creating more capacity problems in the long term and undermining sustainability options and quote the only thing more rates increases I think you have a pretty good idea of what spokes would like from this LTP already I will briefly list some high points and then leave it to you to ask questions for the major cycle routes to meet expectations they will need excellent connecting infrastructure quiet streets less on street parking alleyway connections can all be inexpensive ways to achieve a complete Network integrating them into the public transport system is also important cycle parking at bus stops can allow more people to utilize the bus network that too needs to be in this LTP reducing congestion by allowing people to safely walk cycle bus also addresses central government 's obsession with road-based freight travel times reduced not by building hugely expensive new roads but by better utilizing what is already there so what are our suggested changes to best develop the benefits of active and public transport the draft plans infrastructure priorities need some serious reworking we do need to rebuild much of what we had while including active transfers transport infrastructure as we do why build a 20th century transport system for the to maintaining the status quo building evermore limits our options as prioritized there will be little to fund active and public transport the project scores are a way of achieving better infrastructure priorities when they prioritize affordability in both the short and long-term safety long-term congestion reduction community outcomes resilience economic contribution and alternatives the freeing up of dollars for the local economy social equity public health impacts a cleaner environment and we need to revamp the priorities for roads and footpaths to support the redevelopment recovery and growth of the city encourage mode change and improve safety the performance measures need to make clear how well we are actually doing surveys of how people feel about something have limited value what is actually being accomplished must be measured for instance cycle routes built on schedule where desired and well-connected more people on bicycles commuting going to school shopping playing more people walking taking the bus and then there 's the dead ends central government has begun been big on Commandments and not so great on funding or even listening to what Christchurch actually needs whether it 's their demands trucks or even anchor projects the priorities are not the ones we need high priority infrastructure is what the people of Christchurch actually need to get around on now and to transition to more affordable transport modes council will need to say no to central government on anchor projects transport priorities urban sprawl cost sharing agreements and asset sales know anything less locks ratepayers into substandard outdated transport infrastructure and never rate ending rates increases folks fully supports Christchurch City Council working for the best interest of Christchurch that means infrastructure which is sustainable resilient and affordable which meets our community 's needs first thank you for standing up for the future of Christchurch thanks very much listen and I want to start with a question bits in relation to another submission that we 're going to hear later but because your spokes I wanted to hear your view on it and that was a proposal not to reopen the section of the summit road currently closed to vehicular traffic so open to cars and stuff and the there is a lot of support for the said I know because 's a keen cyclist on a Sunday and they love the fact that this place is now safe for pedestrians and cyclists and doesn 't have to compete with cars so de spokes have a view on that I think you would find general agreement that that 's the preferred option I 'm however spokes is a democratic organization and just as you have to go to your counsel I would have to speak to more people than just myself but I think it is fair to say that yes we would support that it 's great thank you toe thank you very much Derek um your suggestion about good cycle parking at bus stops so there is an area that spokes would potentially work with council in the future will be happy to work with council on that and any other issues that we can be of help because one of the issues too is you know it Airbus 's as you know having enough space on on them for bikes to actually and be carried that 's it and that 's a huge issue because well we get with their bicycles and then they stopped because after you 've had the fifth bus go by with two bicycles on the front it 's not very useful yeah sometimes there 's more bicycles than passengers unfortunately as well so I don 't know whether you 've got any views about the nature of the buses that we are utilizing in the city well in Perth I think it is they 're using buses that have essentially luggage sections which can take luggage or bicycles I think they can take 12 bicycles at a time right but they 're actually even smaller than the ones that we have in size aren 't they I don 't know that yeah I got a lot of it easy to look it up Yanni one of the things that we have got on budget is about 160 million for the accessible transport plan so there 's a number of projects in there which are about doing the earthquake repairs but are about changing the central city just trying to get a feel because you 've talked to us about saying no to government said that we have to do and obviously accessible transporter is one of those have you looked at those projects to work out which ones will really have the benefit in terms of the cycling network for the city versus you know which ones that we could just say no actually there 's no point spinning we have and we have made submissions on the accessible City Transport chapter without that in front of me I 'm not going to go over each specific one we were not impressed with some of them because they did not make for easy contiguous cycling created too many intersection conflicts etc I mean we had real concerns with it the Copenhagen lanes that exists for two blocks and then sort of fade out are not going to encourage those interested but concerned cyclists which is the demographic we really need to target you need to make it complete they need to be able to go from their home to their destination without feeling like their life is in danger pull very quickly quickly just you 'll be aware of the common sense planner about removing 30 million dollars off that 156 million-dollar spend which would actually in complete some of the roots about that it depends on how it 's done I mean I think we all have to do what needs to be done to make it work for the city so that we don 't have to have rates increases we can 't afford and don 't have to sell our assets I think there may well be ways we can save money and spokes looks forward to working with City Council staff to try and identify those as I said in this presentation there maybe alleyway connections there may be removing on-street parking I mean when you try to remove on-street parking I realize you 're going to have a merchant saying no I 'm going to go out of business I think you need to make it clear to that merchant that having that in there means more people are going to be in cars the city is going to need more money for roading infrastructure so his rates are going to go up 20 or he can join percent effectively and is it really worth it to him and then you need to come back with the the carrot which is the NZTA study at Oakland which showed that most of the custom from people on bicycles was actually better than what they were getting from the on-street parking which was replicated in Wellington with a study by opus and replicated at a New York as well so very much to declare for these for you Miguel Rodriguez one thank you very much thank you could we now have the Canterbury cycling development trust _"

    "text": "proposed member population ratio models from the status quo at 12 26,000 two-cylinder average of 16,500 know if that 's what doesn want to give a preference today fine just refer it back to the working party around and if it 's if it 's not acceptable that 's fine you just for shadow it as an amendment and if the motion is lost then we 'll put yours as an amendment no no I can he can for shadow an amendment before i move to you know i mean it may be carried as it is and it may be lost so this will do but i wanted to say a couple of words on this as well so I too wanted to acknowledge the work that the staff had done by reading the newspaper reports of the representation review working party there clearly was a total misunderstanding about the nature of the work that had been done and the extraordinary level of engagement with our communities that had been done under the radar and I think the fact that it was done under the radar you know was free and Frank you know feedback to us but at the same time because it was under the radar others didn 't notice that it was going on as councillor buck said you know you you couldn 't possibly imagine a scenario where people would want more counselors and then the truth is is that is that the reason that I 've taken a different position than others on this matter is that that 's how not how I 've interpreted the findings and I think the findings are open to interpretation and I think Ginny highlighted that really really well when she you know said that well when somebody was asked a question about it they see well I don 't know my counselor so if there were more counselors I might have been a chance of knowing herder you know who it was and and so it can be interpreted in different ways my belief is that people want to be closer to the decision-making that that 's my fundamental belief and it 's what I stood for that 's why that 's why I want to see community boards left with the final decisions on matters that relate to their communities I want community boards to have their own budgets and I understand counselor yo Hansen 's concerns there was a direction that was adopted in the past where community boards had their delegations removed and I want to find a way of working with central government so that the legislation allows for local boards which is what the Auckland group has we have that provision only in the law if we amalgamate with other councils well I don 't see why council should have to wait for an amalgamation with other councils in order to have access to the local board decision making framework which is what Auckland has and I think that if you actually were to embed that process into the Christchurch environment it wouldn 't be able to be overturned by a future council it would be locked into place and it would be only by agreement that those changes would made it would also set up our count so if it 's some stage in the very long distance future there was easily add them as a local board and that to me sets us up as a region to take into account whatever happens in the future and I think it 's a far more resilience oriented way of looking at decision-making locally rather than being beholden to the wider council and in the case of amalgamations exactly the issue that we 're dealing with here was as a result of an amalgamation littleton was never part of Christchurch City because of a political decision that was made to keep it separated from the city when the amalgamation debate was going on in 1989 and actually political decisions they 're actually really stupid when it comes to local decision-making I actually think that it 's really important that the community comes first when we 're thinking about these things so I think that it 's unfortunate that this report at the media and probably the council without a proper communication as to its purpose and I think that and future when we have council committee reports or working group reports then it also needs to have a proper communication as to the press editorials it says any suggestion of a council increase will have to go to public consultation of course I mean that 's stating the obvious but it 's clear that those that wrote the editorial didn 't understand the process that we were going on and I have to say that I didn 't understand the process of the 12 26 ratio really being excluded which is why I can 't support d which is the motion that we have in front of us and I think that the other thing that I want to say is this that I stood on a platform of accountability and transparency and that doesn 't mean that no but it doesn 't mean that making decisions and the public eye is easy it 's actually not it 's incredibly hard because it does mean that we are subject to way more scrutiny than our central government counterparts so for example and central government at a cabinet committee you do not have the media in the live streaming of decision-making at the cabinet meeting all of the decisions have effectively been made block by reports from those committees and there is a high degree of trust and colleagues and that regard but there is one other component that is missing from this table and that is this that once we make a decision as a cabinet it is the collective decision and that doesn 't happen around this table and that 's why I end up in the situation where I feel that we don 't have the degree of trust that exists in a cabinet environment and why we find it difficult often to debate harder shoes and the public eye we are under a much greater degree of scrutiny than our cabinet colleagues but i have to say that i 'd rather be in this place then there any day of the week and that 's because we are closer to our communities we are connected to our communities and if we can create as a legacy of our time sitting around this table the 14 of us a new form of decision-making that actually makes it even closer to the community through local boards as opposed to community boards thing when i SAT around the cabinet table as a minister and I was the MP for Christchurch East I stopped being the MP for Christchurch East for that period of time and I was a cabinet minister representing the interests of my country and when I was in my electorate office as mp4 Christchurch East I didn 't use any of my political influences Minister of Immigration or anything like that in fact i would hand over those decisions to other ministers if i had a constituent that was seeing me about an immigration measure I knew very clearly where the line was and I believe that we could create that line here in Christchurch between your work as a community board member and you 'll work as a as a counselor and a counselor isn 't where people really want to have the connection if the counselor isn 't the decision maker it 's the community board as long as the community borders the decision maker so I think that we 've had a good debate around the subject I think that the I think that the fact one way or the other probably indicates to staff into the working group that they are going to have to consider these issues very very carefully before they bring them back to the council table so is there anyone else Jana you have a right of reply on that as the mover no we 're having the debate around the thing yes in the heat dave has foreshadowed an amendment to 8.2 which he will move if this is lost so Yanni how would we take a wee afternoon tea break and have a chance to just look at that amendment because I do i do agree that it would be good with you to try and get if we can get a common preference today that I mean I think the risk of being divided on this issue has really undermines the work that we try to change so I just like some a little bit extra time just to consider that amendment that was suggested before and people turn that down so like it 's awesome well I mean yannis asked for you know I mean look I to move on to commit I mean the timer 's the is the problem I no no no no no no look look I 'm gonna put the vote because if the f is vocalist troops everything boat is lost if the vote is lost then we 'll get to the other one NF it 's carried we won 't so um so um there 's a number of points that have been made and I 've child really hard as chair that we can party to distance myself from my personal view and respond to the community engagement as we were asked to do through the local government Commission workshop so that 's why I 'm supporting d I think there 's a number of things that have been raised that the idea of going to local boards as certainly something that 's not ruled out but it 's not part of this process we cannot do that as part of this process you 'll recall in fact when the working party was set up I wanted an increase in terms of reference to look at more more holistic we had a very narrow terms of reference so this resolution day I think there 's really even in space and it doesn 't rule out the other options coming back it 's just simply giving a steer as to a preference of the initial community engagement which will still be subject to public consultation the difference between the Auckland boards as I understand they can raise special rates they can sit I think some sort of policy but our boards come our boards can 't raise revenue they can 't make strategic decisions or policies they can 't do things that we might not agree with as a council so they 're very limited in terms of what they can do and the idea that we would create a whole bunch of by Adi amalgamation if you like going back to like 1989 and having a whole bunch of little little councils doing you know things and local neighborhoods maybe something that we need to do a lot more work before before we would agree on but certainly I mean I I don 't know the history I wasn presume that those things went through quite a thorough considered prices and if you just take the peninsula having been smarter within this city has meant that some of the funding for things like the waste water projects although although syrup treatment upgrades have been able to occur otherwise I think some of those projects would never happen in those communities lifetimes so we do an evidence-based approach to this representation review I think we do need to think about we 've had a number of things around communities of interest I 'm sorry everyone decision-making good decision-making that is not what we think asked to do is part of the representation review and I really urge counselors to look at the legislation and think of those factors we 're simply being asked to respond to those three things that the local government Commission have identified there are many other aspects of our operation of our decision making that we can address through other processes but this is not process that 's doing there so we will come back with options if d is supported and it will give you will have but fundamentally the reason I 'm supporting d with an open mind is because I think that 's the preference the community have expressed that they want through the early engagement and I 'd like to go out and test that with the public consultation right i will put the motion so if we could have the screen up please so we 're voting on D and those in favor press yes and those opposed press know well there you go proved my point so it doesn 't carry forward so David would you like to move your motion so we counselor East moves would someone like to second that we propose a member population ratio models from the status quo 12 26 to the New Zealand average of 12 16 and a half seeking to bite um scandrett i will put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no have a vote yeah I can 't decide no I don 't believe in abstaining right that is carried right moving on and I think the next motion is that we moved to

    "text": "look I came in with no predetermined outcome today but I 've listened to all the debate and i 'm just going to reflect back to something I asked clean Livingston when I first started I said how busy are we now in comparison to the last term and he said aw about double now that is related to earthquake issues it is related to the long-term planning process with our financial issues that we have to deal with it is related to the truncated district plan review but they are going to be over soon and and there has increased our workload and I 'll concur with fetch EEO counselor tuna we are working message then and there is no getting around it I don 't believe having more counselors going to change that I will still want to go to every briefing every meeting that I can get to while still want to be out in the community I don 't think having more counselors is going to change the workload and actual fact may trip ourselves up and as she create new bureaucracy and another layer of actually believe that actually when people say they want you know closer contact with their councils I think it may have misinterpreted with they want more local decision-making that is actually empowering the community boards the community boards need more delegated authority to handle the stuff and I think the mayor pointed out we had two decisions in front of us today which really are a community board decision they 're not ours we need a slightly helicopter view of what the city 's doing be more strategic about the vision and we r we going to take the city we can 't_''_102.299 do that and we 're buried in our day-to-day community board issues and as councillors we do wear two hats we were a community board heavily around sit around this table we cannot think about our community board as our main focus our main focuses the city and where is the city going to so I think we 've got a great amount of people here I do think we have awesome debates and actually get really good outcomes and I 've been surprised sometimes you know have we still come out some very good decisions I don 't believe having more counselors will actually add to that I don 't figure also I won 't be supporting this a lot and I think that we 're going to send a clear message to what Christ shoots think that this council you know we 've got our heads in the trough we hear that rude or time that were you know we 're sucking on it on the ratepayers funds and I think of adding to the council is going to add to that feeling out that sexy out there at the moment I would like to see some a lot of work done on how we can drive the decision-making down to the community boards strengthen the delegations and I think that 's where the work really should be am I do clean thank you I 'd like to begin by acknowledging the work that Jenny and her team have done I know that Christ Church is being looked at and held up already in regard to other councils viewing us that 's the feedback that the number of people that have been engaged in our communities has actually exceeded those engaged over the ltp am I correct and that in my mind has been a very good response so far I understanding of what our task is today is that we have to demonstrate in our response the three principal considerations which are in your report in 2.9 and our reports proper consideration and identifying communities of interest effective representation and fairness of representation when we look at what the communities have said as I 've said we want a lower ratio we want more effective contact with our counselors and then if we look at what the community boards have said they mostly want increased representation by way of lower ratio you and my conclusion on this is that our response will be measured by how well we have addressed the three principal considerations identified in 2.9 in the report we that you know possibly that 's a strong argument over the cost pets even over the delegations to community boards but they actually don 't come into the framework and to which we are clearly listed in 2.9 and that 's what we have to address I think we could actually weaken our response if we don 't take those seriously and center our response around those if I mind agreeing with option D would actually be consistent with what our communities have said to us in high numbers and what our community boards are saying too and I really urge you to go with option D Jamie thanks Laura I 've obviously got an open mind to this process but I think at this stage most prudent thing to do is go out with our best foot forward what we believe is ultimately right for the city and there is any since what we 're really saying is do you look at having a similar number of councillors with C or D would you heading towards an additional six or seven councillors with with David 's or the ratios mean I couldn 't think of anything more terrifying than adding to a bloated bureaucracy I think that we 've got 14 people around the table our God sorry this council a big I was happy sorry okay except the point of water can you withdraw that statement oh just to just say I was tall I withdraw this yeah Parmen there the UM the efficient well oiled animal door and apologize governing body that we are more like it ah I think 14 people around the table is a huge amount I think that it takes a very very long time and governance tombs to get things done and I understand that that 's nature of it I do understand that accounts isn 't necessarily a commercial board but I think that if I 've learned anything about local government it 's about finding the balance and I think that sums up everything because there 's always two sides to an argument and I think fundamentally what a council is about and what a councillors job is is to govern and to represent and actually there are sometimes at opposite ends of the spectrum so I think if we want it to be really really effective and efficient weird have six councillors elected at large now be fine and would be really side would be fantastic but then I think on the flip side hey would have really great representation if every community group was a community every eight the person down the street was a counselor but you 'd also get absolutely nothing done so I think finding that balance and finding that middle ground is what 's important my personal belief is that what people really care about I think that they want to be able to take part in local decision-making or have an entry point and the ability to take part in local decision making issues that are important to them and I think they want the council to be effective and efficient so I you look at it companies here and I had a quick look at what the reason he was and the boards of directors I 'm not saying it 's to be warning or a totally fair comparison but they do governance that 's the whole point of a board you 've got tower insurance three hundred million dollars in revenue per year five directors Victor 1,000,000,000 and turn over eight directors in new dollars in annual revenue 12 directors caterpillar 80 1,000,000,000 levels revenue point of order does this has got nothing to do with diamonds he 's allowed to talk about governance what 's wrong with it I 'm talking about not out of an order to make a reference to the size of a governance board when we 're talking about a council we know that a council isn 't a board of directors or but there are similarities it as a governance body um Apple 240 billion dollars in annual revenue and a board of directors of see them do you maybe imran they had 17 directors FYI territorial authorities you know christ church we 've got 1000 at least a thousand residents hamilton 11 counselor for twelve thousand five hundred residents in auckland one councillor for 74 thousand five hundred residents now oversees i had a look at what they had counselors were the council mean as they called my mistakes in the Amsterdam has one council member for 9600 Tokyo has one councilman before a hundred and three thousand residents New York has one council member for every council member for every two hundred and fifty thousand residents so I 'm just saying that yes we 've had engagement there there have been three thousand or so people that have it works out at about 0.8 percent of population that 's fine but also remember this is an unpopular thing to say and I apologize in advance but i 'll decide anyway um sometimes the floor I believe I 'm signing my personal opinion with consultation is that it can fundamentally be flawed because the people that have got strong ideological views with this ones that are the air rattling the cage but I think fundamentally people just want to have a city that works and you know what I I 'm not actually going I 'm not going to ever be a great politician or anything like that because I actually don 't really give a toss if I get voted out making a decision that with the information that I had that I looked after the people of Christchurch that I if I feel it with the information I had I made Christchurch a better place reason there is a net information that 's going to be in the public arena and it can 't_''_602.92 be out there due to sensitivities also be it I I wanted to do this not to get it and not to get the job but to do a job and hopefully have a player part in making the city that I love a better place and it 's not always going to be a popularity on contest I think the most important thing and what I do is look at the big picture and look at the city as a whole and try and make the best decisions possible i think the easy option there is to say we 'll look at the look at the consultation results there people are saying they want to have more councils fundamentally i believe that would be the wrong decision i think that it would further hem our ability to actually get things done so i believe that a nimble group is better i think that actually the numbers that we 've got right now works reasonably well everything that we 've actually 's you like being overworked having more people doesn 't mean that the agendas get smaller all it means is there 's more question tell you what it 's like it I don 't even microphone in my head because I don 't know how many times as I sit there and my head if I 've gone from an actual corporate board meeting and in my head I 'm going why are we going all about this can 't_''_671.02 we just make a decision why are you asking irrelevant questions why are you making political points why you asking questions they already know the answer to and having more people around that table I don 't think it 's going to cut through anything will make us any more efficient I think it 's all about governance and management we don 't need to be managers we have great managers here we have great staff here I believe that would govern I believe that we set that high-level direction and that is our job that 's what we should do and you know what we can have that have i don 't think we 'll make an iota of difference so there there 's no way that I could support at this stage from the information that I have suggesting that we are we significantly add the counselors class AB fell I want to start to by acknowledging the huge work that we 're tend to the pre consultation and unlike counselor golf I applaud that the the review and the results and i believe the people and when i stood for council i was one of those and I believe everyone round this council table also said they actually started for democracy they wanted democracy improved in Christchurch and I 'm quite sad to hear some of the comments that I 've just heard but I actually think that to actually move that debate to empowering community boards actually is like putting that cart before the horse I think I cheered aboard the Spade music aboard for for tombs I know what it was like to have the powers of that board taken away I also know that it will take a long time and we must in do that but we must do it carefully and sensibly and I do not believe at all that it 's workable to try and say oh well well now on power community boards there 's a lot more to it than that and we need there by and from that not only does it these community boards but the future community boards too i also want to reiterate counselor and returners point about council needs to be effective the Commission are looking at how would it be a effective I 'd have to say that while it 's our counselor could say as could say well 14 counters enough the truth is we actually seldom have 14 counselors around this table and as also been referred to even fewer at the committee meetings often unfortunately not always making a quorum those effects which we have to take into account and you don 't need to be a social worker at all to pick up the stress levels at times around this table I believe most counselors work very very hard and do very long hours but and there 's no shared and that we need need more counselors I also think to a big advantage of having more counselors as we could have you know a wider range of views and ideas around the table what would be wrong with that and so you know there 's no doubt to the Commission have to ensure that as a council we have the resources to carry out their responsibilities I don 't believe we currently have we have to have the resources to have a good decision-making ability it 's rebuilding Christchurch is it really a total change in terms of the focus and workload of a council we are not in a position of business as usual the Commission expected that in the dust review some changes would be made in terms in terms of other of the new representation and there 's no question about the changes that have already happened and how we need to adapt to those changes so I 'm strongly arguing that we support option D David thank you look I think I go back to my original comments about the whole representation review centering support comments made by Councillor lonsdale about the work than it 's being related to number of other statutory things that we 're dealing with at the moment look I 'm prepared to support option D of the stage because I believe that probably will give us a range of options to consider and in amongst that as the status quo I personally am the current arrangements with the city but I am concerned about how we deal with banks peninsula so on that basis I am prepared to support option D on the proviso that it does not exclude the status quo and we at least we 'll have a range of options to look at but it does exclude the status quo so hey besides state authorities as long as we can pays well a bit in our if you want to amend sorry I thought you said you wanted to narrow the option i 'm sorry for but it as a point of order in many respects are we actually voting to to prefer a member population ratio closer to the metro new zealand city average of does that include see when it 's written as an or decision we 've made over the banks peninsula so you will have to have some change now what that level of changes is really what DS giving you the flexibility look through work out what is the kind of sensible logical level of change so but just here to counselor say that he supports d on the basis that it includes see and it doesn 't so I mean with my thinning from the report that will come back regardless is that the status quo will have to be one of the options but we 're already stating that out why are we having this vote then why are we having a vote on this if that is the case i understands we would use that is on a comparative basis so we knew where we are now and you look in the future so we can 't go back to it well well the status quo option that we put in the report now we 'll have 13 counselors in banks peninsula integrated to the city now if you do isn 't it so we 're wanting to know do you want other options and as your preferred to move as your preference to move closer to the ratio to the ratio so one of the options would be an amended status quo and then your other options would be moving closer to three to the effort silly we see see does not preclude the increase in the number of wards to ratio yes I know well you just said that we are either voting to stick with the 13 wards and I don 't accept that I don 't accept that that is what 12 26 means you can still increase the number of wards so no then this is I mean is that the problem has arisen because we 've just had a counselor contribute to the debate saying that he will support d on the basis that he still wants to consider the option of C but we 're precluding c by voting for d now what you 're giving the working party as we your preference lies when you when we come back with of the status quo and then we would say and the other options indicated by the council as their preference are these things here so the status quo why are we having this vote now because we want to get a the Whig party needed an indication of your preference was your preference to move towards the metro average ratio or would your preference be what well but that 's not the option that we 're really been given in a mini respects what the paper should have said was that the council the council acknowledges that one of the options will be retaining the current member populo population ratio what are the other options that the council wants to consider on that do you want to move to the to the to the a you know no but it says the decisions made on 8 and 8.2 which is C or D the problem is is there is the fact that at C or D what it should have said is is that C is going to be written the paper anyway I don 't know why we 're but there are other people that are waiting to be heard so you 've heard that I don 't know what I don 't yeah it 's confusing but anyway I 've got Jimmy ref Pauline enter key ok yeah I supported a daddy because C or D my personal view is not perfected not perfect but what I choose the tea because of I particularly like to emphasize every review 2.7 all those highlight because the council we spend so many resources the staff the time in the sum of an erect remember cancer we engage with the almost a three thousand distance and we gather some of the pointer for name that particular emphasized lambo counselors p increase the size of words be decrease if we choose C then puppy we don 't need a have a pre consultation we spend so much resources then we still insist on older you know the LA the original Eva point of your opinion but why we need to spend these resources this the first second is even some transformation yet right now it 's a kind of extraordinary time after need to pee dat always you know for instalike a moment we focus on this reprint the review this one stage 12 as three sh 0 and we set up so many the kind of the meetings former council meeting committee meeting the subcommittee meeting task force in working group so each one of us my person will partake of a quite a few the committee why we will lie to sue this committee and can achieve I 'll call our common goal for benefit or a community benefit Allah people benefit Allah peace this group but if we reveal the data information probably still kind of feel you know not total someone else taught myself still I would like to partake of the meeting powder in day time I have crazy with there may be some other appointments a mother meeting a tender you know that because only one party I kinda divided to to partake of these the tula meetings at the same time it 's a wavy wavy the difficult further is a big we are with the the all current council is it even they have local porno comic decision then the council cannot overwrite in anoka poor decision so we can focus on the the metropolitan the issue a century but how powerless try to our situation we are counselors but we are also communipaw members for instance I particle coming for meeting even I have argue with name you had a painter Campbell meeting started from 5pm palace Emmerich amiable member that men say or we started for 4 p-4 p.m. I always partake of a committee meeting now either finish our heretical but if a communal pot meeting agenda is not so important I prefer stays continue remain in the council committee meeting drawing and cultural the community permitted but you I 'm not all there as you are aware once a reader turf toe minds of all creative minds all the media would like to know which the elected member how you are attending great I don 't want to absent editor condom ET but I can help I have to miss what I need to choose which one you know it 's better not only for me it 's a beta 'm only that a moment as a counselor our workload is absolutely is very heavy my wife always compared to why you have no family time you are always liked working working I say that because my English my my secondly I need to read every day so many the document I need to attend the council meter also engage with less than a social meeting and a workshop and all any kind of activity essential I can help please so you know understand me but I still enjoy these are the kind of counselor the puppy service worker but we need to face the fact no that 's whether I choose the tea and also tea is so flexible this is only the tractor the consultation web portal a copy these are kind of align with the preliminary consultation fee Packer from the community founder individual people there is all kinds of favor reader but we still have the other two or three options because I still think this is not a perfect option thank you yet some interesting points put forward by people i think i think this I mean my observations of the council over the last 18 months how its operated all councillors would make any difference at all it certainly wouldn 't make any difference to the quality of the decisions of decision-making I mean I think to Andrews point i agree i mean you know the calendar is ridiculous now a lot of that is down to this period in time especially the district plan review which has been an abomination quite frankly and we 've just not been able to cope with the demands of that but actually a lot of the stuff we 're dealing with will start to dissipate over time but yeah the calendars is tough and you know that is also a management issue as well in terms of how to space stuff out I mean when it comes to engaging the community the most common things I get called about and actually my constituents call me on the phone and email me and write to me they never submit on anything if it I don 't know anyone that actually even knows after these consultations are going on do make their views known to me but the two most regular things I get called about our trees and car parking well come on I mean that 's not something we should be deliberating about you know so I 've actually started sending those to the community board you sort it out because actually they don 't get many inquiries they don 't have a huge workload so that could be just our ward or whatever but that 's that 's my observation so I think really we can 't get away from the fact that we are trying to amend the delegations of the community boards i think the council being very very clear that we want to push more responsibilities we 've said that from day one and it hasn 't happened yet but you know we will get round to it I don 't think the number of councillors needs to be increased I can understand why people think it will help but actually I don 't think it will make any difference at all i think we have it we have enough people and i i think once the district plan review drops out that will take away a lot of pressure and yet is it is a high workload a lot of that is about the way we govern a lot of a lot of that is about the way the organization works as well that needs to get more efficient and we 've had a lot of very difficult issues to deal with but they will dissipate over time so I 'd be happy to maintain the status quo I would like something to be done about the casting vote so either we end up with an odd number in the chamber or the mayor has a casting vote because that 's just general board issue but otherwise i 'm happy with the with the number we 've got nature i think it 's fine yep pawling he it is an interesting to Baton like I can cure with Paul instead on it from that area but you know the various views around the table they 're all valid I 'm not making any any pre-empting decision on how many councillors I would that the staff of Weaver I 'd like to see that we continue until option D so that we can actually have some some more information presented to us so i can make a better decision you know a week that this is the local government it is frustrating it is different than companies who might be making business with four or five board members but we have to consider other things like community well beings those are the things that are really cumbersome and take the time things that require community connections and yeah empowering community boards may be one thing but we still need to be connected to our communities you can 't_''_1782.7 say the top of the trees not connected to its roots that would die so you know it is complicated i would just really like to see the staff finish this we bring back some really valid options and in heaven discussion on how many counselors we would prefer to see around the table what the decision on our preference around banks peninsula is going to change the picture hugely i want to see that will make my decision so obviously Bucky and I find that this is quite interesting but I actually want a kind of a C and a half which is basically allowing for flexibility for a small increase in size to take account of what will happen with beans furniture changes and the community views I don 't want us to predetermine what the community says I would never have guessed for example that people would have said we want more counselors I 'm actually surprised by that and I would never have picked that and I like betting on things but i would i would have bettered that bit the wrong way on that one for sure and the difficulty I have with optional with addy is that it looks like a Council of 19 but what your HD proposing is that it may be 14 it may be 15 it may be 16 but we 're not making that clear in their decision I mean we are going to be faced with quite major changes I 've actually worked in a council of I think 19 because I can one of 13 and and I don 't really know which was better I don 't really have a view that smaller is better or anything like that and while I can understand that for a board representation the concept of local government is so different to board representation that the analogy doesn 't hold well and I have to say I get a great deal more emails and phone calls about things other than just trees and car parking about all sorts of things that people want sorted but even if we look at the current representation we currently have one to eight thousand banks peninsula one to 23,000 and burwood Pegasus 12 27 and a half thousand and spreading etiquette and one to 33,000 reckitt Andrew Graham so we have a hodgepodge of representations that is not fairly representing people 's the number of people to the number of councillors so whatever we do there are going to be need need to be quite major changes and what I want to be able to do is leave the flexibility so that those changes can come back to us as it is or move closer to 16 and a half thousand to one counselor which sounds like a 19 a council and it 's not I don 't want to either of those I want a range of options in between those which reflect what people actually say they want and reflects their view of what is their community because it 's been interesting to listen to what is their view of what the community is it 's not always as I would have perceived it and that 's totally fine so I I want some flexibility and that may mean a small increase in councillors and to take account of the changes that we 've seen but I don 't really want C or D the difficulty ahead I want to see in a half I mean David 's just approached me to say that he has an amendment which he thanks will merge C and D but I said that in the middle of it well at the end of a debate we can 't move an amendment you know and this people were comfortable with was set aside standing orders if you 'd like to read out your proposal and if there were agreement between the mover and the seconder then I would be prepared to contemplate it because I think those that oppose the current d might feel comfortable with the amendment and if they but they 're don 't think anyone who supports d would be uncomfortable with the amendment so if you just read what it well well if people would allow just a little bit of you know grace here perhaps of if and if the mover and the seconder we 're comfortable with it then I will allow it if they 're not then I won 't so if you could have an amendment to D to read yeah proposed member population ratio models from the status quo one to 26,000 ratio to the New Zealand average of 12 16,500 _"

can have it different is if it 's an isolated communities right well but i agree with you it makes it really really difficult yes and how we integrate it your your numbers around the Mets is actually making it really hard for us to follow what we were discussing with councillor jones around putting the feedback people have said around their communities of interest into the maps into the boundaries yeah and that 's why we 've come to you today for a stereo on what we should do alright so I 'm I 've got an Andrew next thank you and I 've got a number of questions now keeping really brief some of these relate to the engagement with the public and then I 've got one other question as well and they touch on things that have been raised but they 're really specific questions so um contact with the Commission about the process and have they taken a positive view of the process that we 've undertaken well like you go here you go they are very positive sees came out of a workshop with the local government Commission and other councils around New Zealand which Darryl actually teared and Wellington where the local government Commission actually suggested we do a mapping process very much the same as what we 've used in this process so they 're very interested and we 've been giving them feedback along the way so Mary yep so they 've been happy with that yet great so to what extent would the commissioners expect us to demonstrate that we 've taken into account the results of the public engagement in our decision making well the Commission in the guidelines again which are very clear I said that there needs to be three steps which has first identifying communities of interest then giving effect of representation to understand considering fear so in the guidelines around determining communities of interest they have community see themselves as one as a criteria that you key consideration okay great not now just thinking in terms of the recommendation option C retain the current member population ratio of approximately 12 26,000 does that mean that we would end up with the same 13 councillors we got at the moment I know some of you must be voted out the same the same number of councillors on the same personality sorry that was a very good answer I use it does yeah wouldn 't it so in terms of the mayor 's comments are wanting an equal number of councillors the only way to achieve that in the context of today 's resolutions would be to vote for option D wouldn 't it no not discern see here well if C is keeping some time look I don 't take what I said unto into account I see there if the one thing that I would want is a mere it would be to have an equal number of councillors so that I would have a meaningful casting vote Jamie Jamie since which time jamie has told me just simply to amend the standing orders and they to have a casting vote so I 'm going to do that instead and one final question on and actually Jamie is incorrect we can 't_''_223.73 do it so totally in Greek miss Jenny orders god sake it would have been it would have been neat to be able to do that but we were to do it last term because we actually made a decision argument in any way democracy but the point that I was simply making that if I was if the consideration was effective decision-making then I would want to have a casting vote so and my question was probably a little bit on cheeky side his face absolutely um one final question in the context of counselor East comments nice certainly commend him for it some concerns for fair representation on the peninsula the only way to achieve a peninsula that wasn 't drowned out by a large urban population so to keep the urban population as small as possible in the context of the decision that we 've already made around option B would be to increased number of wards wouldn 't it there you and I think that 's why that has been a consideration of the Working Party is because of baked spinach impact on the rest of the wards you know it makes it bringing back stretcher and makes it a very large Ward and it really impacts on those other words I think that in public Arnie can answer that as that year the wing party but that has been the consideration of going for awards as one what people have said they 're dead fires communities into the impact of banks peninsula on the city wards and I might heaven twenty-five percent over the ten percent limit and record and Wigram makes it really really hard to do the mapping around that area because that 's where this really dense population so it is there 's an absence of people in the CBD and I right which will come back over time and you can because she can only use the 2013 seen suspects a real problem but you can 't you can create more Ward 's without creating an increased number of councillors because you can have single there is the option it 's not from better than option and because if if you do that say for example instead of having seven wards you had eight or nine Ward 's with one counselor each then that would or even ten Ward 's with with accounts are each that would still that would be ten counselors or you could have you could still help but you can 't have can you have Ward 's you can 't change the size of wards so that you can have to two counts of wards and one counselor okay you have a mix of wards so does that get caught by the ten percent right no because you can it 's the tempest it 's based on the ratio of counselors to population so you could have a banks peninsula as a single piece furniture plus the yellow hills as a single-member ward and in other Ward 's there 's double yeah but you might want to like for example there I mean it was a yeah I mean you can but there is one of the options that I think increasing the number of wards without increasing the number of councillors you know so because I mean because there are different ways that you could you could frame this because I think what 's what 's kind of putting people you know into this the discussion that we 're kind of having around questions at the moment is that when you look at what people seed so some participants suggested it be better to increase number and powers of the community boards rather than the counselors others suggested that there was a danger of increasing counselors and decrease in community boards so an actual fact you know some people what they were expressing was being closer to the decision making but they think that being closer to their counselor as closer to the decision-making if the community boards had more in making you can actually reduce the number of councillors and have them more of a governance and the community boards making their own decisions with their own budgets I mean that 's more like the Auckland model was established to be and one that I think would would would the number of councillors which which actually it actually brings the decision-making away from the community it just seems to me to be going in the wrong direction the number but anyway I 'm literally in with us others important i 'm reading the local government act right now in the local government using on website and it says casting boat the DeVault possession is the LGA there are no casting books however a council can and adopt they can you use a casting vote if they included in their standing orders through in addition to their standing orders reading the local government website right here getting ridiculous anyway but it as it is a cider shoot ref you ref you would stole my life thank you can we just get a process with everybody ref I 'm going to ask the question not debate um can we reduce the number of councillors was it something we reduced the number of councillors to say 12 you you could there 's been no feedback suggesting that but you could do it sometimes actually we bring banks peninsula into a normal-sized Ward and then we have an odd number in the chamber which means we don 't get this voting issue so we can do that is it make it does make your community boards a little more difficult to structure but you they need anything 's possible yep Phil in terms of numbers of councils and more than current with the Commission take into account the fact that Christ Church is in a very different position from any other city in New Zealand and in fact we 've got huge earthquake recovery which involves a lot more parameters around governance and also more hours so I 'm really basically saying look does that what the Commission take into account that in fact the stated workloads of a lot of councillors has actually and is actually to hide we were just conferring whether it was it that we believe that under the guidance of effective representation the ability for counselors to effectively represent their communities based on geograph have far they 've got to coverage how much they 've got to do we think I could be a consideration ago and I from the first memo that we 've drafted for the Cee to see it out at the start of this approach says and if you have a look at Becca that we addressed why this is such a unique representation review for Christ 's Church at this time and we clearly put that in there so we could we can and we 've been discussing that in the preliminary consultation quite a lot of people talked about that sort of thing so I think you could make that argument at the Commission I most certainly doing yes also did us or we could delay this until our population stabilized LC and in other things were seated and where we were very clearly told no this is a statue process has no room to stop it or changeup do okay thank you and up my other question is if for example and this has been suggested the council was to review what 's to ask for a reduction on number of councillors for example and clearly that would be against what the the feedback which is referred to in paragraph 4.46 plan if council so make a decision like that can end the Commission then Christian our process and can the Commission then make a very different decision from what we might recommend as a council like that does in 2003 they did and was seven thousand four yes they did and into the results weren 't and so what could the then be concerned that in fact the city and the council to end up with a result far less and perhaps anybody might have wanted like what they did in 2004 that 's exactly what happened in 2004 and what happened was that counts laws objected to their councils recommendation council laws appeared in front of the lote the local government Commission and and argued against what the council had recommended so unless we can come to a conclusion that not only has support around the table but has support around the city then we could find ourselves facing exactly the same thing their counsel the local government Commission have the numbers of councillors by banging two wards together in a direction they 're ignored where their centers where answer for the staff to is if in fact we don 't follow the processes and take into account the the community 's views could in fact the Commission decide against us only if someone appeal eyes I 've just want the stuff to you don 't know what L to start anyone appealing Justin themselves it 's no one of Appeals so we make your decision I Sierra has to be appealed they could I could the intelligent only if it 's appealed so or not okay and so if it 's appealed would they take that into account that we were in a finger required to follow or should be following due process yes yes do produce process doesn 't mean agreeing with an or agreeing with the interpretation of what people have said so we need to explore that and when we actually have our hearings on the actual one that we notify we will get to explore those and test those with individuals who come before us to present their submissions to that is when we come back with options you will need to explore the determine your proposed that 's right so but when we go out with the proposal we get feedback from the public at that point and we can hear what people are saying because I 'm really interested in exploring and teasing out what is meant by being closer to you to the decision maker because if we can get the delegations right then being closer to the decision makers actually suggests more community boards not more counselors Paul you raise a good point and it came about by the comment with regard to the council is going and ashy protesting to what we 're being put forward by the by the council so in that same statement does that mean if we go through this crisis and we get a counselor or two that go along and protest we put end up in the same situation so absolutely not can we actually as individuals go and actually protest against appeal isn 't yeah appeal there 's nothing to stop individual counselors from appealing as long as they were an objector to start with so Paul you 're you 've done going around in circles we 've had a few read hearings I 'd actually we 've got to move and second audits you like to move for honest thank you mom I 'm happy to move to debate have you got a question I was it concur with Tim I think the only point I wanted to make sure we can party we 're simply trying to get a preference so we can do some mapping options because we 're spending a lot of time going around in circles until you resolve the peninsula issue you have such a wide range of different scenarios and you know really what we 're trying to do is get some preference from the council so that we can come back with some options with all the sorts of questions you 're asking whether it 's remuneration with it 's a number of community board size of community boards etc but um and so we 're probably getting more into the debate so maybe I should just start the DeBakey you started about and you know I 've been had a few points of days and I 'm respectful effect this is a really important issue for this council so I think it 's good that you 've got lots of questions it has always helpful to get those questions at the informal or come to the working party and and and we were very open without having people come and try and understand what we were doing I just I just want to make several points and regards to why I 'm supporting d because I went into this process with a completely open mind I had no preconceived idea about what the engagement would show and I didn 't even go to the workshop that a number of our community board members who are on the working party went to but the feedback I got from them as chair of the Working Party was that the difference between what happened last time and this time is that this local government Commission wants to understand and and take into account the community views at every stage of this process so the engagement was focused on talking to people to try and find out legislation and I 'm sorry but delegations to community boards and pay off counselors was not one of those considerations in fact the considerations are really clear proper consideration and defining communities of interest effective representation for identified communities of interest and fairness of representation for electors on the electoral subdivision and I join you attention to the huge amount of work that our staff have done getting research on a number of these matters talking to a huge number of people in our community and I know that we 're still going to go out for public consultation and that 's really important but they have been talking to public the public the community leaders and local neighborhoods and local service groups they have been extensively canvassing what event they 're getting from people in terms of those three points and it has been i think i 've personally overwhelming that people feel under represented now there can be a wide range of reasons why that is but certainly would size and population size counselor has been I think one of the critical issues that 's been raised and d this is saying let 's look at moving closer to the average it 's not saying we will go to the average and I 've already heard a number of people say today that we 're going to the average it 's not true simply what we 're saying is because we 've resolved the peninsula issue now we turn on line T going closer to that average to try and get those three things met that I 've just touched on before so you know I urge you to support this today you will get another chance to have a really big debate when the initial or counselors preferred option comes back and is signed off to go up for public consultation so you know this isn 't the end of a process but this is simply trying to help us get the maps prepared so that we can bring you credible options back rather than going round in circles so I urge you to support this I conclude by saying you know I 'm hugely supportive of community boards but the delegations to community boards are at that the local government Commission can determine through this process in history has shown us in this city when our council was cut in half that relying on community boards to pick up the slack was simply a pipe dream in fact what happened was and comments were made us of that decision that we had community boards and they would pick up the workload the community world 's got resourcing cuts they didn 't get their support they needed from the council they didn 't get the increased allegations they lost delegations and they ended up being I think more and effective than what they should have been through that process they even got pay cuts as well even though their workload had double so we are in a new environment we have I think a new local government Commission who has set out a really clear pathway forward and this report is really trying to get some direction to respond to what the community have engaged with us initially and there 's still a lot more work to happen Andrew thank you um I 'd like to start have been raised in the discussion on questions so far the point of the counselor East made earlier around fair and effective representation of the peninsula can only be addressed by more in small Awards I speak to the point that counselor Johansson made we 're saying closer to the 12 16,500 that could be as little as one counselors that could be as little as taking it to 14 I 'm concerned any conversation about the number of council has been reduced I 'm definitely very concerned about concept of Bank Spinelli but potential have been abolished as a ward or swallowed up into a huge urban ward and the people of the peninsula would probably be even more concerned than I am and this is the sort of thing that almost certainly could lead to two appeals and so on so I think we need to be very very careful about all of that however one of the things that has come up in the debate that I would favor would be a consideration of looking at banks peninsula possibly the extended banks peninsula as the ward that rather than two if we go down that track as a way of achieving that fair representation so I know the comments in the report around the people the way that people have said that they want to be represented around their view of fair and effective representation paragraph 2.7 in the report residents are saying that they want better representation more counselors small awards better relationships with their counselors which may well translate into increasing the number of wards and the number of councillors that would seem to me to be logical if we 're going to respect other people have said now we 've heard that we should have regard to the results of the engagement the Commission will be looking for alignment between the results of the public engagement and the decisions that we make again that would point in favor of option D today now I don 't know what the right number of councillors is but what I do know is that we do need the full information in front of us in order to make that decision and we need to see those maps to us that they need flexibility to do that further work once they 've got the guidance from today so making a decision that saw that fixed on 13 which is what option C is wouldn 't in my view give that degree of flexibility and staffs answers to questions has also suggested that so in terms of what the Commission would be looking for alignment with the engagement in terms of what our own staff are saying they 're looking for in terms of flexibility that all points towards support for option D now i don 't know like to make some comments on the status quo which of course is what option C is counselors workload is significant it would be it wouldn 't be unusual for me to be working 15 hours a day and it wouldn 't be unusual many weeks for me to work seven days a week and that 's actually reflected a number of things that we see in the way that we do our work it 's reflected in counselors attendance not only at formal meetings but at informal meetings as well considered for cancellation due to lack of certainty of people attending or lack of quorum where we 've been waiting for counselors to come from another meeting so the meeting can start regular occurrences of counselors leaving one meeting early to arrive at another meeting late apologies for late arrivals and early departure a common place and there have also been occasions where the chair of a meeting has decided it would be poor practice for a decision to be made at that meeting despite there was a quorum because it was felt there wasn 't a fair representation of members present there have also been examples of meetings where there 's been no chair and a chair has had to be nominated from within the floor of the meeting all of these things point to the fact that council has got a huge workload which is affecting their ability to attend meetings and in turn because we 're spreading ourselves far too thinly that again points in the direction of needing more counselors to spread that workload so that it 's achievable and can be spread in a way elected to do and meet the the the needs of the people that elected as and I 'd imagine that that will be one of the things that 's driven what we 've heard in the engagement that people want a closer relationship with their counselor and in order to do that they need or they 're suggesting small awards and therefore they can have that closer relationship now another thing that we see regularly is its stress levels both individually and collectively and the amount of work that we do and the number of issues that we 've got to consider the number of meetings we 've got to get to emails to reply to phone calls to return and so on all lead to increased levels of stress and again that 's not an optimum environment for good decision-making again that speaks to spreading the workload more thinly would in fact mean that we could all be more effective so in short time constraints and stress do impact on has to be as effective as we would like so I 'm supporting option ding strongly supporting option D people have told us it addresses the current issues that I 've described this impact on our ability to be as effective as we would like to be it allows for more work to be done by staff at give staff the flexibility that they need to do that more work so that we can arrive in an informed way once that work has been done in that flexible environment to come to a confident decision based on facts that we actually haven 't seen yet in terms of the maps and other considerations so that we can make a good confident decision I 'd stress this is just one stage in the process and an increase could be as increased by as little as one but what we 're doing by agreeing to option do today is providing the flexibility an environment where good sensible decision making take place for that reason I would urge councillors to support option D thank you Paul _"
