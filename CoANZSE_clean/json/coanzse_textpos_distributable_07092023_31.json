of a urgency to get enough numbers to make it operate quickly and to say that you know you 're giving 12 people away for two positions for anything is really really healthy and I encouraged it and it does do a great job and gives a lot of women a fresh start getting out in the field again after coming from different backgrounds and childbirth et cetera so yeah and I 'd really very other council

counselor summer we just like to speak to the motion this is about kala West Recreation Reserve dissolution this decision didn 't actually come from us it came from the committee itself they passed a motion back in March I think to dissolve the committee they 've done a really good job they 've been responsible for the managing and operating of the committee but due to declining use and let 's just sort of become unsustainable few of the clubs of no longer in existence so our parks sport and Rec Department will absorb the operational part without necessarily having increased staff which is great and remaining funds should be going towards the improvement towards improving the reserve and I yeah counselors I just want to clarify a matter in the in the report and counselor summer just mentioned it on page 22 the second last paragraph in there is not doesn 't reflect exactly what 's going to happen in that the any remaining funds will be returned to counsel the the the section 86 committee that was down they won 't have any power to spend any monies that will be managed by counsel and spent on some minor improvements in building maintenance works down there the minutes the report attached to the minutes of this meeting will reflect will not have that paragraph in the report just wants clarify that with councillors thank you very much cancer person would you like to speak to the motion mr. million probably all of us not to thanking the previous motion those people are stepping down off their management committees and we talked long and hard about our volunteer community members and this is a fifty example we 've literally run out of them and that in that region and for that reason that community hall will now fall under so different volunteers in our community and our society in general these days it 's getting harder and harder for people over time it 's getting harder and harder them to have the inclination to be involved to have their say on their local communities and this is just a sign of what probably is to come and I hope it isn 't I hope we can still clean and the community can still keep developing people and willing to step up what they hand up and do their bit the local community and some of those names off the frank langella at at Darren girl he 's been if he is done a great job now he 's really community based and then sort of people we can 't afford to be really losing but yeah he 's done his job prepared to move on and so he should he 's done a trivia job but you know I hate and this is the first one I can recall

long time since 1982 the theme this year is get social we know that social isolation is a risk for the older population so this is a way that we can try and encourage them to remain active and engage with the community we have got an aging population in here it says that we 're going to have twenty three we already have and up in 2038 it 's likely we 'll have over thirty percent over the age of sixty so these sorts of initiatives are important and it 's pleasing because we have been able to offer the full amount requested for all of these events thank you very much counsel some accounts as a

thank you very much what any council wish to speak against the motion when he council like to speak to the motion Council Patterson would agree you know the policy is correct the concern we know it always comes up is sometimes councils can be stifled and that is not the case as councillor Somerset you know we 're entitled ever say to anyone we want to say too long as we make sure these people know it 's our opinion and not council 's opinion thank you very much councillor Patterson many other council wish to speak to the motion will now go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried and opposed answers now go to item 10.2 contracts awarded under delegation the recommendation is on page 33 as is the item what accounts are like to move a motion please councilmember the

motion just point out there 's a couple of very important ones he knew that that are out for tender to present and that is Sam which is closed and they also do sell gas and I can 't help thinking of former counselor counsel Ryan who would always go cold you culture agriculture is only to the matter and they 're together they say they will be very big thank you for that counselor Patterson where any counsel wish to speak to the motion will now go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried unopposed councils will now go to item 11.1 greatest shepherd and heritage advisory committee revised terms of reference and annual report on page 36 the recommendation is also on page 36 what a cancer like to move emotion counsel someone thank you very much to have a second to please cancer abdullah counsel some would you like to speak to the motion of reference to the heritage advisory committee the committee 's hasn 't been around all established because there 's no awareness of how much heritage we 've lost around shepard and in surrounds and it 's an attempt to try and educate the public on why it 's important and what we have and pleasingly there 's these surprising heritage hot pot hot spots that keep popping up everywhere whenever we do these studies and the people in the committee are really really really engaged so they 're always on the lookout and trying to preserve pretty much everything so there 's six community representatives as far as I can see there instead of four I think and there 's also a bullet point that council will host a biennial Bruce Wilson memorial heritage Lex Lex shop which i think is very appropriate the late Bruce Wells Wilson was integral in driving a lot of these initiatives so it 'll be just great to see him on it in that way so other than that I 'm pretty happy with the changes and look forward to seeing some heritage Thank You counselors on my campus up to or would you like to speak to the against the motion many council like to speak to the motion will now go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried unopposed announces will now go to item 11 point 2 on page 44 a used and develop of 104 Hogan Street at sharor for a car wash self storage facility and food premise recommendations are on pages which is quite extensive page 41 42 43 44 45 and 46 will accounts a lot to move a motion please councillor Patterson how would you like to me thank you very much to have a second to play cancer atom cancer Patterson would you like to speak to the motion concerns with us basically the proponents of this development of model of a change is already to incorporate the concerns that these people had it is close to the middle of the juror I 'll grant that it has been vacant for about 30 years this block of land was I originally a flower business and then that closed and it 's been empty sitting there for all that time it 's on a roundabout which really is access it is really governed by the flood overlay the front of the building or the block is you can 't_''_1428.44 put a dwelling on one side but you can 't never saw it so the proposed development is allowed for that up with a shop on one side which fits Main Street and they haven 't wasted the rest of it by putting up with some car washes in there and some story so there 's lots of amendments in there and I 've bent over backwards deploys as many people as I can they have employees everyone but I think a lamp of the fact there 's a car wash right bang smack in the middle of Marut now this one isn 't right in the middle of town and sort of on the edge of the CBD and I think will be good for the town take up another spot and get more foot traffic and support the other businesses in the town so I totally support it okay thank you cancel Patterson councillor Adam would you like to speak to the motion it 's just quickly detail many of these planning issues this is obviously being brought to us because there was more than five objectives but haven 't seen all the detail there 's a lot of conditions being placed on this and they meet my satisfaction so yeah I 'm happy to support it completely okay thank you so much councillor Adam but any council wish to speak against the motion any council we should speak to the motion will now go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried unopposed and so counselors we now go to page 64 we 'll go to item 12 tabled motions we have nil received item 13 reports from Council delegates to other bodies we have Neill received reports from special committees and advisory committees we have Neill received item 15 notice of motion amendment or rescission we do have a notice of motion item 15 point 1 health council Sutton to move that motion thank you very much and just say what the item is that 's fine yep that 's fine into planning application 28 into between 201 8 1 1 8 on relevant medicines acquired by the planning environment act 1987 that the council resolves to one issue a notice of refusal on the following grounds the land is not suitably located for a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation center being in close proximity to two primary schools and acquired older residential area the residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation center will result in unacceptable social impacts with numerous residents living on site together with card movements and extended hours of operation the residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation center will produce undesirable social consequences to humanity and the residents of the neighborhood he counsels on to have a second to please cancel Suvari because of something would you like to speak to motion we here once again with this same thing so I 'll just read it out similar to what I what I 've said before but this is still a very emotional issue and we must consider this issue on its planning merits and we also must consider the location and the amenity of the area the current location of the drug and rebirth rotation facility in my opinion is not neddle educational precinct with Sir Georges Road Primary School and Children 's Centre just a block away and some ELLs primary school and kindergarten to the east onsen Andrews Road and the noise aspect with this many people living in one location in a quiet residential neighborhood does his propose a pose a risk maybe maybe not but it 's difficult to ascertain the rehabilitation center will have up to 23 residents on site people make a noise they allowed to and I 'm not saying they can 't but with cars coming and going and this number of people there 's going to be new to being noise and I believe that this is the social impact that could be extreme for those living right next door and in the immediate neighbourhood numerous residents have submitted projections to this application noting that they don 't feel safe and who are we to say they are wrong we as the council have to listen to all our ratepayers and make a decision in good faith and that we are personally able to live with this will no doubt offend and to the area where it is situated in the amenity of their local residents I 've heard of the residents are living very close to this facility are suffering from health issues due to the location of the drug and alcohol rehab facility and I 've taken this on board with my decision we need to be aware of the social impacts that this facility is having on many of the residents and the enjoyment of the neighborhood in which they have been living for many years I note that we do need a facilities such as the cottage but would rather see a high quality drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility established on a non-residential site that is government regulated and has licensed professional staff on-site 7 thank you Thank You council something councillor zibari thank you madam a look god previously there 's all us all my colleagues here I 've spoken about this and I don 't propose to go back over material that I 've previously put as part of my position in relation to it there is a right way in a wrong way this my and things of that nature and I don 't propose to take a mat or anything thank you very much councillor berry when he council we should speak against the motion counts of someone I 'm extremely disappointed by this motion it goes absolutely nowhere towards addressing the problem of substance abuse and it also sends a message that recovering addicts should be hidden away it validates unfounded fears and it reinforces a deeply held negative stigma about addiction it even goes towards some some way towards explaining why so many people have not been successful in seeking help for their addictions my position hasn 't changed since the last vote no new information has been presented the objectives failed to convince me before so naturally my opinion still stands as mentioned at the last meeting it is clear that many of these objectives have allowed this matter to impact on their lives and they 're genuinely distressed but it seems to me that largely caused by innuendo and their own volition to be honest and if we 're also being honest the crux of the argument is an assumption fear about addiction just to keep their jobs they make it seem like it 's a personal problem that only affects bad people this way of thinking has cultivated an underclass that only entrenches the problem addiction is not a personal flaw it 's a sociological symptom of a broader community vilifying addicts goes no way towards rehabilitation and exacerbates crime caused by those continuing to try and sustain their addiction these problems are passed down through generations in a cycle that 's very hard to break costing our community millions in financial social and environmental impact despite perception people at the cottage are low risk and as many others have said I 'd rather have a cottage next to me than an active substance abuser at risk of making poor life choices way more at risk I 'm even told that the amenity of the area has greatly improved since the cottage moved in and we ourselves witnessed smooth operational processes and manicured gardens during our personal tour there 's been talk that the model isn 't appropriate or the location isn 't appropriate but entertaining these ideas are the reality is we 'd still be in this position they 're not in my backyard crew will always find another excuse to object there 's no right one-size-fits-all and there will never be a location without detractors we need a great many of these facilities all different types of models it should have been established 20 years ago but with inside lines by ignorant public public pressure political neglect and the too hard basket we must consent to the cottage because finally someone is actually doing something about the problem it 's not a detox facility it 's a stepping stone back to everyday life and what better place to re-establish life in the community that is an inner facility placed in the community by the community for the community Thank You councillor summer any council we should speak for the motion the council we should speak against the motion not discuss how well it 's run the price of oil so linker or anywhere else where he discuss that motion right the first part of motion says the land is not suitably located for residential drug and alcohol are quite older residential area there 's one letter we received from the first closest school now it 's supporting us 100% better addresses that problem the second one is a letter from a kindergarten across the road totally supporting it totally supporting it they didn 't know it was there for six months totally supportive to go down the page it some schools in a older residential area so if we put it in a newer residential area does that fix that problem no that 's not the problem so you can check away point one the second ones are drug and alcohol rehabilitation center result in unacceptable social impact infirm influx and numerous residents living on the site close together we 've all received a letter from the neighborhood live society totally supports it he has trouble with noise not coming from here coming other residents around having immoral parties and streets and cars again that is chucked out there is no notice base support for that the other one is as residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation center all produce undesirable social consequences to the normal and the is a interview with Troy Hancock me you know Troy adding the local inspector if there is a problem with with bad bad actions down there we better tell the police because they don 't know about it there is been no increase in how painting sorry in any antisocial activity at all and that 's coming from the head of ploy so if that 's what we 're going on there is not one scary of support for that motion and that is the motion we are dealing with for not motion not acting on it anything else we 're acting on that we 're not talking about how well it 's run or who makes money and who puts money in it that is what we 're dealing with tonight and that doesn 't end up in it already the pub test or anywhere else thank you thank you counts apart assimilating counts wish to speak for the motion when he counts we should speak against the motion yes marrow cancer Doolin I would like to just say that I do not support this notice of motion counselor a very objective manner look at the refusal grounds and has given evidence that these grounds are not based on facts they are mere assumptions and assumptions one can make about anyone at any time at anywhere so this is a decision that needs an objective understanding yes emotions are important but in this case you have to you know look at at that based on the on the planning decisions based on the criteria based on the conditions and also based on this important crisis I would say that ours Shepperton or greater Shepperton region is facing who is going to take that first step and say yes in my backyard so I think this is this is the time the time has reached that we all think as a community rather than as individuals and not in my backyard syndrome has to be kicked out thanks thank you you can subdue over any cancer wish to speak for the motion Council which speak against the motion I can take a slightly different tack and reflect on how we arrived at this position and we 're we 're potentially 25 page report from our professional planning officers prepared with the assistance of a of a planning lawyer and council voted to reject that that planning report which effectively then we provided all that 25 pages then becomes the applicants Exhibit A advocate they will use all of that material in terms of pursuing this point going back reading through the the professional officers report they did consider each of these issues that are in the notice of motion and provided grounds reasons why they didn 't support those in terms of the recommendation they finally made to the council council Patterson 's right he 's been through all of that in some detail and dissect them and tried to provide some rationalities behind what 's what was actually recommended by our officers but also I 'd to go a little bit further and indicate that there 's some aspects of this that are clearly not defined and at some point if this motion is successful and it ultimately will end up at advocate there 's no doubt about that whether it 's approved or for whether the actual application was heading to in relation to the council report that we as a group rejected that would have formed the basis of a brief for a consultants to have defended our position at VK what we 've got here is about a dozen lines so this motion is successful I 'll be very curious to know how we 're going to brief a consultant to defend our position at VCAT what actually will that consultant take to the panel and argue on our behalf for example what are unacceptable social impacts if that gets accepted adopted here tonight what 's being said on our behalf a tweak had to try and support that what examples would be provided normally we 'd have a very extensive officer 's report which would define what those outcomes actually were so we had something to base a decision on very similarly with undesirable social consequences again it 's poor lead it 's not defined at all so this is really speculative in terms of the grounds of why we 're refusing it normally as I said you 'd have a very comprehensive report you and and evidence this is being based on quite on quasi planning grounds we saw at the last meeting the grounds for refusal or what was put forward we 're issues around them operating without a planning permit well the truth is council issues retrospective planning permits on a fairly regular basis and everyone in favor of extension counsel Hosemann issues in relation to the nature of the operation they 're clearly not not planning issues and again we see here in point to concerns about car movements well the original application and the officers recommendation highlighted the fact that they needed to provide 10 car parking spaces on site they 're in fact providing 13 the hours of operation is being opposed here exceeded hours of operation again what does that mean if as all the parties agree that this is primarily a residential facility what on earth are hours of operation is that the period of time people are allowed to sleep what what are we actually talking about and so I 'm concerned I 'm will oppose it and on a cynical basis you could nearly vote a true supporter of the cottage because this is going to be very very difficult for counsel to defend anywhere let alone advocate can you cancel Haseman but any council we should speak for the motion recounts we should speak against the motion any closing comments counsel Sutton I just would like to point out that what we are actually voting for is a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center it 's not for a halfway house or something like that it 's actually seized it 's a drug and rehabilitation center and the unacceptable social impacts have been provided by residents living in that vicinity who are suffering from health issues and it 's due to the actual location of this facility now we need to take that on board as well because they are important in this this argument we can 't just dismiss them altogether so that 's why I 'm put this motion up and that 's why I 'm voting for it because we have to listen to these people we can 't just listen to one and not to another so I think that there been provided with that from some of these residents okay that counsel Sutton 's opinion thank you for that have you finished counselor something okay will now go to the vote all those in favor so against it councils we have a tie so I will be using my casting vote for in favor of the recommendation so motion is carried we have a second notice of motion item 15.2 I ask consent to move the motion please yes thank you madam a motion I 'll be moving is quite lengthy but in brief in relation to planning application to our won 8-1 went out on the basis of the information before council and having considered all relevant matters as required by the Planning and Environment act 1987 should the council have resolved to true notice of refusal which has just happened or if the an application is maybe the cat for a PHA to grant a permit the council resolves and there 's quite a few points there sure I read them out do I have a seconder please count for something councillor Adams like to speak just briefly hazel Minh indicated earlier this will go to VCAT one way or the other hand I think it will be there this is to I suppose assist VCAT if they should decide that they will order this council to grant a permit we shall provide all the conditions that were pretty much in the original application that was refused it 's really it ensures that well it doesn 't show anything to be quite honest because every cat could ignore this but it will go to them they 'll have these conditions to apply to any direction to us to issue a permit otherwise we might have another meeting and go through these issues or maybe not so it 's a bit of a reserved motion hopefully he won 't they won 't be needed but Anki Council Adam Council something would you like to speak to the motion when he council we should speak against the motion well you can too like to speak to the motion speak to the motion in that as Kevin pointed out it is precisely the same conditions that were attached to the officers recommended in their report and recommendation to approve so the actual approval was rejected that now we 're saying if by some chance we can 't indicates they might want to approve it will now adopt those very same conditions I would have thought if the level of opposition to this facility was as strong as it 's as alleged there would be some variation some of these conditions would have been made even stronger but in fact now we 'll just go with the old

Harriet I have two questions from John Gray notice John 's in the gallery tonight welcome John John 's first question is has an approach being made to VicRoads to officially formalised the golden valley highway that is we demonstrate rerouting wells foot street from Saburo and street to fryers well Street intersection in the coming 1819 financial year the response that John is yes we have been having just some discussions with roads but as you would be aware the when we complete the final bit just at the intersection here that 's effectively only halfway of the project and we need to go from fryer straight through to Brougham Street and there 's some significant works in that that will take some time over many years but we 'll continue to talk to Vic roads and at the appropriate time we will discuss transferring the status of one Road to the other that will then ultimately allow us to come Wyndham Street and formalize the you know ring ring road well switch to your second question some years ago Council formed a three member advisory group of knowledgeable and experienced citizens I think you were one of those knowledgeable and no I thought you were okay I think you might have put the idea up but to helping the management of open space decisions small particularly turf management whose input was valued in the highly successful introduction playing fields that committee seemed to fade away without acknowledgement of its contribution to that success I certainly would like to acknowledge the work that that small group did because there were several conversions of couch grass over a number years in a staged process that has led to much better surfaces on our playing fields could a similar small cohort be formed to help with the welcomed and ambitious council initiative to green greater Shiva room the response to that is the advisory group referred to was set up many years ago and provided valuable input into counsels to management this input was appreciated and recognized the council and is in part why we have had such success establishing and managing field senior public open space and sporting facilities Council always welcomes advice from knowledgeable and experienced citizens on specific topics and values diverse opinion and input there is a however no immediate proposal to set up a specific group to provide advice on the greening Shepherd and initiative greening shepherding involves a range of strategies and operational initiatives to provide for a greener Shepperton during the development of engaged with specialists and industry leaders in these fields anyone who believes they have specific experience in this series welcome to share their knowledge with us and you know an example of the greening shepherding experiences one tree per child which was fantastic success we planted over 16,000 trees last year and we 're going back in to do that again this year with over 17,000 trees this year the response from the community from little kids from volunteers to help make that happen was overwhelming and fantastic and we couldn 't have done it without that support so we do find that times are changing John probably feel the benefit for the better and that whether it 's council the community other authorities or government they 're very much aware of environmental issues and greening Shepherd initiatives and are there to help so with all that assistance out there we 're finding it much easier to provide that support and help deliver so right at this stage we 're not looking at forming another advisory group but as we say quite happy to take advice and listen to people you thank you very much mr. Herot and thank you mr. gray for submitting those questions tonight councils will now go to item 7.1 adoption of terms of reference for Shepherd and regional saleyard advisory committee on page 2 the

to all those parties and individuals and groups there who represent council including council staff counselors in volunteers etc this fraud and corruption policy highlights it very well that the

you have a second to please councillor Patterson can say I was a very would you like to speak to the motion madam me I 'd like to defer to mr. title if I could please invite him to speak to the information contained thank you thanks madam air and through you to the counselors the reporters you 're aware is one of the detail of the detailed report is on page 71 of your agenda attachment to the report they operating performance the moment is tracking fairly well against budget and forecast we 're fairly happy with that there are in the year today column in the detail there is an unfavorable variance in materials and services which is purely a timing variance at the moment it 's related to a number of items so have been paid ahead of schedule in relation to road maintenance building maintenance and some enforcement actions this won 't flow through to the year end we 're not expecting it to of this year so that 's won full-year forecasts column that there is a 1.65 million unfavorable variance in depreciation this will impact on the operating result but because it 's a non-cash item it doesn 't affect cash now work in our working capital ratio or a liquidity ratio is still forecast to be in excess of 200 percent there was the increased depreciation as a result of a higher than expected level of contributed assets from development and work-in-progress assets that are reaching completion that have been recognized as assets through the year at this time of year we are monitoring fairly closely the capital expenditure particularly with the you know end of financial year not being too far away we have ninety-one percent of the capital budget committed with orders and either orders or capital or actual expenditure but the actual delivery of on-the-ground work will be contingent on materials and services from contractors being delivered prior to the 30th of June so we 're working quite closely with our partners in in all of that other than that things are tracking pretty well as expected thank you very much missed ISIL Council Patterson very slightly after that also in capital budget you 're also we can be affected by the weather so they can blow it out but we 're looking very good at that at this stage also the operating performance is going very well it is again in comparison last year we don 't get a clear picture because we we 're still the receiving rates in July we 're going to be able to done with all going very well for that but any counts I 'd like to speak against the motion many counts I like to speak to the

events that were holding there now so I think they 've done an excellent job thank you very much Kent so Jeff and Eddie cancels out and would you like to speak to the motion in this committee and they 're all feeling very knowledgeable in the operation of the show grounds they pay a vital role in assisting council with day-to-day matters and procedures and also in strategic planning for the future

Mall concept options there 's a recommendation on page number 31 with a counselor like to move a motion please councillor Saturn I do I have a second as well what 's the motion first could you please read out the motion Thank You Constance Ellen do you have a second approach second emotion let him chew Thank You counsel Adam counsel Sutton would you like to speak to the motion and with stakeholders and the wider community and they 've come up with these four concept designs that are now being released to the public for their information and input hopefully anyone that is at all interested in this even Thank You councillor Adam would you like to speak to the motion yeah I just want to make mention of the fact that this has been an ongoing issue for a long time and it 's been we 're seeing really great progress here we 've finally got for tangible designs to look at I don 't think councillors completely agree with entirely with any one of them but that 's why we 're here me also this motion puts it out to the public I just want to ensure that public do understand that we will be taking note of their actual opinions and views on these particular plans thank you cancer Tim would any councillor like to speak against the motion would any councillor like to speak to the motion comes to jovanotti I just what counsel Sutton has said I really do urge the right price within Greater Sheppard and the City Council to have a look at these designs put forward your thoughts and suggestions I know there 's been a lot of comment about lack of action in the past and I also understand as been seen even comment about the costs once once that information was detailed to the community so I think it 's very it 's imperative for people to have their say we 're talking huge dollars with input you give us the better chance we have of making a rational decision thank you would any councillor like to speak to the motion to start by commending spire on the work that they 've done the consultation process and the development of these four concept plans which I think we 're all acknowledged it 's been a quality outcome part of the history of the monster email is there 's never been a consensus around what should be the preferred and I suspect we 'll probably get a fair bit of that come back through this process as well there 's not going to be a clear-cut I 'm surprised a there be a clear-cut winner from the public comment the clear-cut winner is probably going to be option number five which isn 't out there which relates to the cost of the project we probably get more comment about that than the actual designs themselves but like other councils I 'd encourage people to have their say this has been a contentious issue for many years and there 's never been a clear-cut direction but the council and it 's imperative if we get the widest range of feedback we can thank you would any councillor like to speak to the motion counselor or Eswari I 'd summarize it by saying the worst that the people in shepherding can do is be ambivalent the best they can do is to take ownership and make informed comment thank you would councillor I guess basically I agree with all the other speakers what would really concentrate on listening to our whole community not just the traders in the mouth or the CBD and it 's a lot of dollars we need to listen to everyone that wants to make a comment right throughout a miscibility as we 've already agreed it 's been going on for years news news news and this is a very significant step were made and it 's out there for comment now we want to hear back and hopefully from their perspective as host council hazel and said we will get an indication one way or the other or it 's every other time of trotty an indication it 's been a 50 bit 25% this way Thank You councillor Patterson councillor Sutton do you have any closing comments will now go to the vote those in favor we should care it [Laughter]

what account alike to move a motion please I 'll move that madam mayor we accept all in favor inst imagine if I didn 't wish to speak to the motion anyway I think what did you know the closing these no public questions tonight cancels we go to item 7.1 on page 2 which is contract 1 7 8 9 heavy plant equipment hire wet and dry hire services on page 2 is the recommendation what it cancel like to move the motion cancer doula go ahead a second please cancel Jeff and Eddie cancer Abdullah would you like to speak the recommendation on page 2 as a motion the recommendation is to endorse the recommendation of gender evaluation panel to include 15 tenderers on the panel of suppliers for plant and equipment hire for infrastructure work which includes road and drainage Construction Road and drainage maintenance the supply of specialized plant or equipment not readily available to council key points of these reckon of this recommendation are number one the value of the contract one seven eight five million however with an optional one-year extension this value is estimated to be six million dollars also based on the annual usage patterns it is not cost effective to purchase and manage these equipment and plant so hiring provides the most cost effective alternative I also note that due to the past experience of operational difficulties in not having the right equipment available at the right time it has been recommended that a large panel of suppliers be available to improve the chances of equipment availability when needed I would like you to note that the local and outside tender is permitted their response and the report also shows nine tenderers who were rejected based on various reasons these reasons are documented in the report and the tender evaluation panel has determined that the contractors who are successful in being placed on this supplies list will be selected for works based on plant availability plant higher rates and establishment rates view of the information available in this report I am satisfied with the proposed arrangement and would support this recommendation thank you Thank You Council to like answer Jeff 's great to see so many local contractors that have been included in this tender project it 's interesting when you go through and look at the items that were actually going to be leasing from those local contractors that water truck rollers canga loaders and I actually noted a boatman trial at 12 to 15-foot night I thought that maybe that was a counselor Patterson to go fishing but I 've been reliably informed that it 's for use when floods occur on the river and that we clear material away from bridges etc thank you canceled you have an ad what any council like to speak against the motion yes I was disappointed my contract wasn 't accepted for the motion any closing comments counselor doula will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carried councils we now go to item 8.1 the recommendation is also on page 8 8.1 section 86 special committees committees of management memberships Council like to move motion the recommendation printed on thank you cancel Haseman do I have a second to please Thank You council Patterson counsel Hayes would in a minute look these came up on a regular basis and we usually make some comments about the contribution that volunteers make in our community and it does give me tend to be a little bit repetitive at times but I think by fact that so many came up we tend to gloss over the actual contribution that these people make and I 'm particularly looking through the the names associated with the ban Bartha recreation reserve and these are people well known throughout that commune they 've made contributions over the many years of service to their local community and I think it 's fantastic that people do put their hand up to manage facilities on behalf of the council and it 's appropriate that they they be recognized and I know that on on occasion that through the volunteer Awards people involved in these committees of management 's do you get recognized I think that it 's appropriate that we look at ways and means of acknowledging the service that people do make to our community Thank You councillor haze woman councillor Patterson would you like to said that I think that 's a trivial idea and I think we should look at getting some form of recognition whether it 's 20 year certificates of appreciation or something down those lines to actually reward those people I know from the bath or recreation deserve their tennis clubs having a hundred years anniversary issue and I 'm hoping council can help me out and some way that front row to pool and and gather all that knowledge and history sort of thing but there is a lot of people in this community that do a lot of voluntary work that do need and desert you recognize I think it 's something we should look at the far as I 'm trying to identify how we do that without making a mountain of work for a start Thank You council Patterson many council like to speak against the motion when he council like to speak to the motion he goes in comments council has on it is it 's following on from councillor Patterson look I can use the Telugu from the recreation Reserve as as an example when of the committee one Alan Hayes he had been the secretary for 37 years and yeah quietly retired from that position and there 's no formal acknowledgement other than a little notification in the pavilion out theater recognized that level of service and I think it 's appropriate and whether it 's a year 's service so that would be one way of measuring it but I think we should look at how we can acknowledge people who do contribute significantly over the years Thank You councillor heisman agree with you as well cancel Patterson on that note we 'll now go to the vote those in favor against motion carry councils will now go to item 8.2 Community Safety strategy 2018 to 2021 the recommendation is also on page 13 where the council like to move a motion council hours are very what motion would you like to me thank you madam mayor I 'd like to move the motion as the recommendation is a motion on page 13 that the council adopt the greater capital city council community strata safety strategy to 18 to 221 thank you you cancer or Avari would you like to speak to that thank you madam mayor council with support of the greater Shepherd and Safe Communities Advisory Committee have developed a new strategy the strategy goes 4 to 18 2 to 21 this is the third installment of the strategy which was first developed in 2007 the strategy speaks for itself the question quite rightly can be asked has a strategy been a success it 's not always easy to measure success but in terms of outcomes as detailed in the body of the report and in my time as a councillor an ongoing chair of that committee I believe the answer is yes I 've always maintained that whilst this is a council strategy the content of the strategy comes from input provided by our community members however it 's not to say that government semi government authorities and interested groups also have a part to play in shaping a strategy the strategy is only as effective as input from its community members and it 's something that needs ownership from that community to truly get the most from it the the aspects however for mine the dominant recurring contemporary things family violence drugs and alcohol and Public Safety Public Safety in the sense that we as members of the community should be feeling comfortable moving about our community at any time sadly that that is not the case it 's a society-wide problem and Shepherd and is no different to that the question is how do we manage the expectations of the community in comparison to the strategy the answer to that is high level engagement and always try to improve on our aims there have been many positives over the years flowing from the strategy and these are contained within the body of the report finally I 'd like to wholeheartedly endorse a strategy thank the community for its support and interest and would like to note the excess of Job Order Council thank you Thank You councillor oh sorry cancer doula would you like to speak to the motion yep so this community safety strategy 2018 2021 its focuses on improving Community Safety within greater Shepperton current data analyst and statistics have also been used to identify priority areas this the vision statement of the strategy says a safe inclusive and proactive greater Shepperton now it indicates that this is an important strategy and it has resulted in putting in place enhanced safety measures and support within greater Shepperton and some of these measures in past have included safety camera network lighting upgrades in Mott Street Stewart Street crime prevention through Environmental Design training to council staff and also domestic violence awareness in projects in partnership with G V family violence prevention Network and Women 's Health Network northeast this as I understand the draft strategy was exhibited for community consultation that resulted in some important feedback which was incorporated into the final strategy the two main outcomes were expansion of measures to include primary school programs and inclusion of b health as responsible stakeholder the feedback also highlighted the need to include youth and children in the in the strategy as responsible stakeholders one of the interesting aspects of the strategy as I was reading through these pages was that it was guided by the community safety survey 2017 that was done in British Shepperton and some and those results have sort of informed this strategy so one of them of course from the survey results the top three priority areas for Community Safety in Greater Shepperton were highlighted and these included a score Kaster or sari has highlighted drug use public violence and aggressive behavior and domestic family violence the five priority goals were outlined and each of these goals have got strategies and measurements in place and also the responsibilities and timeline to measure those those actions one of the interesting aspects that I noted was that in the priority area for alcohol and drugs there were some statistics given in the strategy which highlighted that in greater Shepperton just under a third of residents believe that it is okay to get drunk every now and then and also one of this one of the statistics highlight that there is only one liquor license for every 300 for residents in great residence in Greater Shepperton I think one of the aspects of this this whole information was that do we really know the concentration of liquor shops in areas you a question extension yes please thoughts around liquor shops that after reading this strategy it got me thinking that yes the it is shown that there 's only one liquor license for every 300 for residents in Greater Shippuden but perhaps we should also be looking at at some point the concentration of liquor shops in areas with low socioeconomic demographics such as North Shepperton where we have three current liquor shops and one future and that is alarming according to many residents anyway in concluding in conclusion I would just say that it it 's a very important piece of work that was done by the staff in consultation with community and various stakeholder organizations and I fully endorse this strategy thank you Thank You council Abdullah on many counts I like to speak against the motion that he Council like to speak to the motion any to make one command please and councils often accused of not acting when they say we should be doing something and not following through drugs and alcohol the terrible scourge and after India and leading examples of councilors and we no longer have alcohol in the countless really happy with that that we can lead the community so hopefully in some way that will make some small difference so it can 't possibly be so yeah but it might make some small with it thank you very much for those comments councillor Patterson but any council like to speak to the motion any closing comments counselors are very okay will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carried councils will now go to item 9.1 on page 17 contracts awarded under delegation and status of contracts advertised and yet to be awarded December 2017 January 2018 and February 2018 thank you can switch over Nene do I have a second please I 'll second that madam there do you like to speak to the motion can search of moving the recommendation on page 17 I think it 's great to see that some of the contracts have been awarded particularly the track lighting for the BMX track one of the and they also I think one of the big things is the solar installation on council buildings we are aware that our electricity costs months I think it 's great to see the council 's taking a proactive approach to ensuring that we can reduce our energy consumption costs as much as we possibly can I think it 's a this is this hopefully is only stage one in a number of stages have solar panels or council buildings Thank You Council Germany de cáncer Adam would you like to speak to emotions thank you madam mayor councillor GIM least on my thunder that was the main item on revision which is a so look there 's many fantastic projects there there many and varied it shows how council is across most community concerns not just community concerns community projects as well infrastructure projects but the soleus lecture on council buildings is something that the personal propose aspiration of mine when I first come on the council I 'm glad said it 's finally taking place not only reduces our energy costs dramatically but also our carbon footprint and that fits in well with our our whole policy we expect to the environment so I really am very pleased to say that moving forward against the motion where the council like to speak to the motion councillor summer and a point of formats I like the way it 's set out this month it 's really clear we can actually see that the chief executive officer has awarded certain contracts and that directors have awarded certain contracts and it also it stipulates which contracts are not yet awarded so I think it 's getting more and more clear every time we do this and it 's a great exercise in transparency Thank You council summer what any counter like to speak to the motion this is a regular feature of the the monthly meeting and I think it provides really good information to the community and also to councillors on the progress of works what it also tells me that was in the third quarter of the financial year we 're seriously having a crack at our capital works program indicating that the commitment is there and obviously last year we met 92% of the capital budget and clearly we 've set a target again to exceed that 90% we 'll get as close ambitious target in mind but 90 percent of what we 've got in mind and I think by this regular reporting in this format it keeps councillors in the community aware of what the progress is being made Thank You council Haseman but any council like to speak to the motion any closing comments pencil Jeremy well now go to the vote those in favor against those in favor council summaries they also I can see it in motion carried answers will now go to item 9.2 instrument of delegation members of staff and development hearing page on page 22 the recommendations are on page 22 and 23 what accounts are like to move a motion with only the recommendation made mayor is printed on page 22 and 23 of the agenda Thank You Council heisman could I have a second to please cancel off of all Suvari would you like to speak to the motion Council very briefly madam a because this is almost purely an administrative matter we we last addressed this delegation back in October of 2017 it has been reviewed and updated to reflect the changes is bringing it up to date to ensure that people who are involved in the development Hearing Panel operating within the appropriate delegation thank you cancel Haseman many would like to speak against the motion a lot of our herbs you like to seat to the motion but any council like to speak against the motion to the motion counselor summer there 's a lot of these delegations they come back to us quite regularly usually six months after a general election this one--it 's particular is for the members of staff and that 's the development Hearing Panel as well said and you can see with the policy in its entirety that it is an incredibly long document that makes people accountable for their processes and decisions not all of these actually are decided by staff some of these they do come back to Council for a decision and it 's up to us to just maintain that we can we keep all of our policies in line in terms of technicalities and that we are always compliant with all policies at the same time Thank You counsel summer closing comments counsel hazel Minh the development Hearing Panel convenes on a semi-regular basis has needs required I 've indicated in the past that if other councillors wish to attend and view how the panel works I think that would be a good process it 's very interesting on occasion there is the opportunity to almost mediate and the decisions made by the development hearings panel do not take away any of the other applicant or objectors further appeal rights advocate but I think it 's a very useful and effective process and under this delegation that we can deal with a number of planning matters that otherwise would go through a lengthy and exhaustive process through counsel Thank You counsel Hazen we will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carried councils will now go to item 9.3 on page 26 draft local law number 1 community living 2018 but a council like to move a motion well Patterson what would you like to move is I 'd like to move the recommendation on page 26 27 thank you thank you very much do I have to speak to the motion oh yes very quickly these are our local laws ones that you don 't know you 've got them until you need them minute guards are noisy copper to next door or or some small thing like that we have to allow the fact that there is noisy cockatoos around and noisy neighbors and we have to have a process in place I know a few questions I 've had over users how many pigeons you had to have et cetera they are all in local laws so it 's very important that anyone has any concerns has a look at this is going out for a consultation process people have a look at it get back it was apparent by sunset every three years and it 's a 3rd of July 2018 the current guidelines sunset so I encourage all right every have a look think if they can find an issue that they might have with some of that and get back to Council or the officers and we can see what we can do before it 's adopt it Thank You counsel motion obviously just what dennis has already said that council is required to review there 's local laws under the Act and this one has had minor changes to address a few issues as it 's going out to consultation we 'll get some feedback Thank You Kansas Sutton they might like to speak against the motion to the motion cancel summer just another call to arms to the public because this doesn 't happen very often it looks like it 's every 10 years that we 'd get the opportunity to really sift through and see if we need to make any changes so head to our website and write down a submission it doesn 't have to be complicated and if you wanted to be heard in person in support of your submission we will hold a special meeting so please get around it and let us know what you 're thinking Thank You Council summer when any council like to speak to the motion Council Adam you think you met Amir I just want to reiterate council summers comments I encourage the community to really look at proposed amendments and some may look rather simple in their in their changes but they can have some great effect so I 'd recommend that the community have a good hard look at it and encourage them to submit any for their opinions on some of these proposed changes thank you camp sir Adam any council like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor Patterson I 'm just a wild gorillas are exempt from their will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carries councils now go to item nine point four on page 31 draft local law number two procedures for council meetings in common seal 2018 the recommendation are on page 31 and 32 will count to like to move emotion cancer or oh sorry I 'd like to move the motion met in there on page 31 parts one two three and four and on page 32 parts five six in cancel Safari do I have a second to please and so Patterson cancels the ferry would you like to speak emotion thank you madam mayor look this is essentially a follow procedures for council meetings and it 's a draft which is going out for the community to make comment on as they see fit or not in terms of procedures for council meetings I 'm a firm believer that the KISS principle should apply keep it simple and if you look at the bottom of page 32 you 'll see a number of amendments and people that regularly attended this council meetings have in the past invented their spleen in relation to some of the things which go on at council meetings in terms of the impropriety or otherwise in relation to amendments so on and so forth and I think it 's important that people avail themselves of the opportunity as counsel or Patterson has previously remarked in relation to the previous notice of motion to give some input in relation to how they see best that we as counselors should progress local government procedural meetings Thank You counsel the very council Patterson would you like to speak to the motion against the motion got a point of clarification if I may is public consultation on meeting procedures required further information for you and someday the clarity if you need it later okay any council like was there anything else any other comment there counsel first speak against if it 's required by lora reserve my comment you answer like to speak to the motion I don 't particularly believe that meeting procedures should go out to public consultation because essentially it 's it 's us as counselors who are trying to do our best with good governance and we should get the feel of what works and what doesn 't work for us I think that the meeting procedures we have in place right now quite robust and effective and I wouldn 't like to see too many changes there I noticed there was a reference in this report that says our feedback from councillors was taken into consideration but they really weren 't that many changes so depending on what the public say and what we come up with hoping that they 're there it 's not true too dramatic thank you cancer summer but any other council like to speak to the motion any colors and all part of the transparency process together with the legislative requirements so I don 't think it 's it begins just something that we need to go through is the council thank you for that we 'll now go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried council now go to item 9.5 on page 35 February 2018 monthly financial report what accounts a lot to me the most I 'd like to move that motion meta man recommendation as a motion sorry for yelling into the mic do we have a seconder please does this go to job is canceled up Edison did last month well stay tuned counselor Hayes one would you like to speak to the motion cam what I was about to refer this to I kept the council on my left here but I don 't want him to actually put our finance officer he behind me hit him there finance to shame so could I hand out Thank You counselors the but financial for February is in the attachments to your agenda the primary indicators on the first page that report are be tracking for this time of year the important one being the working capital ratio otherwise known as the liquidity ratio is tracking fairly well and you 'll see that we 're currently holding about 30 1.5 million dollars worth of cash and investments at the moment that 's returning about a bit over 2% almost 2.2 percent on an average basis rates debtors up a little bit at the moment compared to this time last year that 's a matter of timing of when our installment notices and other reminder notices have gone out and we expect that normalized by year-end in terms of the operation operating expenditure is tracking very well year-to-date without any major variances to budget the year-to-date indicator or operating position we 're projecting a downturn in user fees and charges with we 're watching quite closely at this point in time and doing some more investigation on it 's predominantly related to our early childhood centers and bit of a downturn in utilization of those and a shift between fee-paying customers and the grants that we get in to offset some of that linked charges as well but that 's not the predominant reason behind that turn down on capital expenditure capital works is progressing fairly well as Celtic councillor hazel many indicated before the cap the contracts are out and we 've got about 68% of our capital budget committed by way of contracts or orders at this point in time so we 're fairly well on track with our capital expenditure and that 's about it would you like to speak to the motion I 'm very pleased inhibits at 68% cuz it 's been a bugbear going over the years that we adopt a capital works program and then don 't deliver it and it creates all sorts of angst at the budget times I think it 's very important that that 's one of the key performance indicators that we need to meet it means that our our budget is both realistic achievable and measurable and that 's the standard that we should try and maintain Thank You Council Haseman but any council like to speak against the motion when he counts I 'd like to speak to the motion 'm happy to see there is no no plan to invest in Bitcoin apart from that yes that 's it you said briefings I must have missed the Bitcoin briefing there and keep it there but it 's not in the report so I 'm happy to say that you very much predict now Adam we will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carries councils now go to item 9.6 review of audit and Risk Management Committee chart up on page 37 the recommendation is also on page 37 what accounts are like to move a motion council jaboney d thank you madam mayor I 'd like to move the recommendation on page 37 is a motion thank you very much do I have a seconder please just taking the motion madam an answer Adam councillor Jeff and Eddie would you like to speak to my poor review sorry your risk management committee charter is reviewed annually there are a number of specific areas that we look at in relation to the auditing and assurance standards board as well as the any changes the Local Government Charter and I 'm sure mr. Koppel Vic and his audit review audit risk audit and risk management committee will be on top of all that the only other thing I 'd like to say is that the council has decided that the fees for that committee will remain the same as it was last year thank you very much counter jaboney counselor would you like to speak to the motion yes look I need just add that it really is an important committee in council you can sometimes be overlooked because it can be a white user word boring but it can be perceived as long-winded but they perform a very important role for this council especially I 've had a bit of experience over past years I 'm sure you met a me and now have as well and there 's some key objectives and the chart outlines them and in my experience they 've kept that charter very well not it 's hugely important as I said and I 'd just like to congratulate them on their own when they 're working match for that council Adam like to speak to the motion Council Patterson yes as a councillor gives you a lot of confidence this degree of auditing that a decision to council makes an expenditure that the go through this is one of the final processes in this council then it continues on through a state government level so as a counselor you tend to have complete confidence in though in a system that works and there 's plenty of levels to pick up generally when something 's not right and I 've been when I was me went to a few of those meetings and hear very precise very smart people on there and they really did know their financial figures unlike a lot of other people that attend we do what they do in each that one Thank You council Patterson but any council like to speak to the motion any closing comments counselor jebin et me just if I can see where councillor Patterson has got his financial acumen from obviously from attending these audit and risk management committee meetings thank you very much I 'm sure they are valuable well now boat councillors all those in favor against sorry council Adam assert in favor yep sorry thank you motion carries on working councils will now go to item 10.1 on page 40 the recommendation is also on page 40 the one true Per child project to have a counter would like to move emotions and so patterson what would you like to move the recommendations on page 14 do I have a seconder please count for Jeff and Eddie counts up Edison would you like to speak to the motion yes as we all know and I 've been very successful it 's one of those programs were 70 things you do for the councillor and just generally live but a lot of work in before you start getting a reward and next few years we 'll start getting a reward if you drive through the Golden Valley compared to 20 and 30 years ago the amount of work that 's been done planting trees a variety of birds sub shrubs and trees etc it just makes the place a different place than it used to be you see a lot in the city it 'll make a big difference to the bird life as well it will also make a big difference to the shade that 's available global warming it 'll be cooling things so it 's all positive as well as just looking in a street that 's nicely tree looks so much better and we all know about mod Street you know why for more such a nice Street it 's got a nice truce and that 's the main reason so hopefully in years to come with lots of mod streets without blocks of forests in our cities and it 'll be a lot nicer place to be even more so that it is now I can 't believe people laughing this I 'm so serious about it it 's really a great thing that we 're doing and I 'm looking forward to continuing on thank you very much for that Kevin going very well wonderful have you finished thank you very much found such a vanity would you like to speak to the motion yeah I just like to kill with what counsel Patterson year we actually exceeded the number of trees that we were going to play I think we exceeded that by a few hundred which was terrific I think one of the things I 've found from this whole process was the involvement of the community groups and the schools that were involved I think it was great to see the kids particularly in the primary schools where we attended their planning sessions how keen they were and that 's going to give them a I suppose a level of responsibility to look after those trees for as long as they 're at that particular school which i think is a good thing because often trees that we plant are looked after but by going through this process I believe that there 'll be less losses than what we patched that in the past Thank You counsel Jeff and Eddie many council like to speak against the motion many counts I 'd like to speak to the motion counselor given any comments I think the whole process of the the tree planting is giving the children has from the schools any Eddie said and I think that 's a great thing that 's probably what 's my math it 's more successful than otherwise would be and the fact that they 're real trees is another plus as well they 're not plastic Thank You councillor Adam that was directed at a counselor or a person in this room what that means you would any counter like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor Patterson similar to Robert Royston never plastic group we don 't want to speak the CEO about that might I just add it was over 17,000 trees that were actually planted so that 's sensational all right will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carries answers now go to item 10.2 roadside weeds and pests program funding on page 44 the recommendation is also on page 44 do I have a counter would like to move the motion Council a berry thank you madam mayor load move the recommendation is the motion on page 44 you for that do I have a second domestic of the motion letter me Thank You motion thank you for the opportunity the the motion itself is self-explanatory essentially what to go to happen is the government is going to give us a sum of money for two years to perform a control of weeds and other noxious pests that might inhabit the byways and the highways of our community council Adam would you like to speak to the motion yes it 's not a lot of money madam there but it 's it 's a it 's an amount that will assist us in attacking and trying to control these noxious weeds as councillor IRAs very pointed out it 's almost an opposite motion of the previous one isn 't it when we 're promoting greenery no it 's neat needs to be done we must protect our native species of fauna and flora sorry not for and this goes a small way to achieving that thank you cancer Adam but in the cancer like to speak against the motion when he counts I like to speak to the motion cancer Patterson I just like to point out that we have a policy here that the 54 thousand dollars for weed control and we just come to the end of the season I know that Vindhyas just got out of control right through North detour it basically and hopefully we can concentrate on that it 's a curse of everyone that 's got it in that 's made of rubber flat toys et cetera so yeah it 's it 's good to have gone down in this course and we can identify what weeds and councils are already but we 've got some more money to spend on it looking identified and targeted in a more precise Thank You counsel Patterson but any counts I 'd like to speak to the motion any closing comments counsel has a very go to the vote all those in favor against motion carries counsels will now go to item 10.3 on page 49 greater Shepherd in townships framework plan review 2018 endorsed and released for public comment the recommendation is on page 52 I have a council wishing to move the motion Council jovanotti thank you madam mayor I 'd like to move the recommendation on page 50 have a seconder please need a seconder council as a barre cancer germinate would you like to speak to the motion thank you document is going here public comment you know it 's great to see that we 're looking at not only Shepherd and Township but also some of these smaller municipalities or small towns within the municipality for growth in those particular areas a number of areas of been identified in many of the towns and some of them aligned to their community plans which is fantastic but it 's it 's something that I think that right buyers should have a look at particularly those in the smaller towns to see where the development is being proposed for the future and I think it 's extremely good document thank you very much for that council jeben '_''_2584.77 any council also very would you like to speak to the motion just a dovetail into Council of Giovannetti comments if you believe what you read and you see in the media and so on and so forth about the potential explosion of the regional cities in terms of population apparent that this document strategic value can 't_''_2604.99 be underestimated and it 's important that people participate and take ownership of it thank you those comments anyone like to speak against the motion they counter like to speak to the motion counselor Patterson like congratulate Council on developing his policy play pool everyone hears of a tree change which is people should cannon over the places like shipping them oh there 's people at blue shipping too big no only shift out of places like shifting into your tele group is undies etc and what this document does identifies the strengths and weaknesses knows talent what 's there for housing the future and I think it 's great the way looking at back so these towns will be able to grow we can see what infrastructures need in the future so we help them to grow they want to be small to let out of you that small they want to get to the place I can support a good shop and I 'd be a pub or something like that so they you know generally want to increase it done really well I 've looked at this and said you know if I 'm deer wants to improve that size or increase in size what we need to do is this and it 's great congratulate council officers for taking up the challenge green Thank You councillor Paterson Brenda Council like to speak to the motion cancer summer just I think was very lucky to have these small towns and a central business district of Shepherd in it offers people the opportunity to experience Country Living whereas they still have the option to come into Shepherd in for all their services and that 's something you can 't really get in Melbourne and something that makes us quite unique it allows us to look at where our reefs resources should be spread and I do appreciate this tent this plan Thank You councillor some are but any council like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor Bernardin madam mayor I reiterate what I said before that people within the the smaller communities within the municipality you really do need to have a look at this document to very has already mentioned the possibility of improved train transport between Melbourne and Sheppard and really does open up a lot of these smaller towns for people to move to the area and I think it 's great that we 're actually highlighting the areas that would be beneficial for future development thank you very much council jibin Eddy will now go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried councils will now go to item ten point four on page 54 adoption of amendment C 196 to the greater Sheppard and planning schemes I didn 't to the urban design framework Shepherd and North and South business areas July 2017 the recommendation is on page 55 well the council like to move the recommendation we have a motion the council Sutton do I have a seconder please I 'm sorry council something it 's a long one perhaps you just verify which item it is thank you very much in a second to please council summer counter something would you like to speak to the motion future developments and thank you very much some would you like which is something that is often fit fed back to us that 's something we should be concentrating on most of the recommendations here even have to go into the panel to me they 're common sense I think there should be applied a little bit further than just the Northern Gateway and Crayola Lakes Drive it 's going to make a difference moving forward it 'll take a while for it to actually take some shape visually but because we can 't actually put retrospective of changes onto that those parcels of land but moving forward I think it 's a very positive thing Thank You counselors summer many council like to speak against the motion when he count to like to speak to the motion any closing sorry council Hausman example of how the planning scheme actually works that we 've got a document that originated back in 2006 regularly reviewed and as part of that latest review the council resolved in july last year to adopt an addendum to the and design framework goes out on public exhibition a number of objectives come in it goes through the original it 's back here for us to adopt it and then refer it to the Minister for planning for approval so I think it 's not a bad example of how the planning system works effectively agree thank you very much council hazel man anyone council like to speak to the motion any closing comments council sutton will now go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried councils now go to item 10.5 on page 62 it 's a rather long recommendation we have on page 63 64 65 66 67 and 68 and 69 63 216 are movin easier do I have a counselor that would like to move the motion please that 's what you 're needing you do I have a second recommendation on pages 63 to 69 this is in relation to a three lot subdivision on the corner of or in balaclava Road it meets all the council 's requirements the the conditions that are placed on this particular development obviously numerous as you can tell by the the length of the motion itself but it 's it 's the thank you can see Germany councillor Patterson would you like to speak to the motion yes there 's six pages of paperwork there regarding the amendments and the amendments but what conditions attached to it there were six objectors the objectives loss of community dwelling will be constructed cheaply all the actual objections wouldn 't stand up at VCAT so if we didn 't pass this to go straight to VK to get at each straightaway so you know that I probably would wonder next door to my place later but it 's a it 's a legal development good luck Thank You councillor Paterson but any council like to speak against the motion where any council like to speak to the motion councillor Suvari thank you madam mayor the thing that I found quite interesting about this is that it 's making it denser in terms of we 're going up and I think this is a sign of the future these days are pushing for the fact that the urban sprawl is not only restricted it 's not only a by-product of Melbourne but it 's a buy people get in the car and drive an hour and a half to work and things of that nature but I think the reality is that the signs of the future dictate and you know you have to read the media where major cities are trying to curb the amount of vehicle access in central cities and things of that nature so moving along these lines I can see the day and greater Shepherd and where we 're going to have a greater density of multi-storey does an example of it I also found it interesting in discussion and briefing we were talking about the prospective and the prescriptive nature of the the landscape plan which I personally necessarily support because man 's house is his castle and I understand that rules and regulations are an important part of the plan he has been for some time a little bit Thank You councillor Barry many council like to speak to the motion counsel summer I will speak to the motion I will say that initially when I heard the location of this I was a little bit nervous being on far end of Wall Street so it 's not quite as detrimental to the amenity of that streets just such a beautiful Street and I do agree that high-density housing does have its place especially with such a bridge wiring city but that doesn 't mean we stop at protecting existing amenity because once it 's gone it 's gone and I know we have heritage heritage systems in place to try and protect this but I noticed in the report there it does mention there 's no relevant neighborhood character objective developed for the area we don 't actually have those in Shepparton so if we were to protect these precincts like moored Cariah or street with these beautiful trees these gorgeous buildings i think perhaps it 's something we should be looking at and that would give us some protection at vcap for further development in the appropriate areas Thank You counsel summer Lenny council like to speak to the motion any closing comments kind of council jumpin eating will now go to the vote all those in favor go to item 10.6 on page 102 use and tower and associated infrastructure in the public park and recreation zone and buildings and work words floodway overlay and land subject inundation overlay the recommendation on page 103 104 12 accounting he 'd like to move a motion answer a Suvari you don 't have to read it all out perhaps to his colleague Council of juvinity the recommendation as the motion on page 103 just need a seconder before thank you pens Abdullah first I need to take you back to it would you like to speak to the motion counselor very first I 'd like to acknowledge a lady who came to Council and spoke to us as a collective of counsel was the thing coming today she said to me said to us as a group that she lived in this area for 34 years and I she said she had a two-story residence and she really loved the view while the amenity as its described in planning that she looked out the window she said how the bird life and concerned for various other issues and electromagnetic things of that nature and I 'm not an 't like a tower like that in my place or near my place however planning is a very cold clinical area of legislation and unfortunately amenity doesn 't really come into it so technology comes at a price and that price or progress comes at a price and that 's not always something that we want in the to the circumstances of this particular telecommunications tower to single tower 41 point three meters high you can 't miss it but we 've been assured that it complies with everything that 's required we had people in to speak to us from Telstra Telstra will have the tower and Optus will feed off it it will improve the strength of the signal of the speed and connection of Wi-Fi we will inform that there 's a 7080 percent data usage increase per year infrastructure infrastructure cost money there 's a rental fee that 's attached to it there will be an aircraft beacon on top we 've done the aeronautical examination from an expert to say that there 'll be a limited risk in relation to any planes flying off course in my view has merit although I do acknowledge that it won 't thank you you can 't_''_3409.72 I was a very can-do law would you like to speak to the motion yeah I would sort of reiterate what counsel has said and I do acknowledge the concerns raised by our community members and you know you made a presentation the other day however the reality is that it is a growing region we do need better telecommunication services in greater Shepperton and this tower is necessary and is a necessary infrastructure to provide better telecommunication coverage and services to our community I haven 't had a look at the read the report and I am satisfied I would support this recommendation and in some of the main reasons behind my endorsement would be that you know the concerns rate raised by Shepherd an aerodrome committee have been addressed the civil aviation safety and standards are to be followed as part of the approval conditions and also during the briefing by Telstra and Optus representatives they were advising us that the community concern about the health issues resulting from the advised that the electromagnetic radiation from this tower would be under 1% of the allowable level of radiation so I believe that the health safety concerns have been addressed and I think as we do need this infrastructure so hence my support for this recommendation thank you thank you cancer doula recounts I 'd like to speak against the motion councillor Sutton and I realize that it probably makes all the all the recommend all the planning and policies in the etc but I just don 't like the idea of it being there it 's a great big tower it 's in the middle of a park kids play there there 's 200 horse there 's the bowls Club Tennis Club and I 'm just not happy with it being there so I can 't actually agree to it Thank You counsel something but any council like to speak for the motion yes thanks but I mean like a couple of points everything that counts Laura 's very pointed out is true we can never always address the concerns of the community members in respect to these types of at least it 's a colocation type tower so if they both companies weren 't on the same chair we would probably be sitting here shortly having another discussion about another proposal so at the very least we can be happy the fact that we 're killing two birds with one stone Thank You councillor Adam when he canceled like to speak against the motion where you can to like to speak to the motion cancer Patterson first of all I 'd like to congratulate Council as vary and sensitivity in this matter it is a very sensitive matter and and I know you come and approach council hoda say and we appreciate that which more people did would know where people stand fact is there 's never a right place for a tower unfortunately I 've never seen one that 's gone relationship but they 're an essential tool of the world today and as as councillor Sutton said you know a parks not a good place for it but the kids will be damned they 're using their mobile phones so they want reception so we 've got that officer and Telstra he congratulated combining their efforts have one tear or one tear only and that as he said would restrict another cow from going up and one point I know that when you address council was your concern for birds and as I spend a lot of time watching our feathered friends I can guarantee you one make one and will actually attract more birds you know they love somewhere to seek and climb and mostly be karelas not brick the bloody tear probably but they will counting numbers know about that there 's something else there for them then you have birds of prey that somewhere high to sit and watch and all that sort of stuff so it 's not all doing to you although as I said it 's not good looking at have you back fence and santel unfortunates to go somewhere unfortunately it 's never the right place for it the term we have to pass it otherwise it will be at the gap and we 've done anywhere in costal Swapnil so sorry for your inconvenience that I appreciate your time to speak to the motion any closing comments concise Avari I think you met him man look all the commentary has been noted by me and the other thing that I 'd like to to say in terms of a separate issue but but intrinsic in the placement of that tower is that if you 've been following the media in the last few days in relation to the fire stand in the southwest one of the biggest bugbears that have came come out at the moment is in relation to very poor mobile phone coverage and one woman actually was on the radio saying how the news that she was receiving was in fact 12 hours old she couldn 't access her mobile phone because there was no see this tower is currently rated to 3 to 4 3G 4G and will be 5g in the future and I think it 's an intrinsic part of the network of telecommunications that we need particularly in rural areas thank you thank you very much council Oliver and thank you everyone for those comments tonight we 'll now go to the go to item 10 point 7 on page 118 the 2018 china delegation and asia fruit logística the recommendation is on page 119 the council like to move a motion councillor Jeff and Eddie thank you very much I have a second please councillor Patterson councillor Jeff and Eddie would you like to speak to the motion this is another opportunity for quite a shepherd in City Council to make its way into the Asian market last year we had councillor Adam and mr. Harriet and staff attend the but Lee the fruit logistical sister on things of what would in in Hong Kong and that in many respects is piped away for getting some via stone fruits into the the Asian market particularly China I think we would be remiss as a as a municipality if we did not follow up on the opportunities that are there and also I think that by also visiting another country whilst you 're in the vicinity I think makes excellent sense we have a huge horticultural industry in our area and we as a council I think need to do what we the sale of fruit into the Asian market oh I noticed in the shape of the news the comment today that it was a jacket of sure young Thomas didn 't write that but the fact the matter is that it 's not a jacket if you have a look at the agenda I 'm glad I 'm not going to be perfectly honest cuz you you run off your feet so I think it 's money well spent and I think it can only be advantageous to try to ship it on city council in the long run Thank You councillor Jeff and Eddie councillor Patterson would you like to see to the motion oh yes I would done a good job of summarizing my Thunder there it 's certainly not a junket it is hard work I think I 'm more count and more qualified than any other councillor here to endorse this because I 'm not a mere for the last six or seven years it hasn 't been on a junket the the thing about it is and something that really sticks in my mom well about the 365,000 mention in our paper this morning Thomas it wasn 't a real good look anyway the important important thing is I went to a briefing or a lecture the track with the trade ministers of a federal trade minister at TAFE I can take his name three or four years ago yep and Europe ministers anything retired he was a trade minister he pulled off a couple of magnificent trade deals and his point was don 't wait for that happen it won 't happen you 've got to be progressive but zr4 you you 've got to get out there and you 've got to grab it you 're going to sit back and wait for all these deals that come to you it 's not going to happen now we are continue on the work that the last few years of me is getting over there and it 's got the stage near where staff are going I totally support that mayor 's will change every couple of years you need that constant supply and contact we start which part of this delegation and I imagine people sitting I 'm saying yeah counsel why some 36,000 on a junket but you know hopefully this will get the kid a job well their grandkid a job you know it 'll grab the school but the whole town can grow because our real producers are really learning because of these new deals I have it 's important run the front foot all mayor 's and all councils last few years we 're all been proactive trying to get this up and running and it 's important that continues on because as I said Andrew Robb said don 't wait what happens won 't happen you 've got to go and make it happen and by doing what we 're doing we 're making it Anke Council Patterson plenty council like to speak against the motion they don 't like to speak to the motion counselor summer just on the ship news article just to make it really clear one it 's not a junket the people who go exhausted by the time they get back in there 's no site theme and it wasn 't a 300,000 one dollars and that includes GST for a number of people to go over and represent greater Sheppard in in an area that 's going to buy our fruit so it exported the backbone of this region as we know we need to actually continue relations with China that we 've started earlier in order to really capitalize on that there 's already people growing fruit who are going to these Expos and with the mayor of Greater Shepard and by their side there 's really going to close some deals there and I also want to note the contribution that bomber made any Adam made to these ventures because I believe he was the driving force behind a lot of this this policy stuff he 's already gone over there before he 's made some very strong networks and I 'd like to I won 't raise it now as a as a motion but I think we should have further conversation about whether councilor Denny Adam accompanies the delegation over just to give us a little more umph Thank You counsel Sam how many counts I 'd like thank you cancel someone for that kind of what 's happened but it 's been a group effort and I 'd also like to take the opportunity to explain this word jacket although we use this humorously here tonight I can assure you and I 'm sure we our CEO mr. Heric could not attest to the fact that it 's no jacket we nearly lost him over there at one point and he was touching go for a while so no seriously it 's I think the value of these trips aren 't immediately recognized straight away but last year was a bit of a reconnaissance mission in respect to looking at the fruit logística this year we 're taking that next step and actually having a stand representing greater shepherding and I think it 'll just Forge us ahead in respect to our trade opportunities we see we met with obviously Australian federal authorities over there we probably wouldn 't have contact with them here strangely enough but over there in that environment and they were very helpful I 've always supported the international engagement policy which I fully support the mission and I think you don 't can I go get bigger and grow stronger Thank You councillor anyone else like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor jebin eating just mad at me but I think it 's an opportunity to goodness I think we would be remiss if we didn 't follow up on the ground with been done previously thank you very much councillor Bernie will now go to the vote all

these were challenged after we after we proposed them last time they went to a panel and the panel came back with the number of changes and hopefully we 've all sorted everything out I mean this is what panels are for it keeps us accountable there were questions around whether the resolution to delegate power to the chief executive officer to adopt amendment at a later date whether that complied with the act and they decided that it did not so yes we can we hopefully hopefully everything is consistent with exactly what we need to do Thank You counsel summer they counter like to speak against

lot back to the community give a lot back it also mentions in the report that there is another proposed supermarket development in that area which has been a bone of contention for a long time personally I think it 's a good problem to have I think competition is good large investments have been coming into greater shipping in as we all know with solar and with some Bunnings with a whole bunch of things so they need to be managed and that 's our job we certainly don 't want to draw people away from the CBD by having too many competitive things on the outskirts of town and I think that can resolve to compromise with the applicant to make sure that they have an appropriate development in that space Thank You councillor summer anyone like to speak against the motion anyone like to speak to the motion with the blind down please Hey keep it out so for the council like to speak to the motion Council Houseman you think thank you madam mayor obviously as a report indicates this

the RAM we 've seen we 've seen why nawara don 't worry we 've we 've seen a variety of layout plans have been submitted and they 're all documented in the in the report and we 've also know from the report that our officers have been participating in compulsory conferences at Bukit to try and come up with an acceptable proposal it doesn 't negate any of the other discussions around the planning seem amendments and whatever what this does is provide some that does occur on this site it will be supported in this format subject to another range of issues particularly the 173 agreement and that

better how we can set up resources better and will eventually work its way down through every sport this is the first of two we 're dealing with tonight and there 's gonna be a lot more sports done during the course the unit 's it 's about health policy of getting people back into sport getting them off the couch excetera of the more opportunities we can put out there for people to play sport in this particular case cricket the better off we all are especially those people are getting off the couch and as we look around a few councils here could do is getting up the couch and running around chasing a cricket ball but yeah it 's very important we do that and this is just one example I said and trigger Pictoris being very much involved in it and will continue organization this national bodies et cetera to see where you get help tennis is one that 's undergoing a lot of pressure present and it 's important we help them out where we can Thank You counsel Paterson the council sat would

when he counts I 'd like to speak against the motion to the motion yes and I just speak to it please I know with with tennis it 's been under more pressure in a lot of the other sports and I know when we had country week here we 've had a few other tennis Hornets that 's really helped those clubs that have actually supporting visiting teams that come and play in their courts and it 's a way of raising some funds for them so it 's very much it 's not just a little grab of tennessee 's it 's a holistic approach where we can help that club as well as help the players and by doing that we can hopefully promote the game Thank You counsel Patterson anyone else like to speak to the motion any closing comments counsel summer we will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carry councils will now go to item 8.1 new shepard and art museum project costs report the recommendation is on page 20 do i have a council wishing to move a motion I need a council to move a motion please may I move the recommendation is printed on the agenda on page 20 that the council endorsed the functional design option estimate for new shepherd an art museum project of thirty nine point nine million GST exclusive as detailed in this report Thank You Council Haseman do I have a second to play a second the motion better be Thank You councillor Adam cancel Hayes would you like to speak to the motion yes thank you madam a look no doubt there will be a lot of debate discussion conjecture in the community about this project as there has been from the outset and from the outset the focus of that discussion revolved around what was suggested to be the estimated capital value of thirty four point five million dollars for this building what was glossed over motion that was adopted by counsel at the time is that the estimated capital value of thirty four point five million was subject to a range of or six particular Dodd points in that motion including the architectural design construction plans planning and building permits Victoria Park Master Plan Update governance model and transition and project timelines and milestones and of course since the moving of that motion the funding has been secured from council state government federal government and of course now having engaged the architects we have a more clearer picture of what the costs would be it would have been a far more accurate if we 're to focus back in 2015 on the fact that at that point in time the costs were thirty four point five knowing full well that business costs and construction cost escalate over time and in reality you know that it was going to be a variation although working with the architect we 're going to do everything we possibly can to reduce the costing to ensure that we maintain the the scope of the business case and ensure that we are some opportunities in here I mentioned three arms of the funding model I didn 't make comment in relation to the same foundation but at the time there was a funding model put forward of 4.5 for capital and additional eight million for ongoing support of the operational costs I think from a personal perspective there is some scope to revisit that arrangement and to ensure that whatever funding is forthcoming from the foundation we maximize that funding but we also make sure that it goes into bricks and mortar rather than the operational aspects of the building Thank You councilman council Adam would you like to speak just thank you madam mayor I think councillor hazel and has actually covered every aspect and topic of what I wish to say except that I think the key word here in the recommendation is the word estimate and that 's something that has always been in the business case and the feasibility study but it probably wasn 't well communicated as Mike councilors and by the organization as I feel it should have been so that being said it 's project increases nothing get about a four to five percent that 's a standard sort of a appreciation each year that being said I believe that figure is very close to the mark but as councillor hazel Minh rightly pointed out the designers or the architects have a very confident they could bring it in potentially under that figure so I 'm comfortable with that thank you cancer Adam what any council wish to speak against the motion councillor some are objecting again because I think that this recommendation actually sets up another potentially unrealistic expectation in the community this sort of reads that it 's the final sum when in fact we will not know how much it 's going to cost until it actually gets to tender so counselor Haslam is quite right that costs do escalate so by the time we actually have this in front of us it might potentially blow out to half that again so there 's things that we haven 't considered in the costing such as consultants but there 's so much more as well that haven 't actually been included in current Sam space any recent demolitions aren 't included in that ground rehab any external amenities like car parking we need to go back and review the whole thing and get an accurate estimate of the total cost of this project in the whole of life cost of this project personally as far as the foundation goes I 'm very disappointed that we 're moving forward on this without getting even close to what we were requesting as part of the business case and that shows again their failings of that business case which is a foundation of why this may not be a success we should not put one site we shouldn 't be turning any sides in the ground until we at least get half of what the foundation said they wouldn 't cross Meghan I argue that they should have been another figure put in which has been put into the thirty nine nine thousand and that 's completion in 2020 which is two years away so currently with a builder tomorrow yeah be still cheaper than that so I 'm happy that it 'll be built art person but I could just say doing that much good throughout town by attracting people that are professionals in their field we don 't have now and giving them time you can reserve and use the umpire people that are professors and and specialists in their fields don 't do that they want something else and if they don 't do it they won 't_''_897.5 this fast the elements haven 't do something during a day while they 're working that 's where it 's really importantly get this up to make to give our town more structure more vibrancy and more of a wholesome experience we and some of these people are complaining about it will be driving to Melbourne for a specialist appointment and they don 't realize if we had a dad seeing that specialist might have been really like hope the Shepherd because you would have been happy with the lifestyle the why it 's a part of the soul answer but it 's a part of it I know councillor some is shaking a head you can 't see that vision right but I as every counselor does we 're all concerned about costs blowouts and none of us want to do that all of us want to be really really stringent on the money that 's going to cost us and I see the biggest danger to this failing is the same foundation not coming up with the dollars that is a really really crunch time I believe because that should newly have happened the same time as a tender comes back that end will tell us exactly how much it 's going to cost us also Sam should have had most their money done by then so that 's when we 'll have the opportunity to say okay Stephanie Kelly [Music] Thank You counsel thank you for that what any council wish to speak to the motion counselor jebin Eddy just following on from Council of Paterson council hazel man I think that the the the crutch the crunch word in this is currently we have an estimate we 're not going to know the total cost until such time as tenders have been called and that 's the time I believe we 're going to be the same or agree with counsel hey someone that I think we need to look at the numbers and how that they are stacked up in relation to the foundation as well as the other commitments we have there is room there to maneuver that around I think that 's something we will probably have to do because I think the figure that was sold to the public of thirty four point five million is one that we need to stick as closely to us we possibly can thank you counts to petty would any council like to speak to motion any closing comments councilman oh you think you met Amelia look I really really welcome this report because it 's gonna focus everybody 's attention on what the real the real issues are the real issues are delivering an outstanding public project within a price range that is is both manageable and and both acceptable and I think to do that we need to on a more regular basis bring forward the information to the public in terms of how we 're advancing how this is one part of the process that ultimately the proof of the pudding is going to be when we go to a public tender process and what what that tender looks like and what variations if possible it is that we can make to that final process to ensure that we get the outcome that we actually want within within a reasonable range so I I think that some of the priorities from here are to yes I know there 's been changes at the foundation I know they 're moving in a slightly different direction but as a council we probably need to have that broader discussion with the foundation because that 's you know in some ways is the missing link in the project and that 's the area that people will focus their uncertainties on the capacity of the foundation to generate the range of dollars might as I indicated in my initial comments I think there is some scope to have discussion with the foundation to provide a degree of more flexibility around the application of their funding and I think that night with more and maybe we thought it was possible Thank You councillor hazen and we will now go to the boat all those in favor against jump please mr. man motion carries Division can we please note councils in favor sorry sorry all those in favor counsel hazel Minh Council Jeff and Eddie councillor Adams councillor Sutton councillor Patterson and councillor Keith thank you and those against councilors a month thank you councils will now go to item 8 point

was formed two years ago and has done a sterling job I believe in the last year 's Hall of Fame dinner that we had where we presented 27 sports people from Sheppard and who have competed for Australia at other Commonwealth Games Olympic Games and all represented the country at the elite level the function that we had on that night was probably as good as I 've ever have any of ever attended in

Belinda corner as I mentioned the men interactive and team leader healthy communities and one representative from belly sport and the members that would despite what we were about to vote on to this

council Patterson would you like to speak to the motion yes there is some very passionate people on that committee and I 'd like to welcome learner young along and it 's great that she 's here because she 's dropped the every every judge at the community by about 20 years I 'd suggest but there 's a lot of experience in there which is very important and one of our big jobs coming up is to find a home for the for the ward so that 's coming up and Thank You council Patterson what any council like to speak against the motion any council like to speak for the motion yes madam me I just like seeing them speak to the motion and actually mention the names that are on this recommendation the motion is about appointing the points is appointing to five following community members the Sports Hall of Fame so I 'd like to welcome Darrell butcher Ian Fitzsimmons don 't kill God which have already been on there you know Margo Cossack the names of the people that we will be continuing on Thank You counselor where any council like to speak to the motion any closing comments council jibin idea I 'm just following on from councillor Patterson I think one of their next tasks is to ensure that we publicly show the recognition towards these 27 sports people now we 've had some magnificent plaques made up and flags for each of the individual recipients and I think it 's very important that we continue on with this work and sure that we can appropriately placed those items where the majority of the public can see them now so Jeff and Eddie and also like to thank councillor Patterson and councillor Jeff Nettie for your contribution to this committee we will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carry councils will now go to item 8.3 greater Sheppard and Public Health Plan Update on page 29 and the recommendation is on page 30 what accounts are like to move a motion happily move the recommendation as printed on page 30 thank you madam mayor the council note Health strategic plan Thank You council someone do I have a seconder please virginity would you like to speak to the motion counsel someone I thank you madam mayor but I think we can underestimate the importance of this plan because it 's an opportunity to drive real sociological change in this city as Dennis use the word holistic I 'm going to use that as well because being healthy is more than just the absence of disease as stated by the World Health Organization as an as an example of that it 's a bit of a generalization of course but where you live largely determines the outcomes of your life if you were born disadvantaged you 're more likely to smoke be obese to die earlier be less educated and it sounds awful but that is an actual fact obviously not true for everybody and if you are more advantaged you would have a longer life you would be healthier and council has a part to play in this because we have a funds that is supposed to go towards public infrastructure and that is one of the things such as simple things like that can actually make all of our city healthier than we 're actually seeing it right now we are partnering with RMIT who 's doing a study to find out where we need the most improvement as part of a livability audit audits being funded by state government for the tune of 30 which is really exciting because we 're not actually going to know where to make these inroads unless we can map out what needs to be done so already we 've looked at childhood obesity which is not great we 've looked at social disadvantage we 've looked at we 've partnered with big roads trying to find out more about public transport and we would really like to make some changes so that this community is equitable and healthy Thank You councillor summer council jaboney would you like to speak to the motion I concur with though the words councillors summer has already just given us but also find it very interesting that whenever she talks about healthy lifestyles obesity smoking she 's always sitting beside me and I 'm but anyway thank you counts to Bonetti what any counter like to speak against the motion for the motion any closing comments counselor someone okay

emotion answer Patterson what would you like to move the motion on page counter to second the motion please kennedy councilperson would you like to speak to motion yes quickly unit 8 actuals are going very well it 's thirty four point two four against the forecast thirty two a lot of that will fall all the ways we 're closer to the end of the financial year it 'll balance out and sort of end up spot on capital words are going very well there 's forty 0.44 percentage of our capital works to spend and these equipment of sixty point seven two to be spent which is already committed so that will continue and i might have missed something so i 'd like to hand on that welcome crystallize well thank you i thanks madam mayor and council of Patterson did a sterling job so it 's not too much more than I 'll just there 's a couple of the variances on the stoplight report around statutory fees and charges that are showing is being down at the moment that 's largely related to building regulatory fees the building inspections in the like they typically tile off a little bit towards the end of the calendar year in the beginning of the Christmas break so we 're expecting that will normalized by the year end likewise with employee costs we 're showing an unfavorable variance their the activity in the active living space particularly around aqua moves and the outdoor activities we typically put on more staff to run those give tis for the community over the summer period all of those will normalize by year-end is what we 're expecting this point in time ties all council geminated you would you like to speak to the patterson and mr. total of he said but I 'm quite astounded they 're amazed actually council counselor Patterson 's knowledge and his ability to read the financial reports I think the only job in that you can see Jeff and Eddie what any council like to seek against the motion many council like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor Patterson thank you thank you very much for that we will now go to the vote but those in favor against motion carry councils will now go to item 9.2 2017 2018 quarter to forecast review on page 45 the recommendation also on page 45 with a counter like to move the motion I 'll move that motion on page 45 that the council will adopt forecast review Thank You council Adam do I have a second to please cancer Sutton Council Adam would you like to speak to the motion I won 't be so bold as councillor Patterson to attempt to explain the detail of this although having said that said quite seriously I think it is oh it 's an obligation of council to fully understand the financials and as much as we don 't and we probably should actually present them as councillors to the council I think it 's just the accounting jargon that the mr. tarzo is more familiar with is the reason why we usually turn to him and that 's a great segue for me to turning to mr. him to give us a more detailed representation of that recommendation Thank You counsel thank you mr. todson Thank You Marion councils a second forecast review the financial year and it 's picking up some changes in actuals that we didn 't anticipate through when we did pass the original budget in June last year having said that the changes aren 't significant in the main in the income normal operating revenue but the bulk of the 1.2 million dollars change in the the bottom line on the income statement relates to an increase in the donated assets that we receive from developers for the new subdivisions and the road assets and those sorts of things that get contributed to us and recognized as income so of that 1.2 million that changed 1,000,000 if that is represented by that amount the capital budget is where the bulk of the changes happened at this stage of the year where we pick up some Anders and overs if you like in some of the projects that reach completion or need some additional work on them and those projects are identified in detail in the the reports that you 've got in front of you that the the biggest one is a decrease in the expenditure on cosgrove so we 've deferred some of the big expenditure on the cosgrove freed landfill development to next financial year that equates to a decrease of about two million dollars the other projects that are increasing so offsetting some of that that decrease some works some other minor projects some you know Wells food Street seven creeks estate and some works at the runway that have all contributed to a net increase of seven hundred and sixty thousand dollars on the capital expenditure all of this together has minimal impact on councils in quiddity and its other financial ratios so we 're in a fairly good forecast position based on this review Thank You councillor sorry Thank You mr. Thal they can only give you any time certainly councillor something would you like to speak to the motion many counts you like to speak against the motion really counts I 'd like to speak to the motion I just like to take the opportunity to it 's been harder for counselors and staff this year with a different rating system we introduced so it 's put our figures out from year to year years time but during the course of the year a lot of the rating money is coming in a bit earlier and that is not to get the money and it 's how we get think Restonic since it was very little 't made any provisions full rates getting into February now that currently there 's a rating strategy out that we 're looking for input from our ratepayers to see if they 're happy with they 've done that way or not so I 'd encourage anyone that 's out there has a thought on it please get your thoughts into us the wrong strategy we 'll be deciding in the next few months whether we go back to the White House or stick with his website that 's what makes it a bit difficult compare you know this quarter for last quarter incomes different Thank You councillor Patterson but any council like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor Adam we 'll go to the vote all in favor against motion caring councils will now go to item 9.3 exercise of delegations policy on page 48 the recommendation is also on page 48 what accounts are like to move a motion counsel Jeff and Eddie the recommendation on page 48 and which is that the council adopt the exercise of delegations policy 37 point pol to version 2.1 seconder please councillors I 'm a councillor Jeff and Eddie would you like to speak to the motion this is basically made me a amendment to our existing delegations Authority where 's a couple of months ago we increased the CEOs delegated authority from 400,000 to 500,000 and that needs to be reflected in the policy Thank You counsel to Bonetti councils summer would you like to speak to the motion that 's pretty much a nutshell of what this is about there 's just a very minor change minor in terms of the alterations to the delegations policy I 'll just flag that we can still make changes at any time to the delegations policy even before the major review which is six months after the 2020 election but as it stands we had resolved to increase the delegation so we had to change the document counts a summer many council wish to speak against the motion when any council like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor jeff an idiom self-explanatory about of me you will now go to the vote those in favor against motion street bus interchange concept plan January 2018 endorsed and released for public consultation on page 50 the recommendation is on page 51 what accounts are like to move a motion cancel summer happy to move the recommendation as printed on page 51 Thank You council summer do I have a seconder please Anne Simon council summer would you like to speak to the motion Thank You motivate this is basically just a draft concept plan or a bus interchange at Nixon Street and the reason that we 're doing this is because way back when we were talking about Andrew fairly Avenue we did some traffic studies and it turned out that it 's quite dangerous around that area at school drop off a knock off times and also when work finishes so it was listed as an urgent problem back then and now we 're taking some action to correct that we want to go ahead with the upgrades to that intersection but there is the complication of the bus stop which needs to be moved prior to doing anything so I think it 's good foresight that we go ahead we 're repurposing GV link funds are proposing to for the purpose of these and it 's a 2.25 million dollar investment putting kids at risk isn 't something that we like to do so if a problem is flagged we can go ahead and try and fix it the super school came up is a question do we really need to move a bus stop when there 's a super school coming but we can 't wait forever we don 't know when that 's going to be built so we need to just go ahead and do what we can now Thank You Council summer council Haseman would you like to speak to the mushrooms music look the the upgrade of the intersection balaclava Road horde in the street you Dookie Road Burnie Road necessitates the existing bus interchange being being moved and the northern side of Nixon Street between Harold and skåne Street has been identified as the the appropriate location now of course that 's all subject to a consultation process that people who are potentially impacted residents in that nearby areas will be council meeting that feedback will be taken into account before a final decision is made Thank You council Haseman but any County like to speak against a motion to the motion any closing comments counselor summer will now go to the vote all in favor against motion carries councils will now go to item 10.2 draft when Gary Rhoden Ford Road Shepard and feasibility study design report 2018 endorsed and released for public consultation on page 60 and the recommendation is on page 62 what a counter like to move a motion cancelling little me councillor Patterson thank you it would you like to me I 'd like to move the recommendation on page 62 thank you very much do I have a seconder please councillors summer council Patterson would you like to speak to the motion yes there 's a lot of people been very concerned about this there 's a lot of work being put on it the this is a draft that 's been released to the public for food of eight weeks they will all receive a copy of the plan and what we 're looking look at it to see if they can make any suggestions what they think of it and then it will come back to Council during that time there will be consultation with groups they can come and meet with counselors council whatever they want we 're trying to find an end to this problem and we believe that there 's a problem is not about that it needs a road like this now and this is before there 's a bypass so something needs to be done and this we believe is the best option so we 're putting it out for all the people out that way to have a look at it and see what they think and make submissions to council it 's going to have to go there I you know as council I know I 'll speak for every council he would looked at different spots where that bypass could potentially go and the only only feasible one I could see was through the governor and I went after speaking to councilor to variously I went for a drive out through there and measured it enough kilometers which is the area we 're talking about if we were to encourage the bypass to go through some government it 's an extra it 's 13 closer so it 's ten and a half gauge longer we will not get anyone in a track or a car or even to go that extra distance I 'll go straight down there so it 's very important that we get it right so I was quite surprised at the distance differential in the two option so yes I 'll encourage everyone to get a copy of it have a look heavy meetings whatever going to do and then make submissions council will be available all the way through it for discussion and to help any way we can and please have a good look at it and get back to us Thank You councillor Paterson councillor summer would you like to speak to the motion the mayor I just want to stress it this is this is just a draft yeah I know myself and many other people have been contacted in regards to this plan and I would chance to be heard so we need you to have a good look at it like councillor Patterson said and come back to us with the right process and let us know what you 're thinking now there 's no doubt we do need a bypass but unlike councillor Patterson I don 't believe it necessarily has to be there it 's going to take a very long time for the state to actually come back with 260 million dollars for stage 1 I believe and if counsel and councillors and officers deem the social and amenity risk to be too high we would have to go back out and look for other options so please get your submissions in we do need a bypass it will reduce congestion and improve safety in the middle of the CBD it 'll probably boost small businesses and and have a healthier more functional CBD but it 's not our intention to intentionally go out and force all of those problems onto a residential area either so this has always been the identified site but it can change Thank You council summer but this thing 's mad at me I don 't know whether I 'm really speaking against the motion I do object to the point one endorse the draft feasibility study design report I 'm quite happy to release the draft and note the council 's officers report or any feedback but endorsing it is it exactly that endorsing it and in reference to councillor Patterson 's comments that think all councils are fleed unanimous in their thoughts on this particular option we 've had extensive briefings on this and the alternative options were put and they were discussed in some detail I think we need more detailed exploration on those other options so I 'm quite happy to do the points on three I won 't move in a mentor even try to I 'm just making my objection to that point one Thank You councillor Adam Burnie counsel wish to speak for the motion Council germanity I do support the recommendation to allow residents of Ford grow to access the draft report and I 'll implore them to take the time to read the draft in detail and it affected and can understand their concerns from a pure logic position is for drove the most logical route to take for a bypass yes it is is for Road the messed up best this is the most economical option available all year cities but my concern is the development of Ford Road since 2006 trader Shepherd in 2030 strategy since that time we 've seen the expansion of Hawkins Heights developments the Conley Park Estate establishment that recently commenced vines residential development and the new aged care facility on the corner of Ford and Bernie Road and the new I believe proposed residents will develop an on the corner of Ford Road and doors Road considerable development in a short period of time is a bypass road conducive to this residential development well I 'm not sure at this point it 's now to the residents of the area to advise us councillors of their feedback so we can consider their their feedback at the exploration of the public comment period Thank You councillor chip and Eddie any council wish to speak to the motion but I object to the particular plan I don 't really believe that it 's the right spot to have a a freeway which is what it will be going through a residential area and as Bruce pointed out it has been built up quite a bit since 2006 and whether it 's not I don 't really believe it 's the right place we have to look at another option I know we 've had that on the table and everybody and the council staffer said well we can 't do it here we can 't do it there but I really believe that we have to start looking for something else other than Ford Road verification met a man would councillor Sutton like to move an amendment that 's 0.2 and 3 be accepted what 'd you like to clarify what that Amendment is please trust the table can I just clarify the word endorse when the organization puts out a document for community consultation and a significant document like this we don 't put a document out unless it is an important document we need to get it right so it needs number of people a number of objectives and a number of interested parties it needs to have a document of a certain status and that 's the reason why that word is there so any council like to speak to the motion I guess mad at me very very briefly look the purpose of tonight is to simply release the documentation out for public comment it wouldn 't be my intention to debate the pros and cons merits or otherwise at Ford Road I think we 're best leaving that to the residents to come back and tell us their thoughts and views of the world before we reach any conclusive type decision so I 'm more than happy for it to go out and more than happy to hear the community 's comments Thank You council hazel Minh but any council wish to speak to the motion any closing comments ouncer Patterson are you select make a couple please regarding councillor Adams comments about Council 's happy to look at it I was referring to and I believe I said I could be wrong for do apologize the council weren 't close who Ford Rhodes enemy right we had a look around and everything else and that 's what I 've been doing I 'm surprised to the councillor Sutton 's comment that there 's no other option let 's look at it well that 's all we 've been doing for six months we 've been looking for other options the only viable option I could see which we can get minutes when you measure it it 's not an option so it 's councillor hazel and said we 're putting it out there and we won 't comment back so King uranium get out there and have a little bit and see if you happy with it or you 're not happy with it and make your submissions and then we 'll discuss it and make a decision Thank You councillor Paterson will now go to the vote fill those in favor against motion carried can we please note those in favor councillor Haseman councillor summer council jebin Eddy councillor Patterson and council O 'Keefe those against councillor Adams and councillor Sutton as we will now go for solar farm at six point in ten Ferguson rotatory East in relation to items 10.3 ten point four ten point five and ten point six at its ordinary council meeting on the 21st of November 2017 the council resolved to instruct the chief executive officer to write to the Minister for planning requesting that the Minister for planning become the decision-maker in relation to these applications by letter dated the 13th of February 2018 the Minister of Planning has now given notice that the Minister has agreed to the council 's request under the section ninety-seven C of the Planning and Environment action 1987 accordingly the Minister is now the decision-maker for these applications the current recommendations for items 10.3 ten point four ten point five and ten point six are therefore no longer applicable council offices have preferred prepared alternative recommendations and starting with item ten point three as mentioned this alternative recommendation is shown on the screen should be up on the screen what accounts are like to move a motion so that council jeben ' ad on the screen Thank You councillor Jeff Neddie do I Council Jeff Nene would you like to speak to the motion we as councillors felt that we didn 't have the necessary expertise nor knowledge to be able to conclusively make a decision on this because there are so many difference schools of thought in relation to solar farms but not a lot of evidence to back up several declines so what we felt as a council was that we would refer to the minister who has the staff and the knowledge and capabilities to be able to determine what we would like to see is a statewide policy or on solar farms which would guide all municipalities as to when they receive applications such as what we have and I think this is probably the best and fairest way for all concerned Thank You councillor jebin any council Adam would you like to speak to the motion yes thanks Madame mayor yes I fully agree with councilor Giovannetti this is important issue we obviously as a municipality encourage any sort of new industry to our regions for the obvious reasons of there is I think we should be at not the country having said that there 's some valid concerns both community members and we 've been privy to many of them through several meetings with objectors the point is as counselor Jim Haley clearly pointed out I don 't think we 've had the time we don 't have the knowledge expertise or the resources to gain that expertise it sufficient time to make a decision on this now the minister is taking this on board no doubt as councilor Jim here also pointed out they do have the resources the expert advised to either confirm or debunk or refute any of the claims made by the objectors as I said or to confirm them to give us a better idea in it place us in a better position to well if you stage we won 't be voting on it it 'll be in the hands of the government at the end of the day by the panel so I 'm looking forward to them actually producing a factual response to the objections also well I 'm looking forward to the objectors also putting forward their case of experts which I don 't claim to be in this field I don 't think any other counsel claims to it as well I think that 's the actual best result we could have hoped for so let 's hope the correct decision he 's made ultimately Thank You councillor Adam but any council like to speak against the motion to the motion Kancil summer I think it 's responsible what the ministers done they did follow through on what we 'd ask them to do before it 's just renewable energy in general is something that we 're not quite on the front foot with I know that the state government are driving this they 've been set a target of renewables and they 're sort of thrusted onto us to make a decision and as we 've heard not one of us are privy to the ins and outs of solar panels so we were really struggling with this conflicting use with irrigated farmland versus renewable energy technically still a farm but our irrigated land could be diminished somewhat so potentially what could come out of this 've got in New South Wales directing councils on how to make these sorts of decisions and it could be up to us to try and identify some kind of potential site that these areas would be more appropriate for I know they want to be near the grid but as we 've heard there 's a multi multi-million dollar project so any additional lines under the grounds potentially could be a negligible cost for them we could need to look at it closely and not just shunted off to the Minister this issue is not over and I 'm keen to see what the minister decides Thank You councillor summer but any council wish to speak to the motion three council especially councillor summer what we 're really looking for is a statewide policy document that when it 's done someone comes to us with proposal we can look it up well complain and say yes it makes you smoochy so you have to do that we don 't have to go down the road of trying make decisions about irrigated land that there 's a conscious policy statewide the developers are happy if one knows where they going and that 's what we need and they 're in most of the industries during wind farms the what one Victoria for wind farm there 's one wind farm onic and there 's gonna be a heap of solar farm so I 've got to do it has to happen and I think another thing would cancel Germany was not Kriegel the counselors and he was right that we didn 't have the expertise of knowledge but it 's not actually there because you have both sides of the argument come in with something off the internet and I mean both aspects of it you know I said it 's not defined or even on the internet studies that have been done the too vague you can pick them to go each way whichever way you want so we need the state government has a lot more resources of us to develop a policy and then we 're more than happy to stick with it Thank You councillor Paterson what any council wish to speak to the motion councilmen sorry new technologies in recent years whether the telecommunications towers or wind farms that the government has responded with the development of appropriate guidelines for their installation if she 's ran buffer zones and with all those new technologies as usually as well comes forward opposition opposition that may be made with the best of intentions not necessarily of the best of science and so it really does need government to establish some firm guidelines to enable local government to make informed decisions and I think in relation to this region where obviously have concerns about the impact on viable land that is capable of being irrigated irrigated agriculture is still the backbone of this region and we need to ensure that whatever guidelines come forward that that irrigated agriculture is protected into the future so maybe that 's part of the aspect that our participation we 're not gonna be a silent partner in this panel process we 're going to be there we 're going to be an active participant to try and achieve guidelines that yes they will be state guidelines but they 're also going to be region and there 's issues in there that we need to be very cautious and very of wary about its the alienation of agricultural land and the alienation and loss of the water associated with it that 's important to this region so maybe one of the things that we could look at is similar to the guidelines developed in the United Kingdom where there particulars owns that identify land where you can have a solar farm but equally as well as they identify important agricultural land whether just simply a prohibited use and that might be an aspect that would provide a degree of comfort and degree of certainty both for applicants who want to invest in this region but also for our residents and that who wish to maintain their agricultural lifestyle Thank You councilman but any council wish to speak to the motion I can 't say certain I thoroughly agree with what chris has said in this area we need to protect our irrigated agriculture and protect all the land that can be irrigated because without that we wouldn 't have our project I would know we wouldn 't have the water would go because they 'd be sold off so I just think that is a most important thing is to protect the irrigated agricultural viable farming land Thank You counsel Sutton I think all councils have actually spoke to the motion so any closing comments council urbanity this process statement is delivered by government Thank You council Japan Eddie will now go to the vote for those in favor against motion carrying so councillors we now go to item 10.4 use and develop 235 Victoria Road Telugu open for a

page thank you mr. Harriet what a cancer like to me a motion that 's the needs to move a motion I 'll move the motion madam wave Thank You councillor jebin Eddie do I have a would you like to speak to the motion we 've seen a few contentious issues on the on the books this month and it 's nice to know that I 've had the opportunity to move the motion on most of them which I think my fellow councillors for that there 's been a number of issues relating to this medical center which is to be located in in grime Street just west of the inn it 's like kindergarten or high school on Vernie road our planners have listed to meet this concerns obviously from the residents in that area writing to drainage parking and also a number of other things as well and also conflict of interest in relation to councillor do all of it often clearly state that council Abdullah was obviously naughty tonight and she 's had no involvement in any of these discussions that have come before councillors prior to this decision tonight in relation to drainage that issue has been attended to by council planning staff there is going to be a 600 mill drain across the front of the property to drain all 150 mm pipe that will not increase the flood water going into Graham Street it may even reduce some of it parking is always going to be issuing drivers we know there 's there 's no attitude that we 've got two large hospitals day near two medical centers council of actually negotiated with the developer to have an additional 21 parking spots available albeit they we 'll be on Reville Reville thank you I was 20 another turbid gravels you I believe that the Medical Center itself hopefully we 'll bring you new specialists into the town which will enable residents of Shepard and to obtain services that they previously have had to go elsewhere for I don 't think I can say much else made of me Thank You counsel Japan any counselor how does somebody like to speak to the motion the probably the most important ones was parking they legally will ride 51 parks and they are providing 72 or 71 or something like that so they 're in excess of what they need to do which will help that area and some people were concerned think they can just take them away soon as I get there by car the permit is for 71 parks if they remove 20 parks they breach of their permit I can 't operate so I 'm sure if you want to be under that the other one I had some concern which was the removal of parking on the north side of grain Street opposite I couldn 't see any rationale behind that but after speaking to our staff and even the rationale I come up with was different to this probably there is a turning lane or turning into the front of the building on the right-hand side heading east down grain street there for car coming up behind will deviate around to the left of that which will approach on the parking bay right so therefore it 'll disrupt the flow of traffic which I thought will say both you know they need a park at the front beam hindsight that park would be a very dangerous place to be he 's gonna have cars cutting through there all the time so I think there 's only for them but they do have got two driveways and I think you know it is best safety wise if that I wasn 't looking at putting women in to remove that that I 'm not Thank You counsel Patterson what any counsel we should speak against the motion counsel for summer this is a difficult one for me to argue because it does seem to be in line with our policies and I guess it 's more of a protest vote because of parking in that area now it is a problem and I think it 's been largely overlooked we 've had major developments there already we see people lined up along the street I used to live in that area so I 've seen it firsthand we 're going to have a larger Hospital potential private hospital there 's there 's kindergartens it 's actually becoming quite build up but we can 't keep allowing people to park on the streets without offering them other options it 's a great development it will bring professionals to the town hopefully and it will also increase the economy of stress that it is part of our policy that they only provide 50 sites if this was in the CBD they 'd be provided they 'd be required to have five parks per clinician but because it 's not actually in that zone they 're only required to have five for the first clinician and three thereafter but even with that the additional 21 parking spaces in the overflow area are more than more than make up for that so I 'll stress also that as councillor Patterson said they will be in breach of their permit if they remove that overflow parking because it is written there that would have to be removed by another decision and then there 's another opportunity for people to make a submission then on an object about whether or those 21 parking spaces will be removed so whether we if this went to v-cut I can 't imagine that we 'd be successful but I do think that we require some kind of parking over overlay in that area before we continue to accept these permits Thank You counselor summer with any council I am speaking in support of the motion although I do feel for the residents directly as canceled peasants said these are the residents on the northern side of Graham Street I mean we 're all we all get used to actually just pulling up our vehicles in front of our houses and sometimes parking so I 'm not sorry I do feel for them but if you look at the photographs or the council 's have them in their in their agendas and a through the public gallery you 'll you 'll notice who is a car park in the photograph right there and it 's quite plain to see if there were cars per minute to be parked there it would create an absolute safety issue so unfortunately those three or four car parks I might be permitted they have vehicles in them and we 'll move ahead Thank You councillor Adam Cloney councillor wish to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor Bernardin okay we 'll go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried councils we now go to item 10.8 planning permit for dog breeding boarding on page 193 in relation to item 10.8 I wish to advise that as a 30 today council were advised that a failure to determine application has been lodged vk therefore council cannot now decide on this permit council officers have prepared an alternative recommendation which is now displayed on the screen but accounts are like to move a motion councillor summer as printed on the screen Thank You Council summer do I have a seconder please council sutton council summer would you like to speak to the motion i 'd like to point out that we were actually going to refuse the permit which is pleasing it received 62 objections so obviously the issue of puppy farms is something that is quite strong in the community it 's had questions around whether it was overcrowding ethics there was a potential change to the law coming up soon which would make it 's a bit ridiculous to allow something that 's allows something now and then be in breach of that law in in a very short amount of time state government we 're going to a failure to determine because it 's taken us more than 60 days to reach this conclusion which is disappointing and actually supports perhaps the idea of a January meeting I actually support that 100% it 's still a position to object so we 're going to go there and continue to argue the point Thank You counsel summer council assassin would you like to make a comment yes I just like to state that I would object to this application to I don 't believe it 's compatible with the nearby land we don 't know what the amenity impacts would be the operative scale of the operation is far too large for a puppy farm efforts of you to be able to keep it neat and tidy and clean etc so I 'm quite happy to object to it and I 'm quite very happy that it 's going to be cat Thank You counsel many council wish to speak against the motion would any council like to speak to the motion accounts my Patterson oh yes I 'd love to speak to it down basically Oscar 's 14th of April and Oscar 's law is a law that stops puppy farms with excessive ten dogs operational so I can see this going to v-cut if this proponent decides to do that Oh imagine it 'll be at least as some counselor Hosemann would say it 's probably going to be September before they get to VCAT that law be already in and not going ahead which I 'm happy to had to happen this particular I believe had a permit that came previously he couldn 't stick to that thing and they are trying to go 200 so I have no no thoughts it 's very basic and clear what council should do and the minister about the administer the rule Thank You councillor Patterson and you should yes anyone else like to speak to the motion thank you it 's it 's rather unusual that the the council gets taken to VK for non determination of an issue but in reading the report and reading between the lines perhaps that there 's been occasion requesting of additional information that hasn 't been forthcoming so clearly that at the the very last minute have taken this step of going to VK and it 's councillor Patterson points out the legislation is about to change so I 'm a bit of a loss to understand why you 'd venture off to VCAT when you won 't get to be kept before the legislation changes and it 'll be dealt with under the revised legislation whereas Oscar 's laura 's was pointed out so the the issue at at VCAT that does concern me with either the approach and the tactic that the applicants have made is that it does expose the council to the potential of costs at VCAT but given the circumstances and given the the nature of the application and the serious potential for conflict with future legislation that 's a cost I 'm prepared to wear Thank You council Haysom and really council wish to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor

footpaths pools buildings and a whole lot more so it does stand to reason that we should have a strong asset management policy this particular policy incorporates broad principles from state and

our thief jumped in first the recommendation contained on page 12 points to recommendation thank you Joe have a second to him thank you you can see Jeff and Eddie Council is a very would you like to speak to the motion thank you madam mayor look the recommendation self-explanatory as we all know community plans as a cornerstone of any small community in Duke is no exception the Dukie people are very active in a lot of respects councillor from Tottori staying that it 's the jewel in the crown well I can honestly say that Duke is a jewel in the crown because it has a list of fantastic features going forward and I 'd like to congratulate the Dukie people for their community plan councillor Jeff and Eddie would you like to speak to us very councillor Adam and I had the opportunity to participate in the community plan the community consultation phase of it out of Dookie and I can honestly say that there was quite a considerable amount of interest from a wide range of community members I think the previous two motions that we have moved actually fit in very nicely with the community plan because one of the recommendations is identify the development constraints for the Dukie Township and support future rejoining proposals to increase the supply of residential zone Lane which we 've just currently done I think it 's great that we 're able to move the Dukie community upwards and onwards because I think that as councillor or as Vera said the gradual community out there and they do would a candy council like to speak against the motion what any council like to speak for the motion any closing comments councillors I very sorry boys I just wanted to congratulate everyone who was involved in this plan dick he 's not huge but it 's enormous in terms of heart and the people who live there are so engaged and I know that everyone who was involved in this plan really do care about their municipality so for us to come forward and say what do you need is a real it 's a real bottom-up achievement because they 're the ones who are empowered to move forward with what they would like their town to look like what we 've done recently was open a Dukie youth spot and that was a significant investment for the youth of Dukie and one of the actions that have been identified amongst many is a painting or art projection on the old silo there which I think would be magnificent so hopefully we can move along with some of these Thank You Council summer what any council like to speak by sea the one on is identifying was the the Solarize but also go very friendly

1686 committee under the Local Government Act and members can be appointed or removed by a formal resolution of council we do acknowledge that being casey who has been a member of this committee has attempted their resignation and so formally the council needs to rescind her membership at the same time though we do really acknowledge the contribution she 's made to like to speak to the motion soldiers not to say that yank has done a wonderful job and we like to thank her for her commitment to this committee over hurt on me Thank You council sutton but any council like to speak against the motion any council like to speak for the motion any closing comment I 'm sorry do we have okay missing your answer just um I thought perhaps counselor Pattinson was go mentioned about the contribution volunteers make to our society and this is one example of someone who 's volunteered their time to help us come to help us progress things that would have otherwise cost a lot of money so it 's really great to see Thank You counsel somehow anyone else like to speak to the motion also has any closing comments we 'll now go to the boat those in favor against motion carried as we now go to item 8.3 community planning action plan summary 2007 sorry 2017 we get the right here there there is a recommendation on page 12 sorry 22 the wrong number here what accounts are like like to me half of the motion recommendation page 22 and I will reluctantly short note the community plan action packs community plan action plans update 2017 these knowledge a valuable contribution the community plan steering committees and water community members have made throughout the action plan review process Thank You councillor Patterson do I have a seconder please councillor Jeff and Eddie councillor Patterson would you like to speak to the motion yes this has been one real success story from counsels perspective I believe does the community plan steering committees it gives us the actual small communities their own voice it 's very hard from the councilors sit back and for instance find out what Dukie want unless there is a representative group from two key telling us we don 't rely on the old squeaky wheel from Dukie saying you need to do this you need to do that we 'd like to hear it from a group that represents the ratepayers of duty and that 's what these community steering plans are and I 've worked very well the reviews have been done they 've been 's only a guess but there 's continued to grow and Toby support it and it 's a great thing Thank You council Patterson councillor chip Nettie would you like to speak to the motion Council Patterson pretty much covered at all but I just like to say that I 've been involved in a couple of the community plan consultation processes Murchison and Duke you know I think it 's fantastic how the local community as a whole get behind this particular concept because there 's their opportunity to have input into what happens in their towns and I congratulate all those people that are involved in the 17 of the committees that we have because without their help and support a lot of the action that is happening in their towns wouldn 't happen because we wouldn 't know about it Thank You councillor Geoff Nettie would any council like to speak against the motion or any counter like to speak for the motion Council summer I would like to congratulate the community department I know it wouldn 't be very easy to facilitate mutually beneficial outcomes across there 's Orient 's successfully so any regional council out there who is not doing a community plan action strategy I 'd be very surprised in whether they could actually offer these small towns the attention that they deserve he counts for summer but any council like to speak to the motion and for Patterson any closing comments to pick one as you look at the agenda and see the small towns there but as actually has developed to a neighborhood plan and that is now working very well and for instance a group like let me think Ford Road could organize their own a whole community plan and look at things they want done out there even though we know there 's probably a couple things they do like done but it is a community it doesn 't have to be a town it can be a just an area st. George 's Road or one that are up and running and they 're pushing to get their Street developed which we support with parking in the middle et cetera to make the little area a better area for Kyla Lakes view their barbecues the other night again that 's not a town that 's a small part of a very our town and they have a committee and they decide what they like done in that area so that 's what counts wants to hear about so we can actually support our community in what they want not what someone 's telling them they want if you can throw it thank you Thank You council Patterson we will now go to the boat those in favor against motion carry Kansas will now go to item 8.4 draft community safety strategy 2018 to 2021 endorsement and approval for public exhibition there is a mecha mendacious on page 29 what accounts are like to move a motion councilors Avari to move the recommendation contained on page 29 is the motion that the Council endorsed two drafts community safety strategy to 1821 for public exhibition from 22 December this year under 5th of February inviting submissions from the community and key stakeholders Thank You councils of our do I have a seconder please councillor Adams cancel all the variable you like this cornerstone of this strategy is community safety safety of the people that live in Greater Shepperton and the question that 's raised through the strategy is how can council increase the safety of our community and as an example the safer City camera network which is up and running which is very been very successful and continues to be there 's other aspects of the currently the family violence side of things where council throwing its support behind that and the whole purpose of this exercise is to put the strategy out for public exhibition and comment and I invite members of the community to put in their submissions because without their submissions the current action any plans or make decisions in relation to it Thank You council also varied council Adam would you like to speak to the motion I think you met him me I think councillor hour is very well thank you but anyone like to speak against the motion when any council like to speak for the motion any closing comments councillors Avari will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carried financial report there 's a recommendation on page 34 what a council like to move a motion you cancel Patterson do I have a seconder please Thank You Council as a very council I 'd like to speak to the motion is in an annoying body our finance director to give us a in brief sorry a detail summary but a few points that I 'd like to highlight basically it 's been a not a difficult year but it 's hard to compare a year or new month-on-month with a new concept of a lot of the rates have come in earlier so that has been a bit more difficult to to monitor also there 's been a blowout with our superannuation which I 'll get asked crystal to give us a a bit of a some details about that it 's to do with having to pay too early so it 's thrown a year out you will end up a right I believe but the months are out and one that all councilors I really do concentrate on a lot is the capital works budget this we and today to have only used ten point eight five but this time last year we 've done a news 8.1 so we 're always slow off the mark with tendering process as you said other than it really rolls in so I would now like to thank you counselor Patterson through them the mayor to councillors just to address that issue around the the superannuation payment that it was an early early payment it wasn 't scheduled to happen until a month or so after when we made the payment they invoiced us early on that one combined with that and you 'll see on the second page of the report in your attachments the employee cost showing an unfavorable valve balance and that 's due to that superannuation payment and some labor costs that have hit us earlier than expected in terms of casual laborer particularly in the active living area where we 've got a lot of outdoor activity in summer and that sort of thing but you will note in that report that that will correct itself by year-end so we 're not expecting that to otherwise the operating performance is running fairly well just a another point on the capital works performance and councillor Patterson is quite right we are slightly better than last year but if you look at that in percentage terms it 's 49 percent of our budget is currently committed on the capital program and that 's it against the adopted budget at the beginning of this year if you look at our projected full-year budget it 's forty six point eight two percent so that 's not bad tracking at this stage of the year we have some large contracts will commence next year on roadworks and those sorts of things that 'll kick that along quite nicely in terms of rate status we are doing better this year in in receiving our rates income and we 're sitting at forty three million dollars outstanding compared to 51 million at the same time last year a lot of that 's due to early intervention of the rates team with people that are struggling with meeting their rates commitments and arranging payment plans and a lot of people have taken the program and that 's working quite well investments at the moment are currently running at one point eight seven so almost 1.9 percent we have almost thirty two million dollars invested in cash at this point in time Thank You mr. tarzo council officer Barry would you like to speak to the motion any Council like to speak against the motion any council like to speak for the motion until the Patterson do you have any closing comments I 'll just make one comment to the people in the room that might be aware of the rationale while we did the writing strategy below we did a lot of people were getting to the a week or so before the final rate payments I hadn 't even thought about paying their rate now get himself into financial difficulty this way where there 's lots of small payments they can make it 's a lot easier for them and then they don 't get themselves into trouble and now this is the first time we 've tried it and it appears to be working well but we won 't know till go to the vote those in favor against motion carried counsels will now go to item 9.2 contracts awarded under delegation status of contracts advertised and yet to be awarded November 2017 there is a recommendation on page 36 with a counsel like to move a motion counselor summer let 's move that the council note the publicly advertised contracts awarded under delegated authority and tenders that have been advertised but not yet awarded Thank You counsel summer do I have a seconder please I have some in council summer would you like to speak to the motion speak to the motion this section of the agenda pops up every single month and I think it 's a great exercise in transparency anything over a delegated amount needs to go through Council and be ratified as a motion but all of these come underneath the delegated amount but we 're still listing them publicly so these are some that have been awarded some that are in the process of being awarded and I believe it 's not a requirement but it 's something that we do so I wanted to a tender that closed recently and that along with all the solar investment will position us as leaders in sustainability because it 's council buildings we 're being role models here there 's a public and hoping that other people will follow suit because you just can 't keep relying on the grid any longer and also I wouldn 't to draw our attention to the construction of BMX track lighting and construction of steel fabricated 8 meter BMX starts Hill which I know that the guys out there have been waiting a long time they 've done a great job whenever they have their competitions but these two capital works will attract national or even international competitors to the region and we all know that that has massive flow on effect to our economy and it should further position us as an event city and yeah yes I 'm really happy with that Thank You Council summer council house would you like to speak to amazing I think every month there 's a the publication of these contracts are waiting to be awarded awarded or evaluated and in this here that it will be funded through our capital works program we 're getting to the sharp pointy end of the year to get these projects completed and so it 's good to see a significant number of them coming forward and over time as they delivered they will then move and become part of the previous item we just discussed there 's the financial report Thank You council Haysom and what any council like to speak against the motion when you count to like to speak for the motion he goes in comments council summer we will now go to the boat those in favor against motion carried answers we now go to item 9.3 counselor representation on committees there is a recommendation on pages 39 40 and 41 what accounts are like to move a motion counselor Patterson what would you like to me thank you the motion on page don 't have a seconder please pages so pages 39 40 and thank you council person do I have a second to play councils Avari Thank You counsel Patterson would you like to speak to the motion is tourism represented on and this base is good stuff between councilors for instance I 've been on the aerodrome committee for three years now there 's lots and lots of other committees around which we all share every year we go through this process is a few new committees this year which is a called the wood burn the memorial Advisory Committee this council something 's going on and we all share the load so to speak and have an interest on we can report back the other councillors how it 's all going it 's worked very well and it certainly does show the councillors and a lot of ratepayers adversity of count the councillors job you 're out every third or fourth night at one of these committee meetings often and you know it 's very rewarding you can have an important a lot more things that you 're actually interested in and yes I highly recommend and there 's what splitted them all up and everyone 's everyone 's got their jobs to go and do for next year Thank You councillor Paterson councils the very would top that no thank you yeah any chance I 'd like to speak against the motion with any counter like to speak for the motion any closing comments councillor Patterson thank you madam and we will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carries councils will now go to item 9.4 paid parking in the central business district there is a recommendation on page 50 what accounts I like to move a motion like a nuva motion but it 's not that one it 's move option one the council resolved to provide free baton parking in the CBD of Shepparton beginning on the 1st of March for 3 months during this time is recommended a collection of data be undertaken to ascertain a success or not of this trial I have a second down thank you can seven council something would you like to speak to your motion thank you in free time parking in the CBD is necessary because the CBD of Greater shipping and is the only area that has paid parking at this stage currently the parking generates about 1.1 million and we free parking do so would be still fines so we 'll be still getting some hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines the Shepperton CBD is in decline and we 've seen valuations of the properties over the past few years decrease and if we look at the big picture if we have free time parking we should see more more shoppers back in the CBD more people in the CBD will see business confidence grow and consequently new businesses setting up this will in turn increase valuations and the rate revenue will also increase so hopefully we could have increases everywhere we know that Albury Wodonga and Wagah have free time parking in these towns are actually doing very well with lots of businesses both new and old doing very very well how can we expect the CBD to grow with new business and more people coming into the center if we continue with paid parking it is the same as inviting someone to dinner then saying that will cost you a dollar 50 for coming it is a text for coming to the CBD it is interesting to on their social media site regarding the paid parking issue so far they have had approximately 700 respondents with approximately 90 percent against paid parking I know that most people don 't like paying for parking but this survey shows that hundreds of people don 't come to the CBD because of the fact that they have to pay I also note the parking reserved revenue should only be used for parking related issues not used to prop up the budget Thank You Council something comes out and would you like to speak to the motion it will add something briefly the interesting part of this motion is the word trial I mean this has been a chronic concern in this town for many many many years I think it 's about time that we acted in one way or another and I think a trial is a best way to actually ascertain some solid data the actual detail of how will ascertain that data is yet to be revealed and I 'm sure that will happen in the next couple of months so that 's my main reason for get some solid data then we can move on and are they keep free parking or we 're back to where we were or come up with a different solution so that 's why I support the motion made it mean Thank You councillor Adams I 'd like to foreshadow a motion please madam me Thank You council summer that 's noted would any council like to speak against the motion donation is sorry could you please inform us of your poor shadow demotion council summer it 's a rather long sentence I 'll read it out that the council resolved to continue with the current paid and time restricted parking regime for the central business district and continue to pursue further technology options to ensure ease of payment fee with the exception of implementing free all-day off street parking at nixon moored and edward streets parking base Thank You council summer lady council like to speak against summers motion sorry counselor sentence evasion you can 't to like to speak for sorry would you like to speak against no cancer man cancel Haven you can go first thank you moved emotion in in three parts that have been considered again in I 'm paraphrasing now don 't be pretty close that we consider this again an issue of a trial in December we take into account the circumstances of the multi-bit car park and Kia Park Australia and also at this meeting we would consider the performance measures we would use in any particular trial so at the outset I would note that the the motion is deficient in it doesn 't meet that objective we set in November there are no performance measures coming full forward at this point which is always going to be an issue look CBD parkings been a vexed and contentious issue and continue to do so due to the diversity of opinions in my view I thought the report provided a sound basis for the recommendation that was put forward and has been highlighted by counsel a summer in her foreshadowed motion the research has been done in other regional centres is informative the studies conducted in jalan Ballarat bendigo many other places interstate and overseas and they 're easily sourced online all is referred to also in the report will increase the level of worker parking by between 15 and 20 percent but in reality in Newcastle in 2012 will actually conduct a trial at the request of local traders the congestion rate was an increase of 30 percent and the traders quickly asked for the meters to be reactivated all the research indicates to me is that there is no uniform solution to parking to traffic and each location needs to determine its own outcomes which this council is doing through the development of the movement and play strategy do in the new year this strategy will refine the parking regime and options and I 'd also add that the suggestion that councillor summer is foreshadowed is complementary to the thrust that strategy other centers are often side of this model to follow Horbury 12 months ago there the council reduced the parking in dean street their main stopping ship strip from two hours to one hour to encourage turnover in 2011 the council here went the opposite direction in fryer street moving from one to two hours to encourage longer for water and parking you 'll get a range of newspaper commentary parking has been contentious between counsel and traders for many years and earlier this year council engaged consultants to do a report on their parking situation that report recommends the introduction of paid parking in water in 2016 walker and they use cameras on vehicles to monitor the number of plates in the parking bays how they they measure it they raised a million dollars through the issuing of eight and a half thousand fines things like an exchanging all those in favor of an extension and proceed and we would note that the walker find is 118 compared to our 78 so the equivalent here would be to raise the million dollars that we would forego or part thereof is in the order of 12 and a half thousand fines per year or in the trial period they took over 3,000 fines orange it 's again contentious with council using cameras to monitor parking their CBD parking is an hour very efficient but use a backlash with orange issuing more fines and Dubbo or Bathurst combined cities parking should be considered as they with a fines capital of Western New South Wales I 'm not too sure we want to become the fines capital of northern Victoria different locations different problems different solutions unpaid parking will also be significant effect on council revenue and that revenue over the years has contributed to many CBD projects including new car parks in Fraser and Rose Street new footpaths removal overhead powerlines Street scapes trees furniture etc at a time when has some serious CBD project on the drawing board we foolhardy to forego a dedicated income stream that would help fund these projects without that income stream funding for parking enforcement and projects would fall the wall ratepayers the lengthy Community Council debate around parking resulted in a lack of strategic direct into officers which is exacerbated the problem in part we have not moved forward with new technologies providing more payment options nor have we invested in maintenance in decision also adversely impacts the refurbishment proposed from the multi-bit car park and the movement and play strategy will provide that strategic direction in my view the new technology some long drawn out process considered ad infinitum parking reserved funds shall be invested as soon as possible and I 've confidence that officers could implement this important change very quickly you 've given the direction from Council Thank You councillor Haseman what any council like to speak for the motion against the motion councillor summer I 've got a we 've had a lot of commentary we 've gone over and over these I 'm really pleased it 's come to a head at a meeting I 'm just not convinced that a blanket free parking trial is going to be effective at all there has been discussion on recouping a lot of our losses financially with fines like okay it 's like council hazel Minh was saying that 78 per fine and that could really impact on some of our poorest people if we crack down and there 's no leniency I mean arguably finds a less popular than the fees and the fines are what gets in the paper with people saying that their ticket wasn 't displayed if you do anything wrong you 're likely to more people to come to the CBD I don 't think that free parking equals more shoppers I think free parking will equal more congestion I think what will equal more shoppers is foot traffic and that comes into the movement and play strategy that encourages people to park a little bit further if you 're an able-bodied person and just walk into town and then you might be walking through the shops and see something in a whim oh and going that 's the sort of leisurely shopper who 's going to make a difference in our economy I do agree with councillor Sutton that a blanket parking tax in the form of fees is not ideal it 's not something that I would like it 's almost as bad as having a petrol tax because most people have to drive but I do believe we can be more strategic we can offer free parking a little bit away from the CBD we can work on better technology to make ease of parking a lot simpler and we can follow a strategy that we 're likely to adopt rather about the risk of litigation under competitive neutrality laws whether private car park operators are going to come back and say that we 're undercutting their business now that has not been tested but I 'm not sure we should be the councillor to do that and also like councillor Haysom and said there 's absolutely no measurement here there 's no baseline data on how the economy is taking over now and how the retail how the retail shops are actually going as a baseline there 's a risk of really bad PR will become so unpopular if we deem the trial to be a failure and reinstates paid feed parking not only will that be confusing for the public but I very much doubt if any one of us would get reelected not that that should make any difference sorry yeah I really think we should be following a movement of play strategy it 's a good opportunity now to test the movement and play strategy and see if free off-street all-day parking will move some of those employees out of the CBD allow more turnover and be the Council of summer '_''_2517.32 what anyone else like to speak to the motion and so summer do you have any sorry council something to have any closing comments yes I do as Chris said Walker and Aubrey and Wodonga have free parking but they also have very good shopping lots of people in there lots of people walking around which we don 't have mostly we can use discretion on fines we don 't have to find everybody all the time we can have discretions so I think that 's a no issue really it 's up to us to decide what how long they did how many people get finding and how long we give them lenient minutes after their have expired and performance measures I mean we can decide performance measures before we do the trial there 's three or four months to go so we don 't have to have that done now we can do decide how are we going to do it and decide all that kind of thing before the trial actually starts so I don 't think that 's a problem Thank mayor just in relation to the foreshadowed motion by counsel with summer zero is there a commencement time for that motion clear in a few Chancellor Perry okay councillors will now go to the vote for councillor Sutton 's motion those in favor against motion lost counselor summer would you like to please bring your motion for the council resolved to continue with the current paid and time restricted parking regime for the central business district and continue to pursue further technology options to ensure ease of payment of fee with the exception of implementing free all-day off street parking at Nixon mod and Edward Street parking bays thank you can 't fulfill my driver council that word second second thank you thank you can Suvari cancel Sam would you like to speak to your motion oh well briefly most of excuse me madam it 's the point of clarification the words to continue to pursue further technology options is that open-ended or easier a time frame on that as well we could be pursuing those options for the next 20 years we were hoping to move fairly fast in soon as possible to amend the motion counselor at him read through the mayor do you think he can serve someone yes most of what I was talking about in regards to strategy was mentioned before I think retails gone through some seismic shifts since we did introduce paid parking so we can 't blame all of our retail woes on the meters but I think potentially we shall be looking forward at the next 50 years and not trying to recreate the shopping climate of 50 years ago and Joan the younger generation are moving to Melbourne where there 's a lot of foot traffic high density living and a really good public transport and we 're not retaining the youth as well as we can what I 'm proposing is not insurmountable there 's not an impossible financial impact or any risk of harming small business from the congestion it is in line with our movement and place strategy and it will test the fundamental hypothesis that incentivizing off street parks will increase foot traffic and stimulate sales it also offers a place for CBD employees to park me it 's just a small step towards something more strategic and measured in facilitating a thriving and healthy CBD it just makes sense Thank You councillors on my council is a very would you like to speak to the motion thank you madam mayor I suppose from my perspective it 's a it 's a high level of frustration and I took the opportunity to to read the comments from the shepherded Chamber of Commerce in relation to their Facebook and a lot of people took the time to put down their views in some of the views of a fairly blatant a lot of people were saying that refused to come and shop in the great Shepherd and CBD because of the cost and the inconvenience nobody carries coins these days it 's just a total waste of time ad nauseam so in regards to that I think as a global picture council officers by their very nature are risk-averse they don 't support anything which involves risk and which affects the bottom line in terms of the parking issue we 've done to death consultants it 's come out with an outcome which is towards the end of safety and steering the middle line I for one being in council now for over five years and councillor hazel and sitting opposite has been in council for a long time and he would concede that this to use his terminology parking is very vexed vexed sort of issue and I just like to see something moving forward try something because as I 've often used saying that talk is cheap action is expensive but worst of all worst of all procrastination is endemic so if you don 't not prepared to try something then we 've only got ourselves to blame if we sit on their hands for the next two years Thank You counsel as a barre clarify counselor summers motion before we have further discussion and it 's clarification in relation to off-street component so it is off street parking we 're talking about free and timed corner of Nixon and Maude and the other one that was mentioned was Edward Street and that would be the section north of Edward Street thank you if then yeah anyone like to speak against the motion cancel something support this motion because what we 're trying to do is get shoppers back into the mouth we 're not trying to find places for the staff to park and I just think this is the wrong way to go about it you 're going to have to all day car parks right in the middle of the CBD virtually full of workers and I don 't think that 's what we 're looking to do we 're looking to bring people to ship it in into the CBD to shop and I don 't think this is the way to go he counts for something anyone like to speak for the motion counselor Patterson this has been going on as we all know these news news I personally don 't believe the people I 've spoken to even the ones that say yes three dollars for two hours when you get through their story it 's about the inconvenience of having the change in a pocket half the time and where counsel are failed is to keep up with been going something gonna happen and we 've got a long way behind there I believe technology 's a secret I don 't think anyone that 's coming in to park in front of a shop and I say be doing can 't afford 3 then not gonna spend anything in there anyway sorry so we want that for people want to come in and use our prime parking if they 're going serious shopping more than happy other people will pull up in five hour park and both go for walk whatever but I believe that 's the case of the free parking section I did something really radical and I had a talk with an expert about it more are all experts because we 've all been studying it for so long but there 's some people working his organization actually walk around the streets and enforce the parking and check the meeting the meters etc and I run into a couple of them one day while having a coffee and they certainly said the issue was parking in Sheppard and these people working in jobs and store can see the purple words there you can see the people coming out ship thick they ships at the other side of the road they can 't_''_3048.07 be tackled right so if we were to make it free that would be even worse so I believe there 's several ways of several options we know you do we need to do them all we need to identify more long term impact car parking adverse even at but sitting there we need to get that gun we know as council summer said those couple of extra parks which one make a big difference but it 's gotta make a slight difference and any parking strategy that 's going to improve parking in Sheppard and needs a multi deck car park on side if we go free parking they 'll be fighting us all away we need them on side because you are parked in every other day you drive and get out a hundred meters in the middle to CBD and that was only a dollar an hour two dollars but to it excuse me for two hours so I certainly enough my counselors perspective it would be very easy to say let 's have a paid trial for an it for a year I think it gets the stage well I believe that wouldn 't work so let 's be strong let 's make that decision without spending a hundred and twenty thousand dollars on consultants and losing a million dollars on on failed revenue let 's make a decision that we need to look at our game on other aspects of parking and let 's go for in due time Thank You counsel Patterson we counsel like to speak many counsel like to speak against the motion for the motion yes madam Merrill straight forward okay I made a couple of comments and we 're going to repeat myself but what 's been proposed here is complimentary to the movement and play strategy I think we 've got some consistency there that certainly is going to further refine the the parking regime and the the options that are available I think that 's a very timely that 's coming forward early in the new year look I think the becoming free and untimed again it remains to be seen if it moves some of the workers cars out of board and fryer Street into those off street car parks it certainly provides more opportunity for for shoppers in those areas in answer to the the questions around around timing I think that timing could be fairly imminent with only with changes of signage I think I 'm reliably informed that at least one of those car parks the ticket machine hasn 't worked for quite some time and the reason hasn 't been repaired and this is understandable from the officers perspective is they 're waiting for some direction from us and I think the direction provided by this motion certainly gives the strategic outcome that the officers can work with look counselor I was very talked about it being vexed and was the word I used earlier regardless of the decision it 'll still be a contentious issue people have to have a diversity of views and that 's fair enough opinions a common everyone 's got one and around parking yeah I think the one common attitude the features that I saw in the report that struck a bit of a chord with me is that 50% I think it was 50% was a figure used of all parking fines are for failure to display so that tells me that some people are changing their arm they look up and down the street got a pop into a shop for 10 minutes I won 't put anything in the meter because the inspector won 't come along but the other aspect of that I think relates to the availability of coins people simply don 't carry coins these days and it 's an inconvenience and this motion if we can move quickly to implement new technologies that provide the opportunity for whether it 's mobile phone apps or payWave type applications where the coin issue is taken at apply provide better options I think people will be more appreciative of the service Thank You councillor hazel Minh what any counts I 'd like to speak to the motion Council juvinity thank you this is a very emotive issue depending on who you talk to everybody has an than what it is parking is part of the issue but I think with the recommendation that we improve their technology allowing for various forms of payment I think that will certainly improve I think one of the areas that the CPD suffers from is the variety of shops that are in the in this day and age I think that 's something that the mulberry development could possibly address and desist I think the loss of revenue on a full 12-month effect of about 1.4 million is significant and I think it 's something that we as councillors cannot in all financial responsibility agree to because we would have to find that money from elsewhere where that would be found well the there are not many other options apart from increasing rates which people would not be very appreciative of so I think the recommendation sorry the motion that council summer has moved a sound and I think it will benefit Road pies in the greater shipman City Council and I think we 're about Thank You counsel Jeff and Eddie would any council like to speak to the speak to the motion any closing comments counselor summer just in relation to not wanting a large of street car parks being full of workers the reason why we chose those parks is because they are underutilized at the moment they 're mostly empty so what we want to do is fill them up and like councilor hazel Minh mentioned there is a broken meter in one of those parks and since the broken meters been there it 's been a lot more full so that demonstrates that people will park there and walk if they think they 're getting a benefit so hopefully this benefit will continue we don 't want them parking in front of shops if they park in front of shops they 're not there 's no room for customers we want a parking away from the shops so that people who intend to spend can get in and out Thank You Council summer we will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carried all those in favor for a division okay so council Haseman cancel the summer council Giovannetti council is a the summer and sorry keep yeses mix up tonight council Sutton and councillor Adam motion is carried it 's a point of order I finish I say although the Capitol vet doesn 't have shades over adoption of greater ship and heritage stage study double 1c December 2017 there is a recommendation on page 57 what accounts are like to move emotion counselor Patterson what would you like to move then I use the the recommendation on page 58 if my eyes are letting me down ten point one thank you for that do I have a seconder please do I have a second down Thank You councilman council Patterson would you like to thank you for the motion this study 's been going on for quite quite a while there 's been a clear recognition of Shepards lost so much history everyone mentions the post office straight away but there 's a lot more than that and I 'm certainly not a history buff or heritage buff but there is so many places around that really do need protecting from ourselves if nothing else and I 'll give you a house and dunkirk Avenue which is called after I found his prime minister in England and I 'll think the Churchill was his actually known and that was it 's just a house it doesn 't look anything special and stuff the Churchill infernal but that was actually built by a lot of builders during the second world were that couldn 't go to the war but they decided to pool their time at the weekend and build a house for the war effort and cellar places like that so it doesn 't have to be you know some magnificently designed building weather is certainly a lot of buildings around that really do need protecting some are in public hands some are in private but it 's this this is God on it 's been a very long process that our staff have been through identifying and a committee that 's worked on it identifying the places a blue should be protected and this will now go after consultation but starts tonight and people can have a final important Anke council Patterson councillor Hayes would you like to speak we 've all had experience of one particular house over a period of time where people thought the Heritage overlay was an imposition on their their rights as property owners and it 's interesting that that property is now recently changed hands and there 's a application for planting permit before Council but the process that we 're adopting here is we 're not depriving people of their rights or their entitlements this is about adopting the Heritage study stage to see and then preparing a planting scheme amendment which is a public submission process people who are impacted have the opportunity to make submissions objections if they like and ultimately that will end up before a panel Victoria panel and ultimately then Council will get another chance to make a decision in respect of it so some people might think it 's it 's a convoluted an ongoing process but I think it 's convoluted an ongoing because it provides opportunities at many stages for residents interested people to make a submission have their say be part of the decision making process Thank You Council Haseman what any council just like to state that I 'm on the case the Heritage studies that there as to how it applies to public buildings in fact I like many in Sheppard and Ruth at a the post office was all I had to be torn down that was one of the truly heritage properties in Sheppard I 've had a number of rate payers contact me really the Heritage telogen where they 're privately owned homes are included I 've stressed to me the difficulties of having the home Heritage listed and the restrictions they now face when requiring to renovate their home as councillor hazel Minh mentioned there are avenues and opportunities for but I somehow wonder how successful that they would be within those those avenues that they may use they used to use I realized that we as a council have no right to include privately-owned sorry I realize we as a council have the right to include privately owned homes in the study but I but morally on question that right if someone wants it 'll parities was my home that I had bought and paid for distressed at the thought of someone being able to tell me what I can and can 't_''_3790.01 do with my own home we have as council hazel Minh mentioned we 've seen the fiasco in Koryo Street where we hear it is listed a number of homes in the street and one owner who had a shell of a house or more precisely probably about half a dozen sticks avoid it result timber a chimney and a few other minion windows the angst had caused this family from being included in the heritage overlay was I imagine immense the time effort and possible loss of money lost in their endeavors to override councils heritage loosening decision and the costs to council in time alone would have been immense let 's not go down this path again I believe you must provide own as a period of private homes an option to opt out at the Heritage study if they so desire which I believe is fair to all I 'm hopeful about the council 's feel the same as I and vote against this motion he counts of juvinity many as a very thank you for the opportunity matter of me first and foremost let me say that I support the Heritage study and I don 't want to pinch your line council JV but as far as public buildings we 've all heard the time-honored comment the man 's home is his castle and I for one don 't have any faith in the process or the perception of the process that goes on in relation through these things where we have the right of redress making submissions and things of that nature I 've been a counselor for long enough to realize and seen it in terms of what happens in relation to people that are upset about the way that they 're dictated to in relation to if they have a dispute yes they can go through the the process of lodging a dispute having their say but the success ratio in relation to changing those things is not very high so to reiterate I think that the Heritage study is important and like anything heritage is in the eye of the beholder the post office is study and private ownership I am less than comfortable in relation to the redress that is available to put owners of private property thank you Thank You counsel so very many council like to speak for the motion but any counts like to take against the motion any closing sorry to the motion counselor summon two minds on this one as well heritage is always very contentious as we know we have heard a lot from the side of people who would prefer that we do not apply a heritage overlay on their property and I do sympathise with counsel Jevon it is point that we should that landowners should have some protection so if only to allow more time to consider I 'm not convinced that right now is appropriate to support this motion I don 't agree with the open-door opt-out system I think we 'd lose a lot of places of significance just because people believe it 's a hindrance they could be places that are fundamental to the identity of greater shepherding and nobody knows about them even though the landowner is only really opting out guess so the way that we 've the work that 's been put into this is been phenomenal and the process we 've used has ticked the boxes in terms of legalities whether we could go back and perhaps look at each objection individually and figure out exactly what our criteria should be in terms of whether a property is listed or not that 's something that I think could be an option if we if we do if we do go back and perhaps talk to landowners and perhaps figure out because I think we 've got 56 objections is that correct so it 's been quite quite divisive but I mean again there have been there have been property owners who actively support their property being protected under the Heritage overlay so it 's not all doom and gloom when it comes to these things so I 'm happy to allow more time for consideration if that 's what councillors choose eventually though I do believe that heritage isn 't so important for Greater shipping because we 've lost so much and that it will eventually need to would any other council like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor Patterson basically I do have sympathy for people that have bought a house and 10 20 years ago and they want to do something with it and now they might Mel do exactly what they want so there is a overlap period there but I take councillors varies words of your home is your castle well it is because you own the title of it but you also have responsibility as far as I 'm concerned if that 's a place of significant heritage like this one in Dunkirk Avenue the Churchill you 're also you should be charged with keeping the integrity of that building intact that is like that would be a loss for Shepherd and in its entirety you drive down cryo Street and some of those magnificent tall houses that you know the first house is a building chippin and if this was not that I develop a good table you know that 's a big block which they are through there I 'm going to knock one of these down and units everyone 's jumping up and down and then look what we 've lost this is an opportunity to stop that happening it 's a one opportunity of going I do have some sympathy as I said for people that have owned bought a heritage mr. house that wasn 't Heritage listed now is but I think over the years go by I 've heard plenty of stories of people are now identifying Heritage listed houses they 're looking for them they can develop them with the Heritage intact and that 's what people looking for more than a modern house they want something that really does reflect their history Thank You counsel Pettis encourage my counselors to thank you we will now go to the phone those in favor against I 'm sorry in favor Jenny in favor those against motion carried I just have a spill and I wasn 't actually clear on okay sorry can we please go back those in favor yep against motion carry councils will now go to item 10.2 Memorandum of Understanding between Grady Shepherd and City Council and golden River Valley Tourism to move a motion tourism commencing on 1 July 2018 endorsed entering into the amended memoranda of understanding with govern River tourism commencing on 1 July 2018 for two years until the 20th of sorry 30th of June 2020 20 with the option of a one-year extension and authorize the CEO to sign the membrane of understanding over half the council for option for the police and so Adam counts a Tiffany D would you like to speak to the motion I thank you madam mayor we had a briefing from the gothic tourists River Valley tourism group we get feedback and I think that there 's now been a significant change in the management and governance of that organization which gives us a lot more confidence that greater Sheppard and will have a greater exposure through that group into the future there are clauses within the opt-out clauses will call them within the contract that if by some chance that one of the other members of the the group opt out then we also have that chance to opt out as well so I think that there are safeguards the group but as I said earlier I 'm confident that we 'll get better coverage out of it now that there is a new management group involved Thank You councillor Jeff Nettie council Adam would you like to speak to the motion I 'll just add a few comments so this has been another contentious issues been quite a few of those tonight madam me I think councillors over the past two or three years have been convinced that this organization has delivered what we expect them to do and as councillor Giovannetti pointed out we 're the largest contributor financial contributor to this organization to the tune of approximately 100,000 a year I suppose maybe against my better judgement earlier on I have changed my mind and I 'm willing to move forward with this song on this MOU and give the opportunity to the new leadership group which is leann whom is is the new CEO is that correct mr. Harriet and give them the opportunity we 've had numerous meetings in the past where they 've also changed their tech I suppose I could use that to be even more engaging into the future so I think the whole concept is really good I just don 't think it 's delivered over the past few years and we 're looking forward to this MOU being the foundation for this to deliver what they promised that they could Thank You counsel Adam but any counter like to speak against the motion for the motion word cancer I was very made comment earlier on about officers being risk averse this MOU would be the epitome of risk-averse in that it 's certainly putting the council in a more favorable position than we 've probably been in the past and provides us with the flexibility and options into the future that if our expectations or aren 't being met that we do have the capacity to move in a different direction as Indy did the other partners which that was that flexibility was missing from the previous arrangements and as has been mentioned with new governance situation then in play I 'm reasonably confident that moving forward will get the outcomes we 've been expecting Thank You counsel counsel motion canceled Patterson is this organization went through enormous amount of trouble you both call it as far as some accounts of our counsels perspective and to me was like a sinking ship very fortunately we 've got a new captain on board the new chief engineer and I 've certainly gotta go in the right direction and I think we should give them time to correct it and I 'm very confident they 'll be able to deliver which unfortunately wasn 't happening before will finance financing some very significant initiatives in other showers I believe Thank You counsel Patterson anyone else like to speak to the motions counselor summer point out that like councillor Adam pointed out it is quite a large contribution and I think it 's one hundred and twelve thousand dollars two hundred and forty four GST inclusive so we are the largest contributors and arguably we 've had the least exposure over the lifetime of this organization that did of course bring up questions of whether we should continue and arguably also they 're you know they 're going in another direction now and like bang for our buck so if of course that 's not happening we could take that over a hundred thousand dollars and go in a different direction and perhaps our investment attraction team could develop our interest a lot Alliance that is closer to home what I like about this is that there 's pressure to become state recognized which should allow for more resourcing and more revenue and there 's pressure to become more financially independent which will take the pressure off of us so it 'll be interesting to see how we how we step moving forward Thank You Council summer many council like to speak to the motion any closing comments councillor jebin Eddy will now go to the vote all in favor against motion carried councils will now go to item ten point three awarding of heritage grants 2017-2018 there is a recommendation on page 70 what accounts are like to move a motion sounds like to me the motion recommendation on page 71 has the motion which is as saved in the agenda Thank You counsel chip in early do I have a seconder speak to the motion this is an opportunity that people who are including and under the Heritage study have where they can make application to Council to upgrade their homes or properties not always necessarily homes there 's some public buildings there and I think it 's a it 's a good thing that we 're I would offer this to people for those people who wish to be involved in the heritage program there are many others that don 't Thank You counsel eternity for those comments councillor Adam would you like to speak to emotions yes sir Thank You councillor juvinity I all support this as well obviously these aren 't huge amounts of money but they 're there to assist the owners I 'm just looking at some of these properties and I know that these aren 't these aren 't owner-occupied a lot of these will be rental homes and in respect to the 19 dunk Academy the one that councillor Patterson was referring to earlier the Churchill house well the only Churchill component that house is the bust of Winston Churchill on the porch the that period there is a sign that says Churchill on the front of the house about the bust correct Thank You counsel Adam pretty much I just thought I had a bit of trivia have you finished house I don 't know anyone like to speak against the motion for the motion Council just a very very simple comment in light of the previous debate and discussions it 's nice to see councillor Adam and councillor around you Eddie trying to get back in the good books they might like to speak to the motion councillor summer to point out that council receives 32 applications all of which met the eligibility criteria there are a few that are flagged for success if any of these don 't go ahead for whatever reason and I 'm just thrilled that there are people out there willing to work with us to try and restore some of what we 've lost Thank You council some but any other council like to speak to the motion any closing comments council juvinity thank you can submit will now go to the vote those in favor councils we now go to [Music] Abell of motions Neel received reports from council delegates to other bodies Neel received reports from special committees and advisory committees your received notice of motion amendment or

accounts are like to move a motion councillor Patterson on page 78 do I have a seconder council certain council certain counts opposed would you like to speak to the motion Council Sutton would you like to speak to the motion Thank You council sudden many council like to speak against the motion for the motion counselor summer does deserve a little bit of exposure I haven 't managed to get to a lot of these like I normally would because I found myself a job but I do go on weekends and attend whatever I can but there 's almost 60 different things that we 've all taken party in over the month and I think that 's something that people don 't realize a counselor does it 's the best way to get in touch with the community and every time we attend one of these things someone will say their opinion on what we 're doing or give some kind of feedback that 's really valuable in the long term so I 'm glad we 're it 's ending so many things and I think everyone should keep it up Thank You counselor summer they would like to speak for the motion against the motion any closing comments counsel Suttons will now go to the vote all in favor against motion carries my apologies we 'll have to reverse that my apologies for that Thank You councillor Patterson we will now go to the vote those in favor against motion carried councils will now go to item 17.1 assembly of councilors the

Georges Road neighborhood land which has been endorsed by Council as an area to improve for regular community use it 's also been identified as a place for a future retardation Basin which could be developed to allow passive recreation to the community so acknowledge what you 're saying about the park it does need a little bit of attention but there will be future budgets to determine question for from John again what are the traditional responsibilities on residential land developers in respect to Street tree plantings and establishment care we adopt the requirements of the infrastructure design manual and goes into detail in that manual and council require developers to manage maintain trees for 12 months I 'm sure most developers elected pay council to establish the trees and they paid them two hundred and fifty dollars in lieu of doing that works themselves and that covers the planting [Music] establishment of the trace now I know you 've noted not be replaced and that happens from time to time but it 's a mixed bag we can even plant them ourselves or I get the developers to do it themselves can 't train these men don 't pay us to do it John thank you thank you mister

purchasing this equipment Thank You counselor counselor Patterson good any counsel wishing to speak against this motion counselor should you speak for emotion counsel summer just want to reiterate that this motion does propose to deliver best value the idea of joint procurements are to drive efficiencies in financial efficiencies many councils linking together to produce these economies of scale which brings the price down my only concern is that there 's so many successful tenders there which may dilute the goal of having economies of scale created cheaper outcome but I guess the only way to find out if it will work is to go ahead and try it out and hopefully we 'll end up with fantastic evaluation report and more shade sails across the municipality where kids are playing thank you

counselor counselor is very looking at the screen above well just to be strictly clear London amendment emotional council gives out money if you satisfy the requirements and they 're all well worthwhile projects worthwhile funding guarantee any councillor wishing to speak against the motion counsel is wishing to speak forth motion councillor divinity Thank You mr. hedges reiterating what the council our authority said it 's great to see such a wide range of sporting groups that have actually taken the opportunity to make application for some of these finally for the funding that is available we took the successful applicants we have to cheer netball Association Chevy 's footy club Shepherd and youth club United Cricket Club tireless Park community and Sports Club northern legal Junior Football Club so quite a wide variety of applicants which is great that we can support these groups within the community Thank You Council on councils wish to speak against the motion for the motion Council Abdulla yeah it 's we all know that we want we are aspiring towards becoming the sporting capital of Australia or of Victoria so all these steps are in the right direction just more comment around the around the assessment I noticed that something that most of them are the minor projects but at least one project is nature which is amounting to 28,000 or so dollars it would be I 'm sure this is this is going to be followed but we need to ensure that there 's some major budget assessment and review as well and just to ensure that the funds the usage of the fund is on the track is on track and it 's and it 's going to avoid any unpleasant surprises towards the end it 's it 's all about working together and having good partnerships so it 's just a matter of how we are monitoring the usage of funds Thank You councillor I 'll add mine comments to this would be our sporting future funding is a program that I think fitting perfectly with as council Abdo I just mentioned our new sport it sports in one money rate payers money to that program that 's a facility and authorship and so this works in perfectly with that with encouraging and helping and assisting sporting clubs become viable or remain viable and hopefully expand and involve more more members of our community in that sport so there my comments any other comments lik against the motion before the motion and council o cafe chief any closing comments against me all in favor against motion carry there are counselors we have item seven seven point six on page 32 we have a recommendation any council wishing to move a motion please councillor is very I 'll move the recommendation on page 32 is the motion in relation to the revocation of the urban street naming community facility signage policy Wow well indeed to have a seconder please Chancellor Sutton councillors very Thank You mr. mayor look essentially this is following a jet of an election we are tasked to review our policies and this policy has popped up as being of no further value so we 're putting it before the council to revoke it Thank don 't really need a policy specific service good thank you any councillor we should just speak against this motion councillors wishing to speak for the motion careful Abdullah it 's a quick comment I think it 's a smart move because it 's all about reducing redundancy in council operations and the review and update of redundant policies it takes resources of the every policy takes resources so it 's a reasonable step to revoke this redundant policy and gain some efficiencies in council operations Thanks Thank You councillor any councillor wish to speak against for councillor or aspiring any closing comments Thank You mr. mayor essentially that the policy that we have in place is superseded by the VicRoads guidelines in any event so that 's another reason for justification effective okay thank you all in favor of the motion counsels against emotion Carrie the council 's item 7.7 the contract 1808 well stood straight up great States three nights straight intersection in Shepparton there is a recommendation on page 34 but rather council wishing to move an emotion counselor Patterson yes well it 's just you 'll lot of 650 and Thank You counselor person to have a seconder please counselor or as very council person there were injuries the experiment was originally good Thank You counsel Patterson counselor or is very no thanks it 's tonight Thank You counselor a bit of drama they any counselor we should just speak against the motion counsels wishing to speak for the motion Council okay thank you any other counsel would you speak against the motion for the motion Council Abdulla you just want to clarify yes I 'll be supporting this motion but I would want to make a point that in all these contracts in the tenders I 've noticed that there 's very limited competition there was very limited competition and now it 's just at this stage with amendment amendments we have got only one supplier left so basically what happens is that when you don 't have enough competition the quality of the of the project suffers because there is no how should I say no not much incentive to to to to have the projects that are that are delivered according to the so there 's a possibility with of course with such a small competition council didn 't have my choice and now that they had pulled out we were left with only one one one choice so that sort of restricts our ability to to to drive the work in a way that people wanted to I think in the future it will be good if we can if you can encourage or if you can somehow actively promote more competition in these areas and especially with the recent construction project delays in Chariton yeah it 's really as a community representative I would be very keen to have more competition in this area and that will try better project schedule controls and we will focus on project s excellence good Thank You councillor and you have a councillor wishing to speak against this version for the motion cancel our Patterson any closing comments all in favor against motion carried [Applause] item 8.1 councils on page 39 we have a recommendation you respect to the greater Shepherd and greater health Grants round one 2017 2018 do I have a motion from motion that the council approves the distribution of greater Shepherd and greater health project grant funding for ground one 2017 2018 of 2124 dollars ten cents including GST as listed below as listed on page 39 thank you do I have a second to place of counsel counsel asama this is another one about grant grant rounds it 's relatively new and it seems to be getting off to a good start it 's a lot smaller than some of the other grant rounds that we have it 's favoring projects that deliver to vulnerable disabled or disadvantaged groups so even though it doesn 't seem like a lot of money in the long run it actually means a lot to the people that we 're giving it to so I 'm more than happy to accept this and my only comment would be that we need to be a bit mindful of the potential for overlaps into the our sporting future because everything seems to be about sports these days which isn 't a bad thing but we need to be mindful of being it more inclusive when taken mayor and look there 's probably a point of difference here with the age range so the age range and different some activities that are listed this for grants that we had applications for all of whom that address the criteria I think you know it 's really interesting to see that a big diversity there is what what we 're getting to provide for we 've got to have some mature aged participants we 've got the primary school parents partner theater healthy eating habits as well as I think we also have a massage therapy and see the very road school students which I think will be a wonderful and very beneficial so I think there 's the great things we do get to do and I think it 's important to have that bit of diversity and listen to what you know individual particular individual schools like Bernie Road you know require and I think that 'll be a very good thank you can lock any council by wishing to speak against this motion for lotion counts like doing steps towards building a healthy community and I from the council that will help them better it could equip for their health and well-being so you have all small steps in the right direction Thank You councillor any other council wishes to speak against for council summer any closing comments thank you all in favor councillors against motion carried item eight point two councillors on pages 46 and 47 we have a recommendation in respect to the holds community centers and recreation reserve special committees review of instruments of delegation and returns exemption any council wishing to be promotion probably dragging the microphone this way gave it away yes one thing you miss me I 'm delighted ever moved the motion has printed on pages 46 and 47 of the agenda a seconder please Cancellara 's very councillor hazel month to establish a couple aspects mr. mayor I 'm obviously that the Act requires that council conducts a review of many delegations and exemptions provided to member the special committees from time to time and that review has been undertaken and the results is what is outlined in the in the recommendation that has become the motion and I think what this interesting of note that the people who these committees they 're actually delegated to manage council facilities and properties on behalf of Council and I think from time to time the contribution that these people make it 's it 's probably undervalued and taken for granted and the list of facilities on listed on page 47 is quite extensive and it 's appropriate that time to time the council does undertake such a review Thank You counselor counselor is very any counselor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion back to you counselor hazily all in favor against motion carries item eight point three councils on page 53 and 54 we have recommendation in respect to the section 86

motion back to you counsel achieved anything Congress coming we now whether against motion carried automate point for Timmy Geoff 's Bronx round 1 2017 2019 we have a recommendation on page 59 and 60 I 'm correct do I have any counsel we should be motion I 'm sorry counsel someone couldn 't say from Martha Thank You counsel setting up what used to move funding for the following projects and community out scram oh it 's grants round 1 2017 2018 and that applicants there as listed at the Shepherd in theatre Oxford West Side circus awakened Dance Theatre Company and some polls lutheran church community since is listed on page yeah that would be very upset if you forgot them thank you counselor do you have a second to place counselor case counts less I 'm not uh once again it 's a relatively new grant process and one that I believe support I think if we 're going to have a standalone magnificent art museum they to be recorded by the grassroots of our community otherwise without community driving the cultural change towards arts that project is likely to fall over and not be nearly as good as and the GV Concert Orchestra so it gives me great pleasure to move that we should award 2500 towards Dookie the musical yeah I would say that it 's put it 's going to put Dookie on the map but I think Duke is well and truly already stamped itself on that map basically it 's a play that was developed and produced and directed by John head who is performing this with local talents and it actually has score from a local called Wade Gregory who does a lot of classical music with the Cheerilee Concert Orchestra so it 's going to be brilliant and I do encourage everyone to get along and see what greater Shepherd it has to offer except was that a paid advertisement Kessler very very well done Thank You councillor council okay Thank You mr. mayor and I agree with councillors summer applicants contribute to our community supporting creativity and encourage participation in arts and cultural activities for individuals groups and the broader community the assessment panel reviews each application based on the given criteria each project has listed their objective and outcome and I saw it also enjoy many of those participants and performances amazing time Thank You counsel O 'Keefe any counselor wishing to speak against this motion before the motion Council Patterson no I 'm sorry that being the case back to you counsel someone this place if you have some it 's still only half of what we offer without supporting future grants and I do hope that since we have we are building a facility that the grant scheme should equal that of the Sports City facility no sir good thank you holding favorite counsels against motion carried item 8.5 on pages 68 and 69 community matching grants gained around 00 recommendations for approval 2017 2018 driver council wishing to move the motion please counselor do you have anything what would you like to move councillor Jabez I 'm sorry mr. mayor council assembly now maybe something that 's a little bit of reading I 'd like to speak the recommendation as emotional 568 969 that the council approved the recommendation of a grant review panel to fund 15 projects as detailed below to the value of thirty one after the 2017-18 of the greater Schieffelin City Council community groups matching grants game thank you do have a seconder please Castle something there counselor Jeff and Eddie would you like to speak to the motion Thank You mr. mayor again as council summer has mentioned earlier this meeting is all about handing out money to the community which is a very important part of council for all the organizations that have been successful through through this process will provide significant benefit to the communities with the programs that they have my replication for Anakin Ali gives you begin better than us apparently as a whole good thank you councillor Sutton do you wish to add to anything this matching grant scheme started in 2011 and it 's designed to support projects from the greatest represent community which build social connections and partnerships so reinforcers that already exists and it allows participation in the community activity or daughter stages of the project from planning to completion and also community members can acquire develop new skills and create or renew revitalize places and spaces within the community for example the conference that and I think that 's a great idea hope the Association is getting a storage container so there 's lots of lots of things happening lots of money we 're giving away which is a good feel good Thank You councillor councillors wishing to speak against the motion for the motion councillor some respect in regards to giving away money it 's basically doubling the value of a dollar so we offer some money but we 're not just saying here take it and do what if you like with that we 're trying to empower the community to stand on their own two feet in a way they have to be accountable for that money there are forms to fill out once the money 's spent to prove that it has of the value to the community and we couldn 't do all this work we couldn 't go out there and purchase defibrillators or do cultural bus tours on our own we wouldn 't be able to identify that need whereas if you go from the bottom up these guys know what 's going on in the with an ask and then we can provide that there 's no way we could have the resources to do that without the community so thank you to everyone who actually applied thank [Music] you [Music] you 're hearing is once we 've done once the doctors do that begins by Mac Wiseman themselves Thank You counsel if they weren 't thinking that before they are now thank you now I read it right counselor Patterson 's words this is a happens if ax couple times a year and this is just a great night that we are showing that we are giving back to the community and he counseled me to speak against imagine the motion sign then for for the motion counselor is very about giving why sums of money there 's a couple of the thing that attracts me to this particular emotion is that some of the things that we 're giving money your wife for really shows how people are quite innovative for you life-saving Victoria which is a aquatic survival program to Shepherd our youth I lost track of the number of people over that I simply cannot swim it 's absolutely staggering the number of people we cannot swim in this day and age the dookey one where we 're creating a lifestyle development a father to give new residents an idea what actually Dukey has well I mean it 's just it 's really to be in characters for instance Thank You counselor and you can 't solution to speak against for old and closing comments counselor driven it e thank you mr. mayor are certainly endorse everything other counselors have said it 's actually very good to say the Long 's club of gorillas have been given a garden 2,250 for a bob all community do you favor a lot of a shame that 's very much for a councillor Patterson if he should have the shuttle bubbling the launch club lady he can be Jeff staff quicker smart so much the conflict of interest to cancel then thank you for that if you council is all in favor of the motion against motion carried they are not item 9.1 councillors on page 80 we have a recommendation in reference to you 'll have a council wishing to continue to assist in the coordination of this project including managing the various financial contributions for the pre-feasibility study as this is on page 80 Thank You councillor do we have a seconder please council Abdulla councillor okay there 's been a lot of hype around this announcement and it has attracted national and international interest and it 's put greater sheppard and i believe on a platform of being innovative and proactive i have experienced firsthand the positive reaction and recognition this project has given greater sheppard and last month i attended a conference in Sydney a business conference and when I actually mentioned on the stage that I was from Sheppard and one of the comments from the audience was all yes that 's the town that 's actually looking at the putting up their bid for the Commonwealth Games so that was nice to see Sheppard and put in such a positive light and recognized you know the interstate and really really positive feedback which was great I also believe it 's going to improve our opportunities for other events events this project is revolutionary and it 's not just about greater Sheppard and this is about the whole of Victoria coming together to create something very special a legacy for regular areas I fully support this recommendation I know it 's a long way away and I 'm sure I 'm going to be around hopefully to see some fruition I 'm happy to counselor drivers Council do you wish to add some comment I 'm very proud to see greater Shepperton second initiative and its leading regional the regional areas in this bit and as council cave has suggested and has mentioned that it 's a very puzzles to positive story for our region and and I agree that a lot of people that I 've met up since this announcement have now been asking about this project and they now know about leadership well then before so it 's a good a good step the other thing is that I really hope and I do hope that the project momentum is maintained and we are enthusiastic throughout this process because it 's a long process and we around this yep Thank You councillor any council we should just speak against the motion for the motion Council summer I 'm hearing that the more it does make sense the idea is to spread infrastructure so instead of overspending on one great big Coliseum stadium and they 're never using it again for until the next game it 's been 100 years we can actually use the kind of facilities that are spread out across regional Victoria and not have that overspend left to ruin so not only does it make theoretical sense it also makes economic sense now initially I don 't think anyone really expected this bead to draw so much attention we did have some backlash and probably a little dose of envy from other regions who wish they got you first yeah bad luck at the it was just a launch what we did before and now we 're getting into the details so it 's really up to surrounding councils whether they want to be involved and contributes this it 's turned out to be an amazing investment just the launch itself because we launch so we were in the herald-sun we were on the radio TV newspapers everywhere and we couldn 't have well we could have spent that money but in order like it 's actually given us a positive reputation instead of always hearing about the bad things about Shepherd and we 've suddenly become the potential hub of the Commonwealth Games so that 's that 's a great outcome and I think we 've got a chance of winning it got to be in it to win it absolutely Thank You councillor Sela any council wishing to speak against the motion for the motion Council Sutton this is a really exciting time for Greater Shepherd and I believe and we 've got a really high profile task force that 's been appointed that are going to do a great job for us it 's a fun of it 's a first for a Commonwealth Games bid having a shared amongst the region and it 's the first for greater ship it in and I think it can only do good for Shepherd in it to show shepherding and then positive that 's hopefully we good Thank You councillor councillors wishing to speak against again none any councillor wishing to speak for council Patterson [Music] Thank You counselor marvelous any counselor we just pick again something we 've all spoken now for the for the motion no good well I 'll add my final comments I am actually part of the the task force and I can say from a personal experience we 've got some luminaries on this task force so me excluded obviously we have people like Eloise Pratt who 's you know a philanthropic giant in this country you 've got people like well obviously sports people John Steffensen fantastic positive passion of God we 've got the Honorable Jeanette Powell as well we 've got people representing major businesses in Australia we 've got some real full Corp in the corporate world Nick Holland obviously if you 're buried fourth on you probably remember Nick fantastic guy as well so we got some great powerful people there but this motion is in regard to supporting the pre-feasibility study that must be completed before we can enter it two and three million dollars now the state government want us to do a pre feasibility first this motion just sits that in such a framework out for that we 're well on the way to achieving their target and we hope in the next month or two we can come back to the community and say that 's been achieved that will be conducted and that will to the the real feasibility study if that comes out so positive which I 'm sure it will and and there 's all the other councillors have alluded to ultimately if this gets up and gets running it will be a an absolute major change well economy lifestyle change this whole rate region greater Sheppard and obviously but also regional Victoria so well I support the motion 100 percent councillor okay I think any closing comments from the caliber of the committee and task force obviously is outstanding and also acknowledging that the Pratt family and obviously the Sally family rate Excel we have grass roots here in family history so in speaking with Halloween perhaps myself she was very really thrilled and we did sort of revisit some of your history here so I think that 's a real positive fortunate enduring force fone from their behalf so yes very excited and I 'm really looking forward to what the future holds in his face okay thank you falling favored counsels against motion carried item nine point to the domestic animal mental plan results for 2013 to 2017 we have a recommendation on page 85 driver council wishes with a motion counselor summer move the recommendation as a motion as listed on page 85 which is that the council 1 endorsed the evaluation report outlining outcomes and achievements of the domestic animal management plan 2013 to 2017 and to note the evaluation and its implementation in the annual report thank you do I have a seconder please council are is very counselor summer well this is terrific I remember back in 2003 when we were working on these and we worked very hard it was during a period of council where there was a bit of backlash in the community around how our animal management was being led at the time that was leaked from the of a dog that appeared to be Eugen now I remember the mayor spent days responding to emails to that regard and to see how far we 've come from that date now is just so pleasing we now work with the animal rescue groups which has really helped our euthanasia rates and we 're always looking for improvements so in order to point out how difficult it was to go from there to here it 's actually a falafel Asafa call and cultural change so not only can you see in the results that we have a significant reduction in euthanasia and a considerable increase in animal adoption it 's all across the board we have made improvements we 've now got an off-leash dog park and an off-leash dog park committee that 's looking for additional parks we developed and promoted a desexing subsidy scheme we 've recognized that registration is an issue and we 're continuing to try and make improvements in that area but I am so happy that we 've come in we 've recognized that there was a problem is just the bee 's knees these nice marbles Thank You Council summer council I was very I just like to reiterate the comments made by council the summer in particular I remember when I got elected on the first the thing that really struck me was the way that we were just literally just euthanizing animals left right and center and that 's one of the things that really stuck in my craw if statistics are or graphs to be believed you just have to look at both through the dog and the cats in terms of both rehousing and euthanasia rates dramatically the euthanasia rates are dramatically reduced URI housings were the facilities that we have now are really well maintained looked after funding is being put to them also counselor some inventions that we working with Animal Protection groups and things of that major these things are all positive I think that the one remaining area that we have ongoing issues with they 're actually the owners the owners of animals filed to take that fundamental responsibility that a dog or a cat is a lifelong commitment that I really distress as me when I see people just letting a dog 's wandering around the place and secondly not having them on a leash and thirdly getting all indignant when their dog rushes up and attacks somebody and gets a short sharp shift in turn that 's all I can say Thank You councillor any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion get a dog where 's responsible by random lobby just a bad and after probably like I do that very unfortunate it 's not deadly I really do want to congratulate the it was an issue was again for summer city really should indulge in them will be doing now this is one of the guys in jury finding don 't you find numbers have gone up don 't worry house has gone up and don 't it 's nice to come down with ten percent and a lot of I tend to say that 's killed also I think he 's back with actually but yeah again Paulus Thank You counselor any other counselor to speak for the motion I was no one here to speak against the motion is out counselor has the one it 's a it 's a pretty hard motion to speak identity it 's a particularly good story it wasn 't a good story they back in 2013 when this management plan kicked off the the public perception of our performance in this area was very for and the statistics backed up that perception but the strategies that were implemented and the resources to go with it the the training programs that were were applied I 've seen a remarkable result was seen through identification through microchipping that substantially increasing the number of animals that are acclaimed and return to their homes we 've seen a very proactive rehousing program which of those two programs work particularly well it is obvious then they 're going to see a corresponding decline of the number of animals that are euthanized I think some of those statistical data and the graphs that are in here it 's quite stark to see the change that 's occurred over that so it hasn 't come without some expense but I 'm the level of expenditure to achieve these sorts of results indeed take your counselor I fully agree with your comments there let 's hope those euthanasia numbers just keep getting enviro and lower as well and you know the count solution that had comment for or against council something you 're looking very pensive there you won 't have some closing comments I would like to have some closing comments that just in regards to a couple of comments see where councillors mentioned we were putting them down willy-nilly or putting them down left right and senses that 's not quite accurate I know that that was the perception but we were following legalities and we certainly didn 't do anything that wasn 't above board but just because something 's legal and we 're following a procedure doesn 't mean that we can 't do it there room for improvement to go above and beyond so we 've done that and I 'm very proud I think it 's a dog gone effort Thank You counselor all in favor of us my trying to thought with that thank you 106 we have a recommendation in reference to the Shepherd and chamois committee the instrument of delegation and guidelines committee delegations so I have a council wishing to move a motion please counselor is very thank you what would you like to move on thank you I 'll move the recommendation on page 106 items one through four inclusive marvelous to have a second to please councillor Patterson counselor is very we want to speak to the motion thank you for the offer mr. me as a long-term counselor on this committee the the delegation in relation to this has been revised in terms of the Shepherd and Sharma guidelines the item four in particular where it says the relevant provisions resolved that local or two doesn 't apply to the conduct of meetings of the ship and showing special committee essentially means that we don 't run the committee meetings as we do council meeting the other issue that was a arisen is that a previously it used to be the case mr. mayor you would know that there was a requirement for the chairperson to be filled by owner who is elected to that position and there is also going to be the additional council officer appointed to the committee together with the provision of an angel environment report for animation and that last particular point adds a degree of comfort to the fact that there is a good governance in terms of the committee itself indeed Thank You counselor counselor Patterson [Music] be doing also and we can all remember three four mashup sharing in a bit of turmoil is probably not working that book this council whereas burn the corner market II worked very well and I stand up Thank You councillor councillors wishing to speak against the motion for the motion back to you counselor or as very for any closing comments if you wish now I think that 's been covered thank you mister man thank you all in favor councillors against the motion carried [Music] item one point for counselors update to asset valuation and revaluation policy 0 3 2004 live a recommendation on page 110 12 a councillor wishing to move a motion please councillor Jeff and Eddie thank you mister Thank on page 210 as a motion of the council 's of the updated asset valuation and revaluation policy 0-3 policy for thank you do I have a seconder please councillor I was very Thank You counselor counselor Jannetty would like to speak to the motion mr. mayor this is a procedural process what we 're doing is making some minor amendments to the current asset evaluation policy we 're changing the way that we depreciate some of our our assets and amending the wording to make it more clear we 're saying that we we need to refer to it as a straight line method of depreciation which is the actual length of time that the actual I said is going to be serviceable for us that 's better Thank You counselor not obliged to speak more than you wish to counselor or as very you know thanks thank you for that to any council we should just speak against this motion for the motion Council Patterson I think we fully understand what it all means any other council wishing to comment against this motion for the motion back T want to clarify anything for councillor good map Lucentio firefall council Patterson line up there only five of the motion counsels against carried item 9.5 the instrument of delegation to the chief executive officer we have a recommendation on page 1 1 2 so do I have a council mission to move a motion please I 've got all night council council hazel Minh thank you to have a second to place careful Pettersen councillor Heisman if you like to speak to the mission the significant aspect of anything is what it was previously but in the delegation sorry can 't_''_3734.42 say no if the the public gallery can hear you yep yep as it I agree with you lazy microphone all around look the the nice significant aspect I think is that there 's part of delegation there is a modest increase in the canal for contract acceptance from 400,000 to 500,000 and every second month we get a listing here of the the contracts and tenders that are passing through the system and we can see the impact that this change in the delegation will have will often that is held up waiting for a council meeting it 's a relatively small number and I think if we look at this in comparison with other councils it 's it 's a council decision based on the needs of individual councils so I noticed that I think it was a city of Ballarat or Geelong their contractual amount was a million dollars another council was at 250 thousand dollars but I think what this also does it also reflects the nature of the relationship between the CEO and the council as a group and the changes that have been suggested and recommended in this motion will impact and improve and enhance the performance of the council well said Thank You councillor councilperson pretty well Vonage along is 1.2 million Spacely away with the American governance council leads on issues especially contracts that 's very reason to have a contract at hangar and hangar and hangs around I 'm very confident that it speaks if the relationship between Solis what the option all these money has to be the budget must be a magnet budget because the ministers TPM it could really make sure the so you have done wasting money well that 's done thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion Council Abdur yep I would be supporting this motion and it 's a minor change in terms of the delegation amount from 400 to 500 K basically as everybody has highlighted that this is going to reduce decision-making cycle time so better efficiency in decision-making also the monitoring and control structures have to be in place to ensure that this delegation is not misused and we don 't have those structures and processes in place personally based on on my last one years experience I between the CEO in councilor relationship I am very confident I have not seen any instances where this Authority has been misused or translated nice so I 'm confident that this delegation will not have any adverse effect and I and there 's a trust in confidence and I think there 's a step further to the efficiency in questions it 's a very modest change so I 'll be supporting that motion Thank You councillor councillors very Thank You mr. mayor look that I 've heard the comments from my fellow councillors and ultimately issues like this we 've heard comments that other councils have a higher value some have a lower value that really doesn 't concern me I don 't make decisions based upon what the status quo is with other councils I 'll make decisions based upon what I think is right what makes it passes the sniff test and the sniff test is rolled up in the fact that there has to be an element of trust trust confidence it 's only as some would say well it 's only 100,000 yes but to the right player out there that want to know where we 're going up with and you know the argument that we 're going to make things a lot smoother the while I don 't necessarily agree with that because I 've been a council for four years and I know that actually five years now but actually I can say that council process is still de Bourgh ously slow laborious less like and that 's something that the red tape and we get drowned and it 's got to give the CEO every opportunity to turn that around because we can say that people wipe extra time for contracts but I could reel of half a dozen which haven 't even sort of have really moved along even with the delegation that we 've got it 's a let 's hope with a leap of faith that 's kind of changed thank you thank you councils against the motion councils anyone we should just speak against the motion for the motion counselors summer yeah will agree with capitalized on this opening comments that is a very important document I 'm not a hundred percent sure that it 's a necessity for us to increase the delegation I remember it was around this time at their last council that we increased the delegation to three-quarters of a million dollars of the last CEO and I remember also moving to reduce that allocation to four hundred thousand a little later on and the reasoning behind that was to pull back and to give us some control of these financials on the pulse I actually think it 's our role as effect as elected officials to make sure than anything over 400,000 is brought to our attention for a decision I don 't think that that is unreasonable we hear from previous councillor gonna Ryan about the old days when councillors were up until midnight ticking off all of the decisions no matter how small they were now I 'm not saying we need to go back to that but I do think that we need to remember that there should be a balance and I will vote for this and time will tell if we made the right decision Thank You councillor any other council wishing to add comments against the motion or the motion back to you counselor hazel and Freddie closing comments yeah Thank You mr. mayor look there was one where that councillor Patterson said which took place almost encapsulate the whole discussion he talked about the budget and the budget authorizes all of our expenditure we kind of enemy an approved budget correct and to implement that budget there 's a range of delegations that on a regular basis the documentation comes through the council meeting we see what has been spent how it 's been spent in the few minutes time we 're going to get a report in relation to where our first quarter financials are all of that sort of things so we do have everything is on the pulse if that 's not enough though there 's also a very formal review process in fact this there 's an internal audit process and an external audit process the council 's internal audit has four independent independent and quite significant members of our community sit on that that order and they review monitor and oversight all of our operations and on top of that the external auditor is the Victorian order general they go through our reports with a fine-toothed they do any suggestion of irregularity and propriety would be picked up in all of those processes but it also means this through this instrument of delegation we can review this at any given time if there was any opportunity that we thought yeah look we could do this a little bit another look at it and vary the delegation demands well said council thank you very much all in favor councillors against motion carried [Applause] item nine point six councillors the instrumentation delegations are members of staff and development hearings panel we have a recommendation on page one one six sorry one one five and one one six we 'll have a council I wishing to move emotion in respect to item nine point six thank

mr. mayor they 're one of one additional thing that still exists as if we need to have special council meeting we can to discuss any urgent business thank you for pointing that out thank you any council or we should just speak against dispersion yes mr. mayor I 'll offer my annual token opposition to to this I just don 't think it is a particularly good look but for effectively for two months we 're not going to make and I know it 's been said that January is traditionally a fairly quiet month but from memory in the last couple of years we 've been required to hold a special meeting in January because there has been business that need to be dealt with holding a special meeting isn 't necessarily the answer to everything that we need because a special meeting the only items that can be discussed are those items that are on the agenda unless with the agreement of all councillors so it 's it 's a it 's a limiting restricting structure my preference would always have been that we schedule an ordinary meeting of council in the January it might be a very short meeting and white have very little business but it provides a great deal more flexibility than the fallback position of holding a having a special meeting Thank You councillor hazel and for that any other councillor wishing to speak full of motion against council sutton any closing comments all in favor against Russian carry thank you item 1.1 Christmas arrangers I was ahead of myself before we have a recommendation on page 131 to have a counselor wishing to remove counselor Jeb and Eddie Thank You mr. mayor I 'd

2018 thank you do I have a second to place council Abdullah Jenna so jebin any as had told only happens at this period it 's last staff to have a breakout of the Christmas period and I think what we 're doing is following on from previous decisions to play tonight counseling that I should be closing Elvis Thank You councillor Abdullah any comments it 's a pretty straight forward motion most of the businesses and most of the organization utilize this shutdown period 10 days so I think that 's aboard this thank you any counselor wishing to speak against this motion hold the motion Council of medicines [Music] thank you any other counsel we can just speak against full back to you counselor jiminy I 'll counsel Patterson fifty-mile here then saying that there will be a movement to stop a viable if members of the community needed good thank you all in favor of the motion against motion carried yeah item 10.1 Australia Day grants 2017 there is a recommendation on page 133 councillors do we have anyone wishing to be of immersion counselor hours very Thank You mr. may I 'd like to move the recommendation on page 133 in relation to the trade a grants have a seconder please councillor is self-explanatory in a lot of ways that it 's councils giving the opportunity for various small communities around the great Shepherd an area funding to celebrate Australia Day a truly important day and I can 't but help reflect on the the absurdity of some of our fellow councils around the the country that have tried to demean this I think Australia days critical I say long-standing councillor attending the dookey Australia Day celebrations with in fact is a fantastic day to see like-minded community people getting out there and enjoying and celebrating the essence of what Australia Day is all about and I long and hope that that continues in that we as a council continue to support it through these great Thank You counselor counselor Keefer thank you I absolutely agree we can tell virus and I think this is a wonderful day to bring the communities together you can see by our recommendation the groups that have come together a lot of our service clubs a lot of our community groups so I think really supporting them on this particular day is if knowledge meant of 's a great day for Australians regardless of nationality or culture Thank You Council on any councilor we should just speak against dispersion for the motion Council summer Oh movie it 's making folder motion there 's been a bit of commentary around what other councils there anyone this is about the grounds we are staff in the graphs have that clear but this does point to the fact that anyone who potentially might say that this council is too politically correct can think again obviously coming from someone who has a great deal of privilege when it comes to Australia Day but I do encourage any display of patriotism Australia 's a is an opportunity to celebrate under the same umbrella and that is regardless of backgrounds it should be a proud day for all Australians should be proud take the first Australians should be proud day for Colonials it should be a proud day for visitors it should be a proud day for everyone and maybe that 's a pipe dream but I I just can 't imagine someone not enjoying a sausage by barbecue and just getting we 're at acknowledging that there are major flaws and moving forward I was reminded this is about the recommendation that the motion was moved to whether the council adopt the recommendation is straight a grants assessment panel to from the Australian a veg to the total value of nine thousand ninety six dollars understood and one of these days I hope that they might be a bigot beer can regatta on Victoria Park Lake marvelous thank you very much [Music] and that is the highest amount is what Marvel 's thanks councilperson any other counsel will just speak against full counsel Abdullah yep just a very small I would say benign comment mutual victor else is not a thing that we 've got seen applicants as of last year except arcadia committee of management so it 's good to see the continued interest of those applicants but perhaps it will be 80s it perhaps it will be good if we can encourage other community groups and new applications in in next year and maybe extend the scope to other towns as well yes Thank You Council on counsels against person thinking about spoken yes it 'll president mounts that seem like a lot of money but they really assist those communities in making that a very special day and as other have alluded to it is a very special day and we should continue to celebrate it so however small the amount of money is on it adds to the event and that 's to the community feel around that special day so while that being said back to you count as far as very for any closing comments Thank You mr. mayor and not to the main one to juror office the Dukie breakfast provided by the country events visited rifle it 's a big thank you maybe we can this year we can switch it around we 're in favor councillors against motion carried now item two point two councillors on page indeed Thank You councillor Hazelwood [Applause] now councils on page 142 there 's a recommendation in relation to the adoption of amendment C 199 investigation area one this one area one feasibility study study and master plan Grady seven City Council October 2017 the document 29 of planning and bar enacted 1987 and for submit amendment C 199 to the Minister of Planning for firming and accordance with section 31 the firepower of the planning and brought electron donation Thank You Council whoever 's taken to place and it 's what a cave now counselor Patterson would like to speak to the motion [Music] good thank you careful okay I just said brief comment that we 've had lots of briefing and information you regard to this recommendation is all stated here that I support thank you any council we should just break against the motion for the motion Council Abdulla just like to make some comments around my understanding of this recommendation which this motion which I will be supporting basically the 799 amendment addresses the issues of barriers to incremental approaches to development in investigation area one now this plan is kill me can only be approved by the Minister for planning and the latest status of season nine line is that an independent panel appointed by the minister has revealed the amount and objections ezreal and subsequently released a report recommending severe of independent parents findings of course with the suggested modifications now the members area that council has three rows planning authority as a responsible authority and then it also acts as a municipal council to carry out statutory functions under local government act 1989 so the council acts role as a primer authority is required to founded by the Minister for planning is very similar great for the gossip I don 't have a balanced recommendation is Amaya vs the safest and the lowest and most reasonable garden also though since analysis decision is in front by the Venice recommendations I don 't see much reason if the gossip that why the council should not adopt panels recommendation sorry in view of this understanding Thanks Thank You counsel any other council would you speak against for the motion counselor is Valley Thank You mr. mayor if it was not for the independent planning panel I would have continued to strenuously fight against this matter being here purely and simply because the Planning panel has identified what I long considered to be deficiencies in the manner in which the council conducted for those who are not familiar planning is the most convoluted technical exception to the exception process that you can possibly imagine when it comes to trying to separate the wheat from the chaff and to a extent I felt vindicated by the fact that the fundamental premise that the planning panel identified which is the cornerstone of council and community is consultation the Lando 's and I read from the planning panel report page 16 the landowners within investigation area one have felt disenfranchised and disengaged these are not my words these are the independent planning panel reporting and both Council and the Golden Valley hardest group Racing Club need to work now work hard and effectively to gain back the trust and support of its local community I hope that this council listens to what has been put in that report this fact was illustrated in some point by the fact that the master plan was even labeled specifically to the Golden Valley harvest group Racing Club and not the broader area one anybody 's taken the time to read through it it reflects that council should at the impression that they 're trying to counsel is trying to slide something through through the auspices of planning I 've done a lot of reading in relation to this and other planning things that I would say if it was not for the independent planning report which actually highlights some of the things that council could have done better I wouldn 't have supported this replica amendment going through Thank You counselor any other council we can just speak for the motion for the motion thank you council summer you will no have objected along the way in this process I didn 't think that our approach would hold over at VCAT considering most of our decisions were based on a flood study that was very new we hadn 't finished the flood study and it hadn 't been cross-checked or endorsed by the relevant bodies and that was the basis of the decision-making so I 'm thankful now that it has gone to a panel and that 's the panel that 's going to be advising the minister and they have somewhat agreed that that newest flood study take that flood study into account but it doesn 't hold as much weight as I believe we were we were applying to it earlier so yep we 've had the checks we 've had the balances I 'm comfortable now that we 've got that extra layer of liability protection if it ever did go severe cats and I 'm more than happy to accept the panel 's recommendations I 'm not so convinced though and I 'm not sure I agree that there has been inadequate public consultation which is something that the panel decided was an issue because we have been there through the entire process and I 've seen the back and forth and to and fro my objections weren 't based on our conduct it was simply that the flood study in my opinion did quite add up Thank You counselor any other councillor wishing to speak against the motion for the motion Council something and laser both said because I was for similar opinion and I just feel a bit vindicated when we hear that the master plan is only a reference document and so I think that 's a very good point that 's been put in the plan that the panel report came out with thank you thank you any other council we just speak for or against the motion I don 't think you counsel up Edison like any closing comments I 'm glad it 's going to play until now will we and we can look and see what happens for me there 's lots of arguments in that panel they can 't there 's water in there and that 's going to urge OPI and we can finally get this clarified county council person that will go to the minister now not to the panel but that is a penile report well all that being said all in favor of the motion against the motion carried as far as why would you like to collect their colleague place [Music] Tripta good authority Mary darling right references Thank You counselor Haseman now item 10.3 we have a recommendation on page 150 in respect to the murray-darling basin there I may pick up that error that 's where it should be committee nomination councillor Dennis Patterson there 's a recommendation there who would like to remove emotion please councillor O 'Keefe three murray-darling Basin Authority based on community committee nomination counselor Dennis Patterson the recommendation being that the council endorsed the nomination of councilor Dennis Patterson to the murray-darling Basin Authority basin community committee 150 noting the word Association has been replaced by the word Authority correct thank you radio notes the basin plan aims to achieve a healthy and productive River system obviously something counts the Patterson enjoys immensely I think you will enjoy this role if successful great Thank You councillor juvinity Thank You mr. mayor I think Gary castle Patterson is the obvious choice anyone on this council because he spends more time on both rivers the rest of us know far more about that anywhere else here so I fully endorse councilor Patterson 's nomination to be yeah authority Thank You councillor any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion you can position of authority I do I do believe on position that I I can see the basin Texas area from both sides environment we have adapted by rules laughter irrigated good thank you know the council was just being against all fall back to you counselor keep any closing comments a closing comment that counsel Patterson is currently representing counts as part of the murray-darling Association therefore has experienced that in relation to the murray-darling basin and understanding of the impacts of the greater Shepherd in the stakeholders good thank you all in favor of the motion counsels against motion carried item ten point for round 1 2017 2018 mana and major events grants so with

community is in our community and also that council is very supportive for that community so every single one of these events is going to be terrific and I hope to attend every single one thank you don 't cancel ok absolutely agree with cancel some of their the list of events bring tourism and attraction to our region and many lists that have become an iconic annual event the Albanian harvest festival for example now running for more than 15 years and attracting over 3,000 people from Victoria interstate shows the success of these type of events and also the revenue that brings to our community so well done to these some events and we 're so grateful and also willing to support them well thank you any councillor we should just speak against this motion full-immersion your favor

community with 40 celebrating in this case the joy of a species including creatures the new needs and summary Council but we just confirmed that it 's actually the recommendation on page one six 164 only there 's 164 the recommendation that you remove the motion is on one page 64 just a technicality [Applause] [Music] thank you careful person good Cancellara 's very thank you in counselor we should just make against troll back to you counselor Patterson all in favor counselors against motion carried now item ten point six is important they were important but this is actually important ask of government councils do we have a council wishing to move a a recommendation on page 171 councillor Giovannetti on page 171 is a motion that the council receive it like the ask for government for the 2018 state government alleged second please you like councillor hazel and you 're beaten over here on the right by council hours very actually okay there that 's up so council lady you in counselor given any thank you for timaya this effectively I suppose it briefly is council 's wish list that we will put to err where our local us like Parliament members as well as any other applicants we were going for any of the various government positions at the next election just briefly our list consists of the construction of the gullibility highway passenger rail services further investment to revitalize the CBD God belly health routed out the stage to Panera Center Shepherd and sports stadium shipping an airdrome relocation governed regional partnership priorities Greater Victoria Commonwealth Games and Sheppard an education plan and CV link people may think was a beagle is to put out to Phillip Island parents to whether to support us but the fact is that we of getting any money because we never know at any stage when our Minister happens to pick up on this document and I 'll see that something it relates to maybe to ship in an education plan you might be money available something there I can really recognize I can look at and use to hopefully fund these projects just allergic councils I think we 're aware there was some issues with the formatting of the documentation so the numbers don 't flow in any great order well we will add the 12 just some numbers missing so might a point more correct than that yes I think mr. me you think you didn 't date thank you Cancellara 's Mary Thank You mr. mayor I think it 's a brilliant idea and the same springs to mind ask and you shall receive so this is a classic example where we will leave the federal and state government in no doubt exactly what we would thank you any counselor wishing to speak against for the motion counselor heisman Thank You mr. mayor look cam there 's a bit of divided the project should be not notified some people argue that it 's better to have a very targeted and strategic approach identifying one or two projects and chase those as vigorously as you can and because there aren 't there is some merit in that argument but I 'd be in the camp that supports having a comprehensive list because then you 've got the flexibility when talking with government talking with other organizations often the thing that you think is the highest priority will be out of the game because of the cost is attached to it but government and various departments may well have a lesser amount of money that can fund your seventh rates type of project so I think if you 're looking at the the one or two specific targeted type approach that 's the all-or-nothing approach I tend to think we need to have a very comprehensive range of projects and a good solid business case to support each and every one of them okay Thank You councillor councils wishing to speak against full council Abdulla I 'd like to come in Council on the ask of comment and identifying a consolidated list of 12 key projects I fully support all these projects and believe that leadership attend deserves number one margin for number two enhanced quality education and health services for its people it also deserves opportunities for economic environmental sustainability as well as enhanced and enriched socio-cultural aspects of region so all these projects are pretty comprehensive and they are covering different aspects of the economic growth and development of our region so once again I congratulate Council on taking a lead and preparing this document Thanks Thank You councillor any other councillors speaking against the motion please okay thank you sir mouthing it 's also important to notice that the document was also in partnership with the community so that we are engaging and getting feedback it 's also reflecting to me very much that we need to work very closely with our MPs and I think we are I think we 're engaging much better and I think it 's important to continue to do so thank you councillors speaking against none for them councillor Patterson you don 't know wide scope for this sort of enterprise for funding coming we 'll jump in we 'll grab it don 't worry about that if we had have gone with to project just a placement had more than to be bypassed and the Shepherd of the CBD development five years ago we 're still sitting there asking for money for them we 've got nothing so this is a lot better way to go I believe we out there and I think the man was telling us Thornton took Pauline Melbourne Journal and he has potential to be Minister for air ground for lack of a better word the transport and he said I 've just got your document I think you can select anywhere the councillors but we should just make against full council summer uh yeah I 'm gonna mention the long list as well there was some criticism but again I agree with everybody it all comes out of different buckets and if the list is long it 's because of we 've it 's due to decades of political neglect I mean there are suggestions out there favors but maybe council just haven 't been clear enough in what we need so lists like these are terrific you know comparable councils like Bendigo get six hundred million for recent hospital upgrades and we 're lucky enough to have an independent who secured 160 million for the first stage of the hospital upgrade but we still need stage to the CBD has been waiting five years since the first stage for that upgrade and at this stage of the first stage will be in ruins before we even start the second stage we 've applied three times for funding and been knocked back every time so it 's disappointing but this list will put the CBD front and center as a major priority for economic and community health so yeah it 's a clear list it 's up to a lot of other tiers of government to run with some of these things we cannot deliver them on our own but every single one of these projects has merits it 's not in order but we do want to see some action because that 's what we do is what we desert Thank You counselor you know the council would just bake against the motion for the motion well I think your unspoken calls baked down now in spoken against the motion as well but this different attention this list is pretty closely related to our council plan no you 're agreeing that Council Planning Council plan is a direct directly from the state government that says you will form a council plan for they exfoli years to set your strategies and direction so to say that the list is too long it 's pretty much in line with that and as everyone here spoken tonight refining at that of two or three major asks or nothing is done as much service over the many years of the past so I think this is a good strategy and I think they will actually work from my point of view I know that myself and the C I travel to Melbourne and wherever Canberra and a regular basis and the conversations that ensure conversations that sometimes aren 't actually scheduled full and if you have a bevy of these 'll be amazed how things can progress a lot quicker than you may have imagined so I fully support that back to you counselor Jeff and Eddie mr. Earley it 's all fine coverage but really I 'll take those men you you don 't want to add any further comments correct all in favor the motions against Russian Kelly Marty ten points seven councilors this is just a minor minor on subject coming up in shipping trucking Transport Museum and that is a lot of people now in our public gallery each and I could have been if I were two hours late for this item to come come to to the fall so it has so counselors we have our recommendation on page 176 to have a counsel wishing to move counsel germinating Thank You mr. mayor I would like to move the recommendation on page one seven six with the addition of two words if Murray can pick them up emotionally that the council provided in principle support the shipping and trucking transport museum project contentions on demonstration that all other funding has been secured from the a business case approved by council the demonstrates viability compliance with councils legal requirements acceptable governance structures and warrants a financial contribution of up to 1.3 75 million including GST from Council think against that we call me on the motion as printed in the recommendation with your dish of towards a seconder please look at Council a bill I just beat you counsel present counsel Jeff and Eddie which also speaks of ocean hey thank you sir mayor this is a huge project for shipping we had the opportunity to listen to mr. Andreas and mr. Hill when they came to brief us on this particular project as we are all aware ship and Zeppelin is the largest trucking area within the state and possibly even Australia this concept is to establish a truck and transport museum down at Emerald Bank as a tourism opportunity its immense those of us who have actually had the opportunity to have a look at the truck museum up in Alice Springs Arkansas easily see the benefits that it will bring to the town in relation to tourism and it 's good to truck museum in Alice Springs are going to be assisting shipping group one of the other benefits that was discussed at the briefing was the option that the local group are looking out of putting solar panels on the the three they decide that they are going to cover for the the truck museum and the purpose of those panels is to pump power back into the grid and what monies is made from that and in the estimate we were given was between two hundred and fifty the two hundred and sixty thousand dollars would go back into the community via a Community Fund or something similar I think it 's a fantastic opportunity there are a number of eyes to be dotted and T 's to be crossed but I think the motion that we put forward tonight certainly enables council to work with the truck and Transport Museum to ensure that all of those issues are sorted the reason why that this particular item has has gone through quite quickly is the truck and Transport Museum need to make applications have come with Gavin for funding that before going further Thank You castle I was just seeing with it your three minutes were out of it now you 're far from it council abdullah I think after the glossary of Nettie has very sort of because it has given a good reef of the project and the context and what is this recommendation aiming to do in Prince I think the I would support this project given that the recommended connotations are met and I would repeat that it 's the recommendation is contingent on demonstrate the immigrants will support to the shepherding truck and transport museum project is contingent on demonstration that all other funding has been secured from Victorian government federal government and private industry and umberto that the project has a business case that 's approved by council that demonstrates viability and compliance with councils legal requirements and it 's like the the government structure is in place so I think these two conditions to do put council in a in a in a relatively safe [Music] environment and low risk environment so will be I will be I 'll be inclined to support where the council is is going for partnerships with local businesses and community and projects such as these which basically visible tangible towards the towards the achievement of our shared goal and it is insured goal they want to we we say that great things happening go to share button and we want to make this place among livable place and we want to attract visitors from outside arrangement people should come here live here work here and enjoy the this region so the doughnut places of interest like this proposed project is all for to to sort of come and visit and see the attractions that this place offers so in that sense it 's its main it invites why it should be supported of course Sheridan plays a key role in transportation of goods movement of trucks so I think it 's very this region and this site is very well placed to have museum travel as far as I understand it will be one of the unique facilities in Victoria we don 't ever I 'm using another spring but in Victoria to be one of a said that I wish all the best to this project and I would be supporting it Thanks Thank You councillor any council we should just be against this motion for the motion Thank You mr. Mann I absolutely agree with what 's been said I can perhaps capitalize is a bit more simplified in a few words innovation tourism and economic opportunity I mean they 're the things we definitely need to look at more tourism here in shepherding it 's you know we do fantastic sporting events we bring lots of money in that space we need new space in tourism and this is an opportunity so once we do the business case I 'm really hopeful I 'm hoping that this does come to fruition because it 's a wonderful wonderful opportunity to get tourists to ship it and you know to showcase what that truck and you know trucking industry has to offer and obviously it 's going to be supported nationally which is you know really promising so good luck to those involved and we 're hoping to you know really work well together and look councillor councillors we should just speak against for for council some against speaking okay but I 'm not exactly sure how I 'm going to vote but I 'm going to speak against just as a cautionary position so that people can hear both sides of what the argument could be do I think it would be good for Shepherd and yes I do do I think it 'll provide an economic boost yeah it probably will can we afford it I don 't know I don 't know if we can afford it we haven 't seen a business case we don 't know what 's going to suffer if we support this what we have to take away because we have one bucket of money we give with one hand we take away from another you haven 't actually seen what 's going to suffer if we support this project we already have plenty of other attractions in Greater Sheppard and we support Botanic Gardens for a pretty penny we 've got the same project coming up which is ten million dollars we 've got moving art or not so sure we 're getting bang for buck for being a private enterprises may actually work in Shepard ends advantage but again I 'd need to see a business case I 've never seen a project moved as fast as this one and I know that some counselors were talking about cutting green cutting the red tape moving ahead and if I if this was my first term on council I 'd be pretty excited about moving forward on something so fast but it wasn 't on our radar and we 've heard counselors say also hastened slowly if there 's no business case is it a matter of fools rushing in so I haven 't heard from the community outside of the people who have a immediate interest in this project getting off the ground so I need to have more time to go out there and talk to people and see what they think about us investing in another potentially but non viable projects I don 't know maybe I 've been here too long but hopefully if this does get through we will be very careful economic boost to all of the greater Shepherd in and good for the region Thank You counselor now think of because I spoke on counsel Patterson George speak for is talking about we need to say business card we need to make sure there 's funding from state and federal governments and until that happens this is a first step this is allowing this and I 'm very excited about the potential for this and what I really want to talk about is I believe me no Brian a star council support him to study and pull the Sun comes up which is government will tell us we can 't do that that 's fine school identities from when that happens but what what the talk about is affected each Evan we are such a self motivated group that in off their backsides may gamma get you start and this is one of several things that people in communities decide what pretend garbage and sometimes I 'm not saying to pay attention support but pretend gap there 's lots of other things kicked in and people are sorted I 'm and then organize this place terrific and I support this group behind the same yeah this issue he 's going to come up why then we might have to look at totally not how you desk right now but I don 't think we 've really liking to have a lot of people around like some of these disproved and we 'll put the hand up and little charm if this this gets up and running the one best things about checking on the airplane might die trip wait it 's an amazing opportunity we have this piece the other potential development walking in at present yeah might be died bit like the away games of humans Benjamin is one of our roads and routes reporter and the second one is when you look around the audience Thank You councillor any council wish to speak against the motion for the motion councillor hazily yep yeah this this is one of the more exciting project I think we 've seen come along in in many years and it ticks ticks so many boxes I particularly what I ticked off one was in successful operation but that 's certainly a plus for the environmental sustainability impacts I thought it was a it was a huge plus for this project potential to fund most if not all of their operational requirements through through the sale of power off the the solar panels on the roof and significantly the surplus funds or set of funds that may be generated through the soul of a save the solar power going back into the community via a foundation of some sorts I think this really ticks all the boxes it looks pretty good on the conservative side from the council we certainly haven 't given an open check with attached a few strings to it but I think what was also done he 's provided a degree of comfort to the proponents that they can now go to other levels of governments they can go to the philanthropic they go wherever they like and generate additional funds to support this project knowing that the council is supportive if they meet that criteria so I think it 's a project that we should get behind we should this comes to fruition Thank You councillor the other council wish to speak against for council certain öyour council sutton for beers that would be you can I think it 's a very exciting project and I 'm looking forward to it being completed I think we 're the perfect place for truck museum with their tracking history and all the people that have contributed to that tracking history will be represented out there which i think is a wonderful thing for Shepherd in and its inhabitants thank you seein is that no other councils we need to speak yes counselor or as I would like to speak for the motion Thank You mr. mayor look I fully respect Council with summers healthy cynicism because I and I was somewhat of a disadvantage of going around to the briefing you know and I wasn 't exactly falling about the place in relation to it because of the fact that it 's a private enterprise and council being asked to effectively stump up some money but the thing that brings me companies is council a pattern as councillor Patterson is identified balances in place here that have to happen before we go anywhere we effectively Council is the link in the chain which starts the whole process going so from that point of view I think potentially it 's going to fantastic for shipment for all the reasons that my other fellow councillors have identified and the potential is limitless Thank You councillor now thanks to counsel us somehow I 'm net will have to actually get into my chair and ask for a tip you take this will I speak to the motion so used to speak anyone wish to speak against motion or for the motion but I can speak for a motion madam chair very good no issues here counselor some are sent away we may be entering to something that a business case obviously if you read the motion it clearly states that this is contingent upon it doesn 't say that I 'm sure that 's is that that said let 's understand a few things ridership has identified many many years ago that we must prepare our attractions obviously the same complex will be built trying to for us we understand that the Commonwealth Games but that 's also a proof of how we are innovative observing counselor or as very stable counsel Patterson that 's what we do here in Greater Sheppard and say this this idea should it be no I think coming around about 10-15 years ago it 's not earlier it 's here today finally yes there 's concerns when we won 't be entering into this blindly it has to be a business case that we 're happy and obviously the government 's model I 'm sure all those details [Music] in principle support I think should be given so I 'm gonna head back this modified participative it 's terrible carefully driven Eddie would you like any closing comments yes Thank You mr. mayor look the comments of the other councillors have made I think reflect how much we as a council group support this particular project the issues that councillor summer has identified I believe are covered in the motion without any issue whatsoever I think if we look at the success of the ship and a motor an adjunct to that I think if people get the people who are involved with the tracking Transport Museum the quality of those people and the ability as the mayor mentioned before council Patterson that they can get things done so I think a great group who are involved with this particular project and with our support to kick it off I 'm very hopeful that they can create what will be a significant tourist attraction for Shepparton Thank You councillor all in favor of the motion councillors against motion carried

George 's Road area Bell the point there counselor Patterson would anyone like to speak against the motion for the motion any closing comments can such a vanity well take it to the vote please all in favor now we go to item 10.1 community sustainability grants rounds 1 2017 2018 on page 42 do I have a council wish to move the recommendation as the motion it 's a Abdulla I would like to move the motion recommendation on page 42 as motion it says that that the council adopt the recommendations of the community sustainability grants assessment panel to fund the following for sustainability grants to the total value of 8500 47 GST inclusive and there 's a list of four applications that have been successful thank you can sell Jolla would you like to speak to the motion yeah I would like to say that it 's so pleasing to see that these sustainability grants have been initiated and the sustainability team and our waste team risk management team have teamed up basically to contribute towards this grant fund and and to encourage community to to contribute in a positive way and to contribute towards the goals of having sustainable environment and waste minimization with minimization is an important objective so it 's good to see that that this that we have received applications however I do notice that we received only five applications out of which four was successful for this grant and I do hope that in future more and more community members become aware of this this support and this funding grant that 's available so that they can take sort of concrete steps towards making our environment better so clean clean and clean go to Shepperton we are all aiming for and I think I 'm Council has made a good has shown the support behind these activities thank you for those comments council abdullah council to say that it 's a shame that one of these did miss out and that was teacher a community house for their cubby shade sale and they requested two thousand dollars which is quite a substantial amount of money for someone like the community house and not all that much money for us unfortunately it didn 't fit into the criteria of what we were looking for in terms of community sustainability grants and i think that 's a shame i think perhaps if if shade sales aren 't included then maybe we need to go back and have a look at what criteria we are using because as the climate heats up this sort of infrastructure around the municipality is going to be more and more in demand and if we have communities houses and all of the rest of the community groups bringing attention to it ourselves then bring attention to it ourselves then these grant processes would be a great way of getting it done thank you very much and for summer anyone wish to speak against the motion and he council like to speak for sense we 'll go to the boat those in favor against motion carry we 're now going to item 10.2 adoption of amendment c 197 anomalies and adopted strategies on

speak to the motion this has been going on for quite a while it 's a subdivision out there in the edge of the timber Township it 's a beautiful piece of land or not pretty well I drove past it very regularly I 've had their issues with the flooded over layer course which wasn 't any too serious but in the bushfire overlay come along that really set them back any way that I 've done a lot of work and now it 's been kicked off with all the relevant authorities and it 's right to go so there 's a ticketed no zone I would certainly encourage my fellow councillors to support it and it 'll allow that little town of Lambert to grow without getting too big and it 's spoiler but certainly go would you like to speak to the motion just keep that I concur with councillor Patterson relation to the development options now available to tell amber Township Council Patterson said it 's a great little town and I 'm just trying to remember from memory things about 13 blocks going to be a most viable through this subdivision thank you and I think that 's great for the town to progress its kids into the school as well as improve the township facilities Thank You councillor ship and Eddie to put any council like to speak against the motion for the motion any closing comments councillor Patterson will now go to the vote all in favor against motion carry we now go to item 10 for the 2017 international engagement progress two dates on page 67 the council note the outcomes the Tron delegation endorsed the actions within the China report 2 9 September 2017 Thank You cancer and do I have a seconder please cancel aza varriya council Adam would you like to speak to the motion I think all councillors have seen the report and I won 't give you a brief outline of the actual engagement policy progress to date so obviously we 've been to China two times now in nearly a 12-month period the most recent visit as executive summary highlights I think one of the greatest achievements of these trips is that the protocols that were just announced on 9th November this is the start of group protocols for our region I think personally is probably the most important change in this fruit industry in 70 or 80 years I don 't know whether the water community really grasped the impact that this will actually have now I would love to claim credit and you CEO and the visitors who went with us but I have no doubt that we had a significant input into that read in regard to meeting with not only the Chinese delegation or the government officials that had some important to this but also strangely enough we had to go to China to form a closer ties with the Australian and business Victoria it 's just the way it worked out so having said all that the relationships that and such as the the fruit industry that we have capitalized on as councils all know let Emir that we have upwards of 300 million dollars worth of solid investments waiting for the trigger to be pulled here in greater shepherding whether that happens or not in the same amount that we expected to happen till that all is it will be determined by objectors and all the process it needs to be gone through but having said that I personally believe this engagement gee national engagement strategies worked far beyond out actually dreams at the beginning of this we I don 't think we believed that would be this far down the track to be quite honest so it 's too great policy I encourage everyone the wider community radio reported they can get access to it and we 'll just go into bigger and better things in the future thank you cancer Adam for that great update on that as well cancer as a very would you like it make any comment we don 't like to speak against the motion for the motion any closing comments counsel against motion carries and now go to item 10.5 planning for sustainable animal industries on page 72 I have a council wishing to move the recommendation as the motion please answer Patterson what would you like to me that the council receive a note the submission is relating to proposed planning reforms for sustainable animal industries thank you for that council person do I have a second to please cancel Jeff and Eddie Council Patterson would you like to speak to the motion quickly summarizing it 's probably tried some legislation that is trying to separate city from country-folk lots of ways that 's where the two are meeting with animals that 's becoming a bit of a problem this will give them more more owners on the people shifting into the areas where there 's a farming zone thank you cancer Patterson cancer jibin any would you like to speak to them I want you to speak against the motion for the motion any closing comments councillor Patterson thank you will now go to the vote all in favor against motion carried I go to item 10.6 implementation of 1 9 3 on page 9 I 'm sorry on page 77 and 78 do I have a council wishing to me the recommendation as the motion and so summer what would you like to move in the recommendation on page 77 and 78 as it reads Thank You council summer do I have a seconder please cancel hasten and council summit ii we should speak to the motion I think the implementation of this is the culmination of accumulation of a lot of hard work and a lot of analysis of where we 're at as a city center there 's some recommendations in this that will prioritize high-density living within the center which is great because we do have an urban sprawl which is impacting on things like youth retention and car use so that 's just the tip of the iceberg we 're also looking at cinemas and trying to condense cinemas within the CBD and not having them in external areas which could draw people away so CBD is front of mind I love most of the recommendations in this and I 'll be more than wish to seek to the motion in other ways this is a rather complex and particularly if you read through the rap the the motion has moved point by point amendment C 192 essentially implements the greatest Shepherd and commercial activity center strategy which is adopted back in November of 2015 and then C 193 is combined rezoning and proposal from let 's cook for a development in the north so for costs and logic reasons it was the panel that MEP considered both amendments and the submissions that were made to them and the recommendation that we 're in the motion that we should be adopting today outlines the deliberations of the panel and somewhat complex outcome in terms of unusual I don 't recall seeing it before that the second part of the amendment C 193 was split away we 've got one the public acquisition overlay relating to two drainage and part two which is the low score proposal which has been consideration has been deferred for a period of time to allow other activities potentially to occur so it 's a rather unusual panel report and I think people will understand the logic behind it thank you cancel Haseman to have a cancer that we should speak against the motion for the motion any closing comments counselor summer yes I think perhaps um even though I moved it I didn 't realize it had such specific specific points about the IgA development so and to work out how this melds in with the next motion um yeah even though I moved it I might not be able to support that motion after all hey wait they will go to the vote all in favor against motion carried now can simply go to item 10.7 the IGA states your planning application we have had a change which will actually put up on the board behind me here in relation to at the IGA stage to application planning application number 217 177 section ten point seven of the agenda I wish to note the following on Friday 17th of November 2017 the permit applicant filed a failure to determine appeal at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal as a result of the vehicle application Council no longer has is proposed and sets council 's position at the future via proceedings officers recommend that if council had the ability to do so it would have refused the application and revised recommendation has been circulated to councillors and he 's on the screen do I have a council wishing to move that recommendation as the motion recommendations emotion is displayed on the screen Thank You council Haseman do have a second to please councillor Patterson councillor through you madam mayor if the council goes to the vcap proceeding without an adopted position what affected that does this have mic on yeah I might refer to mr. car was to give us a comment in relation to that she has done previously inst officers how we will respond v cat had answered your question berry so i was still looking for a second down cancel house would you like to speak to the mission you think you made me look this is not an unusual circumstance that in the past when we 've had this situation arise where an applicant has taken the council to feed cat on the basis that days yeah I did know too that the application was lodged on the day that the agenda for the ordinary council meeting was published so it 's not surprising that this action has taken place we are the responsible Authority and on precedent it would be remiss of council if we didn 't appear at the cat would be represented and have a position if we had have had been in a position to consider the application the officers recommendation would have been to refuse and this simply provides them with the tools to now adequately and appropriately represent the council at VCAT and pursue the report as published in our agenda and the outcome that they originally proposed Thank You councillor hazel and councillor Patterson would use to speak to the motion oh very well thank you would any council like to speak against the motion counselor someone yeah I don 't actually think we should be trying to refuse this application and I think it 's quite at odds with the recommendation that we 've just passed the recommendation we 've just passed has a deferral consideration by to work with council to determine the capacity of the site to provide a second full line supermarket and integration with surrounding land uses yet in this motion it says that council would have refused the applications so what was the six-month for was it just a token gesture and then we were going to say no anyway and that was already decided or why we suddenly sure that we would say no I think that 's a very pre-emptive decision on the part of this recommendation I think by the time it gets to the tribunal it 'd be 12 weeks and we 'll have more time to consider this I don 't think we should be supporting an application 500 meters down the road madam mayor it might be beneficial if mr. Cam 's could explain the distinction of what between the two motions Thank You councillor Hazen all of consideration of that matter for the six-month period to allow AGA the opportunity to secure and provide evidence of securing a second supermarket on their site and get a commuted tenant this particular item or what officers are of the the stage two proposal is premature the application was premature and that in the offices note in their report that if I GA able to secure a tenant within that six-month time period the C 193 part two proposed will come back to Council for further consideration about that a new application can be made for the second supermarket on the IgA site so it doesn 't preempt the landowners or developers from relaunching a fresh application when they 've actually secured a tenant for that particular site but at this stage the application needs to be dealt with I think perhaps that if we did allow this application to lapse that would be less Corpse opportunity to come and apply for their permit and considering there wouldn 't be any IgA application on the table v cap would almost certainly grant them five hundred meters down the road another supermarket I think it makes more sense to do whatever we can to consolidate an existing site and if they need more time to develop a structure plan then we should have given them we should just give any rush to secure another supermarket we 've got plenty within Greater Sheppard it and IgA have been part of this community for so many decades I just don 't think it 's unrealistic to wait a while and support them but it doesn 't go against the strategy to support IgA the strategy does not mention layers Corp specifically I just think that from a community 's perspective being the last independent supermarket in Australia that we should be giving them as much support as possible includ Thank You counsel summer but any kinds would like to speak forward the motion against the motion cancel something I just very true and I note that the panel recommended that it be split into two part one and a part two and the rezoning of the proposal was started in that part to be deferred until Council is satisfied that this is a best location for a second full line supermarket in Shepparton north so if we get a second supermarket on the IGA side then that meets with our commercial activity center strategy which is having everything on one side just makes sense to me just to have not considered this application until we actually know what idea is able to do thanking accounts for something and I 'm wishing to speak for the motion against the motion any closing comments council has a misunderstanding that the council doesn 't have the capacity at the moment to deal with this application we lost that up that opportunity come Friday what the council does happen which is the president in the past is if we were able to deal with it what the council 's position would have been and no doubt in other in other forums and other processes that we 've referred to previously 192 and 193 things will play out there as well as they will indeed here with this application which was about the redevelopment of the IgA site independent of the other considerations so it 's only appropriate that we do provide our officers with directions and that direction is to appear at live data be represented at VCAT and defend the position that would have been adopted if this had been considered by council Thank boat all those in favor against motion carried will now go to item 10.8 Lots subdivision in the general residential zone on page 115 116 117 and 118 which I have a council wishing to move the recommendation as the motion please find your pages there you can so Jeff and Eddie would you like to the recommendations begin Thank You seconder please Kaveri councillor given any would you like to speak to the motion before us initially there were some serious concerns from local residents abutting this particular property mainly due to the particular size of the subdivision which is only relatively small about 453 square metres and I 've also probably concur with some of those objectors that is a very small block but then I was told that we do have small the box here in shepherding the as far as I 'm concerned the big thing is that the developer has consulted with the relevant landowners adjacent to this particular property and those issues have now all been resolved by the developer showing the plans and it 's now up to the developer to ensure that the to the adjacent property owners Thank You counsel Jeff nearly canceled Suvari would you like to speak to the motion when any council like to speak against the motion for the motion it 's something we haven 't seen that often if at all but we 're going to see a lot more of it in the future a bigger town gets the more exotic towns have the bigger town gets the more attractive it is to find a large block of land and with two houses on it instead of one if you look at melbourne most of suburbs and Melbourne or the suburbs of Melbourne they have two houses and they used to have one there all those major cities have gone like that and it 'll continue to happen and it should happen to cuz of basically kick people in or moral confined area it 's easy for us to service them it 's easy with them to get to where they need to get to in town etc without cars and parking which we 'll cover sir so it is very important and um you there with the new estate out at the Lambuth is sort of half a page in for one house here there 's there 's four or five pages so it is complicated I realize that but it needs to happen and has to happen more Thank You councillor Patterson but any council wish to speak against the motion for the motion any closing comments councillor jebin it will take it to the vote all those in favor against motion carried now go to item 10.9 brady shepherd and heritage advisory committee adoption of terms of reference and nomination of community representatives on page 142 I have a council wishing to move the recommendation as the motion please answer Abdullah Al I 'll move the recommendation on page 140 as a motion it reads that the council head of the revised terms of reference for the greater Shepperton heritage Advisory Committee and having considered the nomination receipt for appointment to the Heritage Advisory Committee resolved to appoint the following community representative to the greater Shepperton heritage Advisory Committee for a term concluding on 17 july 2019 for cari Donaldson thank you Suvari cancel Julia we should wish to speak to the motion it is quickly that initially the the community representation we 've got three community representatives on the committee and there was this application from Carrie Donaldson that was received and they had the committee was very pleased to see to see an entrance interest from the community members around preservation of our heritage and that 's what this committee is all about so hence the the committee felt that it was it was and I felt that it was it would be very Donaldson could join because she brings with her a wealth of experience she 's got event management experience she 's got good contacts in the community and would be able to do to present some good suggestions to the committee on the issues of heritage preservation so that 's why there was a recommendation to amend the terms of reference which currently mentions three committee members three community representatives instead of four so with the update of this terms of reference it would be possible to from the community thank you thank you for those comments cancel summer I need to say that it 's great that we 've got so much interest that we actually have to amend terms of reference so that we can fit more people in Heritage can be quite controversial and the people who really value heritage want to be involved and that 's great to see Thank You council summer here one else wishing to speak against the motion for the motion any closing comments camps or jeweler events will now go to the boat all those in favor against motion carried we now go to item 10.10 the referral of solar farms to the Minister for planning on page one four six do I have a council wishing to move the recommendation as the motion Council it 's a very we 're still deciding to have a council wishing to move the recommendation as the motion please madam I 'll move that let 's print it on page 146 it 's not that long Thank You council director chief executive officer to write to the Minister of Planning requesting under Section 97 C of the Planning and Environment act planning applications referred to the minister in the greater Shepperton City Council local government area involving the minister point 2 for planning to establish a process that provides a fair and proper opportunity for all affected stakeholders to be heard Thank You councillor Adam I have a second please cancel hazel and council Adam do wish to speak to the motion so now as I spoke earlier in respect to our international engagement activities this activity is not just development from that but it 's also an indication of how valuable power is obviously we we all all aware of the rising cost of power so Shepherd and more greater shipping areas has been designated as one of the more adept in appropriate areas logistically I suppose for setting up this type of activity having said that they 're also a very active agricultural producing area that 's what underpins our whole economy here so I am fully supportive of solar farms and solar activity 1000% proposing or putting this towards the minister you mean the minister the ultimate responsibility for approving or declaring these types of applications we 're 'll prevent this council and the applicants being tied up in a lot of processes that could take many many months you 'll also discourage potential investors to our area knowing that there 's a long and convoluted process having said that I don 't think referring these type of applications to the minister will actually dilute the the result in the end so I 'm fully supportive of it and just quickly in reference to our prime agricultural land well we 've got a lot of pressure on us in respect to water as we all know there 's uh we went beginning in more water in their near future you 've not ever all so if you drive around their area you can see there 's a lot of farms that aren 't being irrigated anyway and the proposed actual percentage of properties that we 're proposing I think is less than zero five percent point zero five percent so I can 't see at this stage that this amount of activity will really impact on our arable land as such obviously moving into the future that can like to make come in you think about a minute one of the principal goals of our planning scheme is the protection of prime agricultural land and that 's going to cause some degree of tension and difficulty for officers in determining conflicting policies between energy production and agricultural production I note in particular the experience of the rural city of Wangaratta and the issues there where an objector took an additive decision for a 20 megawatt solar farm to VCAT and issues that caused and the response from the victorian government and i think it 's very appropriate that we are referring this to government for assistance in determining the future of how application to this type should be processed i think we can draw some analogies between other new technologies that have n introduced in particular say like wind farms or telecommunications towers in relation to wind farms the victorian government did develop a whole range of standards and and procedures and policies to be followed when assessing wind farms in the case of telecommunications the federal government under the Telecommunications Act determined the various standards that would that would apply in relation to solar farms effectively non-existent and we 've all had representations from people in recent times talking about potential impacts both positive and negative and I think it 's appropriate that we seek government assistance to develop the appropriate policies and procedures for dealing with these to ensure that in the future we agree on to be able to make informed decisions in relation to these projects thank you case Kensal Haysom and many council like to speak against the motion or the motion cancel Paterson yes I think from memory there was at least three other pieces of literature to go with this recommendation in the council suite just before and they will all basically dealt the same thing we need guidance from the state government here if I have policies pew wanted to do it develop a chicken barn what you 're led to once you can 't do Petrie 's or let 's start we need a paper that will allow us our offices and also the developers to see where it 's applicable to put one and the regulations around it in this area there 's lots of things that you hear about you don 't know some of the orchards to sign that 'll increase the temperature overnight in winter time by three or four degrees and that would be very detrimental to the orchardists because it doesn 't know their fruit to see if they need so many nights of frost to do that so when unexpected no electrical stuff so we need someone that has a lot of money to be able to spend some of that on the science of it all work out where they should be and where they shouldn 't be and that is then and we had Steph Ryan in today and she was saying something 's happened but a lot yeah so we need a statewide consensus on that and any way we can do that is through the state government and I 'd encourage them to to do it thank you cancel Patterson anyone wishing to speak against the motion for the motion cancel geben Eddie no matter mirror I concur with the with comments to the other counselors I think see this is really the tip of the iceberg we 've received something like 5 applications so far in relation to solar farms which are quite to a total generation of 270 megawatts of power state government has renewable energy targets that we 've supposed to achieve by 2050 before five thousand four hundred megawatts so there 's going to be a huge development in this particular area and I think that as other councillors have said it 's beholden upon us to put it back to the government to determine the procedural process for all solar farm applications Thank You councillor jebin Eddy any council wishing to speak against the motion for the motion Council summer I 'd like to move an amendment please madam me yes would you like to please tell us what that amendment is I 'd like to insert a dot point after right to the Minister of Planning so it reads right to the Minister of Planning requesting to work with the Minister to develop a strategy to balance the requirements of existing prime agricultural land and large-scale renewable energy applications do I have to speak against the amendment I 'd like to speak second dot point after write to the Minister of Planning requesting to work with the minister this is a third dot point or amendment to the second no no it 's another dot point in addition requesting to work with the minister to develop a strategy the balance the requirements of existing prime agricultural land and large-scale renewable energy applications what would anyone like to speak against the amendment she 's sorry I 'm sorry penny yes she can speak now thank you it 's just a minor adjustment even though it sounds long it 's really just minor it 's in support of everything that 's already been said the only thing is that the motion that 's put before us doesn 't actually mention strategy doesn 't mention policy it doesn 't mention procedures it just mentions that the minister will decide and the stakeholders will be heard now I understand that it 's early days but I think that 's really no excuse to get on to not get on the front foot we do need to yesterday we received a call from high-profile community member who suggested it 's an opportunity here and we could be more strategic and that local government is best primed to draw that line around appropriate locations for solar that doesn 't impose on prime land or devalue irrigation investments now I understand some of the argument around location is that solar farms prefer to be near the grid but that 's an argument that is across the board and quite negligible when you consider some of these are a hundred million dollars applications on plus so with the minister 's input and there 's no guarantee that the Minister will agree to this but it 's just a request there 's no harm done but perhaps the panel could determine an appropriate distance from the grid identify appropriate locations that are not prime agricultural land and then zone them accordingly which would further avoid objections or public backlash so it shows that we value agricultural land and in the words of the person who rang us yesterday you can shift a solar farm but you can 't shift irrigated prime would you like to speak to the amendment Thank You councillor Barry anyone wishing to speak against the amendment please what we call priming of because chalene how do we define it well the minister might define that for us things in the ordinary sense of the meaning through you madam mayor it is what it is it 's not rocket science okay anyone else wishing to speak for the amendment against the amendment will go to the boat all in favor motion lost sorry those against motion lost take the motion they 'll now back to the original motion do we have any counsels wishing to speak against or for the motion we 'll go to the votes I 'll sorry any closing comments on counselors thank you madam mayor I just want to reiterate there is a concern about obviously diminishing our arable agricultural land but as I noted earlier on when I move the motion at this stage I don 't think it 's of any consequence we are developing residential complexes but actually a larger than the proposed solar farms at this point yet that seems not raising much concern if you cancel out them okay we 'll go to the vote all those in favor against motion Kerry item 11 we have no tabled motions reports from Council or delegates to other bodies Neel received reports and special committees and advisory committees Neel received notice of motion dimensional recession we now go to 14.1 we have a motion trial free paid parking counts or something would you like to please read out your notice of motion on page 153 I 'd like to move the motion that counsel Undertaker to trial free time parking in all on street parking zones and shepherding for a period of six months from the 11th of December 2017 the effectiveness of this trial would be measured in a way which is to be determined prior to the implementation Thank You counsel something do we have a seconder please I 'm sorry maril foreshadow that if this motion is unsuccessful I will move that at the December ordinary meeting of council but a trial of free parking be considered in conjunction with the offices expert report a set of criteria Park Australia on the proposed redevelopment of the multi-bit car park Thank You councilman Noton we shall reach out to now speak to motion I put forward this notice of motion because I really believe that it would be beneficial to the central business sector to Shepperton and all businesses in this area at present this area is competing with free parking at Shepperton marketplace Riverside Plaza Archer Street Plaza ITA shopping centre Meru burner and satura they are also competing with other regional cities in both northern Victoria in the southern areas of New South Wales or bringing with tonga Griffith swagger etc a few years ago we were the envy of these cities the Shepherd and was known as the place to shop and do business sadly this is no longer the situation for our city centre free parking and there 's other regional centres in our own remote centres have enticed the customers away people don 't want to pay for parking and they won 't have available to go somewhere where it is free this may not be the only reason but it is certainly a the Shepherd and CBD and encouraging them to come into the city centre to stop shop stay and do business we shouldn 't have the impediment of parking meters keeping them away commercial properties in the CBD are charged a high rate in the dollar than out of other areas of Greater Sheppard in and the editing post of metered parking has created a disincentive for people to come into the city centre which is giving an unfair advantage to the other shopping precincts the CBD still has a high percentage of vacant shops and keeps an impression of decline as businesses don 't want to come into an area with high vacancy rate and little foot traffic a free tripod control may help alleviate this problem but we won 't know unless we proceed to do this I know with many with interest that many cities in cities in Australia a trialing free parking one way or another for example city of Adelaide to entice more people to visit Rundle now Frankston city looking at introducing some form of free parking wonderful has free parking at a central city putting forward this motion and hopefully you will support it any council something councils of our would you like to speak to the motion thank you madam mayor I think it 's something that we need to try I think from my perspective we 've been talking about if it 's so long I 'd like to try something Thank You councillor berry anyone wishing to speak against the motion Council Patterson okay well I 'm speaking against the motion I can understand councillor Sutton 's frustration we 're all very frustrated with parking in general and it goes back well some one time though 30 years you know there is been these trials that had supposedly happened and fred was busy and norm wasn 't whether it makes a difference or not we need to find out we need to put that up basically on a Bible on a wall somewhere so if it doesn 't make any difference we need to have that out there and accepted so we can all move on and I know if it works it worse that 's terrific but my concern about about starting a trial I 'm worrying about the results how we obtained those rolls I don 't want to go through a process if we lose a lot of money that fire and shopkeepers with people just parking there and going and doing well just going and working in the shop today it could backfire we don 't know so we need to be tight as we possibly can don 't bow to identify that okay if we have free parking next business will be up several in our percent have a business and not so close to the oh my about five percent Fred Newark might be down four percent we need to get those figures and have them done by someone who will know that everyone has a confidence in so then when we do get the result that is it you know either way we all lose on we understand that it does work or it doesn 't say I just don 't think cancer sentence recommendation in their emotion sort of to me it doesn 't cut off at the end nothing we need to concern and I don 't think we need to go six months I think that 's far too long across the slope more money by do support a I just bought a parking trial I don 't necessarily believe it 'll make any difference I do support a trial so put it to bed for once and for all that what 's needs to happen Thank You councillor Paterson anyone wishing to speak for the motion against the motion Council juvinity thank you madam mayor I don 't disagree with councillor Sutton 's suggestion of having a free Park trial what concerns me with this particular motion is that there aren 't any safeguards there for Council with the motion as it 's written we don 't know what the infrastructure requirements we would need to purchase or change what we 've currently got and as councillor Patterson mentioned you know how do we how we 're going to determine the outcomes how how are we going to know what benefit there has been to the business houses within the CBD area I think this motion probably doesn 't go may be able to come up with some of those suggestions for us Thank You council Giovannetti you know I 'm wishing to speak for the motion against the motion yes madam a look I 'm gonna probably be saying much the same thing as previous councillors that the the concept of the trial isn 't something that we should shy away from but it 's about getting the air with with the right process in place the method of by how we would evaluate such a trial and take into account the impact particularly in relation to the financial impact on our our budget what 's been proposed here to my mind is his way too vague in terms of who determines who approves the performance measures that 's not defined at all in the motion and it leaves it open to interpretation is that the council is going to determine that is it the officers to determine it whoever else there is no other council meeting between now and the 11th of December and I think in that regard the motion itself is deficient certainly I 'm not parking I think that 's another discussion which we the motion that I foreshadowed would certainly provide that opportunity at the December meeting Thank You councillor hazel Minh anyone wishing to speak for one emotion madam may not really speaking for against at this stage councillor Hazen please replay your foreshadowed emotions so I can understand it what I for shadow was that if this motion of counsel Sutton 's is lost I would then move that at the December ordinary meeting of council that a trial of free parking be considered in conjunction with the officers expert report a set of criteria to evaluate any trial performance and the report from care park Australia on their proposed redevelopment of the multi-bit car park so you 'd expect the officers expert report that stage I 'd expect to see the report that was available in October that clarified thank you so much any one would like to speak for the motion against the motion councillor summer I would also like to foreshadow a motion note or to do that with one on the table a foreshadowed motion on the table change to the one that we 're debating now that the council undertake to trial free all-day parking in all day in off street sorry in off Street metered parking zones in Shepparton for a period of six months from the 11th of December 2017 the effectiveness of this trial will be measured in a way which is determined prior to implementation so it 's just exactly the same as councillor sun 's motion but instead of on street metered parking I will say all day off straight made of parking that 's not you thank you counsel someone else wishing to speak against the motion accounts for summer okay yes it 's likely I 'll need more than three minutes Oh maybe like well it 's a pent up thing over the last few years well we really haven 't been able to discuss this and debated openly so it 's a lot of pent up things just written down and I would also like to congratulate councillor Sutton in her courage for putting up this motion because it takes a lot of guts to put what you think get support or not in a public meeting and I can 't relate to the frustration at the parking issue because it doesn 't seem to get to her heads one step forward one step back nobody can agree unfortunately I can 't agree on this either but we 'll get into why personally I think we 're looking at the issue wrong like logic human logic without really thinking too deeply would tell us that more people who park in front of our shop means more customers but in actual fact the opposite is true so say the parking bay was full all day with to our times and all that time was used up by the minimum amount it 's only could be for potential customers who may not even have an intention of entering your store but a well planned parking layout that adheres to a transport hierarchy you can have up to 100 or more potential customers walking past or bike riding past because it 's more amenable without the cars there so these people are at a slower pace and that allows them to actually to a sale if you 're in a car you can 't really see it 's just a blur and the congestion that this is going to cause with on street parking it 's completely counterproductive because 30% of traffic and congestion is from people circling the block looking for a space outside their shop now not only does that stress out the person driving and it doesn 't really put them in a good shopping mood it also reduces amenity so people really it 's not a very pleasant place to be whereas drawing cars away from on street roads would reduce congestion and increase foot traffic Albury Wodonga has free parking but they do follow a traffic hierarchy they have a hue incentive of ample all day off streetcar parking spaces that are easy to access and they have the disincentive for on street parking because they limited times to one hour or two hours if you duck into a side street now these strategies are in line with our movement in place strategy but the motion that we 've got here today it 's the exact opposite somewhere that 's already 40% empty most of the time which is our off street parks I think if we looked at the next 50 years instead of trying to recreate the shopping climate of 50 years ago time already know okay thank you for that really electable your neck tension comes please thank you madam air if I can bounce it 's a great extension all in favor for extension see hands please yes granted I will concede we 're not Melbourne that 's another thing I hear quite often that we 're not Melbourne yes we have an urban sprawl yes we have small towns people are required to drive here and we will always need disabled bays in areas of convenience but for the able-bodied person walking from koryo to the mall shouldn 't really be a major issue and from a health promotion perspective off street parking may go somewhere some way towards tackling a very real obesity epidemic in this region I earnestly agree that parking needs an overhaul I think the principle of raising revenue via parking meters is abhorrent and impacts on our an opportunity to create barriers and incentives we need to follow what we can we need to do away with coin-operated machines we need to offer more debt all-day spaces and this motion doesn 't actually address those issues people who go to a movie can 't go to lunch and a haircut because they can 't_''_4262.29 be bothered moving their car parents will drag their kids behind them because two hours is up they 're not sure being a visitor from out of town or never shop here again because of a parking fine two hours isn 't long enough there needs to be more all day as for ya look I think I 've made my point and I 'm not just going to talk for the sake of talking but I feel like this must be is unnecessary and it may actually impact on small business to a point where they can no longer survive Thank You counselors summer anyone wishing to speak for the motion against the motion any closing comments counsel something I 'm quite happy to look at Chris 's motion thinking because at table I don 't agree that if we had free meters that we would have the parking congestion it happen works in other places people move in and out we have to our parking in Nixon Street we don 't have a problem with people over staying in Nixon Street they move in and out on a regular basis I can 't see why they wouldn 't move out the CBD on a regular basis with to our free parking on meters so I don 't actually agree with that premise not actually what I said in any of what I said I never meant and if there 's new information added we shouldn 't be adding it to a closing comment thank you for that counsel something will now go to the vote all those in favor of the motion against motion lost we 'd now like to go to Council Hazel moon yeah madam mayor I 'll move that at the December ordinary meeting of council for the trial of free parking be considered in conjunction with the offices expert report a set of criteria to evaluate any a proposed redevelopment of the multi-deck Kappa thank you council Haseman do I have a second to please the set of criteria we haven 't_''_4404.33 got that yet cancel heisman okay again a point of clarification he 's a man you have said that a trial of free parking be considered I just want to make sure that it 's not free time to parking do we want to make a distinction between free and free time yeah I support free time so that 's why I was I wanted that clarification I 'll have you incorporate this free time to do we clarify we had a second to the motion thank you cancel a demo ii would like to speak to the motion counselor hazel moon yes thanks me to me look I did prepare a whole range of material tonight to talk about and debate about the merits or otherwise of free time parking and all of that but that 's probably now going to occur in December this is about a process that we can have some confidence in we went through a process where the officers particularly keen to spend additional funding around that process we 've also talked at length about developing a set of criteria to evaluate the the trial performance and as Council of Patterson always says we need something definitive here that we can make a decision one way or another and I think that 's important that certainly sets us a month between offices and councilors to work out what that criteria might be and so that if we do ultimately move to a trial we 're doing it on the basis of this is how we 're going to evaluate it and also think it 's important that the future around the multi-deck car park we understand that Kerr Park Australia are proposing a redevelopment quite substantial level of expenditure at that site and we would need to make a decision around our parking policies and processes into the few having regard for what Kia Park more to do as well Thank You Council Haysom and councillor Adam would you like to make a comment yes think no matter me first like to congratulate councillor Sutton for putting this motion not just by council something by all councils about the free parking debate I think councils were led in some led to believe but were community it was communicated to us that this process of gaining more information and data could lead us into maybe March or April of next year and respect to actually doing something about this so the fact that it 's prompted councillor hazen want to put forward that motion that has just brought this whole process forward and we won 't be dragging the chain on this any longer it 's all thank you marry me thank you for that concern anyone else wishing to speak against their motion cancer Patterson I generally don 't like as most people no policy on the run I think and council Sutton 's throwing a beautiful big fat hangar and I 'd right in the middle of us and stir this all up and I congratulate it for that we we 're as frustrated as hell and our community is as frustrated as hell that we have Mel come up with a decision but rather than going down does a December general meeting we need to get set aside as counselors and staff a morning go through every bit of literature we can come up with and ideas thrash it out while we actually want and then come up at the December meeting with the answer rather than trying to legislate from here on in things will work some things won 't work that we need we certainly we need to come up with an answer how we 're going to conduct this trial by December they do about that but I don 't want to limit it by what we 're gonna do and what we rely on Thank You councillor Paterson anyone wishing to speak for the motion Council zibari thank you the words frustration really at the forefront but all I threw out another word procrastination or check actions expensive and procrastination is endemic councilor hazel Minh in all the years that I 've known him he 's never been prone to spontaneous or off-the-cuff policy he 's obviously given this considerable thought particularly in light of the fact that I wasn 't aware of but given the fact that this is one of the most frustrating issues that we 've been talking about for so long we just go round and round and round in circles and I for one fully support that we actually get him get down roll our sleeves up and if we need to have a time then December is it it 's all about money you know their officers are recommending certain courses of conduct because they 're trying to minimize the cost to council how much it is it 's risk it 's about risk you don 't achieve anything if you don 't_''_4727.84 prepared to take a calculated risk inform yourself do all those things but let 's make a damn decision thank you very much solver bury anyone wishing to speak against the motion hand for summer in principle I agree with the motion I 'm just not so sure December is long enough for us to decide on any kind of evaluation criteria I know we had or at least my understanding was that we had an opportunity to engage people to do this properly if councillors decide and that will cost less than most consultant reports it was going to be for 12 months and that would arguably be more accurate and less confusing for the public there 'd be nothing promised and at the end of the 12 months we can reassess knowing that it 's given to us this is data given to us by people who are trained in statistical analysis so I don 't want to come back with this with a bunch of weak criteria and see once again an example like the Christmas trial it was during Christmas and it came back to us saying it was a success but really the only evidence was that the parking bays were full and some of people on the street accredited free parking as to why they 're there which she would imagine that they do that anyway so that definitely sent me some mixed messages and I 'm hearing people say oh we 've done all these trials we 've had all these reports but we really haven 't had a report that has any substance so it makes we 're going to be evidence-based unless we can actually get someone external to do this trial if we decide to do the trial I don 't see too much relevance in the multi-deck report I 'm not quite sure why that is at all relevant to us I don 't believe that free parking is going to be in breach of commercial competition laws considering the car park underneath the multi-deck is 90% full most of the time anyway making that free won 't interfere with their takings in fact all the congestion that 's going to be on street more people are probably going to use the multi deck trying to get away from it all making it more efficient and comfortable so whether we want to support the multi deck or not support support the multi deck I don 't think we should lose sight that it 's a major building in a central location that has been neglected and dilapidated I really don 't think that it 's relevant at all to what we do with parking but that 's just my opinion thank you cans a point of clarification madam a councillor hazel when you opt to put this at the December council meeting what date is that someone know what that will be 20 21st or 20th 19th so Christmas is pretty much all over by then so it 's not a Christmas trial I just want to establish that effect thank you thank you for that concern you know a machine to speak against emotion for the motion I would just like to have a few comments myself in regard to sorry counselor Joe would you please Thank You counsel Abdullah so to put you in the spot there I just have a comment obviously you know the business community feels that parking is contributing to some of the difficulties we don 't know that that 's the hundred percent reason why things are happening the way they 're happening perhaps but we do know that there 's talk it 's been ongoing for such a long time we need to listen to the people that it affects the most and I think looking at some form of trial is definitely you know otherwise we 're going to be in this same position in six twelve months time two years five years time I think it 's time to just do some action let 's get some results let 's do some proper testing and let 's try and you know do something that sets proactive it 's gone on too long thank you thank you madam mayor I just want to clarify whether you were speaking in favor of the motion or against the motion in favor of the motion okay thank you that 's all go to the vote I think we 've actually sorry have any final comments cancel husband you just picked up on a couple of points that were made it has been a long-standing issue I don 't necessarily agree with the concept of it 's been procrastination but there 's been a diversity of opinion over many years on this issue and just a quick scrutiny around on social media in the last couple of days reinforces that if everyone 's got a different opinion as to what the issue is and I think that I Sutton basically bringing this to the forefront and what I 've tried to do is put a bit of structure around the process from here and a time frame I know people have talked about you know the December meetings going to come around quickly enough I won 't harp on the matter of we 're not having a January meeting any further recognizing that leaving this until February was going to be far too late we needed to get on it moving it means that we 've got to do a power of work at briefings to be able to present a concise record at the December meeting so that we can make a decision and I will point out that that decision will be around the consideration of a trial not necessarily the format of the trial itself that 'll be part of the discussion and the decision process Thank You councillor hazel Minh we will now go to the vote all those in favor against motion carried well that 's a good one to have completed I will say we now go to item 15 point 1 up for us it was to sign and seal the following documents agreement between counsel governor a rural water

available for public address on our website along with the official minutes of this meeting all care is taken to maintain your privacy however as a visitor in the public gallery it is assumed that your consent but the minutes of our council meeting held on the 15th of August 2017 and the special council meeting held on 22nd of August and circulated be confirmed is that correct as read thank you a second to please councilman councillor Paterson you suppose that council has I can 't say we should speak against that motion for all in favor area item 6.1 our sports facility use policy there is a recommendation on page two councillors do I have anyone wishing to move a motion council summer recommendation is a to please council Abdulla council our summer no this is just a document that will help us provide some guidelines on how to use the sports facilities that we have here in greater Shepperton we are the sporting capital of regional Victoria we 've got a 21 million dollar I said in our sports precinct we host a huge number of national and international events and recently launched the inaugural sporting Hall of Fame potentially also we 've got a shot at the Commonwealth Games so it does stand to reason that we should formalize our existing practices around the usage it 's a internal document hasn 't gone out for public consultation but it is a working document it will be regularly reviewed and updated whenever the need arises so if anyone would like input into how we 're running these facilities I do encourage them to write us an email or just feedback through the appropriate channels so to risk a pun we want to stay ahead of the game and do our best when it comes to support Thank You Council summer council abdullah yeah i would saying that greater Shepperton is aspiring to be the sporting capital of racial Victoria so it 's very important to have explicit and a comprehensive policy which provides some guidelines around the responsible equitable and transparent process for the use of council sport sports field and associated facilities the policy it 's I think it will help everybody to understand how the the use of the the use of the sporting facilities will be prioritized and it was very interesting to see on page 1 1 7 in section 5.2 way it identifies the hierarchy for prioritizing facility allocation so I think it 's very important and to have transparency in that prioritization is is going to help everyone to understand why the decisions are taken in a way that they are taken councillor any council we should just speak against this motion all the motion tell so some any closing comments thank you mister may have been said all in favor of the motion against Carrie item 7.1 counselors we have a recommendation on page five and respect to the section 86 committees of management membership appointment any counselor on page 5 counselor hazel Minh good a second to please counselor Giovannetti councillor hazel Minh I mr. mayor it 's largely an administrative matter but it acknowledges that we are making an appointment of an Thompson to the cola district hall committee of management and we 're also acknowledging the contribution of Lola Ibrahim to the Hostin Hall committee along serving member and treasurer and that 's a process that she has resigned and also we 're resolving that the members of the Claire district all committee of management are exempt for the requirements to complete interest returns so it 's largely in administered but it gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the work of people who manage these facilities on our behalf thank you yes mr. mee they 're following on from counsel hazel Minh I 've often said this when we come up with these nominations for the section 86 committees that it 's and it 's indicative of this community that people are prepared to stand and put the hand up for these committees and I think Ann Thompson for applying for the role of the brahim for her role at the house and all committee I think without these volunteers on their 1686 committees we would be much worse off overall as a council good thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion councillor hazel it over to me all in favor against motion carried item seven point two the greatest shepherd and women 's Charter Alliance Advisory Committee annual report we have a recommendation on page nine to have a councillor wishing to move a motion they were looking at your council Abdulla wonder why yeah I would like to move the recommendation on page nine that the council received and note the women startled eyes advisory committees 2016 2017 annual report as motion thank you do we have a seconder please the 2016 2017 annual report provides details of how the Women 's Advisory Committee has performed in relation to its guiding principles of gender equity diversity and active citizenship this report is very comprehensive it provides details of the events the working groups the collaborations and partnerships that the committee has undertaken in this in in the highlight that on page three of the report there is a summary of of charter principles and some actions that the committee had taken aligned to those charter principles so it 's very interesting to say that the committee has has undertaken so many activities and the outcome and the achievements of those activities they are mapped back to the to the Charter principles for instance I would just read out one example that Charter has a guiding principle of active citizenship and the committee undertook the activity which was about it initiated female youth public speaking competition event and it 's the achievement or the outcome from that event was that it extended an opportunity to young female students from a local school to develop confidence and skills such as critical analysis of a topic of interest presentation of arguments in a logical manner oral presentation etc so I think it was a very important and a very healthy exercise that was done and female young students benefited and it also sort of emphasized the principle of active citizenship so well I would just like to congratulate the committee development and also towards promotion of women 's participation in leadership roles so well done to the committee Thank You counselor councillor case um Thank You mr. mayor just following on from Council I absolutely agree that it 's such an important committee this one it 's promoting women in leadership at all levels of decision-making and greater Shepherd and it 's encouraging women to step up be involved and I think it 's a very very important committee that obviously we support 100% any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion Council achieve an eddy but I think the greater sheridan woman 's child alliance advisory committee one apart from many of their roles one of the good things is that they recognize women who make a significant contribution to the community annually and my wife was fortunate to receive this award some several years ago and I think it 's great that women who do commit their time and energy to assist women in the community are recognized for that and I think that the women 's Charter Alliance committee doing an excellent job with for before we hand back to council Abdul I 'll just make my own comments I mean I was the child a champion of that committee two years ago and I can see the growth that 's happened there from a once a loosely formed committee and regionally but I think their aims and objectives work probably that concrete but now they 're moving forward they 've done some fantastic things in the descrying from strength to strength and as council likely said they 're after they 're promoting women in leadership which is key to our prosperity in this region so fantastic work well done now council abdullah do you like any closing comments no further comments thanks for your comments that being said all in favor against motion carried item 7.3 councillors on page 13 we have a recommendation in respect to the community planning summary to have a councillor wishing to move a motion councillor Giovannetti to have a second sorry counsel Jim any one of you miss me I 'd like to move the recommendation as a motion on page 13 which is that the council over the 2016-17 financial year and think that many volunteers that contribute to the community planning in greater shepper than right thank you a seconder please councillor Paterson councillor ji ready Thank You mr. mayor over the past nine months I 've been on council I 've had the opportunity to attend a number of these functions in the various communities where these planning groups meet to discuss the needs of the particular town or area within Greater Sheppard and I think they do a fantastic job as I mentioned before they 're all volunteers the work that they are able to have approved and completed I think that the list that we have on our agenda tonight indicates how valuable they are to the community and I congratulate each and every one of the various committees throughout the Greater Sheppard and for their work time and effort that they put into the planning for their particular community Thank You counselor councillor Patterson oh yeah very supportive of this other members of the community playing well before one council and I just love the whole process fact that a lot one or two people in the town with their thoughts the squeaky wheel syndrome they push for what they want this is a perfect opportunity for the smaller towns to really identify what the town wants what the people in the town want rather than just one individual gives the opportunity to get through the process with a council employee to identify what that can once they can line up their priorities and that 's where we can help them so yeah it 's terrific there sort of it takes takes a while get things done sometimes but it 's still moving the right direction again without people all you of this as counsel as very said before they 're volunteers that get up there and they really do any counselor wishing to speak against the motion anyone else for the motion council somebody I will speak for the motion cuz it 's great to receive these updates on what 's been achieved throughout financial year I think that community planning 's those summaries are the epitome of what council is all about it 's about drawing together communities and we don 't necessarily hand things out on a plate but if the community demonstrate a need and I seem to be working towards a goal we can offer some help and financial support so these are all grassroots initiatives from the bottom up and we 're told what 's best for the community it 's not the other way around and you certainly can 't accuse us of being ship centric when you see how many successes are listed over the following pages so each small towns unique they all evolve their own character outside of shepherding and that 's what makes this region so great its diversity and if nobody is busy on September 24th that we are launching dukey 's spot youth project so there 'll be a free barbecue and live entertainment so anyone can rock up and see what the community have achieved there hopefully the first of many spot youth programs around the municipality Thank You councillor any other council we should speak against this motion so yeah it 's very encouraging to see how our community members are motivated to take ownership of the achievements as you as I 've gone through summary of the achievements it shows that clearly that the achievements definitely fulfill the the social objectives that are set out in our council plan 2017 to 2021 the ownership of the plan lies with the community so some Community Planning groups are of course doing better than others which really shows that it 's all about people and people make make a difference the level of participation engagement and commitment in the respective neighborhoods will make a difference so I think I just want to highlight the the the a small challenge that we have here is which according to my understanding is that how to maintain that that interests that level of interest from Community Planning right to the implementation stages because sometimes you know people have got other interests and they 've got other priorities but I think it 's this plan is all about community ownership and community needs to take ownership and maintain that continued continued level of enthusiasm speak against for very brief Thank You mr. mayor yesterday I was in Marina we actually launched 's a great partnership you know coming together with the members of those community plan committees and really celebrating some of the things that we do achieve I mean fifty seven thousand dollars were spent on those shades so it 's a great sum outcome for them it was great seeing your children obviously enjoying the playground and spending some time with you know a lot of those people on that committee in Marin it was a great outcome to see things go the full circle to fruition so I think it 's you know it 's a great important thing that we do thank you any other councillor wishing to speak for against don 't councillor given any any closing comments nothing nothing good that being the case all in favor of motion against motion carries item seven point for the volunteer strategy and action plan 2014 to 2018 year three update we have a recommendation on page 26 to ever cow 's lotion to move motion that 's the pattern what would you like to be a council person I 'd like to move the motion on page to date and to continue ongoing support of the community leadership program for the next three years I am on the wrong page 26 it was a nice motion anyway 7.4 we were all on the right okay so we 're just disregard councillor Patterson 's original commentary so councillor O 'Keefe he wished to move the motion action plan 2014-2018 the year 3 update on page 26 I thought to be the recommendation that the council note the achievements of the third year of the greatest ship a tan volunteer strategy and action plan 2014 2018 good thank you do have a seconder councillor Patterson councillor O 'Keefe and Thank You mr. mayor volunteering obviously is an essential community resource which promotes some active citizenship and social inclusion we know that our volunteers play a very big role in the support of our community many of our council programs would not would simply not happen without their help I 've had the great opportunity to be involved with many of our volunteers including recognition evenings of their support and contribution so I think it 's a very important recommendation thank you councillor Patterson if I can remember this coming to council three years ago and I had great concerns about how difficult we could make it for volunteering and I was really pleasantly surprised when I seen a document it really does give some support there 's four pillows in it promotion recruitment supporting volunteers and celebrating and recognizing which is very important we do those four things to volunteers so it 's been a great success we do recognize we all know the value of volunteers and as it 's been a change of counsel with have to update it and I 'm sure this will work with another years Thank You councillor any councillor wishing to speak against this motion the other councillor wishing to speak for the motion councillor summer yes so would just to point out like the motion motion states this is the third year of operations in this volunteer strategy we initiated this to try and lift the profile of volunteers without volunteers society really would fall into a heap they inject millions of dollars of services into our economy each year and the nature of volunteering means sometimes they 're not often recognized and sometimes that 's exactly the way that they like it but greater Shepherd in City Council does try to incorporate some things into our everyday operations such as holding volunteer awards nights and other acknowledgments I think if more people realise the value of giving up their own time to help others with no material gain of their own it could be a shift in perception for the majority of people because I believe wholeheartedly in or quote that one guest speaker said a few years back he said that volunteering is selfish because the rewards fireworks over and above exceed anything that you would get from something that you paid to do but quite often across their community the activities and endeavors of volunteers are often taken for granted as has been said often they 're not well recognized I think what this strategy is done particularly the recognition front it 's a positive reinforcement of the role of volunteering and is a very positive role in our community we think of all the activities that occur that just simply would not be possible without the contribution that volunteers made to our community Thank You counselor the other councillor wishing to add comment for or against councillor O 'Keefe Thank You mr. closing comments thank you all in favor of the motion against motion carries item 7.5 counselors community leadership program evaluation on page 30 we have a recommendation any councillor wishing to move a motion counselor Abdul 's quick off the draw I 'd like to move the recommendation on page 30 as motion the recommendation says that the council note the achievements of the Community Leadership Program to date and and number two is continued ongoing support of the community leadership program for the next three years great do we have a seconder please can I okay thank you council Abdulla we should speak to the motion so the pilot program of this community leadership was was in 2014 as a participant of the of the pilot program in year 2014 I strongly support the continuation of this program this leadership program that that the council offers is different from any other leadership program in programs in the region and what it means is that that it does not exclude anyone from the community on the basis of financial constraints so it 's a big plus it is grassroots it 's one of the best forms one of the best opportunities to develop networks and partnerships it provides an opportunity to our to our community members to engage with mainstream community and know their community better and also to develop their leadership skills I would just say that council is doing a fantastic job in supporting their gratis grassroot program for its community so I also I fully support the continuation of this program and acknowledge the wonderful outcomes of this program thank you guys for councillor Thank You mr. mayor I think it 's worth noting that we 've had 77 participants successfully graduate from the program ranging from you twelve right through to the age of retirees so it 's a great community opportunity to be involved in personal development and if you look over on to page 32 it does show a range of areas that they are involved in in the community leadership program you know it 's a great thing for us to to support and obviously encourage other members in the community to get involved any counselor we should just speak against the motion for the motion counselor has been a really successful program over the couple of years that it 's been running I 've had the privilege to be a mentor on a couple of occasions and opportunity to speak to the group on on various topics I think it 's been a fantastic program one of the highlights of course though is that each of the teams within the program develop a community project so there 's a real practical application to that wearing another hat I think a couple of the project teams have been knocking on my door looking for financial contribution to make their project country fruition that 'll be fine we 'll we 'll work something out there but it is a it is a fantastic program I think what we should also be aware of here and this is relating to the council budget we 're in fact committing the council this program I think that 's appropriate to because that provides staff and the community with some surety about the strategic direction this programs going in very well said thank you any other council wishing to speak against motion for the motion oh that 's the person peak for it and I must admit the first year of this occurred I was sort of out a little bit I wasn 't totally convinced and it was a second year when I tonight some of the people were involved Everly it really did change some of those people 's lives it was just absolute amaze the difference between the first meeting when the inducted they 're basically passing out ceremony I had a good conversation with a couple of mineral it fully change their lives and I 'd hate to think whether I would have been their life if not for this and now about becoming upstanding member of the community which will help only to have a people in our community so yeah look it 's not a big outline and it is certainly made a difference and as other different ways in the community thank you any other council we should add comment either for or against good no one councillor Giller any closing comments no further comments thanks all in favor of the motion counselors against motion carried item seven point six on page thirty eight counselors we have a recommendation and respect to the small town festive decorations grant 2017 any counselor we should have been a motion counselor Giovannetti yeah Thank You mr. mayor I 'd like to move the recommendation on pace DoD 's emotion that the council approved the allocation of ten thousand one hundred and sixty one dollars and eighty six cents of funding under the small town festive decorations Grants program 2017 to the following applicants do-kyun district development forum two thousand dollars wrote the Men 's Shed 2020 Lions Club 2000 dongol rec reserve 1853 82 and tat Community House two thousand dollars of course that 's GST exclusive of course thank you do a mistake into place and for Patterson counselor Jim and Eddie as I mentioned before mr. mayor I 've had some involvement with a number of these the work that they do for the community is immeasurable having spent time at the root of men shared on the number of occasions the work the guys they do for the community I think is is magnificent as with the Phil and the Lions Club but they 've put a lot of money and effort into developing their community and the Dukey development forum is a very much a go-getter group that I 've had some involvement with over the last few months I think it 's great that we 're able to support these groups and I 'll actually like to see that in the future we perhaps look at perhaps opening it up a little bit more and allocating a few more dollars because I think these groups do a fantastic job for the relevant communities Thank You counselor counselor Patterson is basically the we 've got a clip in mind this is only thirty money I know if the men said that boys material is then they manufacture a lot more decorations and the processes councils been through in the last two months with our festive great but your neighbor who should be looking importing them to do ours for the money that they utilize to get the outcome they get it 's terrific so that works so well men 's sheds get to utilize and material to make things Lions Clubs becoming involved in community also in the events there Zuka district and development forum they all utilize it and I 'd go it 's a valuable little spend in their community coming to Christmas thank you any council wishing to speak against the motion for the motion counselor summer just like to reiterate councillors even at his suggestion that we open up the grants to be over at above 2000 considering we came under budget by about five days and I do think that that could be an interesting concept to consider we did award all of the money that was requested and we still came under budget and we know that these guys do such a great job as reiterated by councillor Patterson so why not capitalize on that for and get some bang for buck but we can have those discussions another for after Jeff and Eddie any closing comments no mr. mayor I think we 've covered everything I think we have thank you all in favor of the

's happened over the last couple of months I 'd like to defer to mr. tights off he would mind giving us an explanation employees so tight or you were willing to do that there 's where we 're very early into the financial year only two months in so there 's not a great deal to report for the monthly financial report to the end of August I will know however we have raised our rates and charges and recognize all the income in relation to that so the financial health numbers that the first page of the report on page 189 looked very healthy that that as has happened in previous we 're ears will normalize and reduce as we go through the of course the financial year there are a few variances reported to the end of August all of these timing variances around prepayments and that sort of thing to do you know pre payments for insurance and pretty much payment for software licensing and other things like that so there 's really nothing of particular note this month good Thank You mr. Tuttle councillor Sutton counselor Sutton Teague 's here of course started this council summer mr. Elliott said good that being the case any councillor wishing to speak against the motion for the motion councillor Giovannetti mr. tarsal of the motion councillors against motion carried thank you mr. Tuttle way to make point five councillors contracts awarded under delegation and status of contracts advertising yet to be awarded August 2017 we have a recommendation on page 55 I have a council wishing to move the motion Council okay well motion would you like to lie to me eight point five contracts ordered under delegation and status of contracts advertised and yet to be awarded August 2017 the recommendation that the council note the public sorry publicly advertised contracts awarded under delegated authority in tenders that have been advertised but not yet awarded do have a second to please cancel Patterson council O 'Keefe we 'd like to speak to the motion Jesse a just briefly pretty much to inform the council the status of requests pretenders that have been advertised we said and that the contracts yet to be awarded there 's quite a number of contracts listed there so obviously we are looking into that and hoping for some formal response Thank You councillor pasen councillor covered and you counselor we should just speak against this motion to you counsel O 'Keefe let 's all in favor of the motion counselors against motion carried their item eight point six counselors is our financial statements and performance statement for the year ended fee for June 2017 as counselors know we 've been briefed in great detail about our financial statements over the past twelve months so looking forward to see what come with each council juvenille would you like to move the recommendation on page 58 yes mr. mayor would like to move the recommendation as a motion and that is that the council approved in principle the financial statements and performance statement for the financial year into 30th of June in 2017 and also authorized the mayor council Denis Adam at the deputy mayor Councillor Kim O 'Keefe and the chief executive office of mr. Peter Harriet to certify the financial statements and to certify the performance statement in their final form after any changes recommended or agreed to by the auditor that they have been made over second to please counselor summer council giovani wish to expand yeah thank you mr. mayor following the briefing session for last financial year had a quite a healthy surplus the requirement of this statement comes under Section 80 c11 Government Act where we are required to submit our performance statements for the end of the year our statements have been audited by our own auditors as well as the Victorian order general department as well as our internal audit committee so I can assure the community that everything is above board as I mentioned earlier it 's been quite a successful year with a surplus cash flow results have been excellent door I couldn 't I thought the news already canceled oh yeah he covers up on budget due to the naturally the right increased 2.5% and the number of additional properties that have become writable throughout the year and has also been an increase to service charges they have in some way added to our increasing income and our expenditures has decreased primarily due to a two million dollar saving that we have achieved on our API fees at the cosgrove tip and that has that is one of many areas where we have made savings throughout the mr. Tye solve Matt Chavez and his team for their work that they 've managed to achieve throughout the year I think they 've done an excellent result as can be seen by the audit reports that have been received very well said Thank You councillor juvinity councillor summer and the other councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion and for juvinity that being said all in favor of the motion excuse me councillors all in favour yep against motion carried item 9.1 on page 61 councils a planning permit application 201 6 406 telecommunications facility 501 mention Road and River Northwest we have a recommendation on page now on page where are we 62 and 63 there 's quite a few points in that excuse me do I have a council wishing to be a motion Council somewhere recommendation as emotion as printed on page 62 and 63 we have a seconder please councillor Patterson cancellous emma i am going to support this project I know that telecommunication towers are not always popular for a variety of reasons but I do believe that they are a get many objections but without telecommunication towers we 'd be lacking a lot of essential connectivity that our society is basically built on so some think that there are blight on the landscape and it 's really hard to argue with a subjective opinion like that but it 's just something we can 't_''_2623.76 knock back there 's questions around health and there 's questions around the impact of the wavelengths going into affecting people in general and I can understand people being concerned there 's a lot of rumors going around in the community about these towers but there 's really no proof to say that there 's any harm caused from telecommunication towers at all and we have to make a decision based on the evidence out there and the evidence says that they do no harm to your health at the moment we 're lobbying federal government to improve digital connectivity via a black spot program and we can 't expect to get these improvements if we keep knocking back infrastructure so it 's not something I 'm happy about doing but in order to move forward from time to time Thank You councillor Patterson very easy to protest voting here in roll this but that 's only gonna cost the 70 grand not be up six months later than what it normally would be I just think council gets used by the relevant government here we have do the dirty work we have to take it on the chin from the people that don 't want it and we know that and some of our in this room and you know I feel for those people like I don 't share necessarily as much of their concerns for the health I 've got one near my house I don 't share that but I you know we 've got a responsible as council as we 're doing the right thing by knocking it back in six months time and more later it 'll still be up anyway councilors ratepayers would have lost seventy thousand dollars in the process that we would have to fork up at pre-k so therefore the people the other side of the river that aren 't involved at all or began crookedest spend at seventy thousand dollars out at Odin owner and do something positive for that community to waste it with legal fees in town so you know I just think we are often thought of having a trying to get council develop a policy where we we stipulate as to go and recreation reserves the recreation reserve get some money you know ten fifteen grand a year for having a tower there but we have no power to do that they have the option of all the time going straight to straight to the cat and saying yeah we 're entitled to put this where we want and we want there and what we have decided has no input whatsoever so is with a heavy heart a lot of ways because there is people that are generally really concerned about out there in center field and I understand it 100% but as a person that 's trying to represent ratepayers I really can 't see what else we can do as a group we tried to negotiate with Optus regarding where it actually physically goes we have no power in go around there it 's up to them completely and we 're still waiting to hear back if they 're going to put it further than that blocker and present not the the physical damage that could do to you if you walked out and looked at all the time but yeah it 's something that we shouldn 't be even dealing with we can 't do anything I really can 't it 's it 's wrong I don 't know what comes to us if they want us to make a decision well we can 't afford the way 70,000 every time as the tower going up because there 's a lot of people would be very concerned about their waste of money having said that I certainly appreciate that doesn 't people out there that wouldn 't be very happy with council but I unfortunately I don 't see an option and I certainly understand if any counselor here tonight votes to put a protest vote insert I understand that but the important thing is it 's got to go otherwise that 'll cost a right pass every against the motion counselor Giovannetti mr. May I accept what counsel Patterson has just sit in relation to we kept the cost account started right Pisan table certainly not keen to do that either but I just like to register a protest I suppose I have concerns in relation to the electromagnetic energy that it comes from these towers counselor summer is right there is no evidence at the moment to suggest that that is harmful but on the other hand I don 't think there 's evidence to suggest that it isn 't either I think that that 's something that the people who live in that vicinity are obviously very concerned for and about as councillor Patterson mentioned we did suggest to the consultant from opposite paths there was a better site on the particular property for the tower to be sited away from residences they chose not to act on that at this point in time I personally I 'm not convinced that they 've chosen the best site for the tower and I do feel for the residents of that area and I will be voting any other councillor we should just speak for the motion you think so hazily okay as it 's been said telecommunications towers are contentious they will always generate anger and anxiety in the community no matter where they 're placed and heedless need to look there for it what council 's role in that process is where the statutory planning authority and our sole role in this is to administer the Planning and Environment Act and to do that we take into account precedent we take into account case floor by VCAT and through the court system and all of those pathways lead to giving miss the tick of approval there 's plenty of examples around the state and indeed pretty close to home where occasionally a populous decision is made we 'll kick it off to Viet let them sort it out and so it 's not on our hands and then there 's councillor Patterson indicated there 's a cost comes back I think on all the evidence the recommendation from our professional planners is are on the path to approval and that 's what we 'll be speak against for council abdullah just like to make a brief comment that yes we do need the better we need we do need these towers for better telecommunication coverage and but we do have to look into the objections as well so I have read all the objections that were raised and I have been looked at the response and I think at this stage we really need to make an objective assessment I know that I know this decision can be subjective but I think in our role we need to look at things more objectively with the X min explanation provided about the objections and officers response I am satisfied at this stage that we are meeting our obligations by by giving a go-ahead on this application Thank You councillor any other council would add comments for or against and then back to you council summer I don 't know all they said all in favor of the motion councillors arms up please sorry yep against motion carried thousand nine point two counselors page 75 call the wood one more Drive Advisory Committee appointment of community representatives any counsel we shouldn 't move a motion since Larry Keith thank you 9.2 the older wood burn Memorial Avenue Advisory Committee appointment of community representatives on page 75 the recommendation that the council adopt the revised terms of reference for the colder would burn Memorial Avenue Advisory Committee and number to appoint the following community representatives to the quarter would burn Memorial Avenue Advisory Committee for a two-year term commencing on the 20th of September 2017 and concluding on the 18th of December 2019 those people listed gen Boehm John Hammonds Julie Marilyn Jackson and kaalia watt McCracken thank you do I have a seconder please counselor summer counselor okay do you wish to speak to the motion yes thank you a little bit lighter topic this time which is good now the primary purpose obviously of the Advisory Committee is to act as an advocate for the future conservation of the caudal Woodburn Memorial Avenue so we 've had the five nominations and as we 've received and I think there 'll be very good representation thank you and so summer I 'd like to also congratulate the committee if the votes carries and I 'd also like to congratulate councillor Shelley Sutton who I believe will be the Council of rep on that committee their tasks with pervert tasked with preserving a remarkable piece of local history there 's an avenue of trees called the cold or burn Memorial and that was planted many many decades ago I think in the 1930s and they were planted to acknowledge the memories of many brave soldiers who died at war and these days it 's still a striking patch of Road you can the avenue of trees but the meaning has been lost so I wish the committee well in maintaining and restoring this Avenue to its former glory glory it 's going to be a challenge but it 's one that 's well worth the effort Thank You councillor any council we should just speak against this motion for the motion cancel Patterson make a quick comment I 'm really looking forward to some of the stories that come out of it there 'll be lots and lots of conversations with with people have their name up there be a enormous amount of information come out that we don 't know about there 's been a whole generation and basically forgotten about it you can see that when you look at it 's all overgrown so the whole conversation what we had again and hopefully that might be the stage that can be documented and yeah were some reading to keep well and truly make sure we don 't lose track of that in the future Thank You Council Patterson any other council wishing to speak against this motion or for the motion ancilla O 'Keefe would you like to have some closing comments none all in favor of the motion councilors against motion carried item 9.3 counselors planning application 201 7 66 600 temple road we have a recommendation on page 81 counselors to have anyone wishing to move emotion no no you can sure you can abbreviate the motion counselor Petterson by referring to the pages it 's printed on I take that meaning as you 're moving the motion yes and what is that motion yes I won 't get you to read that that council up edison detail is going to be a horse rearing area broodmares and because broodmares we all know you can get a broodmare and they can 't_''_3351.979 be some good mum sometimes you need someone on site to be residents with their so I 'm looking forward to some of the potential champions of the turf coming from this area I 've known has terrific soils and gross drippy grass I 'm looking forward to seeing their success in that need is the future beautiful Thank You councillor Paterson council summer I 'm supporting this because it does take all the planning boxes council does have discretion in allowing subdivisions on agricultural land in particular if it 's linked to an activity that constitutes further agricultural use and in this case it is that the applicant proposes a horse farm and like we were mentioning earlier with the telecommunications tower if we were to object to this application it would probably be overturned by VCAT which is a waste of time and money on everyone 's behalf so I see no choice except to allow this proposal based strictly speak against this motion any other counsel we should read their comments for the motion counselor driven Eddie Thank You mr. mayor I think counsel Patterson mentioned earlier this has been a little bit of a saga associated with this particular planning application I 'm quite confident that we made all the planning requirements and that I 'm sure that council staff will ensure that all of the conditions that are placed on this particular development are adhered to prior to final approval being given Thank You councilman any other Council which dad comment for or against been referred to there has been a long history associated with this site that originally back in 2016 an application was made for a dwelling on this particular bit of land but there was never a cultural justification with it and it was subsequently the application was refused it 's now come back in a different format and the agricultural justification attached to it is a thoroughbred broodmare farm and our officers have indicated that meets the requirements to comply with the conditions of the farming zone although I have to say it broodmare farm but having said that it it does meet the standards set by our our planners they have imposed some fairly strenuous conditions that will need to be complied with before any residence is constructed I 'm particularly comfortable with that what I 'm not comfortable with though is the suggestion that relating to how an objection was withdrawn and quite normally in a circumstance where there was only one objection no not the standard was withdrawn it 's really dealt with under delegation but because of the sensitivities around that issue the plan is I think quite appropriately and it sent a very strong message into the development community about this type of circumstance brought it here for the councillors to make that decision notwithstanding all of those issues the planners have recommended approval and I 'll be voting accordingly and very pleased to see the stringent conditions of the burning pose Thank You counselor any other councils been to speak against for do you counsel Patterson my closing comments all in favor of the motion its motion carried item nine point four councils the Shepherd and Melbourne July 2017 we have a recommendation printed on page 93 do I have a councillor wishing to be of emotion counselor summer Thank You mr. mayor I 'd like to move a motion and I 'll be reading it out with your approval that the council 1 note the contents of the guide to proposed and planned infrastructure projects July 2017 john hirsh consulting propriety limited to endorsed the findings of the guide to proposed and planned infrastructure projects July 7th 2017 john hirsh consulting proprietary limited as a basis for continued lobbying for improved passenger and freight rail services 3 called for immediate upgrade of the Sheppard in Melbourne rail corridor to achieve eight velocity services with journey time of 2 hours and 10 minutes including the following immediate actions a work with Moira Mitchell and stress bogie to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to advocate for improved passenger rail services for the whole of the Melbourne Sheppard and rail corridor and authorized the chief executive officer to sign such a Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of council be write to the Minister for transport the Honourable jacinta track and signalling upgrades for velocity services and c undertake a further economic benefits assessment for the Shepherd in Seymour Melbourne rail corridor ok Thank You counsel counsel is clear on the motion there has been some slight changes to what 's printed in your agendas that we 're all clear on that to have a second to please also Giovannetti and counselor somehow you should speak to the motion yes thanks first I 'll just explain the nature of the changes that were made to the recommendation the way it was reading it it gave an impression that we had already entered into an MoU with the surrounding councils but in fact we have had meetings with them and they have expressed their positivity around the idea of this but we haven 't expressly signed any documents yet so we will be working towards that the crux of the matter is that we only have four returned services on weekdays and three on weekends and our journey time can be upwards of three hours which is completely inadequate for a region with a catchment of over 200,000 people so ago and that puts us at an economic disadvantage in comparison to other regional cities this rail line is grossly inadequate and we 're going to be dealing with a lot of congestion when it comes to Melbourne traffic so it must be improved and we want to achieve eight velocity services with the journey time of two hours and ten minutes maximum so hopefully we will be aligning with Mitchell Moyer and stress bogie on this and they have indicated their in principle approval and it carries on from when we all donned our pajamas and rode up to Spring Street in a carriage and lobbied for better services and Mitchell Moyer and Strath bogie was standing alongside us through all of that as well as a few other neighboring shires we 've also done a lot of work lobbying for a bullet train system to pass through shepherding because we recognize that train rail it 's the way of the future for Australian transportation we need to catch up with other countries and we need to make it a priority on a national level but beginning with this start so hopefully just in to Allen we 'll listen to our plight yet again and start to get some momentum excu the pun Thank You counsel counsel juvinity now just briefly mr. Merrit look I think it 's vital that we press ahead with their our proposed plan infrastructure infrastructure projects I think it 's a vital that we press our local members both federal and state as much as we possibly can to get some dollars into this project because as Kessler summer said that really the rail service that we have from Shepherd and at the moment is really quite inadequate for a town of our size Thank You councillor any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion gentle slap do you know just like to say that yeah we need to continue our efforts in in advocate in lobbying for this for the improved services of our train system and it 's I think it 's it 's a smart move to extend our advocacy Airlines and include other other councils like material Moira and strat boogie so perhaps it will have a I think it 's it 's it 's a no-brainer that improved services improve infrastructure bring you know adds to the prosperity of the region and of course Shepperton was was not included in the in the early around when regional fast rail project was undertaken in 2002 2006 and we have seen the benefits of these of this project in areas that were included like Geelong Ballarat Bendigo so it 's it 's a very sort of it 's an example that is you know that is it 's in front of our in front of us and there 's it 's no brainer to see that these kind of improvements in infrastructure to improve the region 's so why not Shepperton shape in greater jeopardy needs to be included in this in this work Thank You councillor and you cancel which is speak against the motion y 'all_''_3943.96 will see against emotion but not against the intent of the motion but against how it 's now worded we could go into semantics about the section under three I call it work with or endorse it all means exactly do have concern with is the changing to the wording of parts B and C quite clearly in writing to the Minister we 're in a first stronger position to be writing on behalf of the four councils and it 's gonna be very difficult for us to write to the Minister no sorry the purpose of this amalgamation grouping on rail services is that we can speak with one voice and quite clearly how do we write to the minister suggesting we want money to undertake level crossing track and signalling upgrades in the other three municipalities if we don 't mention that we 're writing on their behalf we 're writing in isolation the motion says we will write to the minister in our own entity not on behalf of the other three councils and I 'd be if the move of the motion would reinstate on behalf of the four council 's you know to each of those I could well support it like a supporter that 's in its format it 's not complete enough thank you mr. Herod did you want to clarify some comments timing right in relation to combine it we 've got resolutions from the other councils they 're reports that we very much similar we have had a planning meeting here in this room here to organize the alliance so it 's really just a matter hold that regard the changes are probably relevant good Thank You mr. Harriet any council wishing to speak for the motion I will yeah there 's a technical point that hey guys I don 't share his concerns I think it 's just important we keep putting as much pressure as we can on the minister 's it will happen this is going to happen but it 's just a matter of when and we have to keep that pressure up and by doing this we can rescind it we could just keep bombarding and it 's gonna happen I 'm very confident going to happen but it might be several years in the tractional that 's a hell lot closer was four years ago good thank you in respect to councilor hazel burns comment I think we could probably address that at a future wishing to speak against the motion no good for the motion yes for someone coming I would like some closing comments Thank You mr. mayor actually do take exception to the insinuation that they won 't be included in these letters it nowhere in there does that say that it 's only going to be greater Shepard in moving ahead with this solo the motion quite specifically excludes the other four councils from the letter ask the CEO is being asked to write let me just read it right to the Minister for transport your honor we 'll just enter Ellen requesting additional budget to undertake the necessary level crossing track and sealing the apparatus of velocity train so yes it could be seen both ways it doesn 't specifically say it 's from us but if it was to include the other councils I would suggest it would mention them longbow and I completely disagree with that I believe that 's right nothing in that motion as it stands as as I 've read earlier nothing in that motion stopping us from inviting the other counselors to be part an indication that they want to be part of it otherwise it 's premature and presumptive that 's your opinion counselor very well you finish off your closing comments that being said counselors will put a tool vote all in favor mr. Harriet wishes to comment further if I may miss me I just like to acknowledge the state government 's current allocation to this project of 43 million dollars which is significant and we haven 't had an allocation anything like that we haven 't had any allocation to date for the role so that must be acknowledged that has come through consistent and combined lobbying in part led by our local member Susannah she 'd in part by the committee for greater shiverin in part by the local rail interest group and obviously in part by Greater shipping and city council so it 's through that combined approach that we 've been successful this is another example of combining with other municipalities to look for success for the next stage because the previous john hirsh report identified that this is a one hundred eighty six million dollar project been allocated but there is more to come and this is what we 're really looking to lobby for for the next stage and we will do that in a combined approach importantly this report talks about some of the medium and longer-term issues that this rail line has so after we get the 186 million dollar spend on freight velocity trains per day so identifying that there 's some serious work needed to be done at the up field line for example that 's a 700 million dollar project and then ultimately we need the tullamarine link done and that 's a six billion dollar project so this is what we need to get on the radar because these projects are being investigated at the moment as we know there 's a federal government allocation of about thirty million dollars to look at the tullamarine link so it 's important that this report is noted is highlighting not only the good work that 's been done in the past and the need to get eight velocities up and going but also to highlight in the medium-term in the longer Melbourne with all that urban growth and there are two projects that I just mentioned but this report mentions several issues that need to be addressed so this is what will be approaching the government to talk about not only what we 've been lobbying for for some time but these longer-term projects mr. Hirsch it 's quoted some very interesting statistics that our average speed of our trains is 75 kilometres per hour our regional neighbors have average speeds over a hundred kilometers per hour the other why not just like the mention is the statistic that talks about the services per head of population when you divide our four services into our 64,000 population one service one train service is servicing around about 16,000 population when you compare the average with our regional partners our regional neighbors their single service only needs the service around about four to five thousand population so that 's a significant difference our single trains required to service over four times the population so therefore the recommendations that are in this report are most appropriate and I look forward to you which what us who is in favor of this motion against motion carried item number 10 tabled motions we have none reports from council delegates to other bodies now received item 12

favor of the motion against carried all right in number 17 do you have any urgent another business not included on the agenda County yes mr. mayor I have some other business not included in the agenda what is the nature your business counselor summer I would like to table a letter and give me a brief description about that letter maybe it 's a letter that 's supportive of councils adopted position in relation to its support of marriage equality okay now it 's a take you want a table this document this letter did this arise prior or after the agenda was set it did and can it be deferred to Nick the next meeting no I believe it agents I believe is urgent because due to this postal ballot there are community members in our municipality who are struggling with their mental health due to an escalation in a debate that involves their personal lives on a national scale okay thank you look before I my personal opinion respects I need a motion from it counselors to accept this letter to be tabled so to have a motion from any one respect to accepting this are you moving a motion to accept this item dole this letter be tabled in urgent other business drove a seconder councillor summer we should speak to that motion now thank you you 're not speaking to the motion Council some of you wish to comment to accepting this you 've already made your point anyway in respect to why you think this should be fully charged another business I think we do need to consider accepting this just to show there 's a show of support the letter goes into how it can 't go into it in detail at this point until we resolve this issue whether it 's allowed to be tabled or not so that being said we 're voting on tabling something that I think it does no harm it costs nothing and it could be worth its weight in gold if we did table it okay thank you so cancels we asking you how to vote to allow motion first to me what what does tabling involved it means distributing the two councils which I think has been distributed already is that correct councillor my email and I do have copies here if required that 's what he involves so that they 're just clarification no voting necessary it just tables we 're first ready to be clear we 're going to accept this inter Giunta nother business yes if it 's accepted then you 'll just simply note that this letter has been tabled so are we all in favor of accepting this letter to be tabled mr. mayor I have issues that you know become something similar come before council gay marriage three years ago at that stage as elected representatives of Council C are asking to speak against the motion councilperson okay and it could be argued that we were representing our ratepayers the current situation is that the ratepayers have a vote of their own and I think we 're better off leave it to the rate payers we shouldn 't be I think it 's it 's not it 's not a carriage a have a letter placement able counsel and not the other one having opportunity I think and basically councils in a position we 've made a decision that should be it now the rate payers have that opportunity to have their say and unfortunately as we all know it 's got out of whether we support our gay community not because it 's whether we support gay marriage and it 's two completely different conversations familiy and that 's where it 's frustrating for everyone again just to be clear where we 're at this stage we just voted to accept this to table this document in urgent another business so how are we allowing to do that I think you 've had an opportunity to speak forward against who 's in favor of allowing this document to be tabled what to be poured into another business yep I 'm putting this to a vote to comment on the reason of having is tabled well you had the opportunity early on when I did ask you and she she moved the motion and spoke to the ocean I reply well okay before we go to avoid oil there you to actually put some closing comments to this now the motion let 's be clear ease is about accepting this which we 're not clear what that is well we cannot actually the local Lord prohibits us from councilor from reading in would correspondence in full and analytics by resolution of council so if we approve this stage then council summer may be permitted to actually us a a an excerpt from the letter but not to reading for what confusing I understand well I just really would like to perhaps mention that in 2050 we did you prior counsel did actually support just to assist you in that mr. prasit for the memory of all counselors the the adopted counsel position officially right now is this that the counsel publicly supports marriage equality irrespective of sex or gender identity and right this is the motion that was approved in on the 21st of July 2015 and writes to a local state and federal members of parliament the retiring equal opportunity and Human Rights Commission and the combo of human rights was carried at that time this is our official position so the purpose of reading the letter is just to supply support for the mental health of our young LGBTQ community it 's not about votes did you want to keep I 'm sorry counsel I was trying to assist you in making that clear to all counselors in the community so did you want to add anything further to that obviously council summer has any she that she 's bought before us all and I suppose my feeling is pretty much what harm do you because we already have flagged our support we have an official position correct so counselors I 'll put this to a vote now who will allow this document to be tabled which will entail council summer potentially reading a small excerpt more in favor against hang on dude what did I just do they 're holding favor again sorry against good so we were allowing this to be introduced as it to be tabled that cancel out do you have a motion now no I 'm quite you just want to table this document few of the excerpts contained within that did concern end here because we 've got no process in place that if someone around the table takes exception I think I 'm gonna be fully supportive of what 's in the later but we 're operating under no rules here and we know how we operating into the rules well what happens if someone takes objection or wants to make comment on the comments what rules are gonna operate under there is no motion now there 's no motion at this point in time your tabeling the you 're asking permission from this counsel counsel summer to read an excerpt from this letter I just see clear accounts or to allow counselor summer to do that it 's a lot of voting process the motion it would have been nice to be able to summarize and I think you 've summarized it earlier on when you say this is always support there 's a lot of a lot of gratitude in here for greater Sheppard in its position there 's a lot of gratitude for anyone who puts their hand up you counselor somebody we should withdraw you 're taking the doctor what now withdraw to request to read yes this table it 's really be tabled then I 'd be happy to withdraw my request it 's very public it 's being table okay good because no vote required a table of document thank you that being said probably question time thank you miss me we have questions from mr. rod Schubert and mr. John Gray both are in attendance tonight welcome are too close together to rod your first question is there any consideration given to the inconvenience timing and loss of revenue cause the business 's due to major roadworks for example well switch Street have incurred roadworks for Stage one since March the first well think first thing to do rod is to acknowledge the inconvenience of major roadworks due cause to the community however major roadworks remain necessary undertaking obviously as part of council statutory duties with a view to mitigating the impacts consideration is given to timing of the works and wherever possible projects are scoped and designed to have minimal impact in terms of contractors are encouraged to work longer hours such as a six-day shift to ensure the construction time and hence disruption and inconvenience to the public is reduced additionally in an effort to keep the community and businesses abreast of project progress all of councils major roadwork projects are subject to advanced notification to affected stakeholders by means of information letters and most often face-to-face advice and I know that recently there was a walk of the street down Wall Street to give a an update by our staff community information sessions are also held to ensure that the necessary information does reach the wider community this service provides an opportunity for the potentially affected stakeholders to plan their affairs around the roadworks consider upfront what impact the work might have on their businesses and if if any and provide comment to counsel in this regard during construction of major road workers councils website is frequently updated to reflect the most current project information on hands so that interested parties are aware of the project 's progress throughout its delivery council also seen as a regular project updates for email to that this explanation so actively strive to continuously improve its level of customer service and community liaison and can always do better in this area and our rods second question what is the process or how does counsel measure the inconvenience caused to ratepayers businesses within the greater Shepperton city due to roadworks rod counsel gauged the level of inconvenience by understanding the nature of the construction the time frame for works a need for traffic isolation noise dust and access restrictions which may be needed these matters are considered by the project control group and mitigation measures determined prior to communication with affected property owners and business operators further mitigation measures can then be adopted following consultation ooh John 's John Gray 's questions first one from John back in May 2016 the council the day adopted the terms of reference for what was described as the golden valley highway by per section group can you explain the use of the term highway rather than the term freeway the response here John is the previous Advisory Committee was originally known as the golden valley highway Shepard in pipe a freeway shiburin bypass section group however following councils adoption of this stage approach and a realization that the bypass included a staged sort of approach and that the initial stages would involve single encouraged way I was considered more appropriate to refer to freeway in the name of the action group it really is related to that staging approach now your second question still on the topic of the freeway bypass action group bearing in mind the terms of reference mentioned in question one purpose one bivas states that provide a forum to update the community and stakeholders on the project process what is the current updated project program information for the interested community and stakeholder audience well the action group has been reformed as you know by resolution of this council and it contains a chairperson a representative of the committee for greater Sheppard and councillors from all participating councils and six community representatives the action groups quarterly meetings intended to act as a forum to provide action group members and the community with an update on the status of the bypass and other related issues this includes where with this knowledge the Action Group members a task with passing that information on to the community and other stakeholders and we 've done that by various means whether it 's public notice or forums we 've had or word of mouth as you know VicRoads has received and the government 's committed ten point two million dollars to the recent in the recent state government budget to progress stage one on the bypass which is good news and we 've been the action group has been working with VicRoads to better understand what those works they will involve some intersection works at Ford Road and the government Highway and also some works to prepare business plan for further funding of the stage 1 of this project so there 's a lot happening in this space and that group continues to meet and hopefully we 're getting enough information out to you thank you thank you mr. herri for that rather comprehensive answer and thank you for the questions John and rod next item counselors is 19.1 on page 113 do I have a counselor wishing to move the recommendation moved mr. mee don 't move the recommendation that 's stated pursuant to section 18 on 2d Local Government Act 1989 the council meeting be closed to members of the public for consideration of tucán confidential items and declare the items confidential taken to please Elsa O 'Keeffe we should speak to this counselor no straightforward mr. Mir against anyone against the motion I think these are very exciting and that they shouldn 't be confidential okay that 's your opinion and very well received Thank You counselor any other counsel wish to speak for that being said all in favor oh sorry counselor dignity anything tears nothing better mr. May all in favor against motion carried we 'll ask the public over you leave sorry at this point _"

announcing the actual winner announced before we begin with a greater chef in City Council acknowledge the traditional eyes the land which now comprises greater scepter we pay respect to their tribal elders we celebrate their continuing culture and ignoring other ancestors and thank you for that welcome to know I 'm extremely pleased to be standing here today that 's quite general I say that the beginning of my speech is potato extremely pleased to be sure which is a day that I think we 're with marking history moving force I think I refer to this day or a few months ago when we had earlier one of the proceedings in respect to Sam that time of you mark moving forward in Shepherds is some beers after sailing before so I think this day does actually indicate that 's why we 're looking at time from this point forward this was a momentous milestone for counsel and counsel endorse a recommendation an expert jury to select an architect designed a new shipment say the combination of several years of planning and discussions in sheer hard work while both staff and councils and the community as well back in 2010 the idea for a new art museum was touted space in the current sound is extremely limited and it doesn 't does not enable us to actually exhibit the wealth or venture art artifacts and artwork that we have to exhibit the location of Sam tackling between the council offices and these bank lacks disability and holistic experience many people are looking for when they visit an when you say and put me so much more and do so much more as well discussions and fan comments or something it would be a significant project for greater Shepherd and one that would put us on the map culturally and that 's what this is protok this is of designed to do I personally measure the wealth and the wellness of the community by its cultural standing and I think we are culturally mature as a as a regional city and this will certainly endorse a may 2015 council endorse the recommendations of feasibility study and the business case for a noose and this turning point of the project meant consultation and pain could commence in earnest which it did public feedback process show that seven six percent of people responded supported the business case for new arts museum this is a clear indication that the community wanted the new Sampson greater shipping and the whole region dry 2016 counseling launched a two stage design competition calling for expressions of interest from architects to design a new sound endorsed by the Australian Institute of Architects the competition would and division for what would be needed to build an outstanding building an outstanding location at the victoria park brake council received 88 submissions expressions of interest indicating the level of interest in designing such a unique building an opportunity that was obviously clearly saw architects from across australia and internationally i had a skills-based expert jury which i wasn 't part of had also been established to sort through 88 submissions and narrow the count five final designs in our rather exhausting and strictly regulated process I must stress that the five final designs are chosen the public exhibition helped and community feedback sort in the final five circuit science and that also fed into the final decision the community comment was incredibly constructive we received 1,400 responses with only 20 negative comments in addition more than 1,000 people visited the actual exhibition the jury was extremely impressed with the level of detail provided and the community 's responses and took the female back into account when making their decision in mid-february each of the five selected aptech tool firms presented their ideas of the jury announced questions about designs with fifty percent of the score based on design at 50 percentile capability and experience each design was considered carefully and at length so at this point I must sincerely thank you for five architectural first with a high caliber of their concept designs is not offer the opportunity to design and art museum comes along and every one of those five films delivered exciting creative concepts but must press it so I could wave on for a bit longer but I 'm sure we 're all waiting for the announcement but I will write on slightly to ask a group I profiled outstanding practitioners from the arts and architecture to give up their valuable time to adjudicate on such a significant development for greater shepherding is truly appreciate I want to stress that as well so thank you again for your time now time has come to announce the actual winner of the architectural competition and bearing in mind that this building will be an iconic building for greater ship than moving forward this is what general Victorians and wider Australian community means the thick of and visualize ado and may I say that the announcement the name isn 't being organized by the people organize the Oscars Peter good we have engaged in at all our right to announce with great racks and certain great pleasure of it denton corker marshall [Applause] again all the others

that and actor p thanks Denny yes congratulations fifth denton corker marshall and we will have representatives speak shortly with such a big turnout you 're always going to be someone in

sure pardon me if I have missed anyone that we do appreciate everybody that 's here today and project like this doesn 't happen of course unless you got some cult called her cash in your pocket and we do heavily rely on state and federal government for these projects to heaven so that I firstly call upon Jacqueline signs the member for Victoria so thank you so much Peter that 's good to know that 10 million dollars gets a speaking gig here I too would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners and paying my respects to their elders both past present and emerging and thank our email

it 's a great pleasure to be here I 'm representing the Minister for regional development job forfeit the sand is home to a unique collection of ceramics and dizziness and multicultural collections which attract more than 30,000 visitors all be very very very aware the museum is constrained due to its size and location so it was it was a hard decision to of the state labor government to support the shepherd an art museum to fly over to 10 million dollars it 's an investment from our regional jobs in infrastructure fund when we talk in Parliament and impress releases about growing our region 's in Victoria this is the type of thing exactly what we mean just as infrastructure and investment is critical to ensure thriving regional towns so to his cultural experiences and the coming together of the community to celebrate all that is great about it for some of that greatness greatness maybe on the sporting field scattered across town but throughout that for others creativity is their source of expression and achievement shepparton has a very proud history of supporting and encouraging community participation and pride through art and cultural expression but a modern purpose-built Museum and exhibition space takes us to the next level and expands that all important visitor economy I 'm thrilled to hear the winning design from Denton corporal cement Shepherd and as a cultural destination today really makes this mark the start of the reality of this project on our Rebecca islands it is up at night planning your exhibitions for the new space the project will create local jobs increase visitation of tractors investment and boost consumer spending in the region 's retail hospitality and accommodation sectors over the construction phase the project will inject 3 point 33 4.5 million in the local economy and create 72 jobs once operational the museum will increase visitor spending even by almost 7 million dollars per annum and provide another 23 direct jobs by you 10 once complete its forecast of the new music new museum will attract 90,000 in three years time and up to a hundred thousand at the five-year mark importantly this project will improve the region 's cultural vibrancy livability community engagement social cohesion and cultural connectedness within the indigenous and multicultural communities this will have a further positive impact on their annual visitors spend in the region and it 's likely to encourage other private investors to set up shop here I appreciate this project hard work people have been very committed to this project and the benefits that it will bring to the community and I want to acknowledge their energy time and effort thus and staff friends of San San foundation Sam advisory committee committee build a new sound project board we need a Samantha ranking at some Spanish person and all the local government the businesses and community groups who push through this project big projects they 're not easy but you

Jacqueline for your your contribution to just amazing what happens when governments decide to work together to Denny and two seamer Dennis Shelly here are many other counselors that have turned up later thank you for the work that you 're doing and leading you see Dave encanta down there cheering up the partnership sir which is the again helping state government of priorities right which is fantastic at the sand with the committee for and we 're just going to very very fine level of civic leaders looking from the committee for the partnership to the council and it 's there are all a things were going to talking about IES and bs well I 'm not quite sure I in my clinical radar what beer stands for I 'm happy for to that before it to staple before Sam as opposed to the other also to Peter queen who not only is a great mate of mine but also I 've been able to admire from afar the work that Peter has done driving the community along the same lines driving Council of driving state and federal governments but for Peter the head up the community of Sam and then this new project is an amazing accomplishment and earth I know those that have been behind this project over a period of time might think it 's taken a period of time I 'm telling you it 's taken no time at all to arrive from this concept with full community support that 's not quite true by the way I 've got a range of red leaf brothers and their recommend we waste in his body money and hey let 's be fair let 's be let 's be honest there 's into art but I tell you what life is pretty bloody boring if you don 't have art in their life and I 've been able to witness firsthand what a significant art gallery can achieve for regional city happy little 14 using vinegar and these figures that were quoted about a hundred thousand people in five to ten years time significant significant exhibitions whether they be art related or whether they be fashion elated can bring out if there 's an able to a regional city in three months so what this will do as a driver for regional development is just as significant as any decentralization program it says it 's important people sit around a kitchen table and I think about what to go what are the options available for us what are the real drivers that are keeping us living in the city and what are the prohibit is that are stopping us from taking note taking that decision to move into the regions and they talk about education they want to make sure that wherever they 've been had a job offer that is going health is going to be up and about they want to make sure that connectivity our road rail telecommunications they go you there is project projects actually create that leash in their memory and this one here is she 's always asking how 's it coming along how 's the design process going and just on that like like chocolate like to acknowledge success of denton corker marshall but also want to really acknowledge the other four of the four applicants because they 've invested so much time and effort energy into their designs as well either oven could 've been worse it could have been a successful design i just want to thank them for allowing shepherding to pick the very very best well we considered the better very very best obviously from for other companies that made an enormous mistake that hopefully will get over that and you 'll build will build this other way instead but listen it 's an enormous day for the city thank you very much the opportunity safety works and bets all look evenly on eagerly on as this project grows out of gets finished thank you [Applause] thanks Damon and again thank you very much for federal government certainly adults this is art resulting this project but it 's about community it 's about culture it 's about inspiration and what we see in the building I believe is an inspirational building it 's a statement building and we 're just so excited that denton corker marshall are here to deliver so my next key is to ask you to welcome John Denton and Adrienne Fitzgerald to say some words [Applause] [Applause] oh well we 're very excited it 's a fantastic project but we got very passionate about in designing it we came and we looked at the site me but this really is an ideal site in the park and the lake on the main road into Shepherd and you couldn 't get a better site through the gallery we discovered in a terrific collection Rebecca runs we see the potential in our design and move it forward to for Sam to have a effect like Mona in Hobart perhaps that really can transform ejection destiny but just like the was organized to run by writers shipping and counsel thank you that regard to the judging panel for their great foresight of course like to thank you and look we can 't wait to get going and with Rebecca and roll up our sleeves and get into it yeah I just really just like about how exciting it is to be to do projects like this weather with a lively community where they 're really putting their heart and soul into something that they believe is good for the city and we do too and so as you get is thanks to the council and to the people to chip in it because I think hopefully we 'll give you something that you 're really pleased with and love thanks thanks John thanks Adrian yes you spoke about process and this is sometimes project that floats in the playoffs and that 's quite exciting but a lot of time you 've got to get down dirty and deal with the nuts and bolts and process with that auditors probity auditors calling all over this and the feedback not getting from auditors that this has been done to the highest standard and if we keep that up and this will be a very good project my final do used to I think arranger that people and check on it 's already touched on those people but i 'll i 'll just mention the range of well everybody the rep thank you everybody room but council staff the same project board is calling teams for all the hard work and effort you put in to the same foundation yes put you in a crew doing fantastic work too callate the 12.5 million dollars coming from philanthropic private sources that that says something about this project it makes it quite unique that level of support their significant local support as part of that but there 's a whole whack of external support people from outside the area that just see this is a fantastic regional project to get involved in and how lucky are we that we have those people were involved I can 't with the moment go without thinking Rebecca coats for her detail input [Applause] _"

    "text": "councillor Patterson you should speak to that counselor oh yeah I just stay for mr. mayor I just like to remove the recommendation on page one that the minister did ordinary council meeting held on the audience in July 2017 has circulated be confirmed thank you you wish to speak oh thank you oh we should speak against this against motion carried item 6.1 Council peppercorn trees and Homewood Drive Marilla we have a recommendation on page 2 does any council we shouldn 't move motion any that motion Thank You mr. Mann for any other closing comments can 't thank you all you favor against motion carry their counselors item 7.1 the Australian Botanic Gardens Special Committee there is a recommendation on pastries does any council wish to move a motion please cancel outdoor and what 's that motion I would like to move the recommendation on page I see that we have got experienced and passionate committee members who have come back who have been and there 's a recommendation for their appointment however in future I would hope that there are some new players in the field mayor I think you 'd be remiss not to to mention the incredibly good work that this committee has done the budget which forms counsels performance statement thank you you have a seconder please counsel Abdullah councillor Patterson do we should speak to the motion oh yeah this is a bit like reading a book over four years really it 's been going on for years with our first council plan there was lots and what 's in it any other council wish to comment for or against I just like to say the new council it 's been a very interesting process looking back on the four years prior and the support given to us with this new council plan from our prior councilors has been invaluable as a learning platform I 'm excited about the council plan on the prior four years you also a contract or tenders currently being evaluated and this a substantial part of our next year 's capital works program is being determined right here works at a cosgrove and new Mecca road works associated with the sports precinct of course concept designs Moore contract the reason of condition survey sealed Road seal and pavement that works it 's going to flow out of that that body of work the solar farm which has been a bit of a sleeper in terms of public recognition this has got the potential to be a very significant substantial project and of course work a tackle moves and the next stage of the world 's 4th Street upgrade the Noyes Street intersection as I said there 's a substantial part of our capital works budget to be determined on this page if you speak against the motion for the motion council Abdullah just a quick quick comment again this is about the governance and the council and this is a particular recommendation this particular section really demonstrates that the visibility and you know community members can can get the visibility to the upcoming projects and that 's why it 's something really important and it 's it just reflects the good governance aspect of the council to comment for or against one of the ones that really stands out is cosgrove we 've been an enormous amount it 's right that we do but when you look at what I think was showing the Queensland regulations just makes you cry sometimes that we 've got to pay this amount of money and they 're just dumping that 'll come back and bite them on the back I hope it does and now the very big ones of course is that the Moines Street mouth which the communities out there wanting answers forum this is a first step in that and I 'm personally very excited about the solar farm I think that 's gonna bring new dimension to our whole region fantastic thank you that being said councillors councillor hazel in any closing comments it 's thanks to me the person raised that full corners program because it provides me the opportunity to make a bit of a comment about it the fact that in Queensland the very politically contentious issue is there is no waste levy on landfill and that 's obviously the the reason why the trucks are flowing across the border we from time to time complain about the levy here in Victoria but industry what we would like to see though is that the the development fund that where that money is going into that the government should free a bit of that up and that obviously the money that we 're spending at cosgrove butwe 're fountain Seng ourselves would be in a more logical time a good target for that Development Fund to be investing in this type of project indeed Thank You counsel all that being said in favour of the motion against motion carried item 8.3 councilors Municipal Association of Victoria 2016 2017 key achievements we have a recommendation on page 13 does any council wish to move a motion please council to me the motion on page 3 page 13 8.3 the Municipal Association Victoria known as mayor of 2016 2017 key achievements let 's do a second to please just speak to the motion carries Thank You mr. mayor the municipal or the amenity was known as the leadership think body for local government in Victoria key functions of the map include advocacy support training and the provision of advice to councils and councillors and I will the MOV doing some training great support network and I am really pleased with the support we get through here maybe I recommend that the council notes the key achievements which are extensively listed of the Municipal Association of Victoria during the 2016 2017 financial year a lot of context with it maybe the past six months and they do hold some great training for you councillors which is very much appreciated I just note in this report all these highlights and they have some very good ones securing the Carmel funding for five areas operational costs per week in 2018 for the national universal access to the kindergarten program and hopefully they 're kept they 're going to continue their advocacy to seek long-term funding which we certainly need the extension of the roads to recovery program until 2021 was confirmed in the federal budget and there just a couple of things that they 've done so yes I just I would agree with Kim and recommend that recommendation Thank You counselor any counselor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion counselor summer I would like to they are worth their weight in gold their partnership with local councils is highly valuable they 're very strong advocates they consult widely they educate and they actually play quite an active role in the development and strength of Victorian councils as we 've heard they 're their contribution by securing Commonwealth funding for early learning has been extensive they have advocated for roads to recovery as was mentioned they have highlighted adverse impacts on the state 's rate cap policy which has hit local councils quite hard and sometimes it 's difficult for us to get a clear picture of how that is affecting local government but it 's the nav and the LGA you come up and give us this data to say hang on a minute this is what 's going on and this is how it 's going to impact people on the coalface so what 's interesting is that they also fight against cost shifting that we can get from the state government or from the Commonwealth government we have here that they 've secured a commitment from the premier to restore 50 funding for a long time ago and it looks like that 's starting to be a bit more equitable in terms of funding and we 've also had a cost shift for councils to manage rose roadside weeds and pests but ma vie have directly advocated for 5.4 million allocation to councils so that the cost shift isn 't quite as significant and interestingly we 've just had a conversation about the landfill levy so it mentions in this that the MA V is putting pressure on the state to reinvest that landfill levy there is some reinvestment going on with the sustainability in terms of small projects that are likely to reduce greenhouse gases and result in joint procurement across councils which is terrific but when you look at the state requiring each local local council to retrospectively rehabilitate all the landfills that have been left in their municipality over many decades which is a multimillion-dollar endeavor and they 're not actually putting any money towards achieving that goal you do wonder why they 're even holding on to the levy or what purpose it is achieving Thank You councillor any Council doing yeah I think MAV is an effective platform for advocacy and lobbying and if whatever achievements they have highlighted in this report and also after looking at the report it appears that the key achievements benefit all councils across the board and it illustrates that the collective voice can be the effective voice for shared objectives and goals so I think the member benefits report that is included in this report kind of gives that kind of comfort feeling and confidence that the membership fee is justified so well then to move on these achievements thank you I 'll add my comments to that so I think one thing that isn 't listed here is they fought strong and had to prevent many councils from being actually sacked early on mid last year respectively good adoption of the code of conduct there was some inaccuracies on both sides there but so they were they were right in the thick of that fight and they helped achieve the outcome which resulted in legislation change pretty much overnight so they 've done that as well so I congratulate their achievements 'm very small one in perhaps the process I 've noticed myself isn 't it working with other councils from other regions has been very powerful I got to meet all the Bendigo councils recently the forum which was great and many many I 'm councillors I met recently on a weekend away so I think that 's very powerful I found that a very good learning experience with discussion and processes and yeah just networking I think it 's a great thing that you may have ever been counseled together from different regions good thank you all in favor of the motion counsels against motion carried item 9.1 the adoption of the true ins road investigation of the fragmented farmland we have a recommendation on page 17 councilors does any council wish to move a motion councillor Gaz I thank you mr. mee I 'd like to move that council adopt the investigation of fragmented farmland for the Troon Road area and that council offices intention to prepare an exhibitor playing scam amendment to include the investigation of fragment farmland in the greater ship and and planning scheme as please council Patterson counselor I thank you mr. mayor this issue actually goes back to around a bit between 2010 2012 when I first came before council and I took a little bit of understanding I I have to admit and now that I have got a good handle on it it 's it 's good to see that the area south of Tron 's Road has or will be remained as it has been even though they are fragmented blocks and they don 't meet the normal rule living zone requirements the moving the motion tonight we 're accepting that those particular properties will remain the same as they are there Thank You councillor person oh yes counselor juvinity is explained fragmented farmland as it 's been an issue for a while that 's been lingering our staff have done a great job to pick it up but it 's been hanging around unfinished since 2010 so now it 'll go master plan and all be good and we have some fragments fragmented farmland on their agenda which I 'm really excited about that 's great Thank You councillor motion council summer the report mentioned that there was was some fragmented farmland there but not enough to reduce the viability of the agricultural land that is also there so we 're pretty much just going to make no change in that we 're not going to fragment it any further and obviously we can 't claw it back because that 's already happened it does seem like a long time between a resolution and implementation but it wasn 't considered a top priority and and really the whole time that it 's been worked on it 's only cost us around about six thousand dollars so it 's good to get this over with and yeah it 's a report that offers no change which is generally a status quo that doesn 't cause a lot of controversy so I 'm happy to happy to pass this one thank you and you know the council wishing to come in either for or against I think it 's pretty eloquently covered mr. mee I think it has hold in favor of the motion against item nine point two councilors submission discussion paper May 2017 we have a recommendation on page 24 councilors do have a Council wishing to move for a motion please move the recommendation is a motion on page 24 that says that the council note the submission into the could be a specifically Shepard and project but allowing alternative industry to develop in the town is also inclusive in the questions here it also mentions a possibility of a trial which I think might be going ahead chriskiss brothers for a 24-hour food inspection of freights rather than having to transport it to the Port of Melbourne that have limited hours which reduces efficiencies here we have a rural location in the middle of the food bowl with no delays so that 's an incredibly I 'm incredibly supportive of that there was also a question around whether there 's access to hubs and ports and whether we expect to face problems moving Freight in our region in the future I would draw attention that the Port of Melbourne having haven 't had a sale to a private company there is the potential for that port to of the freight transport through the regions so if that 's the case it actually does the inland freight rail line to Brisbane unfortunately looks like we might have missed out on that and that if he 's very sad it to me shows the government that has no imagination no foresight so therefore it even more important we get back on on the front foot and be more proactive in being involved in some of those things I 'm extremely confident if we come back in 50 years some years we 'll still here but probably I won 't be in 50 years this will be a real Freight hub of Australia not just Victoria I believe the way we 're situated the produce that we 'll be flying out to Asia etc from a new airport and you railway line that everything will be centralized through shipping or the Golden Valley I 'm very confident but to do that and to be successful we have to be involved in every possible way we can and this is a way of keeping our nose in it and showing the and and we want to be involved Thank You councillor any other councillor wishing to speak against this motion all the motion to hands up Thank You mr. mayor just that the submission is extremely extensive I think it 's been a great way for me to try and get a grip on things and a little bit more further detail obviously we get our briefings we get things coming through but I have already used to mission you know a couple of times and really focusing on some key issues I think it 's it 's a great submission it 's very intensive it 's very extensive and it 's got a lot of hopefully a lot of weight that we 'll have moving forward region is changing it 's growing and the economic development of this region can accelerate provided we remove these barriers and there are these other barriers we have to talk about the freight movement the traffic movements and the management of the traffic movement in particular about we were just talking about the cosgrove landfill 3 which is state hub facility it 's a ready then obviously traffic movement solutions for heavy trucks carrying waste from this to and fro into this site will be important you know aspects to be addressed beforehand so yes basically it 's it 's a very good and very significant submission and we need to be talking about it straight away thank you speak against the motion for the motion I will actually extremely important we see ourselves as the Australia 's major transport hubs you cannot the major regional hub in this whole country not just Victoria and we will and I think that status will only become more and more enhanced as we move and grow into the future so if this document can affect the decision-making processes of the powers of B it 's worth its weight in gold so I hope it does actually find find a place in there and the minds of the decision-makers I 'm sure it will and hopefully some of these extensive items that are being listed here clear that they really oughta have another look at the roots yes thank you that being said all in favor of the greater ship and heritage open day for 2017 we have a recommendation on page 31 any council wishing to move a motion please Council of doing page 31 the recommendation as motion and it says that council resolved to host a greater Shepperton heritage open day in association with the greater Shepperton heritage Advisory Committee on the 28 October 2017 Thank You councillor cave councillor abdullah you should speak to the motion the heritage Advisory Committee has worked hard to investigate the feasibility of holding this heritage open day and I think it 's inspired by the Malbin open day but it 's you know this it will be a consulate event and I think it will give the confidence back to the people that greater share Patton 's heritage is significant and there 's so much that we can achieve in terms of tourism you know economic development and heritage preservation so it 's a fantastic idea to hold the open day Thank You mr. Mann I think Kent Abdullah has covered that fairly well I think the recommendation to host a great Shepherd and heritage open day range of places of cultural heritage significance as well as to promote community participation in cultural heritage issues and values within the municipality I think this is a becoming quite obvious in the community that we need to be in this space so I think moving with an open day and the committee 's obviously doing a great job I think it 's a positive thing to have an open don 't engage with our community more any other councillor wishing to speak against this motion all the motion only to say that this mare is in very well with our current heritage investigation that 's going on right now it 's a fun way of turning around the perception the greater Shepherd and Lacs heritage hopefully we 'll get a lot of kids involved and the more people become aware of how important heritage is perhaps we 'll get some more heritage type things coming out of the woodwork that we can include and showcase on a broader scale good thank you any other council wishing to comment for against none Thank You councillor any closing comments no all nine point four councilors is the statutory planning update October 2016 2 May 2017 the other councillor we should remove emotion councillor Giovannetti yes mr. mayor I 'd like to move the motion and that the council note the planning permit VCAT development hearings panel and enforcement file information to eat out in this report a subpoena on page 35 of the agenda yes thank you a second to plays counsel sama so Giovannetti actually mr. Maness is very pleasing the Rhea the briefing report we 've heard from staff indicates that our planning department were working successfully and although there 's been a decrease in planning applications lodged for the same period of 2015-16 the statutory time frame that we required to meet we 've actually improved on on previous years just to give you a bit of an indication of that we find that the average decision-making time for the planning permits from October 2016 till the end of May 2017 was forty four point three eight statutory days and the average decision-making time for the corresponding period last year was forty six point three two days which certainly hoping speaking with the the staff involved we can actually improve on that for next year you know that that 's their intent so I think overall planning department have done a very good job over the last 12 months improving where we were from same time last year good thank you counselor counselor iterate what counsel Giovannetti just said this is a competitive field in planning and we obviously obviously this report is in a testament to our staff they 're very professional and quite ambitious when it comes to setting themselves out amongst the field it 's a really interesting read here like councillor hazel Minh mentioned before with the contracts awarded under delegation that sometimes these reports the most interesting ones hidden in the agenda so these don 't necessarily come to us they 're it 's all there in black and white about where we are with v-cut activity where we are with planning applications and the dhp it 's a really Dean Reid it 's just sort of a behind-the-scenes insight into the workings of our planning department so I 'm quite pleased with planning applications but there was a spike last year so there are reasons for these peaks and troughs and ultimately our department strives for the utmost in high performance and so I encourage them all the way thank you any councillor wishing to speak against the motion I know they take pride in being as quick as they possibly can and as counsel I someone said that they 're trying to improve their times every year and I think it 's terrific I do a great job finger cancer I tend to agree to I think this planning update shows that we 're heading in the right direction I think most important documents this council has we were measured on that by the community in their quick we can resolve their planning permits so it looks as if we 're heading in the right direction so will indicators good that 's a great thing for council and for the community careful juvinity just in closing mr. me what counselor Patterson said was correct at the planning to power age 44 grab your rating it all out Thank You Kendall Hazen look it 's a matter of contention probably going back to the comments about the Planning Department that the development hearings panel I think some of the commentary about it has been misguided people haven 't fully understood what the panel does and since its introduction back in August of last year there 's been four here because some 19 planning permits that have been determined and those planning permits would have either been determined by officers under delegation we ended up through the council process and what the the dhp process nation of other process it 's somewhat formal there is set process for applicants objectors ask questions and we 've diversified the work of the panel we 're now incorporating representation from other municipalities professional planning staff from shore of Maharashtra Aoki and will soon expand that to include campus be and Van our I think it 's a particularly good process and I would hope that perhaps counselors who in two minds but how the DHB works actually come along to one and sit in the gallery and I think it 's a particularly good process and objectors where the opportunity to say it 's not a case of sitting in a room downstairs talking to planners they get a a good hearing and I think the process is it 's been extremely valuable and really worthwhile good Thank You counsel counsel okay actually cancel Hey very well thank you I had points but they 've been covered so thank you right any counsel wishing to speak against the motion for the motion someone I think that it has been a long saga that they touch pay we 've been poking and putting out on hoping to get it right and I hope that this is a version that will stick for a while okay thank you I think it was successful that being said counselor hazel in any I think the version actually changes we 're just increasing the membership to provide a degree of more flexibility as which which is good the transparencies never been they missing and I think that what is particularly interesting is that some of the commentary as I said in my previous comments perhaps hasn 't_''_2014.27 been as well-informed as want to come along to the dhp sitting the gallery and observe it operates I think they 'll be a far better informed what I also commented before it did has reduced the number of appeals being made to V cap but the dhp process doesn 't take away either the applicant or the objectors V cat appeal rights if they 're not happy with the outcome they 're still about that all this does is provides a quicker turnaround time for people and it provides a direct opportunity for people to engage around the table with a variety of people to get an outcome and from my experience from the number of these that I 've chaired is that your people might not get a hundred percent of what they want both applicants and objectives but in a mediated process they get in the outcome that they can rely on Thank You counselor all in favor of the motion objectives as recently as yesterday and they had some really good points that perhaps a large cool store and packing shed such as this is not strictly a agricultural use now we have gone back and considered that and since Matthew guy relaxed the planting conditions in the farming zone this would go well could I can 't always say it would because there 's all additions that are attached to this project and admittedly they look great on paper and I really do hope that the reality is that there will be minimum disruption to the surrounding properties ultimately we have to take these cases on merit as a case-by-case and to me the benefits outweigh the negatives so I am in favor of this Thank You councillor Patterson losses we met with before the motion counselor Germany yes thanks mister me this is a significant development for greater shipper than City I think that as counsel Patterson has mentioned it 's something that is going to provide a significant amount of benefit to our municipality over many years to come the amount of employment that 's going to be created with this development is going to be large I do sympathize with the some of the with the objectors but the fact the matter is we need to is what we have the only can sorry the only issue I would have is that as councillor Sam I mentioned earlier is that the conditions are met particularly those pertaining to noise I think that that could be a significant issue but we have been advised that will be monitored once the development is up and running and I 'm confident that if that 's the case then and there shouldn 't be an issue good Thank You councillor any other councillor we should speak against for Keith Thank You mr. mayor it 's always very difficult when it affects people 's lives whether it 's one or 100 it gets down to compassion the the residents there but I do see there 's a substantial advantage to our community going ahead with this project Thank You councillor and you have a council we should add comment thank you a difficult planning metalloid because I think it 's always timely to think about what councils role is and quite clearly our role as mandated under the Act is to administer the Planning and Environment Act and not the standing social impacts I think we need to follow the guidelines in the rules and the professional advice of our officers as much as we can it 's when you diverge from that advice you end up in expenditures referred to previously and that 's something we certainly want to avoid having said that though and look there is an enormous range of permanent conditions that have been applied and as we commented previously in relation to the intrusive in this one but however it got through they couldn 't go through we 've got to prove that we can that 's the type of precedent we 'll people will look at it 's probably the sort of thing that I 'm mindful of in assessing this type of application but at the same time understanding the position that the objectives are in it 's not a very pleasant or likeable circumstances but at the end of the day on the professional advice of officers we need to approve the application Thank You councillor no further comment from any other councillors poor against tho Thank You counsel sir any closing comments Cary item 10 councils tabled motions we have none item 11 reports and council delegates to other

Muir to move that the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on the 20th of September 2017 as you look closer June 22 June so jerusem September there are well yeah well doubler might be ten counselor dividend could you read that your motion out again please read again mister where the minutes of the ordinary council meeting held on the 20th of June 2017 as circulated be confirmed thank you to have a seconder Kenneth awesome counselor germinating you Jewish to speak to that I recommend it straightforward counselor Sutton Nova council we can add comment all in favor carry item 6.1 councillors petition for the Hermitage Street Shepperton else I was very I have to move that recommendation which is that the council receive the petition the lady exhibited streets capital to take you to have a seconder council supple and your comment councillor I don 't think so it 's off to plan creams to me Castle Sutton yeah any council wish to speak to or against that version can also is very any no thanks personally all in favor carried either the 7.1 there panel so to have a councillor wishing to move a motion you to lose the motion I 'll move the recommendation as a motion on page four as printed printed you have a seconder please councillor Abdullah II also summer just this is a provision for a panel of suppliers for compostable bags and what I particularly like about is that it just it demonstrates how George joint procurement opportunities are in the waste industry across all shires we 've joined with Moira vanilla stress bogey and Wangaratta who 've all taken on a green bin service and and joined with them in working on this contract which probably would equate to quite a saving the total contract is estimated at 1.4 million dollars which would exceed the limits set by the Local Government Act so we have to move it as a motion if people do run out of bag just on a side note they can collect more bags from the office council office or call customer service to have them delivered the next bin day one bag should last every two to three days and a roll twenty five thousand rolls and they 're eight liter bags it cost around 200,000 per annum so we would like the public to be responsible with them and congratulate them for the transition the successful transition because diverting food from landfill obviously has environmental benefits less greenhouse gas lives less toxic water and less expense for ratepayers up to over all Thank You Council some accounts lab do I want to add any comments I just would like to add that it was good to see that it was a joint procurement exercise where buymoria Shire Council was appointed as the agent to act on behalf of all the other councils tender process was overseen by Maury Shire procurement department and they was of course a benefit to Shepperton Council in terms of joint procurement it achieves it contributes to achieve cost efficiencies and volume discounts the tender process was overseen by motor Shire Council and the evaluation of panel had procurement representatives from individual councils including greater shape leadership it ins so this panel has had five supplies sorry the five supplies panel will ensure that the council is of stock compost back at intact at only one supply is mitigated because these bags are manufactured overseas and they 're locally distribute is it distributed it 's important that there 's a regular supply of these bags so by not having not not being reliant on one supplier I think this idea of having a panel of five supplies is a good one and yeah so I 'm I 'm happy with with the way this document was has been undertaken Thank You Council of July any council wishing to speak against this motion any council wishing to add comments in support of the motion fails for Patterson yes I just like to say I totally support five councils getting together it literally gets a small bag for our back gives us bigger the buying power they are which is very important I could see us doing this a lot more often with other sorry only mr. Pelley 's in the future 2% rate capping you really got to look at your costs and this is a good way of doing indeed I concur with that council Patterson I model that a lot of other councils will adopt moving into the future to be more efficient in the use of their ratepayers funds that being said any other council wishing to speak against for council some would you like any closing comments No thank you Miss Mac that being said all in favor of the motion against motion carried counselors item 8.1 the festive decorations any counsel wishing to move emotion in respect to that I 'd like to move the recommendation as a motion with an additional dot points the dot point is that counsel review the festive decoration budget allocation within the next two months okay is that clear counselors so it 's the recommendation is printed with the additional line of you just repeat that sorry capsule summer council review the festive decoration budget allocation within the next two months okay so that 's the motion before us counselors do I have a seconder so Jeff and Eddie Council summer the reason for the dot point addition of dot point four is on page 12 of the agenda it clearly points out that the festive decorations 're planning to spend ninety six thousand instead of one hundred and fifty one thousand so that 's a 55,000 2,000 drop and as far as our over overall budget goes that can be made up in quarterly budget reviews or mid budget reviews but as far as fifty five thousand dollars in Christmas decorations it means a whole lot to them it 's a lot of tinsel I was on that committee so I know how much things cost firsthand and I just don 't think that the amount of money that we 've budgeted will give us that bang for buck personally I think we should be spending more money than we used to not less and in the recommendation it also in the motion it also recommends that we disband the committee so that makes it clear that Christmas decorations are a priority for this council and the responsibility will be placed on counselors shoulders not the committee so if we 're going to hang our hat on this surely the intention is to make a big impact as far as balancing the budget goes as I our focus of community scrutiny every year we get phone calls all the time about what we could have done better and I do applaud the work of the staff who put together the Community Survey that was a great way of giving council direction on what works and what we could improve on as far as Christmas goes it 's our festive time it 's an occasion that people of all cultures can enjoy it gives us pride in our town it stimulates the economy we get Christmas sales it reinvigorate the CBD with excitements and honestly I think it 's an opportunity to go back and get it right in terms of resourcing I don 't personally want to be accused of being lively when it comes to Christmas decorations so whether we increase the budget or reduce the budget or keep the budget the same I do think it needs to be looked at Thank You Council summer council juvinity yeah I agree to write the words of council summer I just like to thank the Friends of previous festive decorations committee for the work that they done an excellent job I think we 've taken on a very big task added to our current role by taking over this the role of the festive decorations committee has council summer has already indicated that there was quite a lot of public concern last year in relation to the lack of decorations in certain areas and so I think that our task to try to appease all sections of the community will be a difficult one but I 'm sure that we will be able to do it Thank You councillor Jevon any any councillor wishing to speak against this motion look I do and I 'd like to basically foreshadow another motion at this one against the summer 's violence and it 's basically along the timeframe of the two months more than more than the actual reviewing it done I think it 's a good thing to review it but two months is not going to give us a chance to see how to working why else we know we need to have a longer I 'll be suggesting we have we reevaluate within 12 months just don 't know if we have to expand the budget or not and we won 't ever timeframe in two months it 's going to take us into September we 're still not going to really know exactly what where we 're going I 'll take it out of that counselor Allison here any council wishing to speak before the motion against everything else translators none but probably long the same similar for the thoughts to councillor Patterson I think this is addition to the motion or to the recommendation is a bit premature because we 've got no idea what that additional expenditure might entail and I think the report itself gives a fair framework of what 's happened we 've had a fairly comprehensive briefing back in April and one that led into the budget process we adopted a budget and now as part of this and leading living asked to consider a motion or a recommendation that incorporates the development of a festive decoration style and three year capital plan I think when that body of work comes forward we 'd be well informed then as and what in fact we were purchasing I think like councillor Patterson if we review the allocation not have to do that at some stage into the future I 'm not opposed to the idea I think we 'd be far better informed could make a far better decision there 's a note to that in last year 's budget we spent in the order of fifty five thousand dollars on installation commissioning decommissioning of the decorations that are around and that sort of spend is commensurate with in the capacity of this year 's budget looking at the figures there so I don 't think we are scrimping on on the circumstances I think we 'd also be interesting to look at the allocations across both capital budgets and operational budget and see where the variations really really do exist so as I said I think it 's some appropriate stage in the future when that body of work indicated in the recommendation was completed would be far better informed as to making an allocation towards it Thank You councillor hazen and any other so we 're going to is to me just in relation to the two-month period as opposed to the 12-month through you mr. mayor I was just wondering what what 's the benefit of having a shorter turnaround from councilor summers point of view Council summit do you want to elaborate and that 's why I can 't elaborate on that I settled on two months because we generally do and I take the point that we 'd have to become fairly organized fairly quickly we already have locked in three workshops for councilors to discuss what we may or may not want us to infer as as far as decorations go that 's the opportunity to really lock down the kind of impact we 'd like to make my assumption is that the dis budget that we have is not going to be merely enough especially considering the prices of decommission is 55,000 that 's not even getting into the capital and the operation so it will be finalized by November that shouldn 't be an issue once the workshops are finished we would have direction and we 'd have a general idea on 's not necessary to wait 12 months in my opinion your opinion counsel some of this a bit of a sense of urgency about reviewing this absolutely issues for the first year we don 't have the committee and it 's we 're responsible for it I 'd like to have a bit of an impact having said that reviewing the budget allocation doesn 't necessarily mean you 'll be expanded exactly as I was raised do it thank you any council wish to speak before the motion against we 've had counsel summer any closing comments just on the fact that we adopted the budget allocations to be 94 thousand instead of one hundred and fifty one thousand there 's many many line items in the budget and obviously some things do get missed we 're now at the pointy end of that line item and I don 't think it 's unreasonable to have another look okay that being said all in favor of the motion against motion carried item eight point two counselors is the greater ship and in Linda 's chart Alliance advisor can be membership was second to please care for summer council Abdullah like to move the recommendation on page fourteen as a motion that the council in those sorry that the council endorsed a greater Shepperton women start Airlines advisory committee membership application for two-year to commencing on 18 July 2017 and

other committees it 's really gaining notoriety the events is really popular they have a big cause for social justice issues I really think the committee has done very well and it really does create leadership within the community itself is wishing to speak for the motion Council Abdulla any closing comments just reiterate what cancer samo saying about this committee that is really raised its profile in the past few years and all the members of the community members they have contributed hugely and we have seen results we have seen some good results and it is really a forum for a platform for community women to come together and promote their leadership skills promote you know awareness development and work on the causes that relate to the most development in gender equity so it 's a fantastic forum and it 's good to see that it 's growing and we have in this round of application we have seen membership applications from diverse range of community members that 's great good Thank You counsel Beulah all in favor of the motion against motion carried try to make point three councillors a review of policies community strengthening Java Council we should move emotion councillor

accept their resignations and rescind their memberships effective immediately the seconder please councillor Sutton councillor Giovannetti a standard process when someone resigns I would just like to

committee members counsels wishing a bit of emotion any one councillor Patterson and what it 's that motion Council Patterson I 'd like to move the recommendation on page 24 which is 9 1 which is that council appoint the following six members to the greater Shepherd hopefully she 'll Park Advisory Committee for two year term commencing an 18 July 2017 and concluding on the 30th of June 2019 they 'd be right and Steve Cartwright and over on page 25 I would like to nominate council fern summer as our counselor I would like to a move a motion to a point counselor so not yes yes representative Akriti Cove a seconder please counselor is very council Patterson thank you yeah look this is has been going on for quite a while but I think most councils from the old the old old school will remember well and truly there was a lot of going on about finding a suitable place for lawfully dog park and we had lots of meetings in different areas with lots of ratepayers and they 're all pretty well I 'm happy where we intended to put it we tried to find a spot there where it really works eventually we come up with Patterson Road which is a really great place to be this group of really well they 've been a supporter of this all along it 's grown and causes us no trouble they 've done a terrific job down there and on really looking forward to now that once these committees in themselves together they can identify you know different things they want in there they can go in and tracked events themselves they can maybe even pick up the sponsorship themselves the sky 's our limit with them and I 'm really looking forward to that blossoming again in the next couple of years after this happened so I highly recommended I 'm sure councilor summer I 'll be a great counselor rep on it well send Thank You councillor Paterson councillor is very thanks mr. Neil just wondering there 's a conflict of interest with Paterson Road and councillor Paterson but I just amazing but the other issue is that effect which is little not often known is that effectively you can 't walk your dog off alert anywhere in Chipping greater shipping and so I think this is long overdue and as Council what Paterson is correctly identified as a as a second term council I remember the gestation period in relation to this taking off and there was some doubt as to whether would eventually take off but counsel of summer was very passionate about it and I council representative on this committee going all ears hear hear Thank You councillor rosemary any councillor wishing to speak against this motion your mic is switched off councillor summer I can 't hear you if you want to speak against that none that we just big for the motion thankful the motion in Cusco thank you thank you I 'd like to speak for the motion and thank Steve Cartwright in particular who is appointed hopefully to this committee who was lobbying candidates during the 2012 council election which is where the idea came from council resolved in 2015 to make ducats reserves Patterson Road a permanent off leash park and we handed it to the community on the 30th of June since then again Steve Cartwright has been lobbying council to begin some kind of committee there 's been talk that they can have sponsorship with other animal facilities around town to try and gain funds for obstacle courses for more shade for lighting and they also have a Facebook page now the Facebook page has over one thousand two hundred and ninety members and each day people are great for the pooch and the people because it socializes the animals and socializers the community and as our expiry counsellor is very mentioned it 's illegal to have dogs off leash anywhere else so it has been terrific and since people pay animal registration fees this is a nice way to give back to those dog owners and hopefully the committee 's can also lie A 's for potential site trials and permanent locations in years to come maybe for small towns or somewhere thank you guys council over some other like to add my own comments I think it 's a perfect example of some great outcomes that council can achieve this started well before I become counselor and it took a few years from what I understand to get across the line but it 's it 's there now that the committee is formed and I think it 's only fitting that councils I 'm gonna be on that committee representing councillors she was very passionate as the other councils were as well but I think you are the main driver that 's a congratulations on that just like to make closing comment don 't hope when you look at Manor supermarkets with up the south and the north it 's a long way when you consider that kind of a dog off leash in a municipality it 's a long way to go from north to south Shep and I can envisage your hopefully this group can have input on trying to identify somewhere in the north of Shepherd and where we can have a similar you know you come in this group potential to have a look and AW the groundwork forest that US council has tried to do originally councils made you have a car now I just have a perfect piece of land where one the alternate thank you as I replace being said all in favor councillors commotion against motion carries item nine point two counselors never the contracts awarded under the delegation and status of contract advertising yet to be awarded for June 2017 driver counseling a big motion we all move the recommendation printed on page 28 of the agenda and yes 28 correct which is able to follow the is the ocean thank you very much to have a seconder please counsel summer counselor hazel Minh a Miss Mara I think this is one of the more informative parts of the monthly agenda it provides a good detailed outline of the the body of works that are moving through the council tenders that are contracts that have been awarded of delegation other tenders that are going through the process and it gives a lot of information to the community about the work they can look at various items and do an estimation on when this is going to come back to another council meeting for a formal adoption or the actions and works that will will ensure and I think it 's interesting you look at things like under delegation with you know it sort of passes almost unnoticed but the female changer and facilities that you can reserve has been a contract awarded BMX track renewal a contract being awarded in a business case as electronic vehicles this is all interesting and exciting stuff and unfortunately as it tends to pass as more of an administrative process council is the most informative part of the agenda even as a counselor I always flick through to these part first being under delegation it doesn 't necessarily come through council laws anything under 400,000 is delegated to the CEO and sometimes you get nice surprises and sometimes it 's things we already knew about last month we mentioned the electric vehicle feasibility case which is terrific and it also has in there mod Street Mall redevelopment concept design which tenders currently advertise clothes tomorrow and the solar farm it also mentions the tender process for that so these are all things that are on the radar and coming up and like councillor Haysom and said it 's just a good indication to the community of things that may have gone under the radar Thank You Council some are any council wishing to speak against this motion councils wishing to speak in support of the motion Council Abdulla just like to add that as a councillor Chris Hillman and council summer have already mentioned that it 's a very informative piece offer I 'm sort of an informatics section of agenda transparency of operations I think this is a very good example and I really am very confident about whatever comes here it gets communicated to the whole community and I think that 's a point that we need to highlight Thank You girls about councils we need to speak against for councillors very thanks mr. mayor yes by way of reference to the electric vehicle feasibility and business case it was interesting to to learn from my perspective that Telus winery 's actually got to recharge points and in for electric cars and installed by Tesla free of charge so that 's a reflection of where we 're going the other issue is in relation to the continuing construction that 's occurring out of the sports precinct again a reflection of the fact that that 's an ongoing project which is almost reaching fruition together with the soccer standards going in as well and it 's interesting to note that the complaints by people in relation to the fact that their parking issues out there operated which is also an encouraging thing the council 's we just think against a the motion against inclusion Kerrigan item 9.3 counselors equipment of members to the Shepard and show me committee any counsel at wishing to leave a motion mr. mayor I 'll move that recommendation but I 've got an amended one and I think it 's just for an administrative well you 'd like to move this motion with some additional yes I would although the one on that 's the one I 'd like to move the one that was here that one and we 'd like me to read the recommendation please that the council having considered the applications received were appointment to the Shipton Charmy committee one appoint the following candidates for two-year term commencing on the 18th of July 2017 concluding on the 16th of july 2019 Simon cut rocky Andrew Pogue Cristina Marco Chris DeRose no Helen James Sofra to appoint the following candidates for a one-year term commencing on the 18th of July 2017 concluding on the 17th of July 2018 John Montaigne and cruz patel good Thank You Council on over second debates councillor Sutton and Sylla Lawrence very Thank You mr. mee look the number of people on the ship and in Charmy committee that tie their tenure has come to an end and they don 't want to read ama Nate and some of that one person has resigned for personal reasons going on to bigger and better things and this is just another step in the process of reporting fresh faces and I think all the people that we 've considered for appointment will bring a value adding to the committee Thank You councillor Saturn just it 's a great committee to be on because it 's do with marketing greater shepherding or Shepherd in itself and they do do lots of great stuff so I congratulate those who have been appointed to the committee I think they 'll be doing a good job good thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this motion I think councils wishing to speak for the motion I just like to make a comment and it 's similar to dog park you know there was lots of hassle hassles between council and chip show me three and four years ago and it worked out Shepperton shopping is better for it Thank You councillor Patterson any other councillor wishing to speak against the motion or as I was very any closing comments Thank You mr. mayor I will take that opportunity I 'd be remiss of me not to acknowledge the great work of Malcolm Blake has been a stalwart of the Shepherd and Charlie Committee for some considerable time in his capacity as chairperson on a number of occasions and also like to acknowledge Daniel Tate and Vaughn Papa Leah and Aaron brain who have also finished up with the Shepherd in Charlie and I support the comments that as a second term councillor when I came on to Council with a former CEO who 's no longer here there was a lot of fractious problems going on there was a lot of infighting there was a very a political situation and it 's encouraging to see that that 's been put behind us and the committee as my fellow councillors have acknowledged they 're doing great things and I fully expect that to continue Thank You councillor all in favor of the motion ship in heritage stage studied to see June 2017 released for public consultation another council wishing to be of emotional councilor orizari second deplete sorry council I was wearing what was emotional yes all that sorry that the recommendation contained on page 36 points one two and three be the motion thank you a second to please Oh Castle Patterson now counselor as well you would like to speak to the motion Thank You mr. mayor this look heritage is a bit like heart it 's in the eye of the beholder and I speak for myself and I say what one person 's idea of heritage is not necessarily my idea of heritage I make no bones about that it was interesting when we had the briefing here in relation to Deborah Kemp speaking about things I made some notes as I 've Kennedy she stated the most exciting heritage study that reveals Shepard in his a heritage secret 176 places of heritage interest primarily in a rural setting she made mentioned that Murchison when it was filling the compacity council area had a very untidy heritage background she of the most diverse suite of places that are of heritage significance in Victoria all these facts I didn 't know Erica is history sense of place it goes to building a sense of place and is part of building a sense of national identity it 's in this context that greater shepherding has a wealth of places that contribute to that national identity and she went on to state things of the nature that the internment declare w camp the dangal mansion the first quater house built by James Irving the fact that our main arrivals mill Jura is the first place to develop irrigation back in the 1880s and she further went to say that the Dookie Township which was created in the 1870s in response to the lands act and started originally at the casual bank site in fact historically it was bigger than shepherding now all this goes to say but on a broader scale I recognize the importance of heritage and it 's also recognized and endorsed through the auspices of Planning and Environment Act and however whilst noting that this motion is not about about the consolidate phase I look forward to hearing the debate that goes towards finally passing this s good Thank You councillor is very councillor Patterson is has lot of work been put in by staff already into this study and unfortunately for them I think there 's a lot more to come this is a consultation that 's going out for six weeks in that time anyone that has an issue or another idea will have the opportunity put a submission in which I strongly encourage them to do there is places that I 've seen have been put up that to me really shouldn 't be there that is other issues completely because I have no heritage knowledge as far as what should be and shouldn 't be so we 're going to rely on some expert advice but I 'd certainly encourage anyone that has a property that is listed and they 're not sure and not happy about it please put a submission in and I 'm sure everyone will be happy to have a look at it and discussions and we 'll come up with 's you can get yourself in trouble with heritage I realize that but everyone this keeps mentioning the post office and everyone thinks for year now one one to lose that this is now getting a long way down from that I realized but we still have to be very conscious there is some very good heritage stuff around it isn 't protected and some of this stuff I know through River Connect it 's it 's very important to our history history that you 'd never believe was here regarding Cobb Co and those little place aside extremely importantly protect that we have to be realistic so I 'm looking forward to a big six weeks after that and I think there 's gonna be a lot of work to do to start to actually address it and we 're going to need as councils we 're going to need some expert advice as well Thank You councillor Patterson any councillor we should just speak against this motion councillor give Eddie Thank You mr. mayor talking about getting sales in the summer world also here we go close I endorses the Shepherd and Heritage study stage to see and releases the draft document to comment I personally cannot support a motion that ultimately will inhibit homeowners who wish to modify or renovate their homes as they 'll require permission based on the Heritage overlay and the planning scheme amendment I virtual property owners who have been notified of the Heritage study to contact council staff to ascertain what effect the Heritage study if adopted will have on their properties and to make their submissions to Council if they believe that the study will adversely affect them I have no problem with protecting public facilities in relation to the heritage overlay but I do have some concerns when it relates to personal homes I think that we can become a little go a little bit overboard with some of the decisions that we may make and I just urge every one of the private homeowners who are to be affected by this change to contact counsel to make sure that they fully understand what implications could happen in relation to their property Thank You Council on any other counsel wish just say that it is a draft heritage study it 's not actually going to be maybe not going to be actually as it is here we 're looking for public consultation we 're looking for the people that may be affected to make sure they put in their comment and then everything will be considered before we make a final decision absolutely any other council we can just speak full emotion that 's what I 'm doing I would agree with counsel Shelley Sutton that it is just a job and this is a perfect opportunity for the community and whoever wants to have give us a feedback so that 's the opportunity there also I would also like to acknowledge the hard work that has been put in by the committee and the Heritage Advisory Committee has done a wonderful job in a sense that I 'm a council representative on this committee and it 's been only a few months but I know that this work was going on for last two years and I have seen the passion among the committee members regarding preservation of heritage is something that we need to acknowledge because this this level of work would not be there if we did not have the passion from our community members so I really want to congratulate them on their on this excellent work thank you thank you can slab drill out any other council wishing to speak against the motion or the version councilor summer yeah I do appreciate the point of view of counselor Giovannetti in that a man 's home or woman 's home should be their Castle if you buy a property and expect to be able to subdivide or renovate and that suddenly has a heritage overlay slapped on it that can certainly seem like an unfair course of action and we often see the repercussions of that in terms of submissions in planning permits the issue here is that heritage is always going to be contentious there is a public vibe that we have lost a lot of our heritage and there really isn 't much left the fact that we found a hundred and seventy sites that potentially could be listed with as a Heritage Site in this document has been enormous There is obviously a line that needs to be drawn what is heritage and what isn 't there was a joke earlier someone was saying what if Ned Kelly used the latrine does that mean we can 't_''_2733.24 upgrade the toilet so you know there will be a line we 're going to use our common sense it 's just the beginning of a very comprehensive process if you get a letter that says you may or may not get a heritage overlay slapped on your property please engage with us now is the time it doesn 't necessarily mean there 's going to be restrictions it 's just a process so it ties in nicely with our heritage grants that are also available and that could actually work in favor of the property so yeah we 're just working things out as we go Thank You counsel so many other counsel we should just speak against the motion for the motion okay that being said before I hand back to councillors ray I 'll just say that no doubt we 'll be looking so counselor who is very any closing comments thank you for the opportunity mr. mayor a couple of things that jumped out at me and first and foremost foremost is the use of the word common sense or counsel of summer and that 's the flower that doesn 't go in everyone 's garden and I 've used that before but you have the Heritage overlays which will ultimately be restrictive and prescript prescriptive are also not lost to me in the sense that the comments made by councillor Jeff and Eddie in relation to the distinction between home ownership and public buildings is a very real and relevant consideration but I 'd like to go at pains to emphasize the fact that this is just going out for public consultation sometimes we get a bit emotional bit passionate about the fact that this is a final product it 's not the final product and heritage heritage like so many planning outcomes it would be the single biggest pain in the proverbial for any council so I would urge those people that would potentially consider themselves to be most effective quite vocal about it because it 's an opportunity that if you don 't utilize it will be lost Thank You mr. mcdee Thank You councillor I was very all your favor of the motion councillors against motion carried item 10.2 the greatest chef in Heritage Advisory Committee nomination of community representatives to over counselor wishes with motion Council Abdullah 's I see you hand clapping okay thank you what 's the motion you 'd like to move council in motion the recommendation on page 42 yeah I would like quick right Monty okay I would like to move the recommendation on page 42 as a motion thank you you have a second to place as for summer councillor Abdullah would you like to speak to that motion yeah it 's about the Medical Advisory Committee nomination of community representatives we have got three nominations and having considered the nominations to seek for appointment to the Heritage exactly what you just like note offices that counselor Jimmy is left the room continue sorry counselor bill it 's about the appointment of the community representatives to the Heritage Advisory Committee for have got John Richards Laurie Evan Lloyd and Robin Flay and the second point is about the so yeah so just want to say that it 's fantastic to see that we have got such passionate as I 've said before the passion about heritage and preservation of our history and heritage is evident from these applications and would be happy to see these members continuing on the Heritage Advisory Committee and contributing to the committee and secondly to thank outgoing member Gary you have to help me with this pronunciation generator for his contribution to the greater Shepherd and heritage advisory committee and I 've seen Gary on the committee and he is always you know here I made wonderful contributions and very so it 's it 's sad to see that a very active member of the community committee is leaving but I 'm very glad to see that all the contribution that she has made so we really want to thank Gary for all the contributions 13 Thank You counsel counsel summer it 's all been said thank you again for wishing to speak against this motion now councillor Abdullah thanks thank you all the favorite motion against motion carried we 'll continue on counselors I 've just sympathy how to check on counselor tip and Eddie will just pause for 10 seconds until counsel 780th the CMC seat or good counselor me right it 's okay I saw the CV out of the CEO Dave you know I 'm ten point three counselors the adoption of addendum to the urban design framework Shepherd of North and South business areas July 2017 any counsel wishing to move a motion obviously I believe the recommendation printed on page forty seventh of the agenda Thank You councillor hazel in to have a seconder please council Patterson councillor hazel Minh and I just very very briefly mr. mica this is essentially an administrative process in the preparation of a planning scheme amendment it 's a month ago council resolved to adopt the urban design framework for seven of north and south business areas and now as a process to moving forward to incorporating the planning scheme there 's a planning team amendment it becomes another public process and it 's people making submissions comment contributions so no doubt this will be a fairly robust sort of a process with a lot of interest a lot of submissions given what 's going on in both the North and the South good thank you councillor Patterson now I think council Hosemann did a very good job of summarizing that but I will say that I think it 's very all in the case of this whole our adoption of this that there 's lots to be what 's to happen in the future as that one and give any councillor wishing to speak against this motion the other councillor we seem to speak in support of the motion councillor hazily maybe the time for debate is going to come in the future all in favor of motion counsels against motion carried item 11 councilors tabled motions we have none to report item 12 reports from council delegates to other bodies nil item 13 report from the special committee to advisory committees Neel received any notice of motion amendment or rescissions item 14 Neel received only 15 documents for

interaction and briefing program be received over second answer settle answer Jose Thank You mr. Merritt speaks for itself thank you rather than rushed it speaks for itself is it a mess Thank You Adam here its counsel Sutton if you liked it make sure itself very good any counsel we can just speak against this motion and you have a counselor wishing to speak for the motion Council summer I just don 't want to lose the opportunity to say how diverse our roles actually are admittedly the mayor has probably attended most of these but community interaction is so diverse and so vast and we have these opportunities to see pockets of the community that we wouldn 't normally be exposed to and the check I guess is trying to enable and encourage people from the community to come to some of these events with us I mean we 've had the Equality Roadshow inclusion planning we had the launch of refugee week and the women 's chartered by advisory Alliance was just incredible we 've launched an urban forest strategy small town catch ups things are just going gangbusters I 'm really looking forward to seeing the sporting Hall of Fame coming up in the future and these are all just preliminary things for future future work yes okay councillor any other councils wishing to speak against this motion for the motion Council Patterson I think sometimes we underestimate how important this is and I 'll give you one small example here several the council 's went to an urban education activity center and had lunch over there there 's a group that put on a six dollar lunch which we all forgot to pay which mayor I you alike and you know just something I we were discussing in the library with librarian how it goes and she just brought up a simple point to cancer given Eddie about know disabled parking at the front and cancer Tiffany 's address that and that 's what this is about in a lot of ways it 's just getting out and meeting people in their location so we can have a so I appreciate it comes up all the time and it explains itself I think sometimes we just can 't forget how important it is no it 's about grassroots engagement and that 's what what if I said mister me but I just paraphrase your comments councillor Patterson that being said any other council wish to speak against no for know back to you counselor is very thank you mister man look at one other one that we did attend was a merit no men shared monthly barbecue and that was very interesting and informative as well because it reflected and showed us how much work they actually did good thank you all in favor of the motion against motion carried senders of counselors counsel I 'm 17.1 I think on page silver alley 365 seventies of counsel guest and Eddie castle wishing to move a motion in regard to that counselor given if he what motion would that be for divinity I 'm sorry it was me I like to move that the council note the record of Assemblies of counselors on page epigraphy 5565 it could thank Giovannetti which you have to consider just a straightforward requirement mr. mayor indicating the number of files we 've met as a council with senior directors in the CEO so it 's just a statutory requirement that we record these meetings but Thank You counsel sutton any comment no any council wishing to speak against this motion any other council would you speak for the motion councillor hazel and if it 's me I 'm just referring to the counter but one of the assemblies here the briefing session of the 20th of June the listing of councilors present doesn 't match up with the there 's been an error in there in fact I think I was actually present on this day and declared a conflict of interest in this matter and it 's not recorded in the consumers unless I 've got the date wrong though very much dad what page is that on counselor hides 60 oh yes matter number one yes we

    "text": "okay my name is Peter Harry at CEO of great shipping City Council welcome to the big park like precinct beautiful area here in Shepparton and a beautiful day for a very exciting announcement and welcome to our committee of the 2030 Greater Victoria Commonwealth Games speed committee and welcome to media and welcome to everyone else who has come down to hear about this announcement I start by introducing our mayor Councillor Vinny Adam who 's going to say a few words welcome Vinnie thank you so much before we begin today 's proceedings we the greater Sheppard in City Council acknowledge the traditional owners of the land which now comprises greater Sheppard and we pay respect to their tribal elders we celebrate the containment culture and we acknowledge the memory of their ancestors welcome to thank you for taking the time this morning to pose is truly truly really exciting announcement it is with extreme enthusiasm I announce a greater Sheppard in City Council is leading the way for Greater Victoria to bid the host to bid to host to 2030 Commonwealth Games what this means is that are saying that we have the capacity to host the first-ever regionally based Commonwealth Games event what we are unveiling today is a first of a kind vision and could very well form the blueprint for future major sporting events giving the cost required and infrastructure needed to hold such global competitions such as the Commonwealth Games if Durban being stripped of the rights to stage a 2022 Commonwealth Games over financial concerns alternative models needed to be explored and we believe we have the answer why not look at a regional approach to host the likes of the Commonwealth Games regionally there is a capacity to do so with potentially less investment required to deliver on these games existing infrastructure can be refurbished rather than new infrastructure needing to be built and maintained in a single city we have already seen that England is looking to take over 2022 as the how country and with that multiple cities will host these events and remember the Gold Coast next year is also a regional event as well the momentum for change is clearly there this also means economic benefits are Commonwealth Games Association and will meet with them very shortly they 've recognised the enthusiastic nature of our proposal and naturally though unable to endorse our concept as other Australian cities may also consider bidding at this stage the association indicated that 2026 bidding processes hasn 't commenced as yet Melbourne has become it and so important it now accounts for more than 80% of Victoria 's economic growth with the rest of the state contributing contributing very little in net terms Victoria needs to become more decentralized and here 's a great way to start we 're proposing to the Commonwealth Games be hosted we 're up to 11 regional cities and towns in Victoria including greater Sheppard of course Geelong Ballarat Bendigo Wodonga tur algún Warrnambool and Port Campbell muderer with Dan Gurney Gambian Yarrawonga well we have some idea of the capability of these regional areas the sports nominated presently are just our suggestions the mayors and CEOs of the nominated municipalities have been invited to participate in a workshop on the 28th of April to table any and all ideas of how this concept could work successful that the municipalities work in collaboratively and we look forward to working with our colleagues on this project as this is a whole new way in which to host the games the feasibility of a greater Victorian games needs to be determined prior to a formal bit that needs to be made in six years time we have therefore convened a task force or working group if you like of the highest caliber never before has such a group of oppressive influential people being brought together for a project of this magnitude a project that has a potential to change how international and national events are held in the future the task force is charged with undertaking some preliminary work to initially determine the viability of a regional Victoria Games this model will obviously need to be assessed prior to a fall beat being undertaken I 'm delighted to say that we have many members of our task force here today to be part of our announcement I would also like to welcome to greater shipping today task force chair on my left here mr. Adam carefully and deputy mention today are two very important people for our region we 're extremely honored to have Janine and her Willys Pratt present as we know that shepherding is a place dear to their hearts welcome to you both and thank you for you Lord your continued work and can work that you 'll continue to do for the greater people agenda thank you but also like the fact all our panel members and members of the media being here today to be part of this thrilling announcement with that I 'd like to hand back now to our CEO Peter carrier to continue with proceedings thank you Peter thanks Denny what a great idea great concept spread the interest spread the benefit as you can see we 've already got some fantastic facilities here in Shepparton we 've got the weather to turn it on and if we can build on that that 'll be fantastic now I 'd like to introduce the chair of the committee to speak next and that is mr. Adam carefully please welcome Adam [Applause] firstly I 'd like to thank the man and the concept and then secondly to ask for our involvement and and as mayor said it 's quite an esteemed bunch of colleagues I exclude myself from that but when I look down the table here and look in front there 's some extraordinary experience across a range of sectors so we 've certainly are well-placed to deliver on a plan that would actually get these games you know here and from across regional Victoria about twenty thirty on that we we have this task force established primarily and initially our objective really is is clear and those the six and government funding some corporate support on two so we can initially get a real feasibility study up and going that 's gonna be the primary objective of the task force we will have our first meeting just after the close of this press conference and then we 'll talk about exactly what we need and how we 're going to get it but make no mistake we 're all very serious about this we 're all committed to it and the reason we are is because we actually believe in and for the regional Victoria particularly and we also think it 's a great thing for the people and the people who will support this are the ones who will benefit my so we were absolutely committed to delivering this for Victoria and for the people of Victoria I guess from here we 're gonna have probably series of questions I guess after this I guess I 'll start and then we 'll issue out some of those answers to the appropriate member of the task force but as I said we 're really committed to getting a real feasibility study up and running to ensure that we can actually deliver this project for 2030 very good thanks Adam and thanks for bringing your skill and knowledge to the committee and thanks to all the other committee members for the diversity that it brings and I 've got no doubt with the committee and the support of the regional centres that this is going to happen and it 's going to happen in the well and be done better than you 've ever seen before and I now introduce our to say a few words see that sorry I had to get out of the Sun everyone I think it 's great to be having a place in the Sun but not not in Sheppard and on a day like today this is truly a really visionary project that has has come forward and you can see the uptake that has occurred so quickly in the media and in the community it 's an opportunity for regional Victoria and regional Victorian needs opportunities like this don 't want to say anything negative but this is really an opportunity to to develop so many of our regions in so many ways there are many things that our cities need in terms of government investment and an opportunity such as this gives a really strong reason to to push forward that development and we know there are so many reasons in our community to develop sport recreation facilities in our regions and I think it 's visionary as I 've said and I congratulate everyone who 's done so much work to progress this to this point and great to see such competent people who will be able to take this forward and certainly I think from my point of view looking forward to supporting it as best I can so thank you thanks Suzanna now well that leaves us with the questions please there must be questions of the committee and they 're quite willing to answer any I might kick it off if you 're still sort of thinking of your questions so first question would be in relation to a feasibility study when do we think that might be ready to present to wherever we 've got to present the feasibility study right first question look we 're going to work on a on a fairly tight timeline we 're looking to deliver a preliminary preliminary report in July so that mean there 's a lot of work to do I think part of this feasibility study obviously includes working with the other regions that were engaging so there 's 11 other census or ten other centers which will be work with the CEOs and the mayors and I think that 's going to happen in the next couple late April so that 's gonna be the first round and then of course we 'll work through there but that 's going to be Janet it 's right in your sweet spot I think working with local government local councils this question here I might bring the mic friend now like Oh from Triple M just a query have you are you aware of any other bids no at this stage it 's it 's and this is an early an early stage of puzzle so but it will be open to other bids there are actually other areas in Australia that may choose to be I think what we 're doing here is actually getting in front of it make a compelling case for it and hopefully then scare off anyone else who may think they may compete for this because our proposition will be so good and so exciting very good now there 's a Commonwealth Games happening in Australia up to party on the track does the committee believe that we can learn something from that experience that we can bring to this speed I think southeast the Queensland so and which is essentially not a major city right so I think that 's that 's the first point the fact that they 've been able to recommit some of their facilities already not just into other sporting facilities but also into some of the arts I know I think it 's a Gymnastics arena we 're talking about today it 's going to become a sound studio and a movie production area so these are the sorts of outside-the-box thinking that we need to consider and really need to look to as we prepare for our how games get expressions over here thanks JD flamin when use I just want to note shepherding is pretty well-equipped to host with a new precinct and everything that 's going on what about the other regions the other ten regions how well-equipped are they going to be to handle that kind of yeah so a lot of the preliminary work that 's been done today was done and while the regions were selected really and being part of this collaboration is because of the infrastructure they already have to actually improve some of their facilities so just like shepherding there 's been some government money established you know I think many goes but a Paul Terrell burns actually got some money for different things so what we 'd be looking to do is to talk with them look at what they 're doing already and then look to say okay how can we over the years expand the plans what you 've got whether it 's room for temporary seating or can we repurpose it now into a slightly bigger thing so these are the sorts of things we 're going to do but the regions that were chosen were quite specifically chosen because they have some good infrastructure in place or only got funding for infrastructure to come okay with questions here councillor Edison thank you my question is basically I know it 's a very hard one timelines when do you think of final decisions we made and they 're happy several timelines and I realized probably that 's the first job today they 've got an indication when the final decision will be made thank actually the date for the final decision however there are many decisions in that time on that need to happen between now and then and obviously the immediate work as I said earlier the task force is to actually get a proper feasibility up and going so I think looking lowering our eyes a little and looking at that as an immediate purpose is where we really need to focus and then we 'll absolutely build out from there a lot of this is going to take some some infrastructural you know especially the or logistics aspects so we want to get to a point where we 're really well developed rather quickly so some of these bigger decisions can be night okay quite Johnson from seven years do you have any idea how much this is going to cost first question secondly how do you get cross the logistical nightmare of getting athlete 's between all the sounds I mean that 's a very good question so firstly on the costs we haven 't actually got to a costs yet I think that 's going to be part of think when we 're looking at costs we 're looking to minimize and that 's why we think this approach is one that suits that purpose because we 're going to places that already have the infrastructure in place or where it 's looking to be developed I think the costs that come from security or one that we need to look at because that seems to be the one that is quite big these days for holding these events and so I think that 's going to be key focus of this task force the other one is the logistics and I think if we can solve some of these these matters these are solving matters that aren 't just for athletes these are solving matters that will help people move in and out of the regions for forever it might help solve some of the social challenges that we face in in housing and etc so if we solve them once for this I think we 're going to be solving them for a long time to come maybe one for John and Nick it 's been a areas in large centers how do you think the athletes are going to enjoy coming to a regional center yeah I 've actually played an air-filled game at the Shepherd and ogle and that 's actually part of the regional challenge so it 's a facility that 's at that a great standard so as Adam said it will be going to regional centers like Shepherd on Lightner Gambia which has the Writing Center there that 's held the Victorian championships and national championships so that that 's that 's a fantastic start the the second thing is that the Commonwealth Games and the Olympic Games need some disruption because a lot of money is going into it and it 's probably not getting the commercial returns that cities cities one this spreads the risks amongst 11 regional centres it also spreads the benefits so it will require the state government the federal government to have some vision to say okay we want to provide our regional census particularly regional Victoria and build some infrastructure not only leaving a legacy for sport but also leaving a legacy for those regional the people of the regional centers embracing it and getting on board and once the fans are on board once the athletes are on board you get the sponsors you get the broadcast rights you get people buying tickets so it 's a the win-win for the regional Victorian and for Victoria as a whole don 't_''_1037.959 did you want to add something that I 'm speaking as a former athlete we we visit these regional areas if it 's not through training throughout the year if it 's not through small competitions developing before a big championship so there 's absolutely no reason why with the correct planning you can 't set aside an opportunity for a big sporting event like the Commonwealth Games and I was saying earlier today there 's an event that 's held for the last hundred years in France called the Tour de France only a small event and it 's a it basically showcases a lot of regional areas through France and then it has impact not only whilst II of any Zomba for for long time after the event runs through the survive to exist so I think that 's it 's grateful it 's rare to be in the forefront of that because the the financial model that is that is the Commonwealth Games is clearly struggling we 're seeing also in the Olympic model is is struggling so put Australia to be in the forefront of that globally I think it 's quite exciting there 's a bike rider I can relate to very late nights watching Tour de France and it 's a great promotional opportunities no doubt about that everyone from channel 9 have you had a rough look at some of the other infrastructure upgrades that you 'd need to do to get people there ah no the Shepherd and rail line is sort of in dire straits those aubrey warner ball just that i think honestly we 're looking at this those are the sorts of things that we 'd love to help make the economic case for i think people have been looking at these for different reasons over a long period of time they 're embedded lean even an upgrade if an event like these things done and I think that 's fantastic and I think that 's great it 's a long way to achieving our goals but then probably one other thing to add though we talked about before was often big cities so like Melbourne or Sydney forget things like transport and rail and housing we have it so for country towns and regional cities something like this you know is transformational I think when we think about the plan of how we do this those sorts of things are equally if not more important than the sport itself because of what it will mean for these towns so I think when we 're reviewing that sort of stuff that 's that 's gonna be number one priority where will the opening ceremony happen and will you get Nicky Webster we 're gonna hang you come down from the sky this time she 's older so we 're gonna go bigger with Nikki this is going to be pretty hotly contested I think look there 's a stadium already that he 's big enough I think for this in regional Victoria I think we 'd love to have one here as well and I think part of our planning ultimately would be to try and establish an arena in Shevlin that supports this greater area they could actually hold an opening ceremony in closing as well so I think when we 've got something that 's available and then we 've got an ambition I think our ambition would be here but we also have a fallback position of you know area as well I don 't know if anyone else got any comments on them tell you that I 'll be advocating a court to be shepherded and that we get the infrastructure spend happening here because I mean we know that Bendigo Ballarat Geelong have got some fabulous facilities already they 've got 20 trains a day going each way we 've got four going each way so we 'll be really looking forward to those sort of economic benefits that might flow from a project like this and we 'll certainly be on that page all the time Dana from ABC a question for John you mentioned that athletes have all come together and stayed together how do you think this will compare and what will be lost by not having the athletes staying in the one precinct together I think that will be obviously looked at one at least and really developed the finer minutiae of how this can all work but speaking as Nathu personally when you come to a championship see that 'll win so your main focus is going and you go you 'll go to the Mars to win so but creating an environment which is most important to the games is meant to showcase the happiness of the involvement of the athletes is something which is at the forefront I know my mind nothing about committees mind and I think we have to be progressive we have to change our view of how these championships are being run so what we are used to seeing things as a village and that 's how we 've seen a championship some years before but this is a great opportunity for these athletes to actually embrace the regional areas that they are and become part globally to create awareness and attention for out there these are competing and the Commonwealth Games are only our domestic athletes as well and also the viewers that are taking watching and taking part but I also add to that but one of the things that one of the long-term benefits of this speed is what it will mean to tourism for country Victoria because when people come to the regions earlier than the 2030 games you 'll get athletes coming here to see what the the tracks are like to see what the climates like and then in a long term hopefully the athletes and their friends and their family will come back over many many decades to see where they competed and to come back here so what we 're doing is actually exposing regional Victoria to the world that 's really exciting the fundamental aspect of this whole proposal is about bringing the games to the people not the people to the games that 's happened traditionally so just to reiterate John 's comments can you imagine the youth of rural towns and regional sees having world-class access to that the inspiration that will provide to future generations of athletes is something that should also be considered in this big if you have any what numbers have you crunched in terms of me although in terms of the economic benefit and the jobs that will be created both in the building of new facilities and the tourism during the event as I sort of said earlier there 's gonna be the job of the task force really to develop those numbers at this stage it 's bit early to actually put some numbers down as I said we 're going in with a cost focus and a value focus so I think that 's where we 're starting and that 's what part of these plan is already built but look we will be putting down a plan and delivering some initial thoughts in a couple of months time so it 's a bit too early to be speaking actual hard numbers at this point Locker Triple M again just a quick one I just thought him to go follow-up to the other question what about a you needs a mascot I think maybe we 'll open suggestions on that one maybe we can hold a competition I think we 've had a few a few a few events proposed as well I think I heard this morning that maybe milking cows or something might make an event at the Commonwealth Games this time around too so I 'm sure gonna get some more suggestions about that all right might finish off a very question of each it 's sure this talk to us about the marketing opportunity that this provides to regional Victoria particularly greater shipping you know thanks better I think for most for us was some I 've worked with the Shepherd and team on the great things happen here campaign for about six months now with with pro as well and we 've been part of the growth of this story and that is really for us how this whole concept came about it was about delivering on a brand ideal of what people define as great I think we I I did not realize sorry man how many events are held in categories in all demographics and not only in Shepparton across Chalong Bendigo Ballarat Nogami country towns that are bidding for international events and successfully holding them one of them being the BMX World Cup which shipping and is currently bidding for and of course is a Commonwealth Games sport so I think for us for many of us from Melbourne we have got to learn how significant and impact this will be and to John 's point adding using the Tour de France example and what we 've seen even in the last couple of days were the US Mexico and Canada are joining together for the World Cup in is this ability to be able to showcase entire regions to people they just would never see it before so I think it 's hard to yeah and I think it 's hard to UM to measure that at this point of time but I think this is going to be the test case that will be the blueprint moving forward I just wanted to add Eloise Pratt chair of the foundation I just want to add whether this goes a bright light on shepherding and rural areas and for that we should all give thanks rural Victoria as well as other regional areas around Australia are very depressed people are very anxious and if we can offer them hope and if we can offer them a level of inspiration then we will have achieved something really fabulous because that 's all you want with people we help a lot with the Pratt Foundation and regional areas with kids that have psychotic illnesses and a lot of mental health problems and it 's just so intrinsic community and sport go hand in hand and I just think that you know if we can generate a community of people together then we 've done a great thing thanks Alice that 's a good coca finish on it is an inspiration and that 's part of what this is all about inspiring people to achieve great things committees got a big task but they 're inspired to go and achieve it and we can all pull behind them and make it happen it will happen so would you join me one last time and thank this fantastic committee [Applause] _"

minutes to have a council wishing to move the recommendation as a motion now counselor I was very you were the last meeting up presume yes very good drove a second please mr. councillor Jeff and Eddie councillor our vote you wish to speak to the mayor and council achieve and Eddie any councillor we can speak against ocean for all you favor against motion carried now councillors item 6.1 we have a recommendation on page two recommendation is that the council adopt the revised curbside landfill waste recycling and organics collection policy ninety one point pol one dover council wishing to move that to councillor abdullah to have a seconder please councillor summer else abdullah do we should speak to the motion that was adopted on october in october 2015 had limitations and it was not comprehensive in particular it lacked the incentive for residents to be vigilant about reducing contamination from the recycling and organics organics waste prior to beam collection now this policy is aligned with a golden valley waste and resource recovery plan as well and rescue end resource recovery vice policy addresses some issues and questions regarding organic and food waste collection council aims to achieve it is my understanding the council aims to achieve three-person organics contamination rate this is generally achieved within three to five years of service rollout however our neighboring council some of them have achieved started within two years so some hard work needs to be done their education of course plays an important role in meeting these targets so the revised policy is outlining some section sanctions example service termination for regular offenders such sanctions have seen successful results in neighboring councils such as more Ishod Wair the repeat offenders collection services terminated now I just want to be ready but I want to state that I would want council to be very careful about this and make sure that the wherever there is a case of repeat repeat repeat offenders and the coming termination there is a follow-up action as well because we do not want these residents to keep to start dumping somewhere else in undesignated areas so it 's important for council to follow up also sensitive to the needs of elderly residents who might need help in collection of their bins from the side instead of curbside this service is however available on request only and on a case-to-case basis overall I 'm very satisfied with the revised policy Thank You Council abdula Council summer a lot of information was given there by counsel of doula so that 's terrific I 'll keep my fairly short first of all I 'd like to thank the public for their cooperation in implementing a new beam service which was the organic bin it was a little divisive at the start but we have managed to reduce quite a few quite a lot of tonnage from landfill and take it to western composting so that the food can be used over again as a fertilizer it 's unfortunate that we do have to tighten this policy but because some people are doing the wrong thing we do actually have to start from the bottom up and make sure that we 're addressing and enforcing contamination rates risk management does state that it 's an upstream level of the food waste are responsible for managing that risk which is a little bit unrealistic because they can 't sort through every single bin so they are a private enterprise and we should be supporting them because Western composting which is the name of our provider is a best practice facility it 's the envy of all of Victoria we 're very lucky to have that here and we should take enormous pride it was innovative when it was first developed and we want to support them any way possible just a small amount of contamination can really ruin a truckload of organics and yeah just because a couple of people are doing the wrong thing we all need to police that further Thank You counselor summer any counselor wishing to speak against this motion and the other counsel wish to speak for the motion that said counselor Abdulla any closing comments all in favor of the motion against motion carried from six point to part road closure and sale of rainway abutting buyers street these are recommendation counsels on page six do I have a counselor wishing to move six thank you seconder please I 'll second it

explain why every week councilor hazel in item four is it if but I don 't know but at the very last paragraph yes professor it 's as if no subject if no submissions are received yes and the reason I 'm saying it should be objections we make it a submission that 's actually in favor you want the word submissions if the mood was there remember he 's happy after objections to be replaced the word objections you happy with that counselor Aras very alertly make sure the motion will read as printed on page six with the word submissions removed replaced by the word objection that being said you 're seconding the motion Council Hazleton counselor is very thanks mr. mayor this is another example where we occasionally get a section of road which is no longer of use but it I just want to formalize it and this is a procedure whereby we put it out to public notice if executive officer mr. Harriet is authorized to undertake the various procedures that go with it other than that the portion of laneways at the end of the laneway which abuts to businesses at account and is used for one of those businesses for the storage of materials it 's fairly straightforward Thank You counselor counselor hazel Minh talk to me counselor would any counsel wishing to speak against this motion counselors wishing to speak before the motion counselor is very any closing comments I think thank you all in favor of the motion against motion carried item 6.3 counselors on page 9 of our agendas we have a recommendation that the council adopt the road management plan version 5 to have a counselor wishing to move this recommendation as a motion counselor Patterson to have a second to please counselor summer counselor Patterson this is required under the Local Government Act for us three incoming counsel must review this policy and that 's what we 've done was that the means it 's really good our roads are perfect we all do before we put down a consultation so yeah so I propose we we pass it and move on with our we did Road words you cancel Patterson Council summer I just reiterate we didn 't get any submissions for this which was I believe a little bit unusual considering roads are something that people do love to complain about there 's an opportunity to have input and we got nothing so we could only fix as much as we know about and obviously the way that we 're doing things yeah the regime must be working so happy to adopt good thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this motion and he come in for the motion councillor Abdullah you what I can see the road management plan was updated to number one clarify defect descriptions of roads and also the measurements and parameters our specifications that now have reduced in measurement and a third aspect that stood out was the response time which so the response times have mainly been reduced for example guide for this making them them substantially they think you can subdue any council wishing to speak against for that being said councillor Patterson any closing comments go all in favor of the motion against motion carried h13 councils item 6.4 contract number one seven six zero provision of drainage maintenance services recommendation as printed and I shall read it for the benefit of our live streaming viewers that the council accept the tenders submitted by Cox free for contract number one seven six zero supply provision of drainage maintenance services for the schedule of rates

continue to be exempt from the requirement to complete interest returns in exercise of power granted to counsel under Section 81 CA the Local Government Act it 's great mr. mayor that we have a very effective group of section 86 committees people who are prepared to volunteer their time to assist their local community in the various areas at the section 8 basics committees operate or in section 81 and I think that they all to be commended for a fantastic job you counselor Patterson I long and hard we 've talked about the important role Volunteers pioneer Communion this is just another example you any counselor wishing to speak against this motion counsels wishing to speak for the motion as a given anything any closing comments last April thank you all in favor against motion have a council we need to move that recommend I 'll move I 'll move the recommendation that council adopt the revised shippin Art Museum collection development policy zero two point zero one thank you a seconder please Castle summer councillor hazel Minh thank me as the report indicates this development policy adopted in 2011 was last reviewed in October of 2013 so it was very appropriate it is to be reviewed on a regular basis and the minor changes that have been made to the document were circulated to the same Advisory Committee before their most recent meeting and it 's important that the development policy is maintained and is up to date because it provides the parameters and provides advice to the same Advisory Committee so that they can make informed decisions around the collection in terms of acquisitions and further development of the of the collection good thank you counselor counselor summer oh no that 's been said good any council wishing to speak against this motion motion as i hazeled back to you all good all in favor councillors against motion carried next item is item community plan very important motion for that plan review for 2017 pelvic council we should move that recommendation is motion counsel abdullah dover seconder please councillors very tag team over there else 'll Abdullah Al Abdullah you wish to speak to the motion that the Council endorsed updated Madison Community Plan 2017 and number to acknowledge the valuable contribution Madison residents have made to the update of their community plans now this plan was originally developed in depth 2011 I would like to highlight that the community 's involvement and engagement in keeping this plan current is admirable the plan identifies actions for 2017 such as development of a gym safe crossing points up to post office and a playground at recreation reserve so it would be great to see implementation of some of these are and if identified actions for for coming years what is required is the continued level of engagement and interest in achieving these plans through counsel grants or other funding arrangements sometimes the initial enthusiasm and interest fades away over a period of time when it comes to such community plans however much is sense plan so it is good Thank You counsel councillor is very Thank You mr. mayor yes look I remember when the lady who came and spoke to us jenny was the first name and I apologize he 's looking to get a second name she came and spoke to us about the Murchison community plan she identified and detailed some strategic directions was indicated to us that she was very enthused yes together the community was in relation to these rail trail and was my understanding that campus we had some money towards that and she expressed the view that that actually ideally should start from noches and East which I didn 't think was a bad idea she also lamented the loss of the Murchison tomato fest as it didn 't get off the ground and many people in her view expressed a sense of disappointment down and merchants in regards to that and conversely she spoke a great source of local pride in relation to Dacians mill in relation to how popular that was she talked about how on her wish list they would love to have a in a sad state of repair she further indicated that she was very happy with the fact that there 's 260 metres of new footpath in the Murchison area as well and all in all I found at a very informative and educated the briefing good Thank You councillor Aras very councils wishing to speak against this motion for the motion councillor Giovannetti mr. mee I can fully endorse the comments made by councillors AB dildora Nora 's very Murchison is very proactive community are obviously identified by the speaker that came and met with us a few weeks ago I think it 's very opportune that we would just recently passed the contract for the drainage matrix because that 's one of the issues that has been brought up to be on several occasions in from residents in the Murchison area I fully concur the the Football Netball Club rooms in the significant work and I 'd like to see council support that community in their endeavors to improve those facilities thank you Thank You councillor jebin Eddy you can also wish to speak against the motion for council this council we do these community plans with an enormous amount of engagement with the community we get barbecues for consultation we send out surveys we make sure we 've tried to consult with as many people as possible in order to empower the residents to forge their own paths each small town in Greater Shepperton is quite unique and this is a way for their identities to be solidified again in their own way it 's been very successful we have a number of these and it 's very bottom up so most of the time you see governments and they 're telling communities what to do this is flipped it on its head it 's completely opposite and the communities are telling us so we value our small towns and that is one example of how we do it Thank You councillor Sam any council wishing to speak against for councillor Patterson yes this is virtuous was one of the first one or two towns to have their community playing during cleaning up and running at just it seems like yesterday it is work so well especially emergency a lot of smaller towns have people akin to dominate you don 't necessarily hear what the actual town wants and I think this summarizes it perfectly when you read out part of this plan that says the movement community plan steering committee guide of the consultation progress process from the beginning to the end so they did themselves and one of their key priorities how can we hear from every voice in Murchison and that is a secret to community plans I 've done it extremely well I 've come up with a list of what they want not what a couple of people thought Murchison should have and it 's worked perfectly down there and I graduate them for all working together and I think it is it has been used probably a couple of times before but how can we hear every voice emerges and he 's a terrific concept to have to find out what the actual town wants not what we tell them I should very good Thank You councillor Patterson and you have a council wishing to speak against the motion for the motion against motion carry our councillors item seven point no 8.1 councillors how could I miss this one 2017 2018 budget a very important document councils that 's printed on numerous pages saying at page 29 of our agendas and concluding on page 32 councillors we do have a council wishing to move the budget is printed on those pages as councillor Giovannetti you 'll have a seconder please as a Patterson a councillor Giovannetti you should speak to this very important motion Thank You mr. mayor aye I won 't read out the three pages of the recommendation if I because I 'm sure the gallery and those watching it at home tonight have copies of the agenda in front of them this has been a significantly a significant exercise by our staff to implement this year 's budget we 've managed to stay within the 2% rate capping that government has forced upon us and when you consider that we have a budget in excess of 73 million dollars but no mean feat considering the number of people we employ as well as the number of services we provide that were received and a number of those submissions that we heard a couple of weeks ago have now been included with this budget which we 're happy to endorse those those applications and I just want to congratulate all those who did submit their their thoughts on the budget to us good Thank You councillor Giovannetti councillor Patterson I just like to speak quickly on a couple of the key points as far as I 'm concerned one is the borrowing six million dollars is playing here for hydro landfill three borrowings are never nice this is a intergenerational project which we spread over many many years of this council 's life to come so I fully endorse the loan for that six million dollars a lot of money that we have to have that facility available for us and that will that will cover council 's waste for many many years to come so it 's very important the renewals which is probably every councillors pet so out of a budget because we have to spend money on things this year there 's 39 point three eight million of that will be on renewables they 're renewables on a sexy thing as far as the council goes because base they go on things we 've already got to replace them and to repair them and have them up and running it 's very easy not to concentrate on renewals and let our roads slip back and we have a responsibility as councillors to make sure that doesn 't happen and why would also like to see 39 point three million dollars built on you infrastructure etc which our ratepayers can see and think it 's terrific we have the responsibility to make sure that that doesn 't we continue to keep what we have in good condition so there 's seven point nine five billion on new works which is not a lot of money out of our total budget but we great to get some of those projects up and yet fully endorse the whole budget Thank You council Patterson any council wishing to speak against this motion and you counsel wishing to speak for the motion counselor summer first uh yeah I think it 's a is the challenge of rate capping and we and the grant indexation that we 've had previously and still managed to get a surplus so that 's terrific and we 've done that we 've had a million dollar decrease in capital works and but pleasingly we 've also decreased our fees and charges in the waste department which is more in line with rate capping even though the waste department wasn 't necessarily under that umbrella and also pleasingly we have a million dollars set aside for stage two of the CBD redevelopment which is the mod Street Plaza and bus stop that stage two has actually been broken up into two spaces so the plaza and bus stop will come first and then we 'll work on the road and there 's also things in there for the solar tender which could really put us on the map of renewable energy it 's impossible to agree with everything in the budget and I wouldn 't be true to myself if I said I did it 's a very large document but councillors have worked really hard to negotiate talked about the municipal charge and not being incredibly happy with the purpose of the municipal charge here on page 31 4.1 it does say the purpose of the municipal charge is to cover some of the administrative costs of council and I do understand that that is the definition under the Act but I find that that 's misleading because we don 't actually collect any extra revenue the intention is to redistribute that money so 262 dollars is taken from every ratable property in the municipality and then it 's staggered down from the top from people who pay the most so that we have a more even median so that the people at the top are actually paying less because the people everywhere are contributing to their rates the other thing I 'm not completely comfortable with but I understand there is a consensus and they have complete faith that this is going to work but that 's the Sam line-item we still don 't have the philanthropy money that we had in our plan we are we going to begin building Sam without the philanthropy money the horse and it 's risky because we don 't know if the beginning of the build is going to create enough confidence for people to donate but but there is a consensus that that will be the case and once we begin the money will flow with it so other than those things um yes I 'm happy to endorse the budget Thank You councillor Sommer any councillor wishing to speak against any other councillors we should speak for councillor Sutton actually thank the staff for their hard work in putting this budget together I think it 's been a good budget and it 's been a positive time with the council and discussion around what we 're putting into it and also like to thank those who took time to put in their submissions thank you Thank You council Sutton any other council we should just be qug inst the motion or the motion Council Abdulla so yeah thanks to the council staff for their professionalism and in all the structured processes and and the answering of the queries that happen throughout the process then the second thing thanks for all the community members who provided their feedback and submissions were made so I also want to note that the so that some changes were incorporated into the budget post this consultation process so obviously you know changes in cooperated shows that community 's involvement is very much there and also that this council is listening because some amendments were made as you can see on the page on page 121 it just highlights some of the changes that were done after the consultation process so we have now 28 contribution to Shepperton FoodShare we have got additional 20k for shape show me and 10k towards the torah ' museum extension detailed design stage has been allocated so I think that 's a wonderful outcome thank you Thank You councillor abdullah any other councils we should just speak for the motion council Hazen not look I would be very very brief I think other councils have talked about the constraints imposed by the state government of the 2% increase in in revenue which flows on from 2.5 percent last year so doesn 't take time to work out years is going to get tougher and tougher at this stage with the mooted proposal to annual valuations what that 's going to impact in terms of our revenues is something that we 'll have to have to work through into the future and of course the the budget itself has got a number of drivers to it and we 'll talk about well in in a few moment which is is the rating strategy which is another item in here it 's rather interesting that we 've got a number of submissions in respect to the budget but in the respect of the rating strategy which was released for public comment at the same time no submissions were received yet everybody 's got a view about writing and differentials and all of that no one took the opportunity to to inform the process and hopefully that 's not a circumstance that will will continue into the future that we would like to see a lot of robust debate about how our rated trilogy is applied also comment was made in relation to the the borrowings for for cosgrove I a major infrastructure project it 's got an income stream capacity to to both service and repay that debt and that 's the type of borrowing that I think is beneficial to the council 's business good Thank You councillor hazel the council 's been to speak for or against the motion Council okay yes I 'm I think canceled or touched on it there 's new counselors this is a very very in-depth process particular cross new ones and I think you know with the support that has been given to us like to think it 's been pointed out CEO Peter Harriet obviously the support staff the offices it 's been a very complex interesting process for me I 'm sure I speak on behalf of all counselors this is the community 's budget we want to do what 's best for them absolutely 100% at the time so I think a lot of the discussion that has happened you know it hasn 't just been a quick fix it 's been a long month of months process to and froing and really discussing you know the areas I 've really enjoyed it I found it such an eye-opening experience in my community and I think you know us counselors are so this is our job it 's what we here for you know to really spend the money wisely good Thank You councillor O 'Keefe any other council mission to speak to against well that 's good no one spoke it again so I will speak for the motion I just want to wrap this up I think every other council is pretty much said I intended to say mm-hmm but I 'll just had my own TV silent thing I won 't be silent I do like to offer my thanks to the CEO all the staff you 've contributed to the makeup of this budget it 's been quite hectic for three or four months now putting this together there 's been a lot of engaging with the community just being really great even as late as two or three days ago we 're still making minor adjustments to this budget as counselors it 's our responsibility to handle 120 billion dollars of expenditure so counselor summer alluded to it 's not perfect in everyone 's mind but nothing can be perfect but we think it 's responsible as councillor Patterson alluded to with the borrowings they are responsible borrowing are still under well under the state average in borrowing that 's why we need to keep it borrowings out for operational issues therefore project orientated expenditure which is really great so once again thanks to all the community for engaging and also really often way thanks to the staff and the CIO for putting together such a responsible and hopefully fruitful budget now of course not everyone got what they wanted this year so a lot of items have been identified and will certainly be on the minds of all councils and the organization next year for next year 's budget so congratulations to all and for we support yes mr. Harriet may I just add a few words for you main D look this a very big budget 120 million dollars plus 40 million dollars in capital so for a new council to come together over a very short period of time to so I say well done to this new council getting together and operating as a strong team and you know really attacking a serious task which is a large budget so new and old councillors coming together has a new team great effort where as everyone has indicated managed to deliver an operating surplus fully fund their renewals and borrow responsibly three key underlying financial factors that we should maintain through for many many years coming and that 's the significant a significant achievements with 2% rate capping and all the external environmental factors we have impacting on our budget so that 's a very good achievement we did receive a number of submissions and is pleasing to see that we 've accommodated most of them or the counselors have come together and you 've accommodated most of the submissions that have been placed before us so that should send a message that should encourage people to make submissions and to participate in our budget process because we have listened and we we do try if not totally meet the request in part made the request or provide a response track we may be able to accommodate those responses so that 's been pleasing as part of this budget as well and if I may just think staff the directors and all staff that put in an assisted with the budget this year thank you very much particularly the finance staff through Chris and Matt and magenta and various key financial people that pull this together thank you very much thank you mister Harriet counselors all in favor of the motion against motion carried 8.2 councillors item 8.2 on page 38 the contract number 1 7 8 0 provision of banking and bill payment services to our council wishing to move that councillor jib energy second leg councillor is very careful Giammetti yes mr. Merrill I can move the recommendation on page 38 the council accepted tend to submitted by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for contract number 1 7 8 0 provision of banking in dual payment services for the schedule of rates price estimate of 777 thousand two hundred and fifty three dollars and forty six cents worth 2 we authorized the chief executive officer to award the the optional extension periods of two by one year extensions subject to contract requirements and also authorized the chief executive officer to sign and seal contract documents mr. mayor although this tender is not the lowest using me counselor Jamil here to have a second day I think I 've got that yes we have continued your asuras very had second emotional scene um although this tender was not the lower standard that we received the Commonwealth Bank are for a far wider range of services than what the other tenders groans and provide which is something that moving forward as a progressive council I think that we need to series we look at one of the other points of interest is that we have a year and approved budget of one point two to three million dollars of this particular project the quote just sort of you tend to came in at seven hundred and seventy seven thousand dollars which is an approximate budget variance of about five hundred thousand dollars I think it 's an exceptionally good effort Thank You councillor and Giovannetti councillors very yes look thanks an efficiency minute measure to help us do business better with the community thank you councillors wishing to speak against the motion any other council wouldn 't speak for the motion isn 't me council Hazleton I 'm fully in support of the motion but I 've privately said in in the past that I highlighted the issue here that an environmental exemption was was obtained for this particular contract and that 's entirely appropriate in the circumstances given the type of services but I think it does probably prompt us a little bit to start looking at the environmental footprint of contractors that we deal with and I 'd like to see over time some policy development around that and looking at the the types of people that were doing business with and their impact on on the environment and whether that means that we start thinking about ethical purchasing and these sorts of things Thank You councillor councillors wishing to speak against the motion for the motion can i just the person yes following along council a salesman 's line of conversation I 've spoken about it regularly criteria price team 35% I believe it should be higher and I think it is now probably appropriate hope counsel Hazen was brought up his issue with it that we probably should have a look at that I just do not believe if you 're going to get a new car you know 35% of the pro-ice of it doesn 't lead behind us in any consideration but it should be higher than 35% Ethel Patterson any other counsel which to speak for for counseling for the motion just on the evaluation criteria conversation councils have enormous buying power this is a massive contract that goes possibly over five years and over well it was budgeted for over a million dollars so when we make these large purchases we do have a lot of power in that we can effect more broad change social social change and whether that means local content is considered which it is ten percent goes towards how much they contribute to our economy which flows down into the small businesses in the town and environmental content is just as important because we 've seen corporations the public see local government stepping up to their responsibility and being accountable when where their spending goes the public will be they 'll feel more empowered to do the same so it does make a difference price is not everything and I 'm more than happy to accept this recommendation Thank You council summer any other council wish to speak for or against I 'm councillor Giovannetti I think I wasn 't coming up mr. mayor I think we have all in favor against Carrie counselors item 8.3 May 2017 monthly financial report we have a motion on page 42 or a recommendation sorry you have a counsel wishing to move that recommendation as the motion arose very you can 't hide forever second to please me through you I invite mr. Tyson yes I thought to give us an overview if you would be so going yeah council tassel mr. Tyson sorry thanks mr. mayor I 'm not sure whether that 's a promotion um nor am i I 'll refer councillors to the attachment to the report in your agendas which starts on page 289 and talked currently higher than forecast at the end of May this is due largely to animal registration fees coming in earlier than we were initially planned and also a higher uptake of new registrations of animals combined with that there 's some operating grants that we 've received a month earlier than originally expected in that throat 's recovery grants and grants for the art museum and activities in the park being received earlier than they 've been expected that if I can quickly talk about grants being received earlier than expected we 're expecting that the operating performance will remain above budget right to the end of the financial year and this is due to receiving six million dollars worth of our financial assistance grant for the 1718 year in this financial year so that makes this financial year look really good and makes next ship financial year not as good as it would have been but over the course of the two years all balances out in terms of financial health we 're tracking at the RO low risk level at the end of may and it 's forecast due to the financial assistance cramping saved earlier than expected so if it 's next for six million dollars with the cash into our account capital expenditure is progressing fairly well at this stage thirty-two point five million dollars worth 42 million dollar forecast spend at the end of end of May currently on track to spend what I asked to make be around ninety percent of the capital budget we won 't hit the hundred percent and that 's due to some under spends on things like cosgrove three but also some significant capital projects an example of that would be the wells food street roadworks which is slightly behind schedule and that will have some overruns into next financial year this is me thank you mister title that comprehensive report and just to add to that I know we do call on the Society of each month or each caller to give us an update on our financial reports timing seems to be timing a payments need to be a very frequent issue so thanks very glad that it can look remarkably good one month and then say all in all we 're on mine to have a very balanced way forward and he sorry counselor summer did you wish to add to that any other council wishing to speak against the motion the motion generated them June 's very good time to have a monthly report you get the final summary next month and according to what we 've been told it 's gone very well so looking forward to the final report on the last 12 months the financial you good Thank You councillor Patterson any other council wishing to comment either for or against good council or as very in our closing comments not explicitly all in favor councillors against motion carried they have item 8.4 we have the adoption of various policies as printed on page 45 our agendas we 'll have a counselor wishing to move the recommendation has listed councillor O 'Keefe we have a seconder please counsel us summer council O 'Keefe le straight forward adoption of the various policies on page 45 the governs team initiated an organizational wide review of all existing council policies and corporate procedures following the is in the agenda and now recommended as outcomes from this view obviously one of the new ones being the live streaming and recording of council meetings which is encouraging transparency and obviously better community engagement the Freedom of Information policy gifts and benefits specifically cognition exercise of delegations and conflict of interest policy loyalties policies have been reviewed and assessed on their content and purpose it is recommended that these policies now be adopted with what is considered to be minor changes Thank You councillor Council Sutton I 've picked the wrong box how about councillor some would you like to any comments my to say a few words on the gifts and benefits policy which is one of the ones that we are updating just for the benefit of councillors and the public it has a requirement that council laws must register all the gifts that were given I believe the threshold is 20 very generous so even cups of coffee can add up to over 20 so essentially we 're not able of what we can so long as we register the gift so ah yeah there council which is terrific and we just need to be mindful of that moving forward let 's say hand you know there 's no yeah hey I 'm very very sure Thank You casa excuse me any counselor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion like to make a comment regarding the Gibson benefits policy I appreciated counselor summer giving me the 20 warning up to 14 16 I 'm approaching that key figure proposed then you have a counselor wishing to add comment by the for or against now back to you counselor okay one final comment I just like to wish we 'll all the best who looks after our live streaming he 's actually living on so I just like to wish him well he 's new venture yes I 'll reiterate those comments thank you will yeah the other way was thing woodworking you were a pioneer in setting this up Thank You Damian all in favor of motion counselors against motion carried now counselors item 8.5 on page 48 we have a recommendation counselor who will love to move this recommendation as emotion castle hazel Minh oh how much the same is to me of the sleaze occur on a monthly basis they 're provided for information to see the the status of various contracts as they 're moving through the the organization towards a decision a couple of them that are listed here that decisions made tonight others will reappear in future council agendas would thank you counsel summer edition just that the recommendation is noting the publicly advertised contracts that are awarded under delegation there 's certain levels of finance that are done located to counsel staff and these are under that delegation so it 's just a matter of being transparent if we look at contract number one 7 5 5 which is cosgrove 3 landfill construction of perimeter fencing and we can see that that fence costs over one hundred and thirty thousand dollars that 's a good indication of why we need to borrow for cosgrove 3 moving forward landfills are expensive and when you consider that 's just a partial cost of a very enormous project out there at cosgrove it does partially justify this six million 'll also draw attention to 178 4 that 's electric vehicle feasibility and business case now my understanding is that has also been funded with some money from the sustainability fund which is terrific because that 's the landfill levy that 's supposed to go back to renewables and supposed to go back to the environment but it 's been locked up for many years so they 're actually letting this out to councils who are willing to do joint procurement and collaborate with surrounding councils so that they can really make a difference so if you can imagine electric vehicles being in council fleets across morio campus be we 'd be driving these little electric cars and we really have to have chart charge points in between all the Shires to make it feasible otherwise you 'd just be stuck on the side of the road so it 's really important that we have these alliances and the gold breaking greenhouse alliance are the ones who are pushing that Thank You councillor summer if we get the Hyperloop going there 's only four electric cars councilors in the council hazel one amsuman ruled in favor of the motion against motion carried they have counselors item 8.6 another monumental document especially that this is the first mini council is the first council plan that we 've been involved in or they 've been involved in this is very important it sets the pathway for the next four years of this council and this community so to have a council wishing to move that recommendation as emergent counselor you had your hand up early yes you 're well ahead of the pack there counsel O 'Keefe you 'd like to move the recommendations a motion to have a seconder please council Abdulla so counselor O 'Keefe you got your first cab off the rank Thank You mr. mayor and I just would like to miss a motion on the council plan on page 51 in January 2017 we began discussions on the development of the council plan for 2017 to 2021 to develop ideas for the next four years this has been a lengthy and again in-depth process in which has included input from the community obviously council staff CEO and new council I 'd like to point out I found this process to be extremely interesting it 's a very valuable insight to what our priorities will be and what they are for the greater Shepherd in we 've worked to engage with the community and to seek feedback from surveys as well as submissions which then follows us sorry which then allows us to work on those submissions and work together with the community and as I 've mentioned with the budget this is the community 's plan as well obviously the community plan as counselors our goal is to do again the best we can and that is that we and we have sorry we have tried to do that so this has been such an interesting process we know we 've had some changes we 've had discussions but at the end of the day this plan I think is really really doable and I think it 's very achievable and I think the community are hopefully going to be very happy cool Thank You council O 'Keefe Casabella as a as a first-time councillor it was I 'm happy with the level of involvement from the councillors so there were workshops brainstorming sessions discussions debates with the executive leadership team and the counselors and that resulted in a solid outline of the plan and the draft plan the draft plan so the draft plan was released for community consultation community consultation sessions and workshops were arranged by the council just want to note that attendance of community members in some of these sessions was less than desirable so that can be improved in future also I believe that there is some room for improvement in the advisory committee consultant consultation arrangements so rather than involving them towards the end of the process they could have been early engagements some areas that are not highlighted at the strategic plan level example formulation of gender equity policy were sort of causing you some concern but now I understand that the annual business plan colors this area and councils people in development strategy 2017 and 2021 it 's going to cover gender equity policy for the organization overall I 'm satisfied with the council plan it reflects our community is a very good improvement because now the key indicators of success have been identified and we can monitor the progress with that thank you very much thank you council abdullah just note that the councillor sum has just left the room please don 't have any counsel we should speak against this motion now any other council wishing to add their comments for the motion althought as well.you Thank You mr. mayor I was particularly interested the special council meeting that we had the other day when there was a range of submitters that presented their aspirations and views in relation to what they should be included and I was particularly impressed with the greater Shepherd and basketball presentation in terms of where they see themselves moving forward and I 'd certainly hope that we can achieve some great things for them in the next four years particularly in relation to the fact that it sits at the entrance to the positive thing if we can move that along Thank You councillor or Israeli any other council wish to speak for or against motion as I Hazen before the I 'd agree with the comments that have been passed about the process that we 've gone through to get to this point would say that all planning by definition is aspirational and some of the criticism of council plans in the past has been that has been strong an aspirational that yeah bit lied on the detail in terms of performance indicators and targets to be reached and I 'm really pleased to see that that aspect has been been really addressed in in this in this plan that there are capacity now for an annual review for a tracking of performance and reporting back to the community of our performance against those targets I think that 's really good it also contains elements of that performance measurement that 's both qualitative and quantitative so that we 've got particular targets that be addressed but also you know the quality of performance is being addressed at the same time so I think it 's particularly really outcome good Thank You councillor hazel and just please note councillor somebody 's back in the room you have the council wishing to motion yeah look I 'd like to support specially councilor hazel Symons comments I also like to congratulate all the new all the council 's especially new ones will very conscious I believe when you become when you the new counselor you can visit that down the path that you might necessarily not want to go but I think they showed that they wanted they knew what they want in this counsel plan as well as us all the counselors we didn 't want a document that full of motherhood statements that we could get to the end of it and go yeah oh we 've done all this this is more a very strategic document that we can work to and as councilor hoseman said we can actually tick off our successes as we go a lot of these we could for us one so I congratulate everyone involvement has been a very long process as long as the budget basically for us a lot of input and I 'd also endorsed councilor as various comments when we have citizens come in and address us regarding their concerns I some things that can get to your back your mind forward and the Basketball Association is a perfect example of that and I think that needs continue having some of these groups are very organized and it 's great to hear them and you have the confidence to support them when you know they 're working hard themselves so congratulations to everyone involved like it 's been a great process and it 's a great account good Thank You councillor Paterson any other council wishing to add their comments for against Council Sutton I think it 's a great document it 's an easy easy read document it 's not pages and pages and I just like to thank everybody who worked on it and it was a very interesting time to be working on it I think it 's a great document thank you any other council we should add their comments for or against that means tomato and councillors I 'd like to just echo the comments of all the other councillors and offer my personal thanks to the organization all directors all the staff that have worked when you 're putting together a council plan alongside a budget that obviously happens every four years it 's a double whammy you know to a degree and I know councils weird away on a bit of a weekend together and I distinctly recall some rather robust debates during that period of time and I found that actually quite inspirational with the new counselors went backward in coming forward and expressing their opinions and their aspirations over the next four years so that 's what this documents all about it 's an aspirational document that does actually map the roadmap forward for this council in this community having said that this is a living document it gets reviewed every 12 months and it has to be a flexible document because things do change we have an election coming up in the next 18 months or so state election that could certainly change our actually way forward depending on who 's in power and what priorities that particular government has so having said that we 've mapped the way forward as I said it was rather robust that the discussions and think we 've put together something that incorporates all the aspirations of all the community not just councillors so again I 'd like to offer my thanks and I 'm sure mr. haver probably had some comments to this after I finished so having said that Peter thank you very much and you can highlight some of the key aspects of the council plan what we intend to focus on and deliver over the next four years so that includes the very exciting same project we currently see a five-story building going up in Shepard unless the courthouse our second five-story building will be the same project under economic development there is work to activate the mall mod Street Mall activation so that will be exciting to see that come evident Showgrounds multi-purpose pavilion we 've also got under built we have mod Street upgrade stages 1b and 1c we have new Dickey Road old Dickey Road happening the moment we 've got the progression of the ship and sports stadium we 've got progression of the relocation of the ship at an aerodrome that will be exciting to see we talked about cosgrove Cosgrove is our major capital project and this area of the environment picks up on greening Shepherd and tree planting program and visually that 's where you 'll see a difference over the next four years with the amount of trees that will be planted throughout the municipality significant change you will see in the canopy we 're aiming for a forty percent canopy I think we 're round about something less than twenty percent so as you can see just from those percentages the amenity the visual amenity of our area will change over those four years so that 's a little bit of a highlight there 's much more than that but as you can see lots of exciting projects over four years thank you scenario being said councillors I go back to councillor O 'Keefe I think really good thank you very much well your favor councillors against motion carried item six sorry eight point seven on page 55 we have a recommendation that the council adopted the rating strategy 2017 2021 councillors who would like to move that recommendation as a motion very as likeif main outcome of this review was for the next four years to maintain stability for the ratepayers whilst gaining administration efficiencies the draft strategy 2007 to 2021 was endorsed by counsel on Tuesday the 18th of April the public notice was given on inviting public comments and feedback submission period ended and we have no submissions were received so that the council my suggestion that the council adopt the rating strategy 2017 to 2021 Thank You councillor Keith councillor or as Mary yes mr. mayor thank you I take note of the comments councillor keep the only thing I would say is whilst the support the strategy I would like would have liked to have seen 2.5 remain which talks about the full payment option for the payment of rates with together with an incentive reduction into the centage like a discount if people pay them in full and I think a couple of my fellow councillors have also expressed some surprise in relation to that but again that 's just my individual opinion for the purposes of the exercise tonight but I fully support the rating to speak against this version or the motion councillor summer I will speak for the motion again I do have an issue that the amount raised by the minister charge will be maintained at general rate revenue of 12 percent and I did go through why I thought that the municipal charge is an unfair charge only 50 percent of Victorian councils have the charge at all and if it was after me up to me I 'd stagger it down to be removed completely over a certain number of years basically it 's a seven-point eight four million dollar discount for the top end of town that everyone pays for and being called the municipal charge being part of a reading strategy it 's not the most engaging or sexy thing you could think about and really look into but that considering roads gets a lot of complaints the only other issue that would get on par if not more complaints is the rating system and people 's rates and the bills that they get in there box so I find it astonishing that the public didn 't didn this when you hear the word municipal charge when you hear the word rating strategy people either don 't equate that to the bill that they get in their letterbox enough to give us their opinion or it 's just sounds so complicated that people switch off I think we need a better language when we 're talking about these things and being really clear in what we 're trying to do so it differs from the budget it 's not about how much we 're collecting it 's about how we collect it so I 'm not happy with the municipal charge but through discussions with other councillors I believe that there is really no point in in putting up my hand to object I think that this has been a team effort again and I know that the staff are putting a lot of good work so I am conceding that the municipal charge will stay for at least another year Thank You councillor summer any other council wishing to speak against the motion for the motion adding I share councillors varies concerns about removing the full payment will expire I believe it 's going to be before that for the Christmas break I totally understand and accept what 's been done and that is that a lot of a lot of people get themselves in the trouble not thinking about how they 're going to pay their rates this way they 're forced to take on a plan that will lose their burden and won 't live in position in February of things I need to find 1500 I can 't do it next thing they 're in trouble with back interest et cetera I understand that but I 'm prepared to give it 12 months to see how it works and have a public accepted I think that 's the best way of doing it and if they don 't it doesn 't work as well as we hope then we 'll good adjusting something next year Thank You counsel Patterson any other councillor wishing that any comments for or against that being said councillor O 'Keefe any closing comments no all in favor of the motion councilors against motion carried item 9.1 counselors on page me not to make mention of former councillor Kevin Ryan being in the public gallery tonight oh just one of a note of his actual existence in the building here tonight and he 's intimidating stance in front of the councillors but thank you for that counsel Ryan or former councillor John Gray few going too well without we 're never gonna make that far away he 's the most future counselor well anyway thank you gonna for being it 's not even ability welcome now we 'll move on to item 9.1 on page 61 councillors it 's Nixon Street center of the road car parking driver Council we should move that recommendation as a motion as Laura 's very and a seconder please council O 'Keefe Kessler is very oh look this is a bit of deja vu this one because I remember when this came up way back when in the past and the it was considerable discussion and debate about I just couldn 't get my head around the cost that was attributed to parking spaces and ultimately council saw common-sense and reduced it to 12 enough and subsequently the matter ended up at VCAT and we had a victory I think from recollection but essentially what this is is that if people who are familiar with that part of town that I think from recollection that 's you out of town which doesn 't have center of road parking and it 's very wide you could land a jumbo on that stretch of road there so it 's pretty appropriate that we incorporate that into the parking strategy and put down the markings in line it 'll give us additional parking particularly when freakin Reserve is rockin and rollin and the part of the planning process Thank You counselor councillor Keefe Hey look I think it 's crucial that we try and continue to add more parking I mean the the town is growing in every way we have lots of development one of the businesses along there is actually increases business out of sight so we need obviously putting us forward of more parking I think it 's a sign of the times we 've got so much happening here in Sheppard and I going to encourage more people into the CBD it 's going to be another gateway into the CBD with longer term parking so I think it 's crucial that we actually where we can we add more parking we 're losing a bit of parking and whilst that 's Street I think this is a great you know compensation to give some more parking back you know where we need it long terms where we need it Thank You counsel any councillor wishing to speak against the motion or the motion you councillor or as very hard no thanks mr. mee all in favor against motion carry item nine point two councillors on page 65 we have a recommendation and we got the golden belly highway bypass action group update of terms of reference and appointment of new community member councils who 'd like to move this as a motion councillor Giovannetti do I have a seconder please councillor Patterson councillor Giovannetti yes mr. mayor I just like to move the recommendation on page 65 which states that item 1 we adopt the revised terms of reference from include explicit in May 2016 to the Brian heat we thank Brian Hicks for his long-standing involvement in the golden valley highway bypass action group n technologies from the group and three having a set of the nominations received for the appointment to the Golden Valley highway bypass Action Group appoint the following nominee to the Golden Valley highway bypass action group for the remainder of the current two-year term commencing on 21st June and concluding on the 15th of August 2018 and that being Leslie HASC I 'd like to firstly congratulate Leslie on the appointment to this bypass action group over the next few years is going to be an extremely important group that we will be working with in relation to the bypass I 'd also like to thank Bryan Hicks for his involvement on that group and I know that he did have significant involvement and we do thank him for his achievements over the time Leivers on it Thank You Council on councilor Patterson and I think councilor dinner buddy capita very well indeed do you have any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for for this opportunity to reinforce the importance of this committee we 're talking about up to two hundred and sixty million dollars that we 'll be asking from the federal government for this bypass it really is important for our region that this gets built it 's going to manage our long-term traffic growth because we are a growing community it will make the roads safer it will relieve the congestion in the middle of the CBD it will reduce accidents especially trucks from trucks it will position future land-use development along that site and improve the amenity so we 're looking here at we 're going to include explicit reference to the stage western route adopted by council resolution and the interest of that is to get the second river crossing and the fact that we 've been pushing for the rest western route for so long and it does seem like the government is responding if we were to change that now it would set us back probably about a decade so we 'd be looking at another ten years for anyone starts to consider giving us enough money to continue with what we what we adopted by resolution earlier Thank You counsel someone and you have a council wishing to speak against or as a hazel Minh thank you yeah I 'm very pleased to see this this come forward and in this format you might recall almost two years ago I raised a number of concerns and respect to the governance matters relating to this particular committee and you know things that had occurred that didn 't get the appropriate amount of council oversight and that should have been dealt with in a more appropriate manner even referencing the resolution of may 2016 adopting in the Western route this was already appearing in council and state government publications as the council 's preferred position and I think what we 're doing now we 're bringing this committee this Advisory Committee back into center stage and making it the vehicle for change not not by passing it no coming tonight or or or assuming certain things without their to your governance processes and I think this is really good and again as others have said my ex for contribution to it and also pleasing that see Leslie Hart 's put a hand up and I know mostly through other capacities I 'm sure she 'll be a very valuable member of their committee Thank You councillor any other council we should add comment for or against I 'll just have my comments to this as well thank you councillors myself and the CEO mr. Harry doe on this actual bypass action group and I can assure you that it 's very valuable it just forms a part of a a group type of advocacy that council already advocated very strongly on every possible occasion in regard to securing funds for this bypass and of course our local state member does the same as does many other community organizations so this is just another angle that we shouldn 't say attack but approach and advocate very robustly for this project as they government it 's a very very valuable group of some great people on this on this community now and I just want to offer my thanks to Brian Hicks as well and I welcome Leslie Hart 's achieve our final aims which is to get this bypass up and running sooner rather than later so thank you for that that being said councillor juvinity any closing comments if you 've summed it up very well mr. mayor and keep down slap all in favor councillors against motion carried item 9.3 councillors and I think this is one of the items that our former councillor Ryan has come here tonight to listen to and here on my point three on page 70 we have a recommendation contain the Tetra Park Advisory groups and membership changes there so do have a councillor wishing to move that councillor Patterson and a seconder please councillor David Eddie Kessler Patterson we should speak is former chairman of this group I would like to move this recommendation Chantelle Langley mix Foxx Shawn Oceania see David quick Kray grouse Knoll Russell mr. Ryan himself Nick Taylor Cowell Walters and groaned you several those gentlemen and ladies have been that community quite a while I hope the future of datura Park there 's been a lot of money put in there there 's been a a greater Shetland community it is not nearly finished but it 's getting close and I 'd like to see us concentrate over the next couple of years of finishing off things like downpipes et cetera bring to that stage where we can sort of tick it off there 'll always be room for more development etc but it 's very close to being completed this group very about it as we know some of the people sitting in this room are it 's a you know a risk of science '_''_4926.79 jewel of the crown of the jury and in probably the jewel or crown of our municipality in a lot of ways as far as for projects where our events as an event they 're basically every weekend the big one of course is dairy wheat but that 's only one of probably two dairy or cattle events the rest of horses and it 's very big it 's a very competitive field literally excuse opponent with horse events you need to be on top of your game you need to competitive and you need to have your mindful that and keep that in forefront of our mind and these people I have total confidence that I 'll be able to come to fruition and bring that to fruition zone counselor counselor Giovannetti I just like giving doors comments of counselor person I think that the Deer Park Advisory Group have done a fantastic job over there we had the opportunity early in in our term to visit the complex and ex counselor I was there on the day to tell leaders and show us through and I thought it was an excellent facility and the work that the turret community and this particular group of put in to that particular facility is exemplary really and it 'll be great for that if it could be replicated in other areas of the municipality Thank You councillor any councillor wishing to speak against the motion or the motion see you councillor person I think been summarized pretty well thank you all in favor of the motion against motion carried counselors item 9.40 is like at the start of the meeting of their conflict of interest in relation to this impacted by the amendment Thank You councillor hazel I won 't forget to call you back this time thank you now councillors we have a recommendation on page 75 we have a council wishing to move this recommendation there 's motion it kind of close the doors counselor so no impact on our security palsy so councillors who was just to move this recommendation as a motion councillor Patterson the second to please and slow Abdulla councillor Patterson is put out for consultation there was about 16 submitters it goes to a council sorry now an independent planning meeting meeting next week this is merely a for our information and for the community 's information the planning panel the independent planning panel will hand down their findings and that 'll leave council a good direction on proceedings after that Thank You councillor Patterson council up doing it is at this stage it is only an information item on agenda as as far as any concern and we wait to hear from the independent panel about the report good thank you any councillor we should just speak against this motion councillor before council today can best be described as a meeting headed Hydra of technicality and in so many ways is generally a reflective of planning issues in general to understand and then appreciate the implications of our planning decisions is indeed a challenging process the effect of the revision is to reflect and support the ongoing use and development of the Givi harness and greyhound racing facility and I 'm conscious of the fact that this matter will go to the development only would occur in accordance with an approved master plan which is the GV harness racing study which is to be included as a reference document 09 it must consider the affected use or development in an investigation area may have on nearby existing or proposed developments it 's important to remember that the word consider is used in its simplest form which means in essence think carefully about it there is no further binding obligation in general terms on the topic of planning scheme amendments one of the most critical aspects of them is that they need to be transparent and complete in terms of policies and about those planning matters the amendments sought regarding 2104 and o9 to my way of thinking is pushing the view that the reference document is to be included as part of the planning scheme it 's the combination of these amendments in the master plan that is complicated as they are interwoven see 199 affects the land which is the precinct itself I also understand and appreciate the primary purpose of this amendment is to invest in a form of protection of the precinct itself based upon the fact that the investigation study is complete but equally I am of the view it also affects that other land contained within investigation area 1 as well by placing controls and non precinct land it would be naive to think that this was also not only intended consequence one of the questions I cannot adequately resolved at this point is that it appears the Planning Amendment does not adopt the water technology flood behavior report and the reason for this may well be that it is explained to me is that it is different to a flood study under the Victorian floodplain C 199 also proposes an amendment to schedule four of a special use so in short what the effect would appear to be is that in relation to the land in relation to investigation area one is that applications for use subdivisions buildings or works will all be exempt from notice requirements pursuant to the relevant sections of the Planning and Environment Act I would speculate that the Planning and Environment Act supports the very transparency in relation to public land use decisions part of that process I would suggest is to allow people to continue to receive all those things that we take for granted which could potentially affect their well-being their amenity and their rights of objection or appeal these amendments to the schedule in my assessment potentially seek to curtail those in short whilst I 've continued to consider the merits long as long as you like some time so councillors are we all in favor continue please thank you in short whilst I 've continued to consider the merits of this area every stage of the process assessing the pros and cons for a number of it will have an investigation area one the land the special use zone Santa 's on is the harvest Racing pressing but in reality by implementing the C 199 amendment this will create a lasting ripple effect on the whole of the investigation area one the proposed changes under those planning environment sections and not supported by me and this amendment does not give me comfort regarding equitable develop in the future of this area and I 'm very conscious of the fact that there is a planning and all next next week and to the uninitiated a planning panel is actually allow the public to participate in planning and environmental decisions they independently assess the proposals by considering the submissions conducting hearings and preparing reports the critical thing for me are the planning panels are only advisors and make recommendations the final decision is left to the appropriate statutory body or the minister so I just put it out there in terms of my position in relation to another being very consistent in relation to my concerns about the future direction this amendment thank you Thank You councillor I motion into motion council summer I 'm in agreeance with counselor Asbury in that I 've lost a lot of confidence in this project although the last few motions that have come to us I have consistently objected to and called divisions on so I understand that this motion is just basically to note that it 's going to a planning panel so whether we pass the motion or don 't pass the motion is a moot point here I see the trotting track as an entity in itself that already has a state imposed buffer from the EPA and then we 've embarked on this very complicated investigation area one and based it on flood studies and it 's really difficult to predict flat water flooding at the best of times but we 've used to studies in the process one was an endorsed study the other hadn 't been endorsed and it wasn 't completed yet we based our master plan of the trotting track on that study so for me it 's inconsistent I believe we need to start again in a few years and abandon investigation do it but how much land does do we really need to protect one facility it 's given the public out who live out there the residents they 've had a lot of unrest and a lot of not knowing what their future holds so in my opinion I probably shouldn 't have even embarked on it in the first place I 'll see what the planning panel has to say but my opinion hasn 't changed from the last time I objected in the time before that Thank You councillor councils wishing to speak for the motion against against councillor sutton thanks because I agree with Liz and I agree with what Furnas said I 'm not comfortable with this amendment probably because that land use and as fern said it 's a lot of land around the and trotting track that I don 't really think needs to be included in this plan so i note that it 's going to the you know so I will wait to see what comes up from the panel and you know and form the way I want you to vote be asking for a point of clarification to myself but I will the motion before us is simply to note councils officers response outlined in this report for your Ferol and presentation to an independent planning panel and as it 's been noted this motion is really just to alert ourselves endeavoring to the fact that this is going to a planning panel it 's irrelevant whether to be quite as where these passes or not it will go to a panel so that 's the point we 're discussing the point that the independent panel will wonder where the officers are coming from where the councilors are actually coming from if they 've put up this motion and relevant in that regard won 't change the fact that the Planning panel will be most unusual for the independent panel to be in this situation they will wonder what 's going on said counselors that 's the item before us here today so that being said I think everyone has had an opportunity to speak to the motional for the motion and against and councillor Patterson I think you move we have to be very conscious of the fact this is to basically as as Peter said it is to inform us that it 's the counselors position to know I 'm sorry getting their own note the officers response we 've gone from noting their response into full stage war regarding this project all we 've done is noted the response all right we have to keep in mind is going to a panel hearing I agree with everyone when I 've said it is very complicated and it is very complicated I for one looking forward to seeing the panel 's independent panels response that we you know they 'll have a big bearing on I think we all go from there I think we have to also keep in mind the flood study that we sometimes question will that same flood study was for that whole area and in a not too distant future that flood study will cover all of Shepherd and a movement so it 's not something we can pick and choose it 'll be coming all of Shepherd and mer and that 's counselors that the the section two of the recommendation note the council offers may exercise discretion to best achieve the general position adopted by council with discussions that most of us had with council office that day that was regarding if there 's a small techo comes up to council to the council offers at that hearing panel they would have to say oh sorry but we haven 't got any discretion dual that have to come back to council and that 's what it 's all the panel hearing is in shepherding it is open to the public councils I know we 'll be attending the public will be attending so it 'll be very open we 'll be all very conscious what happens oh I would support and recommend to my fellow councillors we do adopt it let 's worry about the Worr if we get to a wall this is only picking where we 're going to stage that fight if there is one and to see there needs to be an argument so I highly recommend that councilors move that this recommendation become emotion and be hearing Thank You councillor Patterson that being said all counselors for the motion against division deed division being called councils for the motion councillor Giovannetti councillor abdullah councillor patterson councillor O 'Keefe councillor Adam against council Horace berry councillor Sutton councillor seller motion carried Oh Thank You counsel Patterson oh I wouldn 't forget but the Thank You counselors page 83 we have item 9.5 our international engagement polls in 201 seven we have we have a recommendation a counselor or counselor selling yeah they 're pretty great counselor summer you would like to move the recommendations our top things does engage III yes over second to please counselor is very and I cancel a certain a certain summer this is a recommendation that council adopt the international engagement policy and I think this has been a fairly long time coming considering we 've had sister city relationships with many international countries for a long time now I much prefer the approach of an engagement policy rather than an ad hoc approach which has traditionally been the case this way we 've got predetermined outcomes and expectations and we can do go on delegations overseas obviously that has to be flexible and you can 't guarantee that an outcome will occur but if there 's a reasonable chance that we could increase our fruit export opportunities if we could attract investment or have student placement opportunities those are really great things that could benefit our region and we know that the Chinese have responded really well to Shepperton because we have so many great exports and the clean green food that they love to eat their response according to our mayor to the great things happen here campaign was just wonderful they were all sitting around listening to speeches but councillor Adam and CEO Peter Harriet had a visual display of exactly what the region has to offer with Charles Willie 's face at the forefront and they were really pleased and stood up in claps which was unusual so we know how to make an impact in greater shepherding there was recent delegations yes again to China on the own invitation of the premier which happened to coincide with an election and I must say that it was very trip because sometimes there 's negative feedback from the public when councillors do engage in these delegations but determining who and when we should go and where to is really clearly intended in this policy and I think it 's it 's something that can only benefit greater shipping it Thank You counselors and a counselor or Eswari Thank You mr. mayor having fully support 150 percent the commentary by councilor summer particularly in regard to from where we came in the past in terms of sending and they 're overseas in the different locations this policy that we 've got now is a clear map in relation to how we deal with them I personally would like to see that there we are a proactive footing in relation to making sure that we 're across our relationships and it is in friendship city and agreements because as we were briefed previously a lot of these in the past that just sort of melted away into the dust wouldn 't want Thank You councillor any councillor wishing to speak against this motion or the motion oh you 're going to 've done this councillor very said some of these have just melt into the dust there 's also a couple melt into our budget a lot of what I 'm a we don 't need to be spending one group come over and something about a crop in the conversation but we don 't need that we know we need to have on behalf our road page we need to have active people going and chasing business for mutual benefit between different sister cities not an old boys club you come here and I 'll go there and that 's what we don 't bother to recommend the update and we 'll be good Thank You counsel councillors wishing to speak against the motion for the motion counselor some like to note that each sister city and friendship city agreement should feature the firing a sunset clause so we know it can end the 12-month review period agreed outcomes the opportunity to extend the formal relationship and a clear purpose of the agreement and I think that 's very important because that tells us what we 're looking for Thank for or against as the summer would you like some closing comments just in relation to the melting into the budget it wouldn 't matter if we spent ten thousand dollars or ten dollars when it comes to public perception that 's too much so we really have can 't_''_6135.59 be more diligent it can 't be diligent enough when it comes to justifying the spend in sending people on something which is not a junket it is a work trip and they run off their feet the entire time no time for sightseeing and then they come back here and have an amazing network of international people that we can engage happy Thank You counselor that being said council Zordon favorite version against emotion Kerry 59.6 page 89 counsels we have a recommendation in relation to the adoption of the shipping and railway precinct master plan 2017 counselor summer would you like to move that recommendation is emotion thank you on page 89 as reads thank you taken to place councillor rosemary that 's a summer well this is adopting the shepherd and railway precinct master plan and noting and the recommendations of the precinct master plan I think this is really exciting and it 's really important for Shepherd in when it comes to public transport that 's just going to be used more and more often as we grow and as people look for alternative forms of transport and for many the it 's the first impression for travellers when they arrive in Shepherd and they get off the train so if they get off the train and they see a beautiful courtyard environment that 's quite beautiful they 're going to remember that because that first 30 second impression does stay in your mind they 'll be thirsty when they get off that train and probably want a good coffee so food vans would be a terrific addition and that 's included here if they might be coming to visit someone who is in the new upgraded hospital so there could be flower stalls but really it 's prime real estate that this is where people should go because the people are delivered to their doorstep and we will get more people as we get these courthouse we 'll see people come in transporting themselves from Melbourne in suits and suitcases and things suitcases and suit you know briefcase that thing briefcase yeah and also for Sam apparently Sam 's going to attract apparently a thousand people a week which is a very ambitious number but if that 's true they will be using a train and hopefully this is a predecessor for increase that train services as well and an upgrade to the train carriages as we 've seen it 's become a political football and eventually someone 's going to form a council right nice eggs no Feeny sorry Chelsea your words carried a lot of weight there Council summer greatly truly thank you for that counselor I thought that any kind of solution to speak against this motion the other councils wish to speak for the motion Council Abdullah I just want to say that exciting times and it 's it 's wonderful to see that we finally have a master plan for Shepherd and really precinct of course everybody knows that this straily percent currently has got a very high gird look sconce the summer has noted that you know it 's the first impression that counts so visitors coming from outside Shepperton need to get a very positive first impression and I think this master plan having a master plan is is the first step in the right direction so well done thank you any other council we should speak against all for the motion for the motion Council okay I think it 's part of exactly what we have you know really focusing on without trouble you know the rail recent is so important at the moment so to have something on the table on the map that we 're moving in that direction I think is a good argument we 've been putting our hands up for more funding and putting up our hand for more times more rail times I actually travelled to Melbourne recently on the train and it 's a fairly poor service I will say so I 'm really hoping in the future that this is going to continue to grow and it 's as part of our plan Thank You councillor O 'Keefe any for it for the motion here at the air for the motion no our plan is long way back made to big blues with this town one is organized to turn our backs on the railway and also the river currently modern thinking is that we 're changing that we have River connect for instance it 's more drawing our attention to the river realizing what a great asset that is within easy easy to go to think about rail and think we 'll let rails dying we 've got terrific trucks to bring our equipment to Shepherd in we 've got everyone 's got a car boy get the train train services will improve and it 's going to be very important part shipping those are familiar with Bendigo you basically end up in the CBD and you love to try that 's something we would notice and this will lead to that so it 'd be a great step forward when it all happens and opens have access to the rail line up it 'll be a very good thing for Shepherd and especially with Melbourne moving north a fast train and being Shepherd in 30 minutes when you leave you know half an hour from Melbourne Thank You Council peasant any dressing D&E under give anybody councils any any other councillor speak against all floor the motion that now is spoken against the motion all that my comments in light of the fact that we 've received near our first rather significant injection of funding for to upgrade our rail services of forty three point five million dollars I think it 's crucial now that we have a plan moving forward for our precinct we can see that you know hopefully in a few years we 'll gain more more money to complete our 186 million dollar project of actually having proper eight philosophy services to Shepherd and if that be the case we need to have a precinct that actually is fitting for these travels to come and visit and travel back so yes the precinct master plan we 've also in Italy it 's quite impressive and it 'll be a great addition to the Greater Shepherd in streetscape so that being said all them or council Hazen what would you like to add this I was very good just momming their council summer only that I was remiss in not thanking the people who submitted and they were quite detailed submissions and they 've all been assessed and considered to be relevant so we have done some changes to the master plan based on submissions Thank You councillor Simon all in favor of the motion counsels against motion Kelly 59.7 on page 99 we have a recommendation in reference to the adoption of the landscape plan guide 2017 for development proposals in the seeking greater Shepherd in the Sherriff campus be and the show of Moira councillors who got to move this recommendation as a motion counsel Patterson a seconder please council O 'Keefe councillor Patterson oh yes as you said this is a joint initiative in three councils three council sorry for those that are familiar with you put a planning application in your favorite commercial area and some areas you need to put a landscape plan in as well we don 't want to see someone building a big shed that 's front so it was not a guide those people when they submit those plans so there 's been a template drawn up by the three councils and this makes the job a lot easier for people applying for permits they can now go to the landscape plan guide have a look at it and choose what they want and now it 'll be accepted Thank You councillor O 'Keefe I think council person covered most of that obviously we do want to make sure want to make sure that we have sustainable and appropriate landscape developments to have a beautiful urban feel amongst our community and we always don 't want to lose sight of that so I think this is a great guide for the for the developers and commercial residential we just need to keep all the greenery happening so yep typically support this one right thank you councils wishing to speak against the motion none are for the motion thank you back to councillor Patterson any closing comments are due all in favor of the motion against motion carries item nine point eight on page 106 a Shepherd north and south business areas addendum for 2017 who would like to move this recommendation as about come on a seconder please counselor hustling council summer a child read out what it says that the council adopt the urban design framework Shepherd in North and South business areas note council offices intention to prepare and exhibit a planning scheme amendment to include the recommendations of the urban design framework Shepherd a north and south business areas into the greater Shepherd and planning scheme including the design and development overlays and note that future budget bids will be made to implement the findings and recommendations of the urban design framework Shepperton north and south business areas 2017 to plan and improve the public realm in Shepparton not now my understanding of this is that we have done some work around entrances intership in the north and Shepherd in South business areas and entrances have has come up consistently in my entire time as a councillor so it 's great to see some work being done this is specific to the Shepherd in north gateway and the cola Lakes Drive looking that could potentially be applied to all our entrances and amalgamated together but I can understand that each one each need unique aspects of this such as limitations on signage on banila road having shop fronts placed further back from the road beautify the entrances things that are that are really going to help another first impression coming into chef Thank You councillor summer councillor hazel Minh I think you miss to me I think this is a good example of how the how the planning scheme works in practice that there was an identified need to look at the design frameworks in north and south an appropriate consultant was was engaged a plan was developed and that plan was adopted in draft format by the council and released for public comment and a number of people took that opportunity to comment all landowners occupiers in the affected areas were notified so they were consulted and now we 've got going past that the the offices intention now is prepare and exhibit a planning team amendment which we 've probably seen with other items on the agenda tonight and that the opportunity to to object and potentially a nodding up at a Planning panel and then they 'll all openly another report to Council so I think it demonstrates that the planning processes can be an iterative process it keeps going backwards and forwards over the same type of area so it progresses to a final result Thank You councillor and you have the council wishing to speak against the motion for the motion after you counselor summer know that being the case all in favor against motion carried item nine point nine councillors on page 115 there 's a recommendation in respect to the caller Woodburn Memorial Drive Memorial Avenue sorry Advisory Committee terms of reference I 'll just read out what the recommendation is because number one is authorize deformation of the Calder Woodburn Memorial Avenue Advisory Committee in accordance with the proposed terms of reference adopt the terms of reference for the call that would burn Memorial Drive Avenue Advisory Committee I keep saying driver sorry Avenue committee nominate one councillor to serve on the call that would burn Memorial Avenue advisor me and item four authorize ship and announcing calls for the public nomination for up to three community representatives for two year tenure each simulation will be assessed against the number of these a billion fulfill of functions of the Calderwood burn Memorial Avenue Advisory Committee as outlined in terms of reference now I just want to add councillors we have counselors Shelley Sutton who is who has agreed to not agreed but she 's actually expressed interesting being on this committee as a council so I suggest that whichever councillor moves this motion they add counsel Sutton 's named to the emotion counselor Jeff and Eddie you 're moving the motion that caramel wasn 't hoping to move this Marshall and add that counselor Shelley sudden be appointed to the coral plume Memorial Avenue Advisory Committee thank you do you have a second of this council Patterson counselor job Eddie thanks mr. mayor as we had our briefings this is a very significant part of our history within the Golden Valley and I think it 's important that the committee work towards renewing the Memorial Avenue because over a period of time trees of _''_7007.47 imperative now that we get that Avenue back to where it was because it is of significant historical significance to all of those men who in World War two sacrificed their lives for the country Thank You councillor David Eddie Council Patterson oh yes Lord to support cancer very lot of the so a lot of history out there it 's worth reading I know when the gentleman mr. Woodburn planted the trees he continued on after he 'd finished it was mostly memorial to his son originally then decided to plant a tree for every fallen soldier of the area and he planted the fallen soldiers trees closest to their home so if you 're a Pinelli your closest painting 2 et cetera absolutely today I hope and pray it doesn 't get mixed up with too much red tape breweries are being removed it should be removed some of them of self seen and grown need to have a really good look at how it used to be natural look at a map and I 'm very confident council certainty I deal with any tree should have come device so we then pretty quick so I think it 's a really good thing council is doing it is I can remember when I was a kid it was only small and I know councillor summer hadn 't ever noticed it and that 's an age thing it doesn 't look like an immoral and nude suit even though there 's only eight years between us yeah highly recommend it and it 'll be a great thing to council it doesn 't I hope you get total support and a very much a unified committee that will work towards our desired outcome Thank You councillor councils wishing to speak against the motion or the motion counselor summer um just to say that councillor Patterson was entirely correct I did not even know that this was a Memorial Avenue I just thought it was nice trees on the side of the road so obviously we 've dropped the ball in educating people about what that actually what the significance is so there 's nine and a half kilometers along the GV Highway and it 's a memorial to someone 's it 's like two thousand four hundred and fifty seven trees all just to remember the people who sacrificed their lives for this country so that 's a history that we shouldn 't be forgetting and we should be passing down every time we drive through there we should say to the kids in the back seat hey did you know what this was for because I had no idea and I 'm really ashamed of that but hopefully in the future led by a great committee we can we can rectify that Thank You Council summer and the other council we should add comment either for or against council Sutton appreciate and full emotion yes I 'm very happy serve on this committee and the task of maintaining enhancing and conserving the environmental values of the Memorial Avenue thank you any other comments councilors Kessler 's very small comment mr. mayor was it when we did have our briefing it was pointed out that it is in desperate need of being brought back it 's it 's really rundown so we 're very very happy to be part of know public attention Thank You counselors for against council Hazel oh that was asking for comments for again sorry I just the vacuum clears just gonna be dipped in this left ear yeah sorry councils that being said counselor Jannetty closed I 'm absolutely I think we have I think it 's a worthy worthy committee and congratulations to councilor Sun for putting your hand up for being on that representing Council and I 'm sure to a fantastic job in yes in hopefully returning that Calderwood burn Memorial Drive to its former glory and former significance which will never be lost that being the case all in favor councillors of the motion against carry item I presume this is a ten nine point one zero on page 121 yes Latrobe University Memorandum of Understanding and greater Shipman City Council we have a recommendation of page 121 councils who 'd like to move that motion or that recommendation as the motion counselor summer thank you a second to please council O 'Keefe council summer this right this motion will endorse a Memorandum of Understanding between this council and Latrobe University of Understanding on behalf of Council I 'm really pleased about the MOU I think it 'll actually help position as an education city we have a number of tertiary institutions in this region and only yesterday councilors took a tour of go TAFE and I was we were all really impressed by their learning facilities and their governance structure being able to leverage our funding and really position themselves as strong and lasting in the region so this MOU will facilitate mutually beneficial outcomes it 's about collaboration and cooperation and I 'm hoping that we 'll get more mo use for go TAFE and also Melbourne medical center to really position us as the destination for aspiring intelligent young and old Thank You counselor counselor okay okay else 's wishing to speak against motion for the motion you have to sell any closing comments all in favor against motion carried I won 't moderate and 124 item 9.1 1 on page 124 in respect to their a new business grant guidelines there is a recommendation councillors councillor Patterson and wishing to move that motion so good yes I would be a chance the motion checkmates for change of motion councillor better okay emotional memory that council got the new business grant program guidelines and number 2 that council reassessed program in 12 months so the motion before us is that the council adopt a new business grant program guidelines with a assessment at the assessment and twelve months there to be reassessed in 12 months are we clear on that counselors do we have a seconder councillor Hazelden okay counselor Patterson I totally support council encouraging business our positions in Shepparton as an murtler anti-terror and murchison i have concerns as a previous business owner another heart is out there and the other people that are in business and have been in business to all realize that it 's very difficult when you 're you 're battling away and next thing someone gets a bit of a free handout and set up a business beside you that basically catering for the same issues that you cater for now since our briefing I know that the assessment and the criteria is changed considerably a suitability of the business does the criteria I just have concerns how that will be overseen and I think men of 30,000 isn 't a lot of money but it is a considerable amount I just think we should look at it after twelve months to see how it is working we can reassess if we might improve it we might reduce it and we might find it 's the best thing that 's ever happened to business in ship and we don 't know I don 't like it resist after 12 months you cancel hazel them but fully support those comments particularly the highlighting the the section about does it compete with an existing offering I think that 's the area that is of most concern having a regard for I think it 's somewhere in the order of you know something like eighty percent of your growth and development will come from existing businesses investing in expansion and whatever and so I think the the notional let 's give it a go for 12 months it 's fine let 's see what applications we get for it let 's see what the review in 12 months time to see whether it 's working yeah the comment I made about growth and development coming from within we could have a fairly modest business gaining access to these funds by coming to Shepperton but a fairly substantial business investing significant amounts of money wouldn 't benefit in any way from it Thank You councillor councils wishing to speak against the motion for the motion Council O 'Keefe and Thank You mr. mayor I do feel a little bit uncomfortable with this I think it 's you know basically helping three businesses I 'm all for supporting business across the greatest Shepperton however I have concerns at a local government duty to do that again I think that the two issues that have been raised with both both council hazel and council Patterson is exactly how I 'm feeling about it we need to be very very strict you 're on the people coming through making sure that the money is not wasted I know it 's not a lot of money but money is money and I think it 's a risky type of idea perhaps of doing it for someone and not for the other some other personnel I would have liked that perhaps to be more at a state government offering I think it 's difficult to pick and choose but let 's wait and see what happens I think okay let 's give me the benefit of the doubt and see what happens over this next 12-month process Thank You Council on any other council wishing to speak against the motion for the motion caocao summer well in regards to the 12-month review I would imagine that this would come back to us anyway so that we can endorse the people who have been successful and there will also be an acquittal process that counselors will probably be provided on whether or not the grant was successful it 's a relatively small amount of money as was said up to 10,000 for successful applicants and it 's a budget allocation of only 30,000 in regards to this not being a local government initiative I will urge counselors to remind themselves that we need to be looking at the triple bottom line to look at social elements we need to look at the financial elements and we need to look at the environmental elements so if we have a carrot out there for people who might not quite be at the level where they want to invest in a business but they really want to find out more they can try and invest it they can try and apply for these grants and be assisted along the way and even if they 're not successful they can be linked into our business info center who can assist them with a business plan so people will feel more aspirational in this town city there 's the financial element which means more shops around the town means more employment which means more money in our economy and that all gets spread 1 spent locally goes around the economy seven times there 's also the environmental component and that when we walk around down the street and we 'll see the vacant shops it 's just not not a vibrant and active amenity when we walk down the street and we see that so this shops and improve the environment it is a small step but it is a start I don 't believe we should be focused on whether they compete with existing businesses I think that word compete is a little bit toxic and we should be saying complement because if you get a bunch of the similar businesses in one street it 's going to become a destination like we 've seen with ishka and culture tree being very close together you get the similar type of shoppers going there and they know that they can have variety and choice I would like to review this in 12 my short I 'm happy to do that and I 'm hoping we can expand into helping small businesses take that next step in growing because I think that 's really important entrepreneurship is important but small business is 30 percent of our economy so yep I 'm happy to do this it 's a small step but it has my support Thank You councillor any other council we should add comment against or for for comment thank you just wanting to point out they 're getting they 've got to put in money too yeah thank you any other council wishing to come in counselor is very thank you mr. mayor I think it 's a great idea not owning a business but I can see that you 've got to put your money where your mouth is in desk councillor Sutton correctly pointed out dollar for dollar I 'm conscious of the fact that some of us are a bit squeamish in relation to issues in relation to matters of governance but I 'm fairly confident that if it 's managed correctly and effectively it will only just bring people to the community and shows that this council is fairly come in relation to Thank You counselor is very the other counsel wishing to add comment against the motion or for the motion that being said counselor Patterson I would just like to make one comment on what counselor someone said competition is good but has to be even putting the concept of true fish-and-chip shop sitting beside one another and councils pay 10 grand for their good for i for one and the new guy comes other guy and says thanks very much for 10 grand but you deep-fry you 've got to have in context the fact that these people are paying for other people 's start in business center and in business you 've got to be able to stand up in 1955 and sometimes it can be disheartening for that current business so I did I wanna have a little bit twelve months like Mozilla count I think your council Patterson that being said all in favor of the motion against motion carried because we have item 9.1 to befall to get to that counselor driven ap did you have I do but I thought it actually related to item 9 13 that 's what I was told but I 'm quite happy to title it an hour now you can take it any time now now that I 've wasted our time in asking you I think you should say with teachers is where I 'd like to table them deliberately leader council petition as an attachment to the report a petition from obviously believe it delis upon the petition quite a clarification mr. mayor yes the origin of the of the petition as a king was forwarded to Council what I 'm getting at is at an idea generated petition oh yes no Jerry generator Genie so with the leader council with the agreement we 're happy to table that allow that to be tabled Thank You councillor Jeff and Eddie it 's been duly noted now on to item 9.1 to the post amendment C 192 to the greater ship and planning scheme implementation of the commercial activity set a strategy consideration of submissions there is a motion on page 130 to have a councillor wishing to move that as a motion yes so uh some did you yeah I moving at the station that yes you have a seconder please councillor is very council summer ah what to say this is about again going to a Planning panel this isn 't about making any decisions and it 's just noting our position when it gets to the panel and giving officers discretion in achieving our adopted outcome now we have to have an outcome and we began with the position that the planning scheme amendment should go through and that will give it more weights when it comes to things like double supermarkets and no cinemas outside of the mall now I don 't necessarily agree with those I do plan to attend this panel meeting personally so that I can hear for myself some of the objections and our response to those objections I need to be clear in myself when I make a decision based on yeah look I 'm just confident that it should go to a panel so that I can it will help me make my mind up about a few things very thank you mrs. may I think what counsellor summer was that was looking for to differentiate between the spin and the facts in relation to the certain elements within the community which are painting an extremely negative and dire and potentially cataclysmic event in relation to this potential amendment I think it 's all there in black and white and I dare say this will come up as a as a controversial topic at a later against the notion council Sutton Stan C 192 and C 193 and I 'm speaking against this amendment as I don 't think that this amendment is warranted at this time I know that the proposal is to develop more retail sport floor space in the north of Shepperton which includes town squares cafes retail outlets including a supermarket Medical Center and more the area already has a large IG a supermarket with permits to increase its floor space to include a larger supermarket and retail space I don 't believe that this will be a good planning outcome with supermarkets and retail space in such a close proximity to each other it has been scribed to me with more than 10,000 residents in the North another supermarket is required Shepherd and has supermarket six supermarkets and many many neighborhoods smaller supermarkets or within or with liquor licenses which equates to approximately 60,000 people Shepherd is population is approximately 36,000 in Shepherd and I believe and we also we already have an oversupply a supermarket is only about five minutes drive away from any area in Shepparton I refer to the Shepherd and CBD but can you continually allowing shopping centers feed structured on the fringes of our city restricts the ability of the CBD becoming the primary precinct as people no longer have to come to the area to do their shopping or have their coffee Shepperton has an oversupply of retail commercial floor space and until that is filled I think we we that we are negating our responsibility to the city if we continually allow more and more brooding on a peripheral and not concentrating on filling buildings that are empty in the central areas Thank You councillor auras sorry counselor who second to that motion you did counsel I was very public spoken Bokan thank you and yet counsel we should speak for the motion against motion you can store some are there further comment all in favor of the motion against motion carry item 9.1 three councillors on page 142 the combined amendment C 193 and planning permit application 201 6-2 6-9 for the development of a second supermarket in ship of north there is a motion on page serene on page 143 or recommendation Giovannetti and a seconder please councillor orizari careful Jim and Eddie Thank You mr. mee obviously submission similarity of the submission suit 192 193 ago to be dealt with the same Planning hearing later this month than the motion is of the recommendation is that we 're moving is the with regard to submissions received for amendments e1 line 3 to the greater Sheppard and planning scheme and planning permit application to go one six two six nine council Note Council of position outlined in this report for referral and presentation to an independent planning panel and note the council officers may exercise discretion to best achieve the general position adopted by council this is a procedural motion more than anything else so the medic so council officers have some direction when they go to the planning hearing Thank You counselor counselor is very I think to me any council wishing to speak against the motion oh you against another motion council of it okay councils for a summer I just want to make it clear that I 'm for this because I want to really analyze the arguments from this at some point I know that there 's been a lot of division in the community and a lot of many many signatures on the petition if we were to refuse this application we 'd have to have pretty strong grounds in which to do so I do not want this to get to VCAT and our arguments are populist our arguments a week and it 's overturned a vCard and a cost ratepayers 100,000 and the supermarkets built anyway we really need to get all the information and be really objective and do what 's best for our municipality and ratepayers Thank You councillor council speak against for council just like any closing comments Oh mr. white said thank you all in favor against sorry cancers it 's on page 165 online counselors item 9.1 for the river Connect strategic plan for 2017 to 2022 on page I 'll probably be giving you long pages I 'll get the electronic version in front of me here on page 166 I think there 's a recommendation that I 'm down to the movers emotion counselor 160 hard 160 on a second to please counselor summer counselor peasant yes I 'm very proud of this document there 's a lot of people has put an awful lot of work into it been doing impressive work both I 've been working on for several months this is basically River connects roadmap for the next four years or identifies the things we want to work towards we 've identified our top priorities is build more resilient accessible River environment which will include boat ramps and access pontoons inspire the education sector that 's very big for everyone that 's involved in River Connect we have a great asset running right at the back vessels we sit here and so many people don 't know what 's down there they don 't know the value that we have that what that River is worth to us so it 's so unusual I still and we 'll get to the stage one day when it will be respected the way it should be I still believe you know you could get rid of all blood pressure medication and Shepherd and if you ever paddle a new person and you look in the world we need to engage the community which is what we concentrate on it 's not about it sorry it 's not working I 'm doing half of those engaging the community is a very big one that 's a part of the education process and letting people see what is down there if you want to protect something you 've got to educate people and show them what it is and this is what it 's about and prove the health and well-being of the river there 's another very important thing we 're working on major projects our consultation come to the top six projects and the main one is construction of the shared path network we start this year there 's money in issues budget for the planning of the gimel swamp kids town path which has just got so rich in history you will not believe it when it completed that first one and there 's a master plan of all among this five to be done in the next five years we 're looking forward to that being degraded they need some tender loving care upgrading access is a very big one the weed it is really difficult to get down and have a look sometimes platypus viewing platforms and that sort of thing is what we 're looking at people don 't realize is colonies are platypus 200 meters away from us here and it 's under under under explored under you close we really want to work on illegal dumping and that is a big thing that everyone 's conscious of we want to basically try and find out where that rubbish is coming from there 's you get a flood you look at the bridge it 's just covered with litter we need to identify so we can then target different aspects of where that rubbish is coming from and if we can do that we have a real good chance of cutting it down and of course your East Bank like which is a poor moment can just make a note that councillor David Eddie has let them carry on I 'm not going to talk about actually good time it 's time some more no no she 's fine thank you just heard it all before please Bank like now would you like extra time would you like extra time but your time is up counselor you want to go so camp counselors are we happy to let counsel yes continue on we were to stop top again we spanked like counselor former mayor Dobson 's pet project hundred auspices River Connect now and we 're looking forward to work on that and we certainly want to encourage the aboriginal culture events and develop them I have a period of time so I 'd highly recommend it for those that don 't know River Connect is funded by Council and the same a jointly and we have about twelve membership partners involved so it 's a really good program thank you highly recommended good thank you council Patterson council center start by say going to Tandy who I dari I was just gonna say I 've never heard counselor Patterson speak for so long on one issue and it is I can confirm that his passion for this is a hundred percent committee for a few years now and he 's the current chair and I remember once we ended up in a canoe you I think together are going down that river and the diversity astounded me this is something new for me again council gives you these opportunities but the people in the public really have to make the effort to do it themselves and he 's pointing out Jon counselor summit is note the reintroduction of councilor jevetta to the room thank you carry on please come with the wildlife birds down there apparently migrate from other countries there 's lizards on route yeah well River Connect do tours for they have an emphasis on child education you can take them along to see sugar gliders turtles all sorts of wildlife that we really don 't realize we 've turned our back to the river and we really need to start realizing what is on our doorstep is the only people who go down there generally people who are already converted or people who want to dump rubbish and that 's just terrible there 's it 's really making and nobody likes to see that it 's lazy if you have a trailer big enough and you have enough petrol to get to the river to dump your things you can take them to the transfer station and some of that 's recyclable and some of that 's free dumping there is no excuse and we 're going to be really cracking down on that through a campaign on River connects Thank You Council somehow any councillor wishing to speak against the motion for the motion I 'm just very quickly really sorry I wanted to add to it that I had damn it up with some of the Aboriginal community in recent times and the discussion on the opportunity for tourism down there our well known local Aboriginal representative one of them uncle I can 't give you sooner office but spend some time about chatting about the opportunity you know and the people he is tight they are taking down there and showing our River I think there 's a really great opportunity to expand on that and obviously this is part of that so supporting that speak for against motion that being said council Patterson would you like to extend on your tolerance unfortunately council never lost been really you sitting here at I 've already you can catch Thank You Carol Patterson that being the case all in

submitters to be have it here I 'll move that Standing Orders be suspended to allow services view it we have a second done as far as re all in favor against fashion carry that done we 'll be in tonight 's proceedings by introducing the first party to present or submit for our council funded from before I do that I 'll just could be give us give everyone some quick rules every speaker has ten minutes to actually make their submission heard at the 9-minute mark will be a bell inaudible bell but we want you to have one mil F so could you please limit our patience to that ten minutes we have a number to get through so we will hopefully get through them nice and seamlessly so they 'll call long tourney long first honey okay you 're speaking on behalf thank you bread your time doesn 't start until you sit down a sensor in the c- you have the floor Thank You mayor Councillor CEO and staff ladies and gentlemen my name is pre Hutchins association commonly referred to as the GSB a the geosphere blog take this opportunity to present to counsel in relation to the solution for redevelopment with the Shepherd and sports stadium and and have it included in the strategic plan mind we 're going to hand out a vision document that we 've had prepared so if you feel like to view that at your leisure we 're going to summarize that document now at one minimum attend to that by way of dot points and choose the time factor that we 've got basically the Shepherd in sports stadium was erected in 1970 with the two original ports and to further cords were built in 1993 and that 's where we can 't withstand the four courts the the GSB a has approximately 1700 registered members with a forecast membership of approximately three and a half thousand for the year 2027 these figures again that I 've documented in that vision document we 've experienced substantial growth since 2012 the approximate increase of around 83 percent that 's from a regional Victoria average we 're about 2.5 times higher at a maximum with regard to the availability of court space with our current facility which means we we can 't grow any any larger than what we are from a domestic situation which means our week-to-week running with local youth and also adults using the facilities the tspa runs several basketball events throughout the year with an estimated economic return to the greater shipment of around nine million dollars in total with each event generating approximately 1.3 million in economic value to the greater Sheppard an area in recent times we 've had to turn down major basketball events due to the lack of availability of courts which not just impacts the GSP open it impacts to greater Sheppard here it industry standards have determined the average in regional Victoria to be one call to per six and a half thousand or six thousand seven hundred people unfortunately our current ratio is in the vicinity of one per sixteen thousand seven hundred people is fairly long it 's well above above the average although there are 17 individual courts in the greater shepherding area the majority of these are offer very limited and suitability is an issue with to run our regular competitions we finally we can 't utilize those sports plus they 're also isolated from the shiverman box sports daily in addition to sorry an additional two courts are considered an urgent priority which is consistent with the sports stadium feasibility study that was conducted by Warren green consulting in 2014 however expected growth will see the two courts being outgrown I would imagine prior to the project being completed if completed the sports stadium is situated at the main entrance to the original Sports precinct which is just seeing the final stages of a 21 million dollar redevelopment or sure you 're well aware of it however I would expect that the sports stadium being redeveloped would bring that facility up to the current high standard that we 're seeing throughout that precinct here the main points said that I 've raised for the redevelopment of sports stadium a lot of want to open it up to you if you have any questions of me or gspr councils we would ask questions to clarify any of questions if you want to clarify some of the points that we made but it 's not open to debate or general discussion does that mean you know I don 't know I was just going to ask one question if I could through you mr. mayor just in relation to the requirement for two courts which are an urgent requirement that 's based upon 2014 report is that the latest report they have in relation to requirements yes the other issue that I wanted to clarify with you in terms of the ratio the industry standards of one quarter for 6,500 people can district notify the figure that it 's currently sitting at now president views 1 in 16,000 750 is figure that 's been determined by the author of that vision document thank you to me councillor Hazen with you a 2014 report you say indicated the need for another 2 chords I 'm sure there was a range of other recommendations came with the you want to give us a quick summary of what else was recommended there was recommendation in relation to the use of other that those facilities to the Shepherd and sports precinct [Music] certainly made it difficult for us to to operate our current Association organisation or there was a number of other recommendations and I can 't the key recommendation is redevelopment in two extra cords true yes good any other questions councillors nope thanks for your time great thank you very much [Music] good the next person we have coming up to the megasoma she 's Darrin apps down you 're here thank you welcome thank you very much for the opportunity BR presented a like they also introduce us are on Darren Labs are part of the executive masters who in group also Glenn Gipson and also we 've got with us today rod Jackson who 's Dalton belly district our swimming president by Glenn and I have a long term members of the and and they 've been using the Aqua news pool for forty years with wins so also just want to note that our submissions actually for budget submission for 1718 rather than the council plan submission pretty just suggested clarify that our submission is for supplementary the submission also has supporting letters from the ship and swimming car club and also the flat phone swimming farmer club so just to start out we 're very appreciative for the money that 's already been spent on the pool in recent times with the solar eating also the blankets also there 's some money being spent to upgrade the diving box for the forthcoming swimming championships and January 2018 however whether the solar heating and blankets that the temperature can still the poor can be still be variable and not provide necessary patient to extend the swimming season so the supplementary heating is to provide a consistent pool temperature and we 're not looking anything outrageous sort of 25 to 27 degrees so I guess we 're realists we 're not looking for we understand you 're looking for a new pool we 're just looking to maximize the use of the existing 50 meter pool there are a number of regional centers at the moment that are upgrading and replacing a putting new 50 meter headed indoor pools in Bendigo Ballarat with nagato Algren and sale to have competing demands for their funds and such as Sam the stadium which we 've just heard so we feel our request to increase the utilization of the existing pool is a reasonable one to add to the way of the request to cancel to upgrade the chain our upgrade for the upgrade sorry to request is that the change room gels and toilets and recently just been operated at the pool also which were fresh booked so you know again extending the season by increase in though Paul having more variable one more consistent one insert is important so the funds for the probability we understand have been included in previous budgets and master plans and have been either deferred or dropped out so we believe the works can be easily designed and and delivered within the 1718 budget period our estimates 150,000 for the capital costs for the heating and assumes our installation would be done by council there are also other products out there that such as cogeneration they could achieve the same thing and obviously the swimming clubs would be happy to to work with Council submission are we you know its previous pool surveys and reviews that have consistently highlighted that the variability of pool temperature has been an issue the outside pull typically opens for bid Dave ember encloses by the end of March so you know utilization is about five months in the year we believe with a pool bidding that could expend this by two months either side of the season so you would actually get nine months in the year to substantiate this Bendigo with heating it 's mid September to mid May which provides nine months bending at least is actually heated and also open all year round so in the other I guess the other issue is when the outdoor pool actually closes the swim clubs come back ins into the indoor pool reducing the number of viable wanes this quite often the start of every season the course is a little conflict and people get into their routines also the swim lanes in the indoor pool were narrower so it does provide challenges for for the swimming clubs we also believe the project has the wider benefits will to attract country and master Championships to the area and one of their key reform it is reliable temperature also other competitions and carnivals so we believe it 's a small investment council and makes good sense and it provides for greater utilization of existing council asset which we reuse and and very much appreciate so on and so that 's all i have to listen something else good very much thank you down stay there for a moment there might be some questions that we need to be asked now castle virtual thank you go thank you that brings to a close our two presenters for the council plan submissions that being done I need a motion front of the council to resume standing orders versus two Bonetti twelve a seconder please counselors very all in favor against motion carried Standing Orders now resumed also council you have a recommendation on page 3 of our agendas I mean either Council to move that recommendation that the council on our will reduce at receiver note the written and verbal submissions in response to the public advertisement of the draft council submissions and the adoption of the council plan 2007 92020 1,000 bill on tuesday 24 June 2017 at 30 p.m. the council boardroom so Chancellor summer are you just reading on page 3 to

that all the submitters should be thanked for the yes indeed Thank You counsel move the second they were happy to be a point two point three actually be making ten we 're all happy with our cutters so the omission of emotion counsel someone will be page three plus point free that all participants being cordially things organization okay so the seconder for that motion councils I guess only your do should speak to the motion councils are sorry counselor Abdul are you second did it that 's right you just put your hands in did you want to speak to that counselor do I know and you know any counsel wish to speak against this motion now carried there are counselors our leader another counsel to the motion to suspend Standing Orders once again as Peter on page six councillor hazel Mandela was amended the last Midlands to be do this second to place counselor is very sorry counselor is very we should speak to a counselor hazel and counselors very all in favor oh sorry any council with just being against their no that one favor against right now I 've being done I 've got to call upon Willis Scott oh yes Venice is here thank you well Congrats I 'm here representing residents of refuge our Carmela in regard to Rocky 's bridge [Music] I 'll stir some again here as a representative the residents of revenue Java in regard to Loki 's bridge which has been closed since prior to Christmas we did have a meeting with the mayor and mr. maker in regard to that recently but we really want to emphasize the urgency of getting that bridge reopened there was a discussion of refurbishment or the cost of replacing it was exorbitant with that that we 're concerned about we didn what type of structure they 're going to put in whether they 're just going to put the same in as it is now they did mention about increasing the load limit from 3 tons of 10 tonne and that what sort of structure they would need to do that with as the bridge had previously been lowered below Road level and that needs to be brought up to Road level otherwise you 've got extra weight being applied to that when any vehicle goes on it or offered which can cause more maintenance problems with the structure and the regard to railings or what they 're going to put in we 're not sure last time they put in green planking creep across the things which all buckled which makes it very rough some of those things have been replaced the structure underneath was very much altered when they did it they took out a square beam from underneath sitting on the square close and put in a round one which has fractured which they 've put strapping on which is now broken it just doesn 't because you a round and the underneath you 're only going to have the weight across the top of that round piece and across the bottom the rest it 's not flexible won 't take the low limit our other concern is that it needs to be done urgently as we can we 're on the north side of the bridge and we can be cut totally off if the floodwaters come up on the road and on what 's road and through to meruna which is our only access at the moment to go in and out and that is quite commonly known that that road does get flooded and we have people living there who have to go out to Shepherd them around or in other places for work there is people that have business contracts that they have to fulfill and we also have students doing VCE in this area plus tape college if they can 't get out to do their work or to do their exams because of we cut off because of floodwater this can cause quite significant stress for them free children whether it 's bridge be done very quickly before the rains really set in we realize that this won 't be passed and or instigated until the 1st of July but we recommend that the done urgently prior to the rain water 's coming or spring water 's coming down from the snows when they leave release order from the Weir 's literally be winter and so fall because this will cause disruption not to us but also to any work that is to be done on the bridge as it would cause a health and safety issue we do have elderly people out there or so and if we needed medical attention if the roads cut off we cannot get medical attention if they have a severe fire house fire or something else or an accident out there we cannot get the CFA through cannot get ambulances through to be able to meet those needs in a letter that I received from Council they suggested that we make our own emergency plans but that might be a little bit difficult for us to call in a helicopter if we need a an to get us e s in to forget firefighters in because they said in that city if it was in a situation like that they would leave a truck out there a tanker but they still have to come and operate it so we still need some assistance to get the firefighters in which could be too late if there happen to be a fire so this is quite considerably affecting this part of your community and we haven 't really heard what type of structure that they 're aiming to put in in into this bridge also we would urge that the named lobbies preach very kind we don 't want that to be lost the little boy that drowned there maybe six years ago so we want that retained yeah we 're still affected still because of the bridges tires we 're still affected without them we cannot get our mail delivered it we have to come to vanilla Road and as it said we have an elder elderly people out there who cannot drive into Shepherd and and have to rely about the people to get it the vanilla Road post office because the school leadership as I 've said which is urgent for BC students and the bridge so I think even the opportunity to speak to you again ask for your urgent attention to that for us thank you glance and your counsel I wishing to ask any questions Bruce mr. Scott just for my own edification how many residents reside on the drive there 's eight homes out there I 'm not sure how many to each one count I would actually happen out of them but this gentleman here has seven children one 's doing busy and he has a business that he has to be able to get in and out to attend to this is mr. comer Joseph come on he has a son doing tote there 's other students at school of course so it 's urgent for him to go get this road please so actual numbers sorry but right now is it my favorite agent wrong yeah Thank you Thank You counselors thank you guys thanks [Music] Julian grant Jillian here just because the you are is well my name is Jillian green I 'm speaking to a submission in support of the 100000 in the draft budget the Australian Botanic Garden Sheridan I am the current president of the Friends of the Australian Botanic Garden Chevrolet incorporated known as fares for three of our members are here tonight in support of the submission they are higher higher than Sandra those is an independent body which works closely with the council section 86 committee for the gardens the Australia Botanic Gardens committee I 'm also a member of that committee purpose works with the committee to maximise the development of the gardens and this includes making the budget allocation go as far as possible every year they support the development of the Australian tannic Gardens by providing assistance assistance in the establishment and maintenance of the gardens and in many other ways with five years development a lot has been achieved and is plenty to see of the gardens walks through the bush always something blooming and the only Helen Sheppard this is great place for people to exercise I emphasized in the pedis submission the high standards signage installed to continue with and to maintain these standards and deliver further gardens and public facilities continuing continued funding is required your Botanic Gardens are currently hosting school and kindergarten clubs walking groups tourists from interstate snows these ship access groups little ads across country and the local law group the new entry road name Botanic Gardens afternoon has definitely generated interest the allocation of 100,000 will allow for the progressive development of the gardens over the next 12 months paying and costing and funding for particular projects is prepared by the council committee while in advance at the start of the financial year so the current plan for the next 12 months is reliant on the 100,000 funding the value to the greater Shepherd in City Council and the local community is well above the funding allocated each year working bees work for the doll with CVG T who are on site most working days and a he 'll is spent by volunteers research and plants infrastructure items etc being that for every 1 allocated in the budget the council receives 3 value of work done this project it is capped tip site and can now be utilized by many people the aims include using recycled products wherever possible this is being achieved and also wherever possible local firms are contracted for infrastructure works or on other site works and purchases are made from local firms wherever possible feds continue to research and apply for grants which could be utilized for this project this is an activity which is extremely time consuming however this year we have successfully obtained two smaller grants one enabling the purchase of a trailer to replace one which you 've been on loan and young explorers grant binoculars rubber back rubs magnifying glasses and other items for an outdoor classrooms currently applications have been submitted for two much larger the results are not out later this year the aim of the section 86 committee with the support of folks for the 2017-18 financial year is to complete the entry walk garden to further development of the children 's nature play space a contribution to the establishment of temporary toilets on-site these toilets are coming from Deakin Reserve and this project is reliant on on-site interpretive signage directional signage and planted identification staining plaintiff identification signage we aim to obtain landscape concept designs for the next three games from the honeysuckle rose master plan and the gardens are the indigenous land management garden explorers garden and the clearing these three Gardens will take up half the remaining area on honeysuckle rise and then only leave one quarter of the top of the mound to be designed and delivered depending on funding work may commence from one of these new Gardens further development of these three guns will not occur until the budget for the 2018 19 financial year is allocated an amount of 100,000 for that you allow noticeable progress however a large allocation will go a long way towards completion of the development of the master plan we thank the garden the we thank the council for their commitment to the livery too late to date of these gardens and also thank them in anticipation of continuing support remember that this is your unique project in the midst of an urban area it 's a tourist destination and a way utilized community asset in closer before you before you go away Joe sorry maybe a couple of questions possibly and it may not be as well they go thank you [Music] I think our next presenter he 's in here a few shuttles at 20 if he doesn 't appear in the next 15 or 20 minutes will slot Terry in after but I know tell us boys here tell us welcome I 'm Dallas I 'm just representing of queries what about the rights and the right setting just for the ball of a closing Kevin Ivanov I suppose just going through the budget this year are just old nine point two point six missing from the budget if you go to face 66 to read further there that 's missing but I got mainly one of the concentrate on your rate setting you go to seven point five page 46 here you you your land values gone up by 121 million dollars from 6 1917 to 78 and I I wasn 't sure how that was of my mind pressure words that the those land values of based on the 1st subdivisions and whatever I couldn 't work out how the 121 million was increased that was one person I there are no exclude dancers off-the-cuff sort of thing and my concern was that there go write system everything was capped at 2% you know so ever as I 've gone through so you 're generalizing page 45 there are capped at 2 percent and then referred to essential service commission how Kansas set their rates and so the table in here that says you know how the rates are set to do your average rate kappa genesis total annualized revenue levied from general rates municipal charges and any other describe rates and charges on arrival properties within the council district so when i referred to our page 7 point 7 on page 46 your municipal charges up going to avoid 2.3 percent on to the capping of the 2% so I suppose I 'd I 'd like that look better stuff why that hasn 't been capped at 2% you know it all comes down to rate payers caucus and the other thing was you know the waste and recyclables meant to be capped at 2% that middlee in this document it says they 're done you know wasters racing charges currently excluded so the current looks good from the cap revenue based on selling at a time before they will be capped or you know if these excessive charges are passed on the rate pays you know there 'd be no reason why it shouldn 't be captain 2% and you know they seem to be excessive charges on top of we 're already seen in paying extra above other councils in the area I referred to your own strategic resource plan page six and your greater shipment if your rates compared to early values and greater shipping point seven four percent similar councils such as Beltre 2002 long 0.64% and all other councils 0.47% they 're small figures but when you analyze them we 're 13.5 percent higher than been ago Colorado and for the same volume property so if you 're paying 2,000 in Bendigo for the property you 're actually paying appears to be paying two thousand two hundred seventy dollars in Shevin so I couldn the similar price property and then when you look at all other councils for 36mm point five percent higher than all other cancers which doesn 't seem to be very fair and it probably needs to be addressed that that 's why I can work out we 're not capping at the two percent we 're already on a higher base so how can these other cancers operate with these lower revenue basis is there some concern there and should we be addressing why we are increasing our rates so so drastically compared to other councils of similar dimensions and in particular all other councils are a 36.5% less for the same valued property it doesn 't seem very fair to our rate if I like myself or others Logan to so I suppose that 's not my major concern that the rate capping why we 're not running wither two percent or even less than two percent because as clearly we 're getting charged or other than other councils for the same billion problem I can we weren 't here when we began the proceedings you 've got 10 minute bill just so you know what time you 've got limited obviously you 've got a few other point you need to address there 's all the other local off-script Sonex point is athene performance indicators let 's just wondering where they 're recorder or published in particular i was interested to see about the cable ties you promoted promoted economic growth you KBO as the AVN 's and I wasn 't sure how they attract all now they have measured and look and your other kv theis because you know trending ami it 's a very fluid system when you analyze them spc too close then you lose 188 to sole traders could open up a neck the same day and your ABN show of positive figures so that that raises concerns it 's like you know you 're spending a good five billion in this area so you know shouldn 't be tracking maybe job growth probably sale prices and populations rather than APNs because you know it 's very easy to you know this is a it doesn 't give a true reflection of a economy not being tracked at a European a correct manner how do we know this money being spent wisely I 'll wrap it up there then there are two questions I have now you 're still got time you better further till three minutes at least yep if you need more time that 's I just look at those they 're all right thank you for that any questions counsels any clarification questions Dallas one moment it may be some council 's new task now all right good thank you so councils will just have to work to pull our thumbs for a short period of time until the next presenter arrives talk amongst yourselves could host mr. Muir can i clarify in terms of the timing connected person that 's at 20 and the time now is 00 30 or six twelve I 'm a concealer just adjourn the meeting but yes you think just one moment casts are as well we 're just looking up the exact to have true stories you standing orders to do that so under the counselors who remove to resume standing orders counselors very counselor is very of course not counselor Sutton all in favor of resuming standing orders against motion carried now having said that I need a motion to adjourn okay to have a counselor wishing to move a motion to adjourn the meeting for 15 minutes counselors very second done counsel Sutton cancer I was very you wish to speak to that counsel Sutton anyway against we should you speak to it counselor I was wearing no I was no ID required okay Boyd favor or I 'll general meeting for 15 minutes thank you mister me _"

    "text": "Thank You counselors our next presenter is here well that hasn 't been quite 15 minutes we 're all happy to resume the meeting good thank you very much now Terry welcome thanks very much mr. mayor and council it down one moment soldier very shame Stan you came out of standing orders finding resumes down here 's a motion that we cancel I was very moving the motion to rejuvenating orders Chancellor Hazen seconded the suspense daddy suspended sorry mr. Hayslip yes counselor no comment to that all in favor period thank you now Terry thanks very much much Jeremy and hello to everybody I assume you 've all got my submission in relationship to funding of Tia Park we just want to make clear now I 'm not representing the Ventura Community Plan committee here at this meeting I think Carl Walters or someone 's coming along a little bit later to do that I 'm just representing you know this is just my immune system as a member of the community so I 'll basically be reiterating what I have said but as you may be aware by council in 2003 and that and that plan was we started preparation of that in 1998 and we conducted an enormous amount of community consultation and engagement prior to that that approval being put in place over the following four years some key features of that approved were constructed so that was that was all sort of done under the auspice of revitalization committee at this particular point in time then in 2010 the teacher a community plan committee was formed and the whole that program was prepared and again it indicated that the number one priority it 's number one prize from the Turturro community was the the landscape management plan from Atia Park and its implementation following a chaos and decision or direction further consultation was carried out by the teacher a community plan steering committee in 2012 that again included extensive community engagement that plan basically was the same or had a couple of additions the aerosol but the nor was consultation was again carried out in that done that plans never been approved so it was submitted to Council in 2012 has never been approved have been implemented on either our selves works and and the toilet block last year but basically we cannot go any further with the implementation of that plan because of access to fig tract land I 'll come back for that in a minute as I said the implementation of the plan still remains the community 's number one priority as detailed in the latest community plan 2015 the existing ell landscape plan comprises the following features increases the size of pristine park and improved playground equipment tuturro has no major playground equipment there are bits and pieces scattered with the school all around the place but the other some minor minor playground equipment in McTeer Park but really the new the new plan actually has enhanced playground equipment and also tuneage playground equipment which is very important there 's provision of an amphitheater conditions to improve outdoor entertainment potential so what we 'd be doing be raising the area as part of the plan which will look down on the Rotunda and make that the center of the park itself it involves the relocation of the skatepark and what was the first skate park in the city before the one at Victoria Park lake and it was always intended that we actually enhance that and move it to another location and to Lambor I think we 're going to get the get out our skate park unfortunately the skate park is still lived can 't_''_286.47 be shifted until we actually quite a big track land it 's not in a very prominent position and as far as I 'm concerned it 's not in a safe position for a skate park it 's hidden around the back and we really should have it in a more prominent position as it 's shown in the landscape management plan right opposite police station the intersection that big track land is currently occupies is extremely dangerous this new works would include roundabouts as I said the skatepark bus parking and so forth and would improve the safety of that currently at the moment school buses pull up on that side morning and night pick kids up it 's quite dangerous and hopefully no one know as we heard this stage but it children it will also eliminate unkept land right in the heart of town this has been vacant this land since council relinquished the lease the Vic tract in about the commissioners did it in 1995 John Gray will probably correct beyond that point but I think since that time it 's been relinquished back to victory we would also have additional car parks which are desperate need for the park and also for the RSL so as you 're aware we can 't proceed until we 've acquired the Vig track land it is not it is known that the track land has some environmental issues that are hindering negotiations over future ownership council representation has been recently undertaken and took five months for the state government to respond it wasn 't terribly good and the gain that had to be followed up on two or three occasions so it might be a slight chance to actually move this forward previously we 've been in this same position over the last fourteen years three times who have advised representations that council has and and ministers have made representations to Vic but really hasn 't gone anywhere it hasn 't been given a priority meanwhile the Vic tracked land in question remains a blight on it that you 're a community and if it has environmental risk to the community as is used for a large community uses including a school boat cough or is used continually unchecked in a letter from Ben Needham general manager property from Vic track on the fourteenth of the 1st 2014 he advised that the site could be used for public open space and a road and that the risks on the site are small right so they 've already indicated that the site is appliques ok for what we want to do what we we we we as a gain or repeat we want to complete it so that we can enhance only pristine Park make improvements to road safety relocation of the skatepark to a safer location and general utilization revitalization of our business district is clearly wanted and sought for many years I 've been involved in this process since of the inception and I 'm most disappointed that the extension of land is again unfunded there 's been negotiations and questions about what costs are involved in this and they 've range from forty seven thousand dollars to seven hundred and forty seven thousand dollars I think fig track think it must be in Bourke Street completion of the McTeer Park landscape master plan has been not community 's number one pride for fourteen years it should be funded accordingly and I suggest that we make allowance for funds in 1718 budget to pursue to purchase that land once we have actually negotiated its transferred but at the end of this councils got to give this a priority I understand Peters made representations I understand your net pal made representations I think Susanna Sheen made some representations in Parliament the other day right about this very issue but we haven 't followed it through council has not bit the bullet on this one it is our number one priority has been for 14 years I don 't know how much the community has got to do they write reports put it in number one priority and you fund something else we you had a petition you put lights outside the budget you put lights around Victoria Park right that 's a good project right but the owner how many people signed a petition maybe a hundred to under 300 for one or whatever well 3600 bibbling datura made this the number one priority for it through an enormous commitment to do so so if you can actually honor whether you can do it with sand seeking to go around the minister to get the minister to waive some plan issues you know one minute tearing right out good no and they 'd be more than that but we if we put the priority into this we can do it so all I 'm going to say to you as it is a number one priority we want to get a funder I 've been associated with for 14 years we 're getting a bit sick and tired of it we need to be able to move it forward thanks very much thanks Ari thanks B time you questions counselors just a quick one Terry your motivation for being here tonight your tackling the big track I know I keep track a different way I know that you knew that the chair is very frustrated we open the barbecue the other day and and basically getting moved on that community plan I 've got and jump ahead of the master fear nothing that happened that whole area so there 's a couple things have happened even though master plans happen so you 're suggesting we should tackle Vick track harder or what are you actually oh yeah this is it 's ministerial-level if you go the surface of this thing is okay we understand some hydrocarbons down below there used to be a service station on there years ago just bit like a service station up where Sam 's going to sit right same sort of thing as the one intact leak hopefully yours doesn 't look right but you know we 've got a situation so what we 're going to do this can be a waiver the put what we want is not a problem it 's if the if the groundwater at 4 meters or 5 meters depth has for government to waiver that accepted consequences if it 's going off side right and there 's a lot of testing being undertaken so it 's a ministerial ticket to pick this and give the land or some sort of minimum cost to Council to move forward on this from my point of view you 've got to put really put the hammer down on this one good think thanks Terry that 's it Thanks putting the hammer down now you wouldn 't want to cause us back now the level of hydrocarbons Hwacheon problem nothing let 's go Sydney minutes so counselors with about six or seven minutes to the next presenter the web piacere making you 'll be seeing me quietly to wait is [Music] [Music] No councils by my white shirt we 're very close to the time for the next presentation so rocky D 'Agostino rocky you 're here to present welcome nothing to draw rocky you have to have 10 minutes obviously an online match I will not take you 're sure we 're looking forward to last at the 9-minute mark will be a problem wrong tip go through um I 'm here to present an objection from the Local Government Association to Association incorporated and its regard to the greater Sheppard City Council budget for 2017 that 's what the two survey 2018 my name is rocky D 'Agostino and i 've been delegated to present the association 's objection to the counselors at this meeting the Association refers to the differential rate in section 161 brackets to brackets a brackets by brackets double line of the Local Government Act and the mandatory of the legation the council has clearly identified the objectives of the differential rate and just distinguished the exact purpose for the differential rate within the area of stipulated on page 54 and 57 of the council draft document this will demonstrate how the rates for page 54 and 57 are different between other industrial commercial areas in the municipal the associations have taken advise in the draft budget that shows it does not meet the Australian account accounts as these standards which would be based on an open transparent or accountable the Association is therefore able to fully understand brackets one brackets the brackets F brackets tree of the local government acts which supports you associations projection to this drug budget the council states at the bottom of page 44 of our draft budget that the commercial improved one land and industrial improved one land provides unequal the ship and show me tax but does not declare the amount in the draft budget document the Association understands this as a breach of junior care by counsel the Association has attempted to establish the amount of money the children showing section 86 committee will be trusted with in this financial year draft draft project in doing so the association has made a number of assumptions in arriving at a figure below as a drop i just does not stipulate any amount that the shipment show me committee will receive we begin with commercial improved land one and the industrial and and one on on page 45 of the draft budget we used the raid wall amount of 9 million 320,460 from the 217 percent rate stipulated on page 54 which we have seven million seven hundred thirty five thousand nine one weight which leaves one million five hundred eighty four thousand four hundred sixty one dollars for the Chevelle in showing campaign we also started with three hundred three million six hundred thirty thousand eight hundred fourteen dollars for industrial model and we again take away the stipulated four percent from the two hundred and four percent which results in a figure of three million four hundred eighty-five thousand five hundred and eighty one dollars which leaves one hundred forty five thousand through two hundred thirty two dollars and fifty cents for the ship and a showman campaign we 've added both those amounts together to that equates to 1 million seven hundred twenty-nine thousand seven hundred and one dollar cents which the Association understands is the shiverman show me budget allocation now could any counsel indicated that is the correct figure rocky we 're not here to answer any questions where he charts for since your submission okay well any questions you need answered for more clarity you can point to we 'll make an appointment to get those answers okay on that basis the Association understands that the in the budget it also will be negligent if it do not direct the members of the set of section 86 committee to use the taxes still collected by the council and entrusted to the committee to carry out the function Judy that is the underlying purpose viable governor for the differential rate we request that the council amend the draft budget to accurately represent the requirements of our Government Act and the ministerial diet guidelines in an open transparent and accountable drive document that is why submission thank you thank you rocking out before you before you leave any questions any clarifications needed but any councillors thanks for thank you it 's we have a better 5 min of white councils for the next presenter submitter [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] through the new housing development along demangone road so council can look at that particular errors you know Dharan god road is being developed that there is a scope through quite a bit more development along now both darvon road and around the surrounds of the of the township as well in addition to that that their most Minister for transport to say that Vick track has now been directed to deal with council we have struggled to get anything out of it track in terms of acquiring the land directly opposite McTeer Park on the western side for those of you that know it it 's just a barren wasteland at the moment still school kids assemble there in the morning to to catch buses to school but it 's something that we want to see developed as part of McTeer parkland at this particular point in time natural enough we don 't have an answer out of the track but we are hoping the council will start to put some funding toward the actual purchase of that land and the development of that land and we 're looking at around about two hundred thousand dollars if that could be a consideration for budget one of the things that you that we have finally achieved through the minister is that they have been directed to speak with Council which is the first time we 've seen any movement from big truck at all that didn 't come you would certainly keep that one in mind that is be fantastic the other one that we really want to focus in on is the chattering museum refurbishment program now for those that don 't know this is one of the most significant collections in Australia particularly with dating back to the to the Second World War German and Italian memorabilia and data and so forth from the detention camps and to chair Museum is a fabulous Museum that has as much of these materials but they are aging it 's very difficult for the volunteers that manage the facility to keep them in a condition whereby they will last lot longer the collection is about to be Heritage listed which you may or may not be aware and if we 're going to have it era to list than we do need to see a significant improvement in their capacity to store those items there was a typo in the original letter if you made send them from Carl so the volunteers themselves have raised nearly eighteen thousand dollars towards this refurbishment of the storage areas and display areas from forty nine thousand now the quotes that the his the Historical Society to Jeremy 's M committee have would get would be very close to the total spend if we about eighty thousand together with 149 but it is getting very close and it is something that we would ask you to consider place when it comes to your you know future considerations regarding the budget the thing that I would leave you with as I said at the beginning is that we are representational to cheer we do a lot of work we have a lot of discussion around what our key priorities are it 's a fabulous town but the thing that we must we feel we must have is that we must be seen to be relevant within the teachers so that when we have a priority list that we are we do advertise that particularly at archery community markets that we have it 's very important the townspeople see that what we do prioritize what we do advertisers look what is the direction in which council allocates funds if we have success in this area particularly with with the new people who have moved particularly in around the Golf Estate we 're really doing our best to engage there as well as so we do represent pretty much all of the groups around the township if there are any other questions I 'd be happy to answer them I think what Carlos outlined there in the letter that I did make a slight modification to does spell it out fairly clearly so without anything else if there 's no other questions I 'll leave you in peace like you want any questions with a clarification sort but think of all thank you thank you very much thank you to all the presenters and submitters tonight thank you for your time and effort in coming forward so I 'm sure all councils will consider and no doubt assess what has been heard here tonight with that I need a motion from the council to reduce standing orders councillors very second to place councillor divinity councillors very Jewish desire at Casa de you wish to speak now in favor of motion against motion

Harriet item probably is a confirmation of minutes of our previous meeting the recommendation on page one fill the council wishing to move that recommendation as a motion mr. mayor the council to speak to that namsom a straightforward that 's like a no which is speak against the motion for the motion okay so two people watching I 'll just give some background really so we 're moving the recommendation yes it 's up to you you can okay that being said all in favor varied item 6.1 councilors the contract number one seven one seven provision of a panel of supplies on-site crushing of recycled concrete and bricks we have a recommendation on pastry any councils wishing to move a motion she needs me council summer seconder please councillor Giovannetti no summer the contracts worth about 1.5 million over three years an optional extension of up to two years it exceeds the CEO delegation so it 's come to us both conforming tenders were successful in this which are eco concrete crushing and local mixed quarries and they 've been recommended for us to accept them please to see that there 's a ten percent criteria assigned to local benefits that 's a recent change in our procurement policy and it 's applied to all of the tenders which is out of this contract both environmental there 's a reduction of emissions through the use of modern up-to-date equipment and also the recycling has existing waste product and that will reduce our existing stockpiles so I think it 's a little bit of housekeeping that that we need to go through Thank You Council summer any councillor sorry council juvinity would you like Miss Chancellor summers summarize that some are summarized are very well thank you and you counselor wishing to speak against this motion was for the motion Council summer any closing comments all in favor Karen we go on mr. mayor I might have got through me because I think council unity move confirmation minister previous meeting did here and what did president council person may well be wrong I wasn 't here so uh probably I 'm able to do so good well picked up counselor sorry I couldn 't quite hear you now scale freaks out if another well picked up counselor Patterson Dennis so that being said should we revisit that castle summer you second it did you know yes I could sorry so do end up alpha okay I could count for a key phrase you wish to speak to that Oh Castle sudden we 'll go through it again sorry any counsel wishing to speak against it for that Mount Isa all in favor Eric [Applause] on page eight counselors we have a recommendation regarding the greater ship in the urban forest strategy and tree management palsy so the council wishing to move that recommendation as a motion second to please I 'm our counsel O 'Keefe mister may look this is obviously a long process there 's lots to happen in his face I think it 's some a great thing that we 're going to be looking at around six thousand extra sites where we 're going to be planting I think it clean and green community is very important and I think it 's definitely heading in a great direction for greater shivanand good Thank You Council summer I 'm very pleased with this strategy we often hear complaints that Shepperton and surrounds is too flat or to concrete but this strategy will turn that commentary on its head because a community so we went out with a very detailed issues and options paper and that had extensive public consultation we receive 38 community submissions as well as held internal and external workshops there 's no planning implications around this and each precincts will have its own consultation as we move forward and the timing of the adoption is good because it will enable planting to begin almost immediately at the moment we have an 18% canopy cover and it would just be wonderful to aspire to 40% we 've seen cities like Melbourne achieves very close to that and it 's made a huge difference when our first friends the councillor used an example of improvements that could be done to Isabella Street which is one of the longest streets in Sheppard and almost devoid of trees and obviously that brought down the value of the property in that area and there were lower socio economic activity and problems because it was left so bare but a taxi driver actually told me that Isabella Street used to be a sought-after property location when it had that canopy so it our our streets and another example is about part of Koryo street which recently had trees removed to upgrade upgrade the curb in the channel and there 's an immediate difference since it 's stark reduction in amenity I mean but I 'm told that the trees are due to repair you planted very soon which is terrific but that 's an example of how much trees can impact on a on a precinct it 's not just the property values that will benefit because we 're planting trees that link with the river that will encourage bird life and native animals and what 's really pleasing is that Lois ocean of socio-economic areas will have improved natural insulation so those struggling with heating and cooling bills don 't have to pay so much and it also improves mental health by encouraging people to walk around more outside and to drive less and if you 're under the canopy of a lovely urban forest that 's likely to be one of the outcomes if I had one criticism though it 's the idea of the useful life expectancy for each their discretion and assess each trees value before it 's removed but part of me wonders if the bureaucratic best practice target of ten percent tree Renewal per decade could be an issue so this is an example it 's not going to happen I 'm assured that it 's not going to happen but if someone in an office decides that the plane tree canopy is down mordor a crow straight need to be removed due to damage curve in channel it would be tragic now I 'm sure that that will not happen and if it does it won 't be a direct result of this strategy on council summer would you like some more time yes tails was said yes council Patterson very quickly in summing up I just want to say that I 'm really impressed by the staff and especially the CEO Peter Harriette to driving this project I actually think it 's one of the most important initiatives that this council has had and it 's one everyone can hang their hat on and we all benefit from it for generations to come and be part of it Thank You Council summer any council wishing to speak against this motion any other counselor wishing to speak for the motion Abdulla requirement comment sir and they 're saying that you know the green clean and beautiful greater Shepperton is a vision that i am delighted to share with the community and our council and however i also want to know that they are trees trees that fell or died in Shepparton central locations but they have not been replaced in past few years action is vital and I am hoping that with this in strategy you know there will be more actions it is a good starting point to have an urban forest strategy but the real challenge is in its delivery and implementation I hope that annual targets that will be set out in operation plans will be regularly monitored and results will be communicated to general public and the point is that it is important to promote this strategy and its benefits to the community because not everyone is knowledgeable and interested I 'm referring mainly to the new arrivals are migrant and communicated to that community and public involvement they are buying an ownership through education and consultation process is very important so I would be very keen to see that council develop appropriate programs to involve public in the development and maintenance of our urban forest health that 's all good Thank You councillor any cancer wishing to speak against anyone else for counsel someone any closing comments OOP sorry he is like like my comment please look totally supported it has great potential there 's a lot of work going in going into the particular brand of true making curry etc there 's been talk about probably not enough consultation but it has been a consultation period and more importantly every time there is a plantation or a street way of trees being planted Philby consultation ongoing with residents regarding selection of truths I have one and it 's no reason for doubt on in event I 'm just wondering sitting here in 50 years whether our grandfather 's was like why some of those idiots and little these trees now that have dug up ground and others we were grandfather 's my pair grandkids my green hairy old man Madison would bigger MMA you won or we 're all a very would you like any closing comments and final comment I 'm actually joining some type of public awareness committee I suppose we 'd call it I 'm looking forward to that in promoting this into the community and letting them see the greater opportunity this is bringing sound ring all right thank you that being said all in favor of emotion in motion carried item 6.3 councillors on page 13 it 's to do with South down Street in Chaplin mr. mayor I 'll be more than happy to move the recommendation printed on page 13 of the agenda in councillor hazel in do I have a second second to please councillor is very councillor Hazelden I think it mr. mayor essentially the recommendation is that a temporary road closure of southbound street until the proposed sealed Road associated with development nearby is completed there 's a bit of history about about this I think it probably still is the only unsealed street in the urban area of I assume at some point but this Southdown Street when the stage one of any road upgrade was undertaken Southdown Street was nominated as the preferred detour and it had substantially increased traffic at that point of time and hindsight is wonderful but to think about it all of these properties that are drawing southbound street are on the east side prevailing winds in this area predominately from the west and the southwest and the massive increase in traffic along southbound street resulted in a very substantial dust problem for those residents and on a number of occasions I stood in residents backyard and we 've watched this great cloud of dust come across the fence it created significant nuisance and distress to the residents and they finally petition Council to do something about it we during the construction phase a vernier a we did use dust the presents we did use water tankers and all that but I think the volume of traffic there defeated those those methods so this is a very logical outcome to logical and practical outcome it 's a temporary closure until the Associated development a road that carries or is significant in terms of being required for through traffic it certainly though has created a problem for those residents I 'm sure the residents will greatly appreciate that what they 've suggested is coming to fruition Thank You councillor I was very I think this to me and I would like to add further to the comic council hazel Minh that the the design of the street has also going to be put into place so that when it 's a lot of time we can be shovel ready to go ahead and sort it all that good any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion councillor definitely hears me as we 're aware this particular rate has penis you giving a problem to the residents of that area for some time I was only recently I think up to 50 yard residents of that area submitted their objection to the continued use of South Main Street so I 'm I 'm quite confident that the residents in that area will certainly support the decision we 're about to make this for or against spoke Thank You councillor abdullah just like say that i hope that this simple temporary solution will end in inconvenience of residents that are affected by the dust issue and i know that the most economical option is temporary closure and it been agreed by the affected residents I have to confess that I had some doubts about whether this decision needed to go through the community consultation process I was however advised that it was not a policy decision rather a corrective action to address a problem faced by some community members and also a small number of vehicle is affected maybe fifty by this solution where and also an alternative route is also available hence the requirement for a broad community consultation is not there and unsatisfied with this response I hope that this simple solution with and the inconvenience of the effective decisions Thanks Thank You councillor drillin any council we should speak against the motion for the Russian Council someone yes similar to councillor Abdullah also had doubts and I do hope that we are doing the right thing I after Angie fairly also get nervous about basing our decisions on petitions without going to an expensive consultation especially in regards to closing Road but the recommendation in front of this suggests that have only be closed until such time that developers can seal the surface so it can be reopened so it 's not a permanent solution or a permanent closure and we could probably visit option 2 which is putting a dust suppressant on top if indeed the traffic movements become a problem but I 'm willing to trust the offices and the consensus of the rooms that close your won 't have a ditch will impact on the community and if it does become problematic we can always revisit it later Thank You councillor summer any councillor we can just speak against for councillors I just like make a general comment thank you and it is basically that I 'm really really glad it 's not so south down straight I find Street deserves in front of them very difficult to close I get fifty result if ten people use that storage every day which is very very minimal it to board us very basic why should we pay the seal it now and some else is going to do it for us in six months I know a little bit difficult for those people do use if I 'm sure they won 't mind putting up of the six months Thank You council about any other council wishing to speak against this all this motion now in case I may add my comments just to be to note councillors that the actual residence will still have access to the riri of their property by that road it 'll be actually closed to the general public but not to the actual owners of the properties that back onto that road so we 're clear on that that being said councillor hazel and any closing comments here thank you mr. mayor I come amongst many other differences one of the major difference between this and 300 fairly Avenue is that in fact the residents requested this one to be closed the the issue of access may well become an issue in the future design some the residents there do utilize southbound an issue come the design phase about how we provide for that access or whether we provide it at all they 'd add a frontage to Southend Street but they certainly do do about it and some already enjoy access now which is one of the reasons why the closure will still enable that access to occur so what I think this is a really good outcome it it 's fit for purpose for this particular situation I made the comment before the southbound street in terms of its functionality the people aren 't really aware of it it 's between Hawkins Street and Ford Road entity to section at either end so it 's not a non arterial road it 's not a route for people to travel on a regular basis but obviously with the the usage during the Burney road construction and was dramatically increased and a lot of that traffic has been 19 it carries far more traffic now than ever used to so I think the residents that said the outset the residents are going to greatly appreciate this outcome thank you all that being motion carried item 6.4 our contract number one seven double-o a tree establishment and planting that 's on page eighteen councillors to have the council wishing to move a motion in respect to that recommendation council summer drove a seconder please councillor is very council summer I was terrific its leading on with our urban forest strategy so we can get started in planting right away so the five-year contract valued at around about 1.7 million dollars with an optional extension of up to two years a gam local content was included in the tender process and in this case the tender has an obligation to ensure that the trees are durable and fairly advanced once handed back to Council as our asset so I really look forward to seeing the results thank you some Carol 's Laura sorry I 'd like to see them get stuck into the trees at Princess Pea thank you for those comments any council wishing to speak speak against the motion for the motion councillor Abdullah I 'm very satisfied to see the evidence that in tender process procurement policy was followed and evaluation to assess the proposals as opposed to one person 's discretion kind of decisions so it 's good to see that good governance principles that are applied in our council procurements also I 'm pleased to see advanced that there is some advanced planning for the implementation of urban forest strategy so basically this is strategy in action outsourcing of tree plantation activity will free up staff time on section customer service risk management and also they 'll be able to spend more time on formative pruning pruning need in the first three two years three first two three years that 's what that 's that 's what was elaborated during a briefing so I just hope that this will be done across the municipality and it will not be limited to bigger towns any council we should speak against for council summer any closing comments hold in favor of the motion against motion carried item six point five councillors we have a recommendation on page twenty one proposed discontinuance of part of future court Shepperton to have a council wishing to move on the recommendation for councillor is very 's very Thank You mr. mayor it 's all contained therein the recommendation effectively it 's tidying up of a planning issue and this rule if this recommendation is possible my fellow councillors it 'll effectively put the bed a minor glitch sir nothing I can usefully add anything further to it Thank You councillor Sutton names what they said it 's just cleaning up as the kind of subjective substitution because they actually change the way the corpo was so this part of the court is no longer required for that plan so just putting it back to where it should have been thank you dover castle wishing to speak against this motion after speaking for casa has done who named it but it hasn 't huge court I was a very deep in Dennis or if you think it 's worth Thank You counselor Patterson and here the counsel wishing to speak for or against no Cal Cyrus very a closing comments are not even on Cal about us now I coming up though no I can 't a good decision that being said all in favor against of members to the greatest chef of positive aging Advisory Committee there is a recommendation although have it recommendations to me Thank You counselor very second our counter Sutton Alice orizari Thank You mr. mayor I 'm actually the counsel of its point on this committee but so far we haven 't had a meeting but I 'm looking forward to it and now that we we 've got a number of members that we will have on this committee I would fully expect that we 'll get together and be able to make some useful representations to Council in relation to making a lot of people older better in our community good thank you council Sutton an appointment of this community will help build a sense of community as it raises the process of positive aging with new members being appointed to provide advice and recommend actions to counsel to ensure that the needs of older people in the community are met thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this for council summer I just have to make a note there 's so many returning returning members here lot about the committee itself in that people who are aging positively obviously well obviously council rip on their last term and it was fantastic they 're very engaged they 're very interested in community needs and we are an aging population so we need to be cognizant that the aging aging friendly infrastructure is in place and there 's policy around how we can better provide for the aging population and I just really want to congratulate them because they have been there almost the entire time actually some of them have been method even longer than me brother ha thank you thank you so much any council is going to speak against or August about admire comments always also on that committee and I know there 's quite a bit of good work actually came out that can be in regards to similar simple things like the changing of signs in car parks to alert different speed limits and to try and address bad behavior so yeah very productive and very active to councillor or as very any closing comments I know I think that the comments all having for the aging community a positive voice because I think quite often they 're overlooked and these people that once you the argument is that once you leave the employment full-time job and move into older age you tend to become a forgotten members of community I certainly won 't let that happen as far as I 'm concerned being on that committee and I 'd like to hope we do some productive work Thank You councillor all in favor of the motion against motion carried [Music] item seven point two counselors chef de RAF

balances will decline slightly from we 're currently up at approximately thirty seven million of cash investments returning an average traded over two percent good thank you mister total wishing to speak against this motion or as far as very any just like to thank mister title this is we would all in favor of the motion against carried item 8.3 counselors we have a recommendation on page 37 contracts awarded under your delegation status of contracts and advertising it to be awarded for April 2017 we have a council wishing to move counselor Jannetty you 'll move that motion the saris recommendation on page 37 a seconder please and it 's like okay counselor deviating and here mr. mayor I 'm happy to move the recommendation on page 37 as a motion it 's listing all of the contracts that are going to that have been publicly advertised and awarded under the CEOs delegations Authority Thank You councillor O 'Keefe the council wishing to speak against this motion for the motion and storge vanetti Andy Clayton uh commenters to me all in favor against motion carried item 9.1 on page 41 golden broken greenhouse alliance Memorandum of Understanding Webb recommendation we have a counselor summer which likes to move that now second to please they can deplete councilor recommendation and I 've been the council representative for the last two years on the Goblin version greenhouse alliance committee and firsthand I 've seen how that how to have the capacity of an hour to deliver very large environmentally sustainable projects right across all regions we envision that membership will increase from 8 to 11 member councils and that covers the golden broken region as well as the Northeast region these groups they were the behind the what 's working better initiatives and that initiative won a premier sustainability award under that our council took a lead role in changing traditional street lights to LED streetlights and that delivered massive savings from joint procurement procurement across councils and also in reduced energy costs and right now the committee is working to unlock funds from the sustainability vfv fund for collaborative electric vehicle use across councils we 're working on a feasibility study for that which is exciting over the last seven years the total value of all projects delivered by them is in excess of 5.5 million that means that every dollar invested in the Alliance has a return alliance and we won 't have the same level of success in navigating very complex procurements and alliances without them so it 's imperative that we support the MOU just to give them some independence from what was resource Givi now they need to stand on their own two feet as a committee with merit by themselves Thank You Council hello counselor ' chief council which is big against this for the motion-tracking you council summer for any closing comments nothing that will in favor against motion carried item eight sorry nine point two amendment will see one nine five investigation area three resigned to the urban growth zone adoption of amendment so we have that this recommendation on page forty eight drug counselor wishing to move this as a motion now so hazel Hong move that mister me call you out we 'll have a second Ibiza counsel Patterson counselor Hosanna mirror I think this is a pretty good case study of how the planning team works in practice we 've had a study of that particular area we 've had a planning team amendment put forward a range of a planning scheme amendment for submissions from referral authorities had no objections to submissions were received from referral authorities and requested changes that were resolved one submission was received requests the proposed amendment be abandoned and for late submissions queried the flood controls objected the proposed amendment they were then referred to an independent planning panel and this is a process that 's pretty common in relation to planning scheme amendment so independent planning family from panels Victoria in March looked at those objections looked at the overall proposal from Council and gave it the seal of approval that independent planning panel report is now back for councils consideration and the recommendation is that we adopt the recommendations of the planning panel we adopt the amendment and we submit the amendment of the Minister for planning for approval that of course is not going to be the end of the process because once that ministerial approval is in place before development actually occurs out there will now require other mechanisms to be in place a precinct structure plan and a development contribution plan and they 'll be implemented again of the process it 's a significant step but there 's a fair way to go yet thank you councillor Patterson very good summary counselor Hosemann I when I first become a counselor I thought if you want to develop the land you and the counselor permit heroine we are it

coincides with celebrations surrounding reconciliation week it is celebrations like these that spark conversations that develop further understandings which lead to true reconciliation my name is Leonid Rowland I feel extremely honored to be able to speak about my great-grandfather William Cooper William Cooper was born a yada-yada man on his peoples country in December 1861 and passed away in Marikina Hospital in 1941 he is buried back where his life began at camera he was the fifth of Malaga supported by missionary Daniel Mathews Daniel taught William to read and write and also introduced him to the Bible both of which he fell in love with through his life he worked as a Shearer a writer a public speaker and a general labrum Williams first representation to government was at age 21 a petition to land 1800 acres were set aside that we fondly don 't know as cummeragunja William Cooper raised seven children one who fought and died with the Anzacs in Europe raised many more grandchildren one being my father who live with him during the later years of his life who shares many stories of his continued battle to fight for equal rights of not just his people but also others who were during those times were marginalized as a man in his 70s he started Australia 's first indigenous justice movement the Australian Aborigines League a movement which long after his death would lead to the bonus 1967 referendum during these later years although he loved the bush he felt that he needed to be in his greatest work his Soria moved to Melbourne 's also allowed him to be eligible for an old-age pension as he no longer lived on the mission he mentored and worked with other strong Aboriginal leaders like sir uncle dog Nichols ID badge Tucker Uncle Bill Ferguson and many many more many Sunday 's was spent on the Yarra River speaking upon his soapbox to those that wish to listen about the equal rights of his people moving around the state and up the east coast of Australia to collect signatures from Aboriginal people and talk about equality he collected almost 2,000 signatures to petition King George the Debs this petition was to prevent the extinction of the aboriginal race to improve conditions and to have a voice in Parliament certainly this petition did not reach the king 77 years on this protest has been heard and the petition has ended up where William originally wish for it to be my dad 86 at the time fulfilled a lifelong dream by hating the petition to Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove he also during this time was granted 15 minutes to discuss William Cooper with principal with Prince William we now know that petition all those years ago finally arrived where it was meant to be William Cooper is also recognized for his protest on December 6 1938 after reading the newspaper about the atrocities in Europe and ill-treatment of the Jewish people after Kristallnacht a night November 9 1938 where almost 200 synagogues were destroyed over 8,000 Jewish shops were sucked in looting at tens of thousands of Jews were removed to concentration camps back in Footscray William encouraged members of the aboriginal advancement League to March with him from Footscray into the city an attempt to handle a tower to protest against the at denounced the actions of the Nazi Party this small demonstration to the German embassy was ignored and the door was slammed in his face decades later this letter and protest has finally been acknowledged and accepted the Jewish Council recognized William Cooper with the ceremony and planning of trees at my dad 's forest at the ceremony the ambassador to Israel addressed us at stated quote William who could William Cooper 's greatness emanated from the fact that he was not only perpetrated up and demonstrate his anger at these wrongs I hope that this small chap snapshot of William Cooper 's life gives you an insight into the man that he was and the struggles that Aboriginal people faced his courage and continued fight for rights of his people shows that the sort of person that he was to never lose sight and be discouraged up a continuous amounts of time he was ignored when asking governor government officials to assist and help make changes for his people this of course is what I loved about him the most I feel proud that he 's my great grandfather he sends up knowing what the what was right and wrong together treatment of mankind shown through in the actions and the man he truly was the family of William Cooper some of you who have traveled a long long way today thank you we 'd like to thank

Titus will alluded to our risk in respect to debt is very low and that 's the way this council wishes to keep it and that 's what we 're working towards so generally speaking we 're tracking very well I think it 's irresponsible if on behalf the organization and I thank you for that mr. total any other council we should just speak against the rationale yes I just want to make a comment that absent flows up and down up and down end result is final one I 'm very comfortably good ending and that financial department thank you pulling favor of the motion against motion carried item nine point four counsels our draft for rating strategy 2017 to 2021 there is a recommendation on page 68 over counselor wishing to move that recommendation as a motion counsel Abdullah you have a second to please counselor Saturn Abdullah wish to speak to the motion I 'd like to move this recommendation on page 68 about well you can if you choose to be far away that it 's about to endorse for the draft waiting strategy 2017 2021 as presented and points two three and four on base number 68 basically this rating is based on the following objectives one is about the inter that the entire community should contribute towards unavoidable costs of local government that 's a very important objective that everybody needs to understand when talking about waiting strategy also one of the other objective is that we are feasible services should specified local objectives can be achieved using differential rates so that says why differential rates are used in our case and also the residual service costs should be apportioned on the basis of property evaluation now one of the things is that the rating strategy determines how and not how much the council will raise money from properties within the municipality it determines the sheer of revenue contributed by each property some recommendations include about for for greater Shepperton council to continue to apply differential rating as its rating system as a part of this trading strategy this addresses equity issues under represent recommendation is is saying that the separate differential rates not to be introduced for pocket properties defined as retirement villages because their situation is the same as other common properties there 's also recommendation about municipal charge which is maintained at the existing proportion of 12% of total rate revenues and MC of course helps to ensure that owners of low valued properties also contribute a reasonable amount to meeting the unavoidable costs of local government so these are some recommendations draft reading strategy from what I a very comprehensive process there was a reading strategy advisory group that was involved and of course pros and cons of all the all the objectives were analyzed at that time so it 's something that is now in you know sort of we are ready to endorse it and that 's what I would recommend thank you thank you sudden famous it at all but this is going out to the community so anybody wants to put in new submissions they can do that and by the council if they wanted to good thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion back to you council abdullah all in favor against the motion carried IVA 9.5 councilors 2016 2017 quarter 3 forecast review their recommendation on page 73 to have a council wishing to move that as the motion Council Patterson second to please counselor certain council person are you so again right counselor title I 'm mister title if you 'd like to just bring us up to date really quickly on the revised forecast it 's pleasing to be able to report to year-end by their one point eight four million dollars better than the quarter adopted forecast this largely due to low but lower than EPA low the cost Cosgrove 's landfill some salary savings across the organization and an increase in membership in that our moves so every little bit helps to contribute towards that the capital works forecasters are projected forty two point six million dollars and that remains steady from the quarter to adopted forecast year-end working capital is improved from quarter two as well and we 're projecting its thirteen seventeen point three million as compared to 42 which is sixteen point three Freeman myristic live investment also increased along those lines as well so that it suffice to say we are sufficient working capital erm to meet all our financial obligations and we position in terms of liquidity and thank you mister title counselor Sutton you wish to add anything any other counsel wishing to speak against this motion for a motion Thank You counsel Patterson any closing comments yeah we 're being kicked around a little bit with our waste as we all know but basically end up nice and square you know three months good thank you all in favor of the motion counselors against carry item nine point six the counselor expenses an entitlement policy and page 76 there is a motion of the counsel of dr. counsel expenses entitles policy 37.3 pol three now any counsel we can to move a motion to move a motion with the following change so you would like to the motion that you tell me what you to top paragraph attendance and functions page two of these which is the wrong page so in hate technology I 'm going back to page two sorry I was on page three I support the rest of the document and I 'll read it out so people aware what I 'll be talking about a maximum of two counselors are may annotate the company 's directors course speech financial year counselors wishing to annotate the company 's directors course will be required to occur all educational course fees up front once the course has been successfully completed an application for embarrassment may be made provided the following successful completion of of results to evidence of payment of course fees three applicants must be made application must mailed in three months least of the course or no case none of the final result whichever is later a counselor who achieves less than 80% attendance and something tenth subsequently fails past the course will not be eligible for reimbursement now that course entrench expensive to run you want me to talk to it now at this stage we need to know that we 're accepting where you 're dumping the counsel expenses and entitles policy less that point you referred to which was item so there 's no number cancels clear what the motion is yep yeah yes driver second I 'd like to second that things miss to me thank you now councillor Patterson you can speak to circulation of that whole sec reference to what counsel over that paragraph know what what counsel of Penance actually read out now my rationale for this is that councillors we 're all very passionate about our community et cetera but you know some of us aren 't the sharpest tool in the shed we can we 're not we 're not professors of Finance we 're not lawyers we 're not head of governance to partners we need to gain all that if we were headed both departments we wouldn 't be playing for job for 25,000 a year I gotta tell you the the concern I have with this is putting the onus directly back on the counselors if they do not complete the course successfully they lose their 8,000 at the third of their pay for the year there is no initiative there to do it at all we have a budget of a hundred and thirty three million dollars that the counselors work on per year we 're responsible for it by law but Sir this is where the backstop discounters it is important we get as much education and knowledge to be able to utilize that money as good as possible for our ratepayers therefore by putting something like this in front of right in front of counselors and basically making it very unattractive to pursue this course he 's not the right way to go also it restricts turn to four years that 's a could possibly do it if you had a whole different new counselors why wouldn 't you let them all do it the first year you 've got the benefit the next series after that rather than having to skilled up and ready to go you 've got to wait for the next year for another two to get skilled up then another year to get those two skilled up they might not stand again you don 't know you 're better off getting people in there getting them trained as quickly as you can and then you 'll receive the benefit so I do not support a the any of that I think it 's just bad for council in general I know of previous counselors and mayor 's that have actually stood sorry I 've done the course some of them are files some of them haven 't even set the test still yeah which is an idea like granted that but still they have completed most of that course and therefore they 've learned a lot along the way just because it hasn 't been a benefit to you and the council 's and therefore the right buyer so I totally support the rest of it but I do not support that part I intends to would like take an answer Thank You councillor Patterson counselor said yes and just one other thing too I 'm not sure if council Patterson did mention it after all that is that the 8,000 needs to be put up front so we would have to pay that straight away and as Dennis that our budget is fairly tight I 'm very very keen to do this course but to actually outlay eight thousand dollars to do it right now would be difficult I think that would be enough to put most councillors off so I absolutely support councillor Patterson any other council wishing to speak against this for the motion bonus or to speak to motion or for the motion my support councillor Edison 's motion limiting just two councils per year with an expanded Council of nine just does it seems logical to me to try and have some councils into our directors to be pointless if that council he 's a relook at number one and four for three or four years I haven 't had the actual benefit of that course so and again the financial commitment is another aspect that I think made you chose some councils so I fully support the motion that being the case Council of Paterson any closing comments now I think it 's all been covered thank you well in favor of the motion we 're all clear with emotion was it was the policy lest one councillor person put it thank you against none so that motion is carried thank you 59.7 contracts awarded under that delegation and status of contracts advertised and yet to be awarded for March at March 2017 where the recommendation on pages 78 and that 's it on page 78 another council wishing to move that as a motion can 't_''_1712.77 slip do I so your hand a second place councillor Saturn note the publicly advertised contracts awarded by the chief executive officer and directors and the delegated authority and tendons that have been advertised but not yet awarded 's all good thank you councillor Sutton any council wishing to speak against the motion for the motion just like comment sip and hike is a turbine thing but I 'm learning to hate the words cosgrove Sal landfill it is copper spinning an absolute fortune I better do it but I 'll be so happy when it 's all done like the rest of the council I spent on something else Thank You council Penson now the council we should comment for or against the motion that been the case Chancellor Abdullah thank you favor of the motion against the motion carried item 9 sorry our draft 2017 or 2018 budget there 's a recommendation on page 82 I will actually read out the recommendation I won 't move the books the council endorsed the draft 2017 2018 budget as presented authorized a chief executive officer to give public notice of the preparation of the draft 1718 budget accordance with section 129 of Local Government Act 1989 they stipulate in the public notice that persons may make a submission on the draft budget 2017 2018 in accordance with section and that written submissions must be received by 00 p.m. 19th of May 2017 point C to undertake the administrative procedures necessary to enable council to carry out its function under Section 223 of the act in relation to this matter number three hold a special council meeting on Tuesday 6th of June 2017 at 30 p.m. tree here any person wishing wishing to be heard in support of their submission on any proposal contained in the draft 1718 budget in accordance with section 2 G for the Local Government Act 1989 and point 4 consider all written submissions on any proposal contained within the draft budget 2017 2018 so any council which that recommendation has immersion counselor abdullah ii two plays as the pedestal cancel abdullah yep i would first of all i would like to say well done to council staff for the for their professionalism in budget preparation so the draft budget is out for 2017 2018 the budget has been prepared on the guidance and directions provided by the council and they were three guiding principles in this year 's budget and they were number one we will aim for a sub surplus budget and number three we will fully fund asset renewal so it 's great to see that all the objectives have been achieved in this budget as if you have a look at the budget it 's it 's we 're having a total revenue of 132 million compared to one hundred twenty seven point nine three million in 2016 there has been an increase of three point two five percent similarly in total expenditure we have got a slight increase that is three point four percent increase and the total expenditure estimated is 119 point nine four million dollars now the total capital expenditure in 2017 2018 is estimated at thirty seven point three three million and this is across projects in following categories as a very details really very useful especially for community members if they want to get a quick understanding of councils allocation of expenditure across the main services it delivers now for example it shows that for every hundred dollar how their hundred dollar is allocated to each service area and they would notice that the highest portion eight dollars second highest expenditure is of course in governance and administration third-highest is aged and Children Services whereas fourth-highest is maintaining community facilities and assets the lowest amount of expenses made in the area of environmental management and drainage so it kind of gives you a quick and a quick view of how your hundred dollars are spent also on page number thirty-four there are details of operating and capital this would like to note that some operating grants are projected to decrease for example youth services early childhood education and environmental management however there has there is an increase in grants that is projected in San parking enforcement and Commonwealth Home Support Programme so I believe that it 's a very having all these details in the draft budget and it just shows that it 's a very good example of transparency and everything about councils spending is available here in the budget so I would encourage community to have a good read of it understand the budget and make the submissions there is an opportunity for making submissions and the timelines I mentioned in the recommendation thank I 'm just not sure where the council to cover the two percent rate increase and five point four in the curbside waste that 's what we 're sticking with this year we have not seek to get an increase things getting tighter and tighter we have to keep working with the constraints were given so I would certainly encourage everyone to have a good look at the and so what they think last year was for once an exciting year budget wise because we had lots of people have come and met with us at Council and we took notes and we changed things so we 're certainly that is not the final budget necessarily we are more than happy to look at every proposal comes to us and if we believe there should be changes made we 'll do that my habits of the 19th of May to get their submissions in and then there 'll be a special making where we 'll sit down with them and listen to their concerns and see if we can help them out Thank You council person any council wishing to my comments seen as there 's no one speaking against the motion I think overall it just shows what can be done in respect to the confines of a rate cap which has placed stress on bananaboys council but every Council in Victoria but it shows that that a good organization can work well within their means and it 's the crown surplus and not hopefully not affect too many services in a negative way of course that remains to be seen well receive our submissions from the community which we fully encouraged but overall I think it 's a great piece of work and I 'm very happy to report that as I said we 've work we 've kept it within our means and we 'll be delivering your circles which is always a great thing so congratulations to our staff that being said councillor Abdullah any closing comments just a very small comment but this is a draft budget we have noticed some small typing errors and consistency issues that will be rectified in the final budget as I understand so when you 're reading it just carries item nine point nine instrument of delegation to the chief executive officer we have a recommendation on page 87 I need a counselor smooth motion place and response to that recommendation counselor Patterson a seconder please O 'Keefe yes this is the delegation which gives ie the CEO power to pay accounts based and spend money which they do a very good job of then it also gives him the power to authorize other staff members down the list to conduct their business counsel and pay the bills that they know do what it does it just makes things move a lot quicker otherwise would have you know small tenders coming to Council it 'll be number thirty days before we could authorize it etc so this generally makes everything move a lot quicker and anything substantial comes to Council as it just done back there to the checked over and basically kicked off by councils anyways so we 're well and truly aware what is happening and yes it has to be done every Thank You councillor okay any councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the well currently it is my cancer medicine indeed only favors motion against motion carries item 9.10 instrument of delegation for members of staff and development hearings panel there 's emotional page of motion sorry recommendation on page 90 and 91 yes so whoever counsel I wishing to move that as recommendations as of the motion it has the Saturn now counselor and Panasonic in some common good and will cancel something I devil 's second the motion yes thank you council person this is basically continuation on previous one but it 's more to do with the developing Hearing Panel we give staff the authorization to partake in it and some very important decisions get to made there of course so it 's very important that they 're well and truly informed of all latest regulations etc and have the authorization more importantly to make that decision and probably I 'd call on yourself mr. Muir as a member of that panel to probably make a little bit more than that I think you 've covered it quite well basically the dhp there 's a lot of changes within the the staff to be updated basically on the latest information and act on that so it 's basically regional it 's about council Sutton did you wish to add anything now as a second of motion no I think dinners covered in capital any council wishing to speak against this for back to you counselor Patterson no I think you 've covered it very well mr. Schultz wait that being the case all in favor against that 's scary 9.11 on page 94 a draft council plan another important document and page 95 so 84 to 95 to have a council mission to move this recommendation as a motion o 'keefe sorry a second a counselor counselor O 'Keefe you just pretty much it 's a work in progress we 're working on our council plan yeah I think everything 's pretty much just stood there to where we need to be and obviously community consultations important it 's really important thank you canceling okay careful Abdullah we should speak to it I just would like to emphasize that of course this is one of the most important plans is has been developed in consultation or with with many stakeholders started with the council counselors council staff community they were forums that were held to get the inputs from community basically the idea is to come up with a strategic plan and in this draft council plan they have been five our strategic objectives have been identified and for each strategic objective there 's a strategy to achieve those objectives and there are a measurement measure of success as well as in key performance indicators for each of this measure of success so I think in this round this strategic plan has been made quite sort of concrete and in terms of monitoring of the plan the measure of success and indicators have been introduced which will really help us to monitor the performance of this plan so I would encourage community to have a close look at the plan and and provide any submission sister if you feel like yep Thank You counsel Abdullah any counselor wishing to speak against this motion for the best report there is absolutely enormous mental work goes into this by to start councils start but it is a very rigid job together and as a council will quite determined to previous council angel si was a bit wishy-washy to me it was a lot of motherhood statements in now that really you couldn 't you couldn 't measure whether it succeeds or not so we were very adamant this plan that we want to get something that we can actually see and tick off that we 've completed and that 's what what the concentrations been on I know from my Moni council here that it 's been involved in one before and I appreciate different that there are new council to put in it it 's you come in and you don 't know what it is and you 've got a lot of work to do regarding but I 've done a perfect upload congratulations we basically identified that we want something we can measure the results we don 't want to initially watch new stuff in there we want supper than the we can actually change I 'm doing and trying to achieve and then taking it off God it they will come back hopefully some more recommendations do the things they want in there which is extremely important that if it 's all about safe plan as well as ours and then we 'll adopt it and that plan will be what we work through for the next four years so congratulations to staff and are those four people over they 've all had a big input to it what a work enormous manner work and it 's good they do work sometime of the years [Laughter] compliments and the other counsel we should add comments to her against now against all add my comments for those two documents that counsel or counselors really need to focus on in their term of service that 's the council plan obviously and the budget this is the roadmap for the next four years so it 's hugely important that we get it right that 's why it 's going out for public consultation and we hope to get any recommendations coming back that being said counselor O 'Keefe Ben said thank you my third favor of that motion against motion carries to have the counselor wishing to remove that as the motion that the counselor dr. Grant 's distribution policy 43.2 pol went no get some medicine sure I 'm getting to it do we have a second to place counselor Saturn counsel Patterson aye yes thank you very much this is to do with

around town when there 's a large project you make the Minister for planning responsible set a lot of the red tape the cat said a lot of the small stoppages doesn 't come along and getting away the minister is then responsible for the planning controls and he rather have to go through processes before it gets to the end he is in charge it 's happened that currently happening for error according us SPCA Wrigley do it Unilever there 's several other places that do lots of works they do not need to go through the detail process a lot of people after go through it 's important thing area and we can 't afford it held up with very small technicalities giving a minute to the power he basically can 't_''_2906.579 be over fully support Thank You councillor Patterson council abdullah i just would like to say that this is important to expedite the project in a sense that there are dependencies we 've got grants from federal and state government and they follow and we have to follow certain milestone for delivery so those milestones we have their own page 105 of the agenda but basically it 's it 's just a very good approach to expedite the project and to avoid any unnecessary delays and

page 143 it 's about it says that the council was seed and note the greater Shepherd in the Heritage Advisory Committee annual report 2016 for the year ended table December 2016 I would like to just say that this is a very active and passionate community we have got representation from Shepperton as well as small towns such as much as in attend romero gum lamba which is excellent it 's I have also noticed that this committee is playing an important role in creating awareness about our heritage and it 's providing a very strong advisory role if you look at the annual report they outlined some of the of them some of that is about professional guidance and administrative support and also about the arranging lectures and identifying and recommending significant heritage properties in greater Shepperton for the Victorian Heritage Register so this all these contributions from the committee they it 's and they are appreciated and annual report it 's it 's very comprehensive and it covers everything one of the things that I 've noticed is also about the committee that is undertaking greater Shepherd inherited heritage study stage and just to highlight that this is possible only cause of the active subcommittee members of this committee and their research and knowledge of heritage buildings places and sides is vital and it 's very impressive so I 'm very happy to to receive the report and to see and to read all about the achievements councillor pedestal so we should just speak against this motion for no thanks Pfizer against Kerry and their counselors where seems we seem to be the mood of giving right what a man exam page two sorry 146 where the recommendation in relation to community sustainability grants 2016-17 around two we second to please I would like to move the recommendation on page 146 that the council adopt the recommendations of the community sustainability sustainability grants assessment panel to fund falling 3 sustainability grants to the total value of five thousand seven hundred and twenty two dollars 20 cents so we put three organizations who have received this this grant basically it 's the demonstration of councils continued effort to foster positive relationship with community and providing them the support that they need to help achieve benefits such as environment sustainability social connectedness enhanced sense of self and belief so these grants up to two thousand dollars would benefit these community groups and committees it is also encouraging to see that the grants panel is actively looking to support all applications even if some of them do not meet the criteria for sustainability grants in this case I noticed that one application from Houston Hall committeeman of management for upgrade of external lighting did not meet this grants criteria but it was diverted to add which is building renewal program or funding so and also the so that 's that that Shepperton and small towns so to Lamba in this case this has been a fairly new grant that was first launched in July 2016 I think it 's going to be interesting space to watch particularly moving forward with environmental sustainability strategies I think it 's a great thing to UM to know and really support it 's quite interesting the three different variety of projects that are listed there you put your Filipino Australian friends association with the herb and vegetable garden you 've then got your blackout blinds amber recreation and then you 're golden broken indigenous purchase of the direct cedar so it 's a very diverse range there and interesting and as far as something new and also again supporting our environmental sustainability so watch that space and hope it 'll grow good Thank You councillor any council we should just speak against this motion for the motion Council Abdulla any closing comments no bullying favor against motion carried Ivan 10.8 the renaming of toilets it broke or rename the cart approaches to a new name that 's on page 154 there 's a recommendation but guidelines for Geographic Names 2010 renamed quaility Road try our Botanic Gardens Avenue councillor O 'Keefe second to place Kenny I 'm doing okay Thank You mr. mayor this is obviously a big decision to actually change the name of a road however I do think the change of name from politic road to Botanic Gardens Avenue will provide clear direction to the entrance of the Botanical Garden it 'll fit with the image of what we 're trying to protect their assist people to find the site I think that 's an important thing by myself got a bit lost they 're heading out there I think this lines up with the project moving forward the actual renaming of the road and the future plans at the site and that it is to be enjoyed by the locals as well as a great tourist attraction so we wanted that to be an easy you know an easy place to find we want the road to represent I think exactly what they 're trying to create out there moving forward it 's still a work in progress it 's important I 'm sorry bands of changing a road name but I think it is a much better fit for what the road leads to and I think again very important to also recommend that we somehow maintain the heritage in the history of the site and apparently there is some signage out there that does explain you know that the it has been a tip there before it 's currently displayed but I do think moving forward for the image the perception from the public lots of reasons I think this is perhaps a great suggestion to actually change it to Botanic Gardens Avenue Thank You councillor Abdullah the road is leading into Australian Botanic Gardens which is being built on a former landfill site so with the changed use of this side and also to promote this beautiful and impressive impressive space it makes sense to rename the road the new name has far more aesthetic appeal than the current one and no doubt that the current theme identifies the history of the side but the same can be done by providing appropriate signage in the garden regarding its received for this name-change 10 in favor and 4 in opposition due to historical purposes Australian Botanic Gardens Avenue is reflective of the current purpose of the sign the one which is more permanent so I think that it is only appropriate to go ahead with the recommendation thanks thank you he cares for wishing to speak against this motion for just like to add a comment I 'm in favor of changing the name to attend ago continue but I think it might be a good idea or not be nice idea if we could just put underneath the tanning Avenue oh that 's a lovely thought it 's not a motion unfortunately before it 's a key point so on so thank you for that [Music] look I can see there 's four objectives to change the name and I can I can see their point of view it does say a lot about the kennel gardens that was a tip and that it really does hit you in the face when you drive down their thickness they 're tipping you sell what 's in air so I 're probably gonna have to write back if it formally tipper able to burn and background any consolation to speak forward I think the more spoken councillor good he said that guess like a final comment in is that as I said I 'd eat it out there not so long ago and that 's I 'm looking forward to completion and Botanical Gardens moving forward and hopefully creating a great tourist attraction as well as the community enjoying Thank You capsule O 'Keefe only favor of the motion against motion carries now Argentine point nine is another renaming renaming telly group tell you the river no westbam bar thorough survey recommendation on page 161 grab a count over that mr. Patterson seconder please answer certain and council person I miss this is an area I frequented have all my life basically and opponents correct it it is confusing they twist and turn and we lot simpler with a continue one for Golden Valley highways right through to in America right now so you wrote a lot more easy for emergency vehicles piece of vehicles and everyone else to find than turning and going left and right with the same road name and crossing other roads that they shouldn 't be there basically so this is good it 'll don 't help people out that way a lot take you cancel something oh it 's a safety issue so I think it needs to be done good thank you any counsel wishing to speak against this for council person not see me just speaking to the motion yes all done all said that being the case all in favor of motion against item 10 notes point 10 council page 165 the greater Shepherd a movement and play strategy consultation report and vision and direction paper there was a recommendation who 'd like to move that as a motion second to second to place a fibula council okay yeah that 's a fairly large consultation report here obviously the vision is part of our movement strategy I think it 's important that we obviously move forward in this direction particularly you know making our roads have everything easier to access yes I pretty much support the recommendation on page 165 opening would encourage everyone to have a look at this strategy basically it 's it 's a long-term vision it 's all about making greater shape it in a livable place and active living and it also taking a very holistic approach further to the provision of an improved transport system so not only relying on cars we also need to do more walking cycling and public transport within where the sheraton also needs to improve so this strategy is very comprehensive and talks about the different Thank You councils wishing to speak against this full immersion you know just what to support both counselors it is a futuristic what 's the direction where we 're heading and then I 'll deal with walking cycling public transport freight movements cetera being a strategy in nice and early it will allow us to move greener city so much easier in the future so hope you support good things council person I 'll just add my comment as well I mean this is the first tip to producing a draft or a moving in play strategy so this has to be done otherwise sorry counselor okay sorry dad thank you thank you all in favor of the motion against motion carried item 10.11 councillors on page 172 in relation to passenger rail we services project and economic impact study reports is a recommendation there on page 132 who 'd like to remove that as a motion a second to please don 't cancel Patterson Chancellor okay look this is hugely important there 's you know lots happening in this space at the moment I think it 's a fast growing city we need to have a strong vision in this space with our rail we have strong investments happening in our town with the multi million-dollar courthouse expansion of Latrobe University 's GB health just to name a few so this increases these type of projects increase the demand to have a better rail system in place where is he going to be trafficking a lot more people with these type of progress happening in our community attract people to our region we need to have better rail services we know that and to link easier access and to encourage opportunity for our services or lack of amount of rail services that are offered compared in particular to other regional areas so we need to pursue this this area and we also need to be very part of this in the future we need to stand up and make some noise as we are with a sustainable upgrade that delivers as I mentioned in the report we want at least eight daily type of services and reduce travel times from Shepherd into Melbourne and vice versa this is gonna help our help our tourism Economic Opportunity and at the moment I think we 're disadvantaged and we 're getting the impact of blackhole so I think this is a very important report that needs to be supported we need to be definitely in this space in light of what happened last week without putting our hand up for the Commonwealth Games we 're having lots of reasons to you know really make some noise and really show that we 're capable and in need of you know this type of service within our community so rail you know it 's a very very for that matter so I think this particular report is the start of many things in the future to come so it 's really important that we all get on board literally and you know take advantage of this you know these opportunities that come our way Thank You councillor council Patterson addressing the Melbourne on the triangle trying to get some attention to this and and this is just continuing on this is a terrific report third sometimes you get reports from consultants that you know been wishy washy this report was terrific the briefing we received them was very clear and precise what has to happen that shows that we 've sort of we 're a long way down the rail literally we 've missed out for a long time and it 's gonna be a big job for us to catch back up we have to start somewhere it 's not just to do with fixing our line down the road years we do with what comes out of Melbourne no room for an extra trying to come to ship because it can 't get through the put Melbourne before we can get a proper service here but the minister does Cinderella and basically said well you know you come up with business case approvals and we 'll see what we can do and that 's what has happened and it 's a very good business case that shows that if you do build they will come they where it 's being built just blossomed absolutely blossom does in Castlemaine a barista the train goes through the end of Bendigo it was just buzzing with people getting on lots of trains you know something like 10 or 15 a day gives the opportunity for the whole town to build on it and all that all the stops down the way so we have just been neglected for far too long and is in disrepair don 't need a political and say whose fault it is but we need to continue to work to try to catch up and that 's what reports what this will do and all we can do is keep going so he has done a great job commissioning this and working on it we need to keep working at it we need pushing because if he 's the one thing that 's holding this town back more than anything else is a fast reliable service to Melbourne if we can get that everything else will burn Thank You councillor Paterson any councillor we should to speak against the motion did you wish to speak against the motion Council AB good no he can 't speak for the motion you will thank you I think I would I would repeat what which my what my fellow councillors have just said we have all seen that Shepperton has been disadvantaged in regional train infrastructure investments for example regional fast rail project in 2006 where shepherd Seymour I was the only train corridor that was excluded shepherding is growing as council a team of Caithness noticed and future is looking positive with all the recent developments and and our Commonwealth Games 2030 announcement last week so it 's looking up forever so in in context of that and improved shepherd and northern train service is an absolute necessity one that is justified in terms of potential principles of social justice and equity I would say our people living in Greater Shepperton as well as in surrounding regions such as Mora campus be strategy and southern New South Wales they need access to decent train services that is to be able to transport people in a manner that is safe convenient efficient reliable frequent faster as well as it 's inclusive to the needs of diverse groups of people that is all young students and several people we have been telling them for a very long time that this need is there and but there has been little or no response so far so given that shepherding is getting no response from the decision makers Council has taken a very intelligent and timely initiative to undertake these two studies that is passenger rail service improvement study and passenger rail economic impact study and to provide objective data about infrastructure costs and economic benefits to progress further to bring Shepperton in line with other comparable region cities what we need according to these reports is that we need eight services compared to the current four services we need times of two and a half hours we need modern wheat velocity carriages as opposed to current obsolete and disgraceful carriages I would strongly support the two studies and recommendation so far and a score from 186 million dollar for train service upgrade and also a fifth daily service with current in France in freh structure in 1819 state budget I noticed that the strategy the the reports they were consulted by strategic partners such as a committee for Greater Shepparton Susannah she Shepherd and rails GV health etc so the notion that build it and they will come has worked in case of Bendigo Ballarat and Geelong and it will definitely work for Shepherd and greater Shepherd in as well so well done to the council and the team involved in development of these reports thank you Thank You council on any other council wishing to speak against the motion thank you for the motion I just think the report actually gives us some way to start so it 's a starting line and it might just take a long time but at least we 've got something to add my comment has any negative comments government usually rely on costs and benefit factor calculations when they assist these types of projects and they 've given a lot of money over the years of projects that have come up with a very low number this project with the 200% increase in usage would add up to 0.6 which is nearly one account governments like the senior number one clearly attained without for a 250% increase we can get up to a number of 1.12 which is a fantastic actual number in respect of assessment of these projects and I would suggest that the bill that make will come mentality off you could really apply here would really work that coal concept I think it 's a project that really needs to be done as Dennis said this has been ongoing I would just like to say that I think if we didn 't if we weren 't advocating this would have a lot of time on our hands it takes up a lot of time council and the council itself and the organization but it 's so worth while I can assure the community that we will not stop until we get the source we need so after that 's all in favor councilors incoming so I just have one actually and I think a very important vision is the projected population growth you know we 're going to be able to sustain and support our argument you know when you look at the projection of our population growth so to support our population we have to offer some poor top of increase and better rail services I think that 's going to be part of our argument and positive things are happening here so all in favor of the motion council 's gracious pending motions councils we haven 't got any any reports on council delegations to other bodies and they 'll report some session special committees nothing there notice the motions amendments or recisions nothing there councillors talk to Mitchell sliding in ceiling that 's also nothing 16.1 on page 184 we have a recommendation where the council wishing to move that recommendation as the motion I 'll move that council Patterson to the motions not just this vegetable council we should just be against this version any other comments for the motion Council passes any closing comments and I think doing that right on your was that being said all in favor against motion carried 17.1 councillors is the assembly the councillors all those that we 're going to find a page where you live at Council passed a regulation that the council make the record assembly the council 's second to please [Music] can you come in now it 's open now so we 're it against the motion for the motion in the elaboration in your earlier comments thank you [Music] against

Herriot any other counsel wishing to add comment either for the motion or against the motion counsel summer would you like some closing comments thank you miss me thank you only favor O 'Keefe yes Thank You counsel okay we will call you back in a moment item nine point nine counselors on page 91 we have a recommendation it 's it 's not extremely lengthy but it 's rather lengthy to have a council wishing to move this recommendation as a motion council summer okay and seconded by Councillor Patterson so council summer well I 'm really thrilled we 're moving forward and I know there has been some criticism since the draft budget came out that perhaps this motion is too broad but honestly this is the furthest we 've gotten since I 've been on council and I 'm I 'm of a firm belief that there will be some action here I mean if we pass this motion activation can begin immediately and going by the timeline that we 've been given the works if works are required in the mall could absolutely commence by the end of this term which is very exciting because we also have staged to Maude street to do prior which has always been part of the first second and third and fourth type of trial and it will feed into the debate about what works in the mall think that 's a very smart way of doing it because otherwise it 'll be guesswork the budget for activation has increased it was 340,000 now it 's 500,000 over two years but it 's still less than the price of a toilet block so everything will be provisional on the under to understanding that we may be opening the mall to traffic so we 're not going to put permanent structures in the way of this we 're going to be very cognizant of the fact that we may need to remove things so anything that goes in there either is removable or out of the way we don 't exactly know how things are going to look but I can assure the public that we will be considering each step on a case-by-case basis and I 'm sure whatever we do there won 't be a quick fix it does take time there 's a lag time we need to reestablish consumer and business confidence but I 'm just so glad that is that we choose to do they all seem at least we 're doing something good thank you counselor Patterson I think I can basically speak for all councils and saying this is as frustrating as hell I can see why in 20 years nothing 's happened it is that difficult to see which direction we should go i was hoping to get some guidance out of all the submissions come in that 's confused the whole thing or everybody wants a little bit I 'm very hesitant to commit for an hour million dollars if that can be a price to open it when we don 't know if that 's going to fix a problem at four and a half million dollars more still of the same issue possibly no one is prepared to say for an athlean dolls we 'll fix it no one knows so the only way to go is follow these recommendations as I said I the general public out there to want something done we are seriously wanting to do something we just can 't get a clear idea of what needs to frustrating as hell but we are concerned as most people are about the CBD that we don 't always for now million dollars by opening up the traffic if we haven 't got some rationale that will actual work if we could spend that money and be exactly the same position so whatever it is going to be a complex answer and as I 've said before it 's between Levien as it is and and opening up the traffic for the answer lies somewhere in there but we 'll put identified before we spend that amount of money green councillor wishing to speak against this motion for the motion councillor giovannetti as both Castle a summer and Catholic person have said this is a very complex issue and has been some 20 years council hazel minh indicated that to us recently in a briefing session that this particular option has been around for for many years i think as a council like council Patterson said we need to do something it 's an opportunity to allocate this money we can use it for a trial with the big party but it gives us an opportunity to trial what can work they would I think it also has to work hand in glove with our agreement with the chamber there 's no good spending bucket loads of money in the mall or in the CBD area unless the chamber are on board is no good spending the money and developing it if the shops aren 't open so there 's got to be some agreement between the shop owners and council that that is going to occur otherwise it 's effectively we wasting money again so I think they 're things that we can work through going through this process I think it 's an ideal opportunity for trial could any other councilors we should just speak for the motion council Abdullah yeah just to say that it 's good to see the much-awaited report council staff has done a good job of compiling the results of public consultation in mods on Mott Street activation more Street Mall activation unfortunately as has been said by my fellow councillors the lengthy process to arrive at this kind of important decision is those who are most impacted by this situation that is a businesses in mod Street Mall the report findings highlight a lack of consensus around various activation options put forward by spy Wendy Crowe and Peter copulas so it 's very obvious that there is no silver bullet no single solution is going to change the situation overnight however there can be some short and long-term solutions long-term solutions includes initiating this concept design work for all three options the start to finish timeframe for these three options could be from twenty seventeen to twenty twenty in depending on if and which solution goes ahead with detail design and implementation stages and another important and interesting point to note is that one of the key barriers to access mode street mall has been identified as sparking issues availability and cost and there are of course are thus fact other factors such as variety in diversity of shops safety of the area lack of satisfactory public toilets etc so during the time that we initiate planning for the three options mentioned in recommendations some of which may involve multi-million dollar investments on trial and there could be in place to help change the status quo and some of these areas would be in my opinion would be an ass mention in the report the parking issue multi-deck car park trading hours as pointed out by Castro giovanetti uniform and extended in my opinion is the way to go food precinct potential and yeah so basically these are some of the activities that I would be keen to actively pursue pursue when this discussion is stance cancel Abdullah any other counsel wish and dad come in that 's losartan I just thought to agree with most of the reckoning date make a recommendation I 'd like to see the mall Street now become this they 've become the heart of shepherd and again and be reactivated but I would also like to see some of these money used as a trial to get things so we can actually ascertain whether if we open it will work we keep it close with some other things with other little work so I think we have to be a bit careful about what we do funds to have a trial on some different things I think that would be the way to go good things council sudden any other council we need to speak against this motion or for the motion council all the mo for the motion councillors very thanks mr. mayor councillor Patterson made it what I thought was an interesting comment in relation to as a second term counselor I remember when we are sitting here musing about the fact that would we jump at the opportunity to spend four million dollars in relation to a potential positive outcome quite quite fairly I thought we would balk at that suggestion because there 's no silver bullet in relation to this mhm however I draw comfort from the fact that history has been on our side in the sense that we 're not the only ones that have been put through this process because very young-looking council his hazel one who was mayor at that time I for the same issues and I just like to read a little bit from it councillor hazel minh who was mayor at that stage and this couple of years ago whilst there has been a strong Lobby from the business and retail sector dejavu call it the council recognizes that the mall is a community asset and the needs of all the stakeholders must be considered there is no united view on the future of the mall and the council has not determined a position for or against the reintroduction of vehicle traffic and the other changes in the mall council wants to hear your views please take the opportunity so interestingly here we are 20 years down the tracking or longer actually and I remember saying pre-election the worst thing we could do as a counselor was do nothing and in support of what counselor summer is said finally as Clancy would say there 's movement at the station the same situation arrives as was twenty of years ago when are quoted that article but refreshingly there is movement in a forward direction and it 's refreshing to hear that there 's a degree of bravery on behalf of our council council as individually and hopefully collectively if this recommendation is passed that we 're support the recommendation and as I hope my fellow councillors do Thank You councillor many other council we should you speak against the motion or the motion councillor hazel and thank you mr. mayor and thank you for the history lesson yes very I remember it well can you sign like your photograph yeah did you like it I can take a slightly different tack and actually look at the survey results themselves because they confirm the diversity of views and they confirm that there is no clear direction being provided from community response that 's very much the case of what happened 20 years ago when I think that the consultation process indicated then somewhere in the order of eighty-five percent of people 's reposed to reopen but let us not talk about 20 years I think there 's probably people in the room that can recall from when the mail was first constructed back in eighty-eight or 89 whichever the year it was this debate was going before the installation that 's been going ever since and what the polls indicate if we look at the Shepherd a 55-percent opposed our results here to the specific question about what would you do to improve the mail but the highest ranking response of thirty-two percent was waving as the traffic that 's great thirty-two percent of the respondents are over around six hundred people in total what it also tells me though is for sixty-eight percent of the respondents their priority with some other process let 's do something else so there is no clear direction but it is indicative of the males history that that type of outcome and I think more clearly a lot of the responses a broader CBD based I think that 's appropriate because and I 've set it on a number of occasions in a lot of times we 're having this discussion the male tail is wagging the CBD dog we 're focusing our attention on one particular area and there are some things that the council it 's within our scope around traffic around parking around streetscapes there 's things are out of our control diversity of the shopping operating hours for example we need an integrated solution one thing is CBD has changed quite dramatically in that time we 've seen the loss of a number of supermarkets out of the CBD furniture is moved out of CBD large-scale electrical hardware even a nursery that was in the CBD so the structure is changed it 's changed because its consumer demand consumer demand has driven the creation of the the satellites and people have responded to that we need to look an integrated solution for for this issue an infrastructure spend linked to marketing and promotion and uniform opening hours I think that 's a position that 's reasonably consistent with that that 's been espoused by the chamber in the past I find in the report though the suggestion that we visit other sites such as store bendigo Ballarat I think that 's lacking in merit we need to come up with a solution specific to Shepperton and if you have a quick look around it 's pretty easy to find you know the stall option and so hazel and essentially yes please any objections carry on the stool option for example the redevelopment there was geared around a Shepperton I think where I 'm struggling to see its connection and when I check this just recently an issue that 's occurring install is concerns about large numbers of shop vacancies in that region you know particular locality so I 'm not too sure we 're going to go in by visiting places that have been put forward as potential solutions but obviously have their own range of issues and similar when I hear comparisons with places like water and albury where consideration is being put forward for the introduction of paid and regulated parking so I think that I felt with the solution that 's specific to Shepperton not something that we 've pinched from somewhere else and I 've always advocated a forum as outlined in the report have done have done so for quite some time and I probably been a little bit one out of various stages on that I think a forum of all of the stakeholders to look at the issue the broad range of CBD based issues that are outlined in the in the report on page 94 is a significant and 's no single solution for this problem the single solution if it was available or the simple solution as well would have been done 20 years ago there was a proposition put forward community rejected it and effectively significant parts of the community are rejecting this again Thank You councillor hazel and any other council we should just speak against this motion no one left but me and I 'm going to speak to this emotional for this motion I think it 's probably the best bit of logical work that our the officers have done actually and that 's not disrespecting all your other recommendations that have come up over the last two years but I think this is really it 's it does actually incorporate all the different aspects of of so-called Silver Bullet solutions but it 's logically stepped out the 500,000 no doubt will be spent in such a way that if point three a B and C are somehow acted on down in the future or the very near future with respect all that money hasn 't been spending isolation it will be part of for a full opening of the mall it allows for other variations of it and we 're stepping through step by step but as council Sutton said possibly after the first allocation in the first year of 250,000 we might find that that 's actually on a long way to rectifying the situation if not the other steps are they available for us to step through so I think its associated to the logical steps that I can 't_''_1236.859 yeah I just really want to applaud the officers for putting this together before i was because i think as councillor Patterson said this is one most frustrating subjects that councils of had to face since I 've been our council and well before that as well so at least as councillors where I said we are taking action and this is definite action there 's no stepping back from this now we 're moving forward the resolution will be a successful 500,000 I 'll spend or an opening of them all having said that all in favor of the motion opposing comment sorry counsel someone forgot you have my apology counsel heisman I thought it was interesting the integrated solution completely agree we do need uniform shop hours there needs to be some onus on business to find their own solutions because counsel can 't fix everything there 's no single solution that 's going to make everything better whether it 's all down to consumer demand on why we have empty shops that 's questionable I believe that infrastructure has a very large bearing needs needs to be a pleasant environment that that 's always taken into account you need to encourage foot traffic whether there 's shade whether there 's ABS access to public toilets these are all things that council can do i do agree with Chris councillor hazel Minh that we 're comparing apples and oranges when we look at other malls around this state Bendigo in particular was built to be a mall there 's some very tall grand buildings there I believe I have a meijer we have a street with shops down the road and we concreted that street and that shows we are not necessarily building a mall unless we start from saying that again I 'm just looking forward to see what comes out of this thank you favorite version against emotion Kerry can we call in council okie you can fall asleep how gross street is the Vindico wall yeah okay counselors page don 't know we have tabled

item 7.2 endorsement of nominees for induction into the greater ship and sports hall of fame forever council wishing to move the motion as printed on page 9 councillor giovanetti page 9 and 10 sorry indeed Oh giovannetti to have a second desk councillor chief carefully giovanetti would you like to speak to emotionally I 'd like to move the recommendation contagion on pages 9 and 10 of the agenda I would also like to focus opportunity to congratulate the ship and sports hall of fame Advisory Committee on the work that they 've done over the past few years general Patterson has been a a member of that leaf some years and is still a member i think that the group of nominees that the committee has selected are excellent and i idea as to how they were selected and the sports hall of famers designs of recognize and celebrate significant sporting achievements of greater shipping and residence hall of famers potential to capture sporting achievers from the Golden Valley and become a regional sports hall of fame these achievements include participation and success in sport and a national international level and inductees will include players athletes coaches and officials and administrators and others involved in the sport at an elite level nominations were open to anyone who has been a resident of peppermint and who actively participated or supported sport in the area prior to ordering achieving national or international level sporting accomplishments this will be the first group of nominees that will come before council and the committee will continue to operate and we 'll look at the next level of sportsman who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame throughout the next few years thank you can put Counsell a turkey look I 'd like to support that as well the sports hall of fame is a priority sproul recognition that some of our most successful athletes it contribution and their support growing up here in Shepherd and I can remember many of these elite athletes and their success so I 'm looking forward to that some Hall of Fame and sharing that joy again with them and revisiting that success I think so a great contribution from our community and something that should be acknowledged in history right thank you can 't frankly if any other council we should just speak against this motion I bet you you want to speak against the council Abdullah no jump the gun they did it and you can so we can just speak for the motion councillor Patterson aye yes I appreciate I 'm council journey these comments but unfortunately only been on there haven 't_''_762.54 been diluting yet brew store has been here for a long time it 's a real great concept and it really does as kem assigning it really does relate back to our use your man of great athletes had come out of this region Maxie Carlos for instance when I was growing up the kids I remember very well brace Edwards and Glenn Jones 'm really looking forward to getting you know the biggest job we have to do now is try and find a home for the all the time which there 's lots of possibilities but it 's something that really are always so if you don 't recognize your passion in the future and I believe this is a great part you should be proud of those people love represented us very well and we deserve to give them some recognition looking forward to things you can surpass in any other counselor wishing to comment Council Abdullah just a small comment that it 's of course very encouraging to see this initiative and the commission of achievement in sports goes hand in hand with the greater shepherding council 's aim to in for our region to be recognized as victorious sporting capital so that 's one and the other one is in particular I 'm very pleased to see that out of 27 inaugural members who are nominated for the sports hall of fame include 13 women and 14 men this reflects a good gender balance in our sports achievement and this would be a good incentive for local women and men to get involved in sports of the choice and availed existing opportunities so welcome great Thank You counsel villa I wish had committed to this I decide to recognize former councillor Kevin Ryan 's contribution to this committee based him in myself Robbie 's as it was inaugurated last year I think until one 's going to assure you there was many many weeks and being spent working out exactly what criteria should be used in selecting the applicants and the final step will be recognized so I know the job ahead of the committee now is there still it 's all quite huge so I wish them all the best but I 've just like to as I said recognize councillor former councillor Kevin Riley 's chairmanship of the board councillor summer use dad 's coming I would like to add comment first of all I 'm really pleased that they 've seen it 's been so popular in its first inaugural year it does show that we 've been down the right track there 's sports of to Paralympians it 's just terrific there 's an enormous emirate ceremony coming up scheduled tentatively the August fourth so hopefully people can clear the calendar for that but ultimately it comes down to council promoting sport which is such a positive thing on so many levels so one great for Public Health we 've always been such a sport oriented region we have an endemic of public obesity unfortunately particularly in childhood and these ventures could help to turn that around it 's a perfect complement to our state-of-the-art boarding precinct which is being built so now proposed basketball stadium it 's a terrific way to recognize local sporting heroes who can turn into role models and it 's also really exciting to be looking for a new location it could be at the existing sports stadium or someone we haven 't thought of yet but we 're really showcasing this region so it can position as a sporting capital of regional Victoria Thank You counsel come on counselor giovannetti like you are floating tell me mr. Shaw cute thank you very much more in favor against motion carried page 14 do I have someone counselor Patterson would like to move this recommendation as a motion to have a second Dark Council of someone that 's a person oh yes William Kirk there was an amazing person and I believe when you read his biography you 'll realize he was probably before his time he 's responsible the establishment of Madoc week which is very successful now especially this area he established Aboriginal advancement League he was a representative empowerment and one of his biggest ticket sales I 'm concerned he petitioned the German Consulate regarding the prosecution of the Jews and that 's that 's a man that 's well i 'm thoroughly before his time we should be very proud to have him associated with our town and by putting a memorial up in a very very open place but people can be aware of his doing through the past i think it 's very appropriate we support it Thank You counselor come on I like to reiterate to councillor Patterson 's remarks that this was a great man he 's achieved a lot many great achievements to have the opportunity to honor the life and work of this man traditionally we haven 't_''_1064.32 as a mainstream society in cognizant to the achievements of Aboriginal pioneers but we have this opportunity to put William Cooper France and center in a public place on his traditional country so this will inspire to pay respect to traditional owners it 'll inspire future leaders it 'll help combat racism it will support the rights of Aboriginal people as a whole and remind us that equity and justice are fundamental human right thank you for summer you can also we should just figure gives me pleasure any other council wishing to speak for emotion Casper hazel Marissa Mayer I think the Chief William Cooper a very significant in indigenous to be very significant in Australian history at the same time we know the the stories of the walk off from camera ganja and his role in that and obviously he 's leading role in the establishment of you need this community here in greater shepparton so it 's appropriate that he be recognized and in a lot of ways where we because he 's been making noise elsewhere including by the other state of israel with a readmission in a very public place there and the comments that were made about before his time because one of the first people in the Western world to recognize the issue of what was happening with the Jews in Germany at that time unfortunately other people and nations around the world didn 't take note and respond accordingly but it is appropriate and i think that the request that the william pitt Memorial Committee have made to this council is something that we should approve and move on as quickly as possible at the same time recognizing that whatever the design of this statute with ugly and of it 'll be life-size and the design will be agreed upon by William Cooper 's descendants and of course that 'll be hopefully seemingly a role they 're played by an elf Turner is obviously a relative of William Cooper 's and the more that we can involve family in the acute and the community in in this design and installations the better it will be that I think we should note the great financial contribution of the Victorian jewish communities in actually erecting this statue there are there I think you know Marshall an actual figures that I 'm quite probably they 're contributing major power the actual financial commitment to directing them and their eyes as well absolutely so without their contribution financially this probably couldn 't have happened it so thank you to them now sorry can 't for 780 ever fathom did you bust your head oh I 've been ready a little be the batting might be and he was an amazing person so I think it 's fair and at the end quote that we recognize you with a laptop statue right thank you never liked careful should add counselor everyone I 'd like to add that by supporting this recommendation the committee the community will benefit it will be one step forward in a long journey of bringing the indigenous and non-indigenous communities together and building a relationship of mutual respect and understanding it will be a symbol of Pride and recognition for our indigenous community and will be bring awareness about our Aboriginal history and recognition of contributions of brilliant Google towards promoting rights of Aboriginal people and diversity so it 's a it 's a good step in the right direction word thank you can subdue a capsule person 's work any questions without solving Queen favors motion campus against Russian carry page 17 of your agenda counselors we have item 88.1 asset valuation and evaluation policy we have a recommendation any council which in turn we go to the motion tennis players Larry second to please after germinating counselors very Thank You mr. mayor short and sweet this is an example where we identified that we didn 't have a relevant policy to cover off on this particular asset valuation and revaluation so we formulated a policy and it 's never before the council d it is Thank You counselor driven here I 've kind of had my squad Cancellara 's arias said but it was a recommendation from our audit that this regarding racial policy be adopted and we 're just following that process Thank You counsel wishing to speak against this motion for the clarity around what this policy actually is it it delves into determining the valuation method used to assist our assets the condition or the age of the assets so that we can work out depreciated replacement costs and the frequency we need to reevaluate as well the non-current asset is easy straightforward but now we comply with the processes within the local government sector thank you any other counsel wish to speak for or against no counselor is very nice thank you all in favor against motion carries page 19 councils item 8.2 contract awarded under delegation and status of contract advertise and yet to be awarded to reach again 17 r up until do i have a council which is remove the recommendation as pendulum page any pages on the recommendations for me Thank You counselor is very serve a second to place councilor Patterson Flores very I give you some air the cornerstone of the local government act is accountability and transparency and this notice of motion fulfill those requirements because it 's there for the public to see in relation to contracts awarded and request for tenders in terms of the contracts that are going to the various infrastructure in other areas that the council operates with him we think you counselor Patterson I don 't know how I can follow that all trying operating concentrate on and does not get awarded some very big ones coming up in this quite a few of them probably one of the ones the new ship is an art museum stage two concepts at nine it should be very big boss yes and there 's quite a few coming up looking forward to being I 'll deal with them but any counselor wishing to speak against this motion for answer I was very from another night all in favor against carried 8.3 Council on page 22 there 's februari 2017 monthly financial report I can hear mr. title clearing his throat I 'll move the recommendation with me on page 22 counselor is very that the recommendations of the council receive a note that slippery 2007 multi financial report who have a second to place where all those many of them or can account for father cause or suttin kept it 's tamara and treated the counselors will just talk about operating performance to start with our operating performance radha owns counting surplus slightly behind year today at this point in time however still forecasting that by year end result should have improved and we 'll hit the forecast so we were expecting materials and consumables here today are high at this point however this is a timing issue due to some large expenditures that we 've made in the recent months for prepayment of software licensing and those sorts of things which we 're processing at this point metal correct as we go through the remainder of the financial year a forecast year end result has improved largely due to additional capital grants that we recognized through our operating statements and these grants are predominantly in the area of road grants and together with the increase in supplementary rate income that we 've seen we 're forecasting that that will flow through to a better result than the marginally better results and originally forecast in the original budget reminding councillors however that some of this year 's offset by air from the consequent landfill in terms of financial health our working capital is very healthy at this point in the year with the working capital ratio city in about a hundred and eighty-four percent and council as you recall victorian order to general 's office considers a hundred and fifty percent and higher as low-risk year-to-date cash balances are strong and currently we have about thirty 3.5 million dollars sitting in cash with an average rate of return of sitting about one point nine six percent that 's translated into 556 thousand dollars of interesting comment saved to date which guards capital works the end of februari we 'd spent fourteen point three four million dollars compared to the same time last year that 's a little bit under we spent 15 million roughly the same time last year however we do have a lot of capital works in the pipeline with in excess of 21 million dollars worth of work that 's actually then committed to orders as usage and there are tenders as you saw in the previous report that yet to be led also pleasing to expected and remains above a hundred percent at a hundred ninety percent at this point in time they do title council certain as you wish to add anything to it any kind of the wishing to speak against this motion for against I don 't think it would be anything that council salad or counsel jeopardy I 'm sorry mr. air that i think mr. titles given a very good synopsis of so the finance report being unaware that it would be dropped on him such short notice but mostly dogs just like to point out that is a concern although financial attracting quite well at the moment the decrease in user fees Cosgrove 's landfill is an issue we 're down 4.8 million at the moment less of course the ear reduction in epa csw we would have been paying on that landfill I know council staff are going to be speaking with the contractors pertaining to all of the contractors that were using cosgrove and we hope very much that very near future we can get them all back on board and dumping their rubbish where it belongs counselors very would you like any closing comments I know that thanks mister miracle been said that being said all in Jove up against motion carried item 9.1 the memorandum of understanding chamber of commerce and industry page 25 now so someone would you like to move the recommendation is immersion I 'd love to move the recommendation as a motion on page 25 thank you ma 'am have a seconder council Patterson councillor summer I 'd say it 's been a long term criticism of this council about we do not engage more closely with external bodies when it comes to strategic planning for the shipping and CBD whether that 's true or a perception I can 't comment that that is what I 'm hearing where the Chamber of Commerce the Shepherd and show me and councils Economic Development Department have largely been playing a silo park whereas by pooling resources and strategies we could have a multi-pronged and aligned approach to improving economic output in the CBD ten thousand dollars per quarter which is what we 're voting on here it 's not a great deal of to their cooperation in shuffling the funds it shows a great deal of goodwill and partnership most if not all local chamber organizations around the country are in some way funded by their local council and we haven 't been doing that so that makes this a long overdue partnership in my opinion and I wholeheartedly support and I can 't wait to see some outcomes once we get going thank you care for some the council person I think one of the most important things would have realized we 're all on the same side we all want the same benefits the same result so it 's important we work with anyone it 's like minded which the chamber is I 'm looking forward to and I haven 't worked very well the money will be giving them is basically running from the rights of those shopkeepers are paid so nobody shows that at all I 'm sure they 'll look after and use it wisely and I am very much looking forward to working with them to promote the CBD as a whole Thank You councillor better than motion councillor hazel and okay I view the you know you as a positive development because for the first time it will define the relationship between counsel and the Chamber of Commerce and that 's been ill defined in the past and on occasion we 've been at odds with one other because we 've been moving in different directions this hopefully will address that level imbalance and of course there are other other bodies around who will be part of the process we 've no doubt that the source of the distribution of the funds coming from the Shepherd and show me will produce some debate no doubt that in the community and made out with it and Shepherd and chamois itself of course we had a bit of a recent hiccup with some national publicity that we didn 't need or desire and hopefully this type of memory of understanding to finding the role to ensure that that type of issue won 't won 't occur again and also the efficiency in the in the memorandum but there is a dispute resolution process so if we do have deal with them and of course the ultimate is that the council is providing the funding the funding is debate into the relationship and that relationship and imagine on the outcomes that we achieve together it Thank You councillor hazel many other council we should you speak against all four I think counselor your face for quick you know just a few words around this the support for this recommendation it just shows councils keenness and goodwill in partnering with one of the important organizations in context of economic development in our region it is councils acknowledgement of the important role that the Chamber of Commerce can and hopefully will play in making sure it is a great place to work lives in West and visit this also reflects goodwill and a positive gesture towards chamber chamber something which is followed by most but not all the local councils i 'm also pleased to see that greater shipping council has taken a right step at the right time it is my hope and expectation there that this MOU would help build a trust based relationship between the two organizations where and responsible manner I would also hope that the Chamber 's skills and aspirations and stakeholder management special emedia will complement council 's efforts in promoting a positive message about greater Shepherd shepherd in which is great things happen here Thank you Thank You careful Abdullah councillors I did you wish to add thanks mr. me look essentially I support it and having been chairperson of shepherd and Charlie and on a number of occasions and actually still on the committee and latching on to the commentary from Council hazel Minh I can indicate that that let it be no doubt from my perspective that this MOU and this allocation of funds is not a handout it 's not a lot of charity there 's expectations of output and positive come back from the chamber the other issue I indicate that in travel as far as the funding coming from Shepherd and show me in terms of what the potential view of the committee members is I can also say again referring to council hazel with commentary that it 's not necessarily one hundred percent where their funding to come to speak against motion for the motion council sudden I don 't think it 's very important that we work together with the business community and by entering into this MOU it will be the start of a new an ongoing partnership with the chamber which can only be for good of shepherding thank you careful summer would you like in closing comment well I bring I think event an opportunity I 'll just reiterate what was said through the discussion councillor Patterson mentioned that we are all on the same cut on the same side and that the money is coming from the shopkeepers themselves so snowed will be spent wisely counselor habermann said that it would define the relationship between us which surely hasn 't_''_2178.92 been there before which is spot on there was the national publicity that we didn 't necessarily desire and I 'm just glad that there wasn 't a knee-jerk reaction to that and that as to council has said there is a process now for any kind of dispute or disagreement we Abdul counselor Abdullah acknowledge the important role of the chamber mentioned of us that there are skills and in the stakeholders of the chamber such as management of media and caliber is why or authority reminded us that it 's not a handout and we do expect some outcomes from this and that there may be division on how shipping and show me feel about the budget allocation and Shelley Sutton mentioned an ongoing partnership so I would be very surprised if this wasn 't a unanimous decision over all thank you for that synopsis is very counselor but I commenter thank you well that very appreciated a voltage ollie favor against Kerry can paste 29 sorry counsel on page 31 item 9.2 planning permit 2016 dash 3 30 year some development of the land for a caravan park and host farm primary produce sales and restaurant so do you have a council we should remove the motion as printed on page 31 we all move the recommendation quite a lengthy recommendations agreed on page 31 of the agenda of a second to please epicness councillor Patterson thank you I 'd like to foreshadow emotion please yes cancel summer that you foreshadowed version that he just give the third the decision to one month to allow cultural heritage overlay Thomas well thank you I 've noted that we 'll see whether we can get that foreshadowed motion now councillor hazel was no I don 't that a good the big fella for to shadow emerge at this point he was me this particular site an application or a similar application we decide it 's had a long history before council as indicated the previous application which was similar but of a different scale failed the tactic both councils and subsequently at recap at the December council meeting and the officers recommendation for refusal was not was not successful supported by council and the subsequent motion resolved that the matter be publicly advertised and as a result of that we 've had a strong and articulate objection from adjacent properties nearby to this to this site and we 've also had probably a strengthened objection from the of American catchment management authority now most of the issues relevant to flood behavior informed the Golden Valley harness and greyhound racing precinct master plan Martha flame the Associated planning scheme amendment also adopted by council is going through a process the public process the CMA objection is substantial and it steams alone there is no country data being presented to either dispute or in any way very what the catchment management authority has determined also note that in in past meetings that the other study area that was being considered at the same time as a study area where this particular property is located the council has expressed no concerns with the CMA flood modeling behavior I also note that in the planning team amendment to the CMA will be a determining authority whereas at the present time there a referral Authority I think that any move or any suggestion that we move away from what the catchment management authority and or ignore the very strong objections of the resident would be most misguided by council and I strongly endorse and recommend the adoption of this motion Thank You counselor hazel and council person I editors a great proposal in so many ways will be great for the region of us to go ahead that advice has been that CMA will not support it on flood level issues and we received additional avoid legal advice that their advice is correct and what and where its proposed the bay I 'd be supporting it but I can 't support when it keeps in the normal fog like could any other counselor wishing to speak against this motion counselors very first the notice of motion for us tonight is to refuse its application I thank the officers for their diligence in preparing the necessary documentation to enable us as counselors to make an informed decision return to the application itself I want to clarify the role of counselors in this decision making process in our role we must not prejudge an application we must consider all the relevant facts and not consider irrelevant facts we 're making these determinations we must be open to both sides of the argument we must consider all relevant issues and not make a decision based upon morality or wise having said that we are entitled to have a strong view as to how we feel our community should develop and must retain an open mind to listen to any contrary argument way of information and the range of competing values and perspectives and be open to be persuaded I am comfortable in the context of the current application that I have done so I acknowledge that as recently as this morning there was a further legal advice provided to assist us in our determination as to the application itself by way of observation on note there eight objectives I note that the proximity of the objectives was close to the potential development I respect their democratic right to object I further note that it does not appear anywhere in the report that the harness racing club is one of those objectives I note that the application is not supported by the offices because it has the potential to impact on the continuation of primary production land and potential conflict between ongoing farming activities and the proposed rule living uses in surrounding areas even that the proposed development has its roots in a quasi agricultural basis I 'm unable to be satisfied to the requisite standard that the conflict is any a notion to support the refusal of the application on that basis agriculture by definition is a science out of practice of cultivating the soil producing crops raising livestock and degree the preparation and marketing of the resulting products applying that commonly accepted definition to this application I would surmise that in fact it doesn 't meet the criteria and will value add to the ongoing farming activities in around the area as in my view based on the material has roots in agriculture no pun intended the proposed use is contrary to the endorsed GV harness and greyhound pressing feasibility and study and master plan this it would seem still has a lot of gray in the final position there is legal advice in existence in a gain I 've considered that advice and it does not mitigate exclusively against approval of set applications I council area would you like an extension deaconess more counselors in agreement carry on thank you there are two studies we can consider the golden broken catchment management study of 2002 and the more recent incomplete Shepherd and Moreta study there is no planning management of saris what a determining what really counts I was variable so in cancellation I take clarification that 's because my understanding is the adoption of the racing precinct also initiated the planning scheme amendment process you clarify that mr. to Harriet there are at gnam you comment on that please okay in John what time is it no it takes it all to the master plan for the investigation area and a plain skimmer movement is currently underway but has not been formally endorse for English in the planning stages thank you carry on but a Management Authority another determining referral authority but rather a referral Authority and with recourse to the state government referral and notice provisions planning practice note number 54 of jun 2015 it states that a responsible authority being council must consider the recommending referral authorities advise but it is not obliged to refuse the application or to include any recommended conditions a recommending referral authority can seek a review of BK different objects to the grounding of a permit or recommends conditions at not included in the firmament by the responsible authority in it does not appear that the proposed proposal contains its requirement that this is something that could be overcome by further consultation to take a leaf out of councillor summers book given there is discretion for council to approve I look at it in the veins of the application applicant is asking Council to exercise this discretion in support of the proposal I have considered all material and relevant issues I ignorance acknowledge that this is a balancing act that the proposal was about opportunity to bring a substantial development of the community to value-added measured against negative outcomes I believe it should not be refused Thank you Thank You counselor is very and you have a council we can you speak against this motion councillor summer I just speak against the motion basically it comes down to the same reasons why of Egypt objected along the way and that is that our own flood study the council flood study that was done still remains quite tentative so I 'm basing this on the fact that model zoe council so much which part are you referring to the current one the sort of charting chalk line membership anna maria bella marie flood intelligence project mapping project that 's the 100 clearly the shepherd America mapping for future reference so I was just saying that that model was not completed by the CMA we we completed that ourselves through a consultant the CMA is the responsible authority and today they have not endorsed our plan this flood study has not yet been the subject of an amateur but I think that 's true yeah I 'm not to pretend that mr. reggie rhett and we meant to refer you again what was it common to a need clarification EMA has formally endorsed the marina shepherd and plan plan they have been one councils partners in terms of developing the flood study in the flood mapping work that answer your question good carry on the cma have not endorsed our study the flood study has not yet been subject to the amendment of the planning scheme we may have lodged an application for a planning scheme amendment that as yes we still don 't know whether it will be successful and legal yet a seriously entertained planning proposal on the proviso that it has not yet been made into a planning amendment so also with the legal advice that we received today pointed out lots of gray areas it took a position but if you read between the lines we can definitely see that it 's not a seriously entertained planning proposal and it won 't be seriously entertained until the subject of an amendment to the plan until it becomes subject to an amendment of the planning scheme also this flood mapping is incomplete it 's only really for that specific area has not been endorsed by the responsible authority or even by council for that matter it doesn 't mean that we shouldn 't consider our local mapping but we are tasked with disbalance enact and in my opinion we should err on the side of procedural fairness and base our decision on the 2002 CMA flood study as that is more likely to hold weight at a tribunal as they are the authority on this so we are able to commission a flood study for our own reference we and incomplete it arguably does not hold weight over and above the current authorized 2002 CMA flood study they will both be considered if it gets to our tribunal this is true but they may not be given equal weight we may not win so until the flood study is complete to CMA cannot in Dorset with them CMA have merely waiting on two steps here one they 've given in-principle support for the Greyhound master plan and two they 've objected to this application based on councils own flood study which are fine surprising so we 're here to assess the proposal and I believe it should be allowable it 's a multi-million dollar venture and I prefer that counsel take a position that examines the granting of a permanent favorably and look at both sides counselor or as very was saying earlier and I believe if we gave them some time to actually put together the chmp that covers the entire development site within the activity area we 'd have more time to look at both sides of the argument particularly is some councils have been following this around us with roller which would know finished good thank you any other council wishing to speak for the motion council Abdullah just a few points the intended tourism and economic benefits of the proposed views and development of land are offset by some important aspects of the application some of which includes number one this land is within farming zone and the use of land is unrelated to agriculture it is mainly focused on accommodation not related to agriculture number two the land is in the flood wave zone and lent an lsi role and subject to inundation in this context council had referred this application to CMA which is a referral authority in this application the responsible authority being the council which must consider the recommendations of the referral authority the CNE has objected to the proposal proposed development application as majority of the side is located in flood Wayland which means that if this development goes ahead there is a risk that it could result in danger to life and property in addition to CMA Council has also sought another independent assessment from water technology they have developed due to flood depths given the fact that both subject matter experts that is CMA and water technology have given similar recommendations that is unsuitability of the land for proposed use and development I 'm confident about the rationale behind the council 's recommendation for this applications diffusal I also know that the applicants have not provided the on flood risk report if such a report was available it could have been taken into account to further evaluate the recommendations given by CMA and water technology in the absence of this expert flood report CMA and Water Technologies recommendations are the only guiding reports reports available to use in decision-making on this subject there are other aspects of this application such as we care has previously refused the similar application on same grounds in addition to this this cultural heritage management plan provided was not complete and it did not cover the entire development site these to me are compelling reasons to support the overall recommendation to refuse this planning permit application on the basis of current information available I do not find any grant for any grounds of views and recommendations Thanks point of clarification for some of you we should say something can I please have a point of clarification what is that point of clarification a CMA flood with mapping results which was the first one from 2002 would the applicant have been allowed to build on that land if we were still using that old flood model I don 't have that answer when I 'm sure mr. reggie rhett and may have some view on that I know agent the applicant 's proposition the one that 's before if the flood mapping we used was from 2002 most of the entire application and we got advice from the catchment management Authority the current application location on a flood zone under the 2002 CMA flood mapping you mr. Edgerton mr. Herriot may currently answers this is like we approached the thing they actually take they do consider and it 's not the CMAs for a catchment means my plane management plan by shepard and floodplain management flame because the although the CMA I thing goes on the sailors under that generally that when the council goes the point that the CMA do refer and the legal advice actually mentioned this that reference is made to range of information that 's available including the 2002 floodplain management strategies that counsel put together as well as the latest information in the intelligence report that 's progressively being developed not finished progressively being developed and it 's not surprising that if we only wanted to consider the question was if we get only consider the together to study what would be the result what we don 't know because when this has been referred to the CMA they 've actually done what the legal advise suggest that they should do they 've considered both the previous adopted strategy of 2002 and the latest available information to them when avoid my question was whether it was on a flood zone under the 2002 some of you three mr. chair I can tell you under page 32 of council 's agenda lists the current zoning as well as the overlays that currently exist oversight and four counts of information that 's the farming zone 2 and the land submission and the cmhc doesn t she 's based on the 2002 catch bait on the current that line my question is higher authorized modeling what that showed just answer that land subject to inundation the current planning provisions for that land indicates of the lands in the farming zone 2 and a land subject inundation overlay is on the intelligence model based on the 2002 current slide megamix this council has adopted that land is a rager ettim just said you know farming 's own hand it is land subject to inundation as opposed to makes overlay flood plain she 's answer you decide if it doesn 't make reference to which blood study they 're actually looking at in the text what I 'm not going to get any references said thank you mr. rajaratnam for your input to have any other councils we should speak before this motion well how about you speak to a counselor sudden will decide whether it 's for I think it 's a fantastic opportunity for us to get the caravan park and the horse farm because I think it would be very beneficial but then taking into account the CMA objection the state 's planning policies grammar to the council planning scheme and the lawyer 's advice I 'm just not sure that I can agree to disagree with their recommendation right so ultimately you 're in favor of refusing this permit application that you are for the motion then good any other council we can speak for against Kessler just like only one of everybody else is something I 've got a favor found this particular application and the process that we followed to be extremely difficult to get down to the nitty-gritty of the tin tacks if you like we come as a new counselor I think we 've are sufficient questions of staff to make a determination in this and I think that probably what is wave my decision mean is the fact that we have received the advice from staff we have received the advice from our legal representatives I think going back in my working days I think if we we would be remiss not to accept that information as I think we could be seen as possibly I will vote accordingly when I get there how dare you will any other council we should further comment for or against this motion so good that being said councillor hazel in any closing comments i 'm sure you 've been waiting for this yeah i was angry so you think she listened to the discussion i I am take out the point that Cancellara 's are innate about counselors role I think counselors role in these particular matters is very very clear and it 's defined defined as saying our role is to administer the planning and environment act and for their role is and that means we take into account all of the legislation regulations and statutory requirements that 's what we deal with and I think through this process we have explored that ad infinitum we 've now come to yes a decision time also note that people who may be of a mind to think well you know we would like to approve this process I think it 's quite good but from my perspective I 've never had a briefing in relation to what this to that information but in my time here we 've never had a briefing from the applicant in terms of the operation of what their tourist proposal is all about so in that respect this application is actually silent in terms of the benefits that can be obtained from this so people talking about what a great proposal it may well be that hasn 't been tested hasn 't been tested here I haven 't seen a business case in relation to this proposal all I 've heard about it other counselors talking about it and if people were of a mind to support this proposal it may well be that counsels role is perhaps as councillor Patterson with indicating maybe we should be finding or assisting these people find another bit of dirt to put their proposal on if it is a such benefit to the region building a mindful of is to that in the discussion if people were thinking about an approval process we haven 't_''_3740.349 at this stage seen anything in relation to planning permit conditions for such an approval there 's broad speculate I just direction will be giving our staff if there was a motion to come forward to say literature to prove it and I would think that would be a very very inappropriate motion the questions raised about the 2002 sled study and if i 'm not mistaken i would very strongly argue that the previous application on this block of lang through a very similar proposal was considered by counsel and vcat under the 2002 blood study there was in operation at the time and was rejected under that flood study so you can infer from that what you like but previously this land is being considered as inappropriate for this type of development and the newer flood information that has come forward probably only makes that some or even difficult hurdles to get across the other thing I 'll remind counselors of at a briefing two weeks ago I asked the planning officers could counsel hazel is your like intention is Bruce Lee thinking we will not really spawn years laughs that 's relevant it all in agreement to extend don 't use emotion because relates to the role of the planning officers if they could give me a precedent in this municipality or elsewhere around Victoria of where a musical authority had ignored the CMAs approved model of flood behavior and the silence was deafening they couldn 't give me a president of where a council had taken the action that has been considered or inferred by some councillors he denies I think the only course of action available to councillors under our role is administering the planning and environment act is to endorse the officers recommendation that of course leaves all of the other stakeholders and process would be appeal rights at week at in place subsequent submissions to the planting scheme amendment process and indeed the panel 's Victoria process itself so nothing is happening here this evening of this motion is successful is denying rights to anybody it 's in fact just seeming this is ultimately it does end up at the cat it seems it to another forum and a different level to be determined so I 'm strongly recommending that counselors adopt the recommendation Thank You councillor hose on that all said who 's Division the net or against go for division councillor hazel Minh I is carried the motion is carried I 'll call four divisions to me now all invader please Hank my satin besides I campus giovannetti councillor hazel and council Abdullah councillor Patterson councillor a case against cassila I was very councillor some accounts added items 9.3 page 15 on page 51 councils of the agenda item nine point we planned pivot 2016 test 331 you some development of the land for a caravan park a lot of the right one here yes I have including local projects island restaurant the recommendation neck council on patriot or less a council wishing to view the recommendation as emotion same thing that the council wishing to do this motion please recommendation so he can for Patterson go second to please our second counselor hazel in careful Patterson yet disposal all being said and done same scenario we have to leave the overriding issue you see flood mitigation problems and they 're both covered it good counselor Hayes 1 i 'm looking to revisit the previous debate mr. here but yeah nothing 's drawn the same level of objections through on the same objection from the catchment management authority and I think the all of the argument we had previously applies to this area or blamed equally thank you any council 's wishing to speak against this fashion answers we shouldn 't you speak for the motion as a person and closing comments when covered thank you countess yep good client all in favor of the motion clearly chantix I can 't see sorry against motion carried you can 't have a division certainly all in favor of the motion again please councillor Sutton Council giovanetti councillor hazel Minh counselor Abdullah counselor Patterson chat keith against counselor I was very counselor from accountable councils item number nine points okay 89.4 the Heritage grant guidelines for 2017 there 's a recommendation on page 68 we have a council wishing to move that as the motion sorry move the recommendation as a motion on page 68 would you like to read data House Counsel summer that 's council endorsed the greatest ship in an heritage grants program to adopt the Heritage grants guidelines 2017 and grants program in the 2017-18 financial year and allocate 25,000 to the program thank you you have a seconder fella I 'm in full support of this we do offer around three hundred thousand dollars for grants in the community this one is very new we 've lost so much heritage over the years and much of it is hidden behind the saccade of existing buildings you can walk through and look up the deal underneath the awnings and some of these shopkeepers have stripped off to the outer layer and you can see all this beautiful tapestry underneath I 've seen old pictures of high street when the entire strip had awnings over the footpath which is just wonderful and we 're talking about this grant and possibly we could get joint grant applications that could result in something that involved in an entire street scene the tops of buildings tidied up with very impressive results I really believe that some kind of incentives for property owners to restore and showcase all the hidden or lost heritage that we 've got is a step in the right direction we campus enough can 't_''_4212.719 do it yeah I would like to say that the recommendation to support heritage grants program and guidelines will promote a much-needed conservation of heritage sites in our means ality it is good to see some important steps by the council to preserve and maintain our heritage size sites negligence and lack of care of these significant sites would only mean that for our future generations there would be no trace of their cultural heritage it is essential to pass on sense of pride and legacy to our next generations by preserving our heritage sites now providing financial assistance for maintenance of these heritage sites on dollar to dollar magic funds is an important step in the right direction that would promote sense of participation and ownership in these endeavors having the Heritage grants guidelines will ensure that the award decisions are following principles of good governance that is transparency and accountability in awarding such grants based on well thought-out_,_4272.07 eligibility criteria thanks you cancel abdullah aim carefully wishing to speak against this version for the motion council patterson 's or just like only support especially if do we have and the bazaars of shops in Shepherd the hidden the presence of our brain is in France it looks like there are that they 're only babies compared to what 's up in the bazaar I think as time goes by and people realize that there and they properly restored and tiny big cetera we have a lot more history in our town we believe we have the newest and old buildings albums building those sort of buildings they 're all there it 's all up in the front of them and that you just can 't_''_4315.42 say look present unless you have to be highly at elevators which sometimes we all are so yeah I 'm really looking for the future I think cam will will be known for a lot of our heritage is a lot of the older heritage stuff around Victoria 's wooden which won 't last that these are all brick and they 're gonna last and it 's important to look after good thank you any other council wishing to speak against for councillors summer closing comments at all been five councillors on page 73 Asia fruit logistica expo Hong Kong September six states in 2017 there 's a recommendation on page 70 so you have a counseling to move that recommendation as a motion counselor giovanetti to the second two please sounds or suttin eligibility as mr. me um I think this is the first time that will be participating in this Expo from I believe I think it 's a great opportunity for the greater shepparton City Council to attend this Expo together with growers from throughout the region to try to engage in businesses in China to come and purchase our products that we have here in in Shepparton and surrounding areas there 's a minimal cost associated with this particular trip and I think it will long-term be very worthwhile I 'm just king of your pants on fire Bruce other thing one is the normal high councilor obviously who will Kane happy agent fruit logistica as well as a council officer and it 's accepted me to nominate FAFSA not me well thank you against Allah to Eddie oh that 's it you ok fantasy note that it 's important that we participate in this sort of expert which growers to fetch the Chinese business people so that we can find new markets in Asia and grow our business Thank You counsel Sutton ad council we can just speak against this version council Osama to comment well I 'm in two minds and I 'm going to listen to the debate and I do understand that this is important to build relations to exports to China and I 'm just tentative because we haven 't yet adopted the International Strategy which we 've listed later in the agenda but we haven 't tried it yet so the policy is listed as item 4.1 in the international strategy is not done so we haven 't actually measured the merits of this trip against any set criteria we 've just been told that it 's a good idea and maybe it is but my understanding is that this event is an annual event so there 's really little urgency to be pushing ahead so quickly I just would like to know that it 's really worth our an outright objection it would just be more of a deferral until we get our ducks in a row 12 the strategy that will be adopting later on Thank You counsel some are any other counsel I wishing to speak for the motion because I was very Thank You mr. mayor fortune favors the brave these a day I just roll off and a loose lips the reality is you 're thinking about seizing opportunity there 's no like there 's no time like today and we plan ourselves as being pro-business proactive searching out new markets trying to support and endorse our growers touting ourselves with great things happen year campaign as a food bowl of Australia we need to generate impetus and in order to generate impetus we need to go to the coal face from the coal face is Asia and this Expo is the hub and that 's where it all happens and talks cheap actions expensive and procrastination is endemic you might have heard that a few times I 've got married a few times but the reality is that all those three key words recommendation of emotion and I wholeheartedly support Thank You counselors rarity any council we can speak against for council Patterson I think you can just one point I believe council summoner 's point if this is carried it 's a resolution of count I 'm everywhere else happens as far as I 'm concerned I think other speakers are unto it thank you have a great opportunity it 's a time where there is lots and lots of opportunities for places like goulburn valley to promote themselves and if we sit near back side and watch it all go past it will desert the biggest key tonight excited to forget we 've got to get out of here we 're going to make it happen we can 't afford to let it happen has speed done it takes a totally supportive take your council person any other council wishing to speak for against the motion careful abdullah for you couple comments yes it is time to strongly showcase our region 's fresh fruit produced to potential markets in asia it will build up councils relationship with local businesses and agriculture enhanced credibility about our local fresh food offerings to the overseas markets and investors i 'm sure it will be a positive step towards developing important trade relationships with overseas market it will be interesting to note the experiences gained from council 's participation in the expo and how we could use that experience in aligning our efforts and initiatives to buyers needs so that is really important Thank You counsel Abdul or any other cancer we did cancer that case I was actually supposed to be involved in expose how this coming weekend with my business obviously that 's not going to happen now I do that because I can 't do anything looking at an investment in my business other but this the same way as counsel in our community it 's investing putting ourselves out there on the world stage we will walk away learning something and anything is worth learning so I absolutely support this I invested in my own business I see it as an opportunity and I think that 's what we should be looking no information knowledge as we can and get joining there Thank You counselor ok the other council meeting to comment they 're being too careful driven any closing comments favorite we 're talking about start out with this yeah discussion 80 pounds ladies really like that 's beside the point what counselor oh sorry said before is very important we need to be proactive in this area if we 're not proactive things can pound inspire I think if we look at our values that we obsessed as a council leadership and innovation are two of them and I think this particular motion imitates to our community that we are pleased as in what we are losing their area and the PRP divide you 've been trying to encourage business to do business in Shepherd good thing grounds Thank You counselor I would comment but would have to leave the chair for me to comment I 'm sure we don 't want to upset council okies with a dodgy animals moment motor vehicle will be broken before that 's being settled councillors all in favor inversion against Kerry item nine point six councillors the proposed friendship city relationship status a recommendation on page 77 Clovis Council wishes to move this recommendation as a motion I 'll cancel Patterson to have a second to please cheer for divinity Council Patterson oh yes where we have friendship city agreements with lots of different cities and regions around the world and probably one of my criticisms of council we haven 't basically followed through with them we 've basically state with some of them just visit every four or five years when you put a dinner on for them cost us a few dollars and away they go as far as I 'm concerned they 're a waste of time we need to work at them and this one is one we need to work out and I love the the sunset clause there are five years and the 12 months review which will happen having said 25 years I don 't think it is there now but to be 12 months review to make sure it is working we have to have a growing of fish with countries and regions that we actually can and our ratepayers can get a return I know from the bottom so I 'm looking forward to it working and before the work very well there 's being great connection between our mirror and that region already so I hope that continues on and it will be something we can really look forward to in the future as far as serving our ratepayers well with increased export opportunities and that the jobs and the growth that goes with it Thank You counsel Patterson before our scans virginity to speak of murders add some more information to this on Wednesday the officials from jingshan will be visiting well on Wednesday they 'll be and also he says they stand corrected melbourne and will be attending myself and the CEO for the signing of this document it 's this motion passes tonight and it will be hosted by the pregnant of course as well so there 'll be a series of friendship status type agreement signed that evening between number of municipalities and other cities from the gin soup province and jin chen will be the one that will be obviously signing with so as I said this regional isolated relationship in itself this is fully supported by the Victorian Government and by the premier personally sorry careful Jimmy Nikki would you like to thank you oh thank you mr. where I come hell of a long life which sorting office on really have a nice sub schedule that was obviously woman just as a council Patterson was mentioned earlier I think it 's very important that we develop those relationships and it 's good that we 've gone back and reviewed some of the prior relationship CPS Energy Council Patterson indicated some of it was an ugly a waste of money so I think that 's fair and reasonable to delete those as a sister cities and work with new opportunities as I said before and obviously contain is one that we can work cohesively with and develop business associations with there 's a rat the municipality good thank you any council wishing to speak against this am I was wishing to speak for the motions at the point of clarification is the miracle in relation to the gym tan district what sort of population by dint hundred thousand mark the province that they fit into which is jen sue province is approaching 200 million people and just for added information they have the third largest solar manufacturing plant in china in this content so that 's sort of great interest I think potentially to greater scheper sorry other councils we just speak against 44 council summer I think so you can throw oh I 'll just say what I 'm saying so I cannot have preferred that this was considered at a time after we 've endorsed the international strategy that I 've already mentioned the strategy and how important this is moving forward but I guess we 've were quite busy astok about all this which is I guess terrific make shipping and greater but as has been mentioned already we do have a number of government friendships city agreements that have been identified in the strategy and they are either in need of review or of revival so in an ideal world we should probably be testing our resources on the ones we already have as friendship cities rather than entering into new agreements international relations so we want to export allow produce and grow our regional growth product and my understanding which we 've heard is that the friendship city agreement has already progressed to the point where in town representatives will be visiting shepparton on Friday and there are premier appointments to be held so I 'm told as mr. mayor mentioned that they are major producers of solar panels and other prosperous pursuits could be opportunity so rather than risk offending them there 's no immediate effect expense here I do agree that a friendship city should progress and I 've every trust in offices that targets will be set to justify this outcome setting targets for friendship daddy target for friendship yes I think any other council wishing to add comment for again then council person closing time solving captain thank you thank you all in favor inch motion carried item nine point seven yes on page 83 you can always develop a tourism and major event strategy for 2017 to 2021 can I suppose there 's a year recommendation on page 83 any council we to move this recommendation second up please cancel I was very careful summer I think the best way to describe this is to read a paragraph out of the agenda we 're endorsing the economic development tourism and major events strategy and I believe it 's already working generally ratepayers would come up to me and tell me all these terrible things that are happening in the municipality of what are we doing about them but lately since we 've been having so much success around events people have been coming up and saying congratulations so in the last five years of my experience that 's very refreshing so I 'd like to commend the staff on that so I 'll read this paragraph so people understand what some of the priorities are some of the key projects include establishing a grant process that will allow for incentives of new small businesses to commit operation within the region CBD revitalization initiatives support the development of friars street as the food strip of the CBD facilitate opportunities pertaining to investment in solar within the region develop an international engagement strategy to guide council and its international opportunities implement structural reform to the approach to tourism some of its delivery support and facilitate the development of contemporary tourist product along the Goulburn river and support the development of contemporary arts and cultural tourism which engages and attracts new markets and to the development of food tourism so that sounds very exciting and I 'll be looking forward to how they roll this out all right Thank You councillor some that council I was very nice I comment any council wishing to speak against this motion for the motion councillor Patterson 's the end of this is one thing that we 've done really well when I say where 's counsel most start have done better ones we 've done it we are getting a real reputation for the vin CD and there 's lots and

to move that recommendation as the motion only miss me councillor giovannetti a second to please councillor chief councillor gym-ready wish to speak to that catcher keynote council we should just speak to or for that no all in favor of the motion carried item 6.1 is a summary Buescher memorial proposed site location council wishing to move any motions relevant to that else la sutton i 'll be at that mansion as people on page 22 have a second to please alpha giovannetti cancel something you should speak to the motion yes I 'd like to speak to this motion the committee has looked at various locations around shepparton and they 've decided they would like to rescind this previous motion because they believe there 's a better place to put it and accept the proposed location of mana monash park because it 's close to the War Memorial and it 's in keeping with this area so that 's why I 'd like to do Thank You counselor given any would you like but also that the family of summary Busia also agree with the change in the location so i think that 's an important factor as well ok any other councillors wishing to speak against this motion he counsels wish to speak for the motion bly to quickly speak thank you I think it 's quite amazing the history of this summary who 's you he was a dedicated like dedicated life Horseman in the First World War of course he was deputy premier victoria from 1922 1930 his victoria dated general in london 1936 he had a very distinguished career and how lots and lots positions in government authorities after the war so he is knighted in 1938 so it is very important that we recognize people have had a big input in our history and this is certainly one that 'll be great to see the stuff though dude Thank You counsel Patterson any other counsel wishing to speak for or against this motion miss miss to me the original decision from the committee proposing this memorial indicated the preferred site was going to be in the Queens Gardens the the scale and the size of the statues it certainly wasn 't going to be appropriate in the Queen 's garden so they 've really looked at that proposal and came up with with monash Park and of course in the process updating of the monish Park master plan will need to be undertaken to incorporate the location of the statute that will of course then provide an opportunity for public comment in respect to that that you master plan and any member of the public who is particularly keen to see what the search is going to look like they 're on display in our foyer area and have been for some time good Thank You councilman cancel any other council sorry we should just speak for or against council certain any closing comments bloom favor against motion carried I suppose we have a recommendation on page nine I 'm respect to the contract 6169 three phrases now I 've gone past 6 a-6 this flu x is really very pay six councillors a proposed closure in court bowl abutting lot 30 Marlborough driving kayla to have a 'll move it mr. mayor Patterson do I have a seconder councillor hazelnut councillor Patterson is this is a change of plan route our mobile drive base to the end of my overdrive it 's a very big balloon at the end of it is around about and the new development that 's going out there it needs to have a few slight adjustments to it and they sort of lay the new estate to continue on and build through there so it 's only very minor and all the locals are more than happy with good counselor hazel an interesting military procedure mr. mayor and submissions are being sought the point of debate where the pros and cons will come to the fore when any of those submissions come back and be considered by council so let it go out with the community have their comments on it I think I agree with counsel Patterson that will be a fairly straightforward process any councillor wishing to speak against this motion any councillor wishing to speak for the motion causal Patterson any closing comments all in favor against motion carried the awarding of the contracts councillors there 's recommendation on page 9 I have any council wishing to move this recommendation as the motion Oh else lagera literally drove a seconder old circular mr. me how 's Patterson councillors even if he I think he was mayor this burnt quality to conjecture about the cost of particular project both in the press and around the street to Shepherd I 'm recall several years ago I was involved with a group of people with a significant disability who wrote the council urging them to ensure that there were adequate toilet facilities available within the City of Greater shipping and CBD and this is the the app come from that particular from the particular discussion as well as the CBD redevelopment plan the cost is high but because of the specialized nature of some of the facilities that are going in there that 's the reason behind the higher than normal price I want to say either normal it does compare favorably with the cost per square meter of other toilet facilities that have been constructed in recent times within the City significant benefit to the population of the city yeah when they utilize the wall street and CBD areas good thank you cancel up council Patterson yes thank you oh just like the ad council Jennifer get a VT jr. I can get that your order yeah giovannetti and he said the million times I know I know some of the comments in the in the media about you know it 's been in that much money and yeah we 're not having that I priorities right for Melville to me the first thing the mel needs is a decent set of toilets these aren 't just toilets the booze news toilet says 110 thousand dollars provided by the state government for the disabled disability side of things so they are really out if you could say it they are alluding to the toilets in chippenham they have to be good and i think these people are criticized would be criticizing us again if we did a cheap job I 've be still on earth so I think we 're doing the right thing it is a lot of money for pipework has to be changed so there 's Russian lb on that we weren 't completely convinced at last meeting that 's why I left the table and it 's counselors I believe we 've done due diligence on that and looked at all those figures and I am now happy to second this I think as I said you know you probably want to tracked a lot of people to Mel with a good set of toilets but you 'll send a lot of people away with a bad set so I think it 's important we do this right and we do it there 's no you 're sinking down the track five years we should have done it properly and done a good set when we 're doing it so I believe we 're doing the right thing ok Thank You counsel Patterson any counselor wishing to speak against the motion has been in favor of the motion in a moment you will yes okay and thank you mr. mayor look I do absolutely agree that the phrase of Street toilets are in desperate need of work deserve to have you know a much better facility however my objection is going over the budget in such a huge way being at least 150 1,000 above the estimate I just find that you know really hard to understand how we could get that figure way above our estimates so I 'm look I feel we need to absolutely do something do we can 't_''_630.81 go to this level of cost i 'm still trying to justify that i just simply feel that perhaps we need to revisit this and see what our options could be i just find it really hard to perhaps except that this we could go that far over our estimate Thank You counsel O 'Keefe any other cancer wishing to speak for the motion council Abdullah thank you just a few comments one of the common complaints from from shoppers and visitors in Shepparton CBD has been the lack of decent public toilet facility the one that caters to the needs of people with all abilities and their caregivers there has been a strong demand for an improved public toilet in the CBD and as I understand it was refurbished five years ago and is now at a stage where the existing building cannot support the additional infrastructure required hence the plan is to demolish the current wallet building and construct a brand new toilet building in phases three phrases to be development development is consistent with the overall CBD redevelopment strategy that aims to revive economic activity and bring more shoppers and visitors in the CBD having a high quality attractive and all-inclusive public toilet building in a high-profile CBD location will only complement the redevelopment of CBD in n rejuvenation of mod Street more on surface yes it looks expensive it 's an expensive project on surface however they are certain aspects of the project that must be taken into account when comparing its costs with that of any other toilet or public toilet for that matter some of those aspects include number one building a toilet for private or residential use is different from building a public toilet that has to adhere to a range of public safety regulations and quality standards also when we think about the dollar amount required personal supervision costs or project management costs they are not taken into account where is the public toilet construction costs such as this one does include these cost items so obviously any cost comparison between a private and public toilet construction could be misleading and it 's not comparable I understand number two the proposed fraser street public toilet is not just a standard accessible toilet as noticed by my fellow councillors it 's a rather high end toilet facility that includes includes features such as changing places toilet and parents room including feeding room our toilet and baby change facilities standard accessible toilets do not meet the needs of all and you know changing play six dollars are different to standard accessible toilets in that they have extra features and hence extra costs I also understand that the scope includes demolition of current toy toilet building hence an additional cost element is there and a rather restricted side access for demolition and construction is another unique feature of this toilet project another evidence of the overall costs going up I think the phrase is three toilets facility in CBD will be good thank you this extension we were all in favor of that so the only thing is that the fraser street toilet facility in CBD will cater to people with all abilities which is so important and it is you know the hundred and ten all ten k changing places fund has to be used within this car and financially as I understand so if it 's not built will perhaps lose that as well and that 's that 's I think that 's the main thing that I 'm in favor of that because of all these reasons thank you thank you any other council we should you speak for the motion councillor Sutton sarcasm in your beaten today I 've just agree with you seema and Dennis and Bruce I realize it 's a very costly project but i think this type of facility is required for many and if we don 't build it now we 're going to lose that money so I 'm agreement with the recommendation thank you any other council wishing to speak against immersion for the version Castle Iseman i we defer consideration of this item until this meeting because I had a number of questions I want to answer for myself one of them obviously being around the price we are we getting value for money cost-benefit all that and the actual need and I think by getting some of those questions answered that it 's the pricing per meter is commensurate with with other constructions they 've been undertaken to produce public toilets is there a need I consistently hear people around seven over the last number of years bemoaning the lack of quality toilets in our in our central business district and on occasion being very critical or some of the toilets that are in operation many of which are private not count of that gets lost in the dory are we getting benefit yes I believe we are I think we are getting actual quality product and i 'm also very mindful that the grant that we received that 's been renegotiated a couple of times around this project has the potential to be lost if you want to move in a different direction look and but then the council gets criticized on every level of expenditure so this won 't be any different but i think what we are going to see is that in our in our CBD as the community and patrons in the cvd you 've been asking for for a long time we are going to produce a very good quality public facility for the usage and thank you can so hazel minh there is no one left to speak anyway now we 've all gone through councillor giovannetti would you like any closing comments if victories to me I don 't really need to make any too many closing comments because I think it 's been very well summed up all the other councils who have spoken I do take on board counsel O 'Keefe concern relating to the cosplay web from the estimate to the final price and I think that that is something the council needs to be cognizant of and also to ensure that in the future the estimates that are provided to councillors are as accurate as what they can possibly believe that being said all division mr. me d declare the motion carried first and then all in favor again please councillor Sutton councillor giovannetti councillor hazel and councillor Adams counselor abdul a counselor Patterson against counselor o 'keefe next item is six point not sleep point at all point for sorry we 've got the egg to Alaska contract 1752 old leaky road upgrade between Drummond road and doors road in Shepparton ave Council wishing to move the recommendation on page age 14 pleased to meet over the recommendation printed on page 14 of the agenda I have a seconder please i 'll ship edison councillor hazel in '_``_1108.94 oh this is a a fantastic project because for one of their major east-west arterioles this has been a a major blight for a number of years that section of road for a lot of people the volumes of traffic that it carries on a daily basis it is not after the standard you anticipate in a major provincial city this work has been long overdue and very pleasing to see that it 's got to this stage now and will be constructed at the go over old sores and raise old issues no doubt this major upgrade of that road is going to increase the volumes of traffic on that road and by extension will significantly increase the volumes of traffic that will use Andrew fairly Avenue well provide the final nail in the coffin for those who aspire Thank You counsel hazel and Kinsler Patterson oh yes I totally support councilman 's comments and there 's eight thousand vehicles use that road every day and eleven percent of them are heavy vehicles and that will only increase with Packman expanding their output he 's comment regarding soon be fairly evony I think very pertinent that 's going to become very important and still open so yeah looking forward to it having that old road done it it is really crept up over the years to come very very Sarafian needs doing urgently and it gives us great access or the factories down there great access to the bypass good thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this motion any other council which in turn further comment speaking for the motion and okay be myself and at least one other person in this room regularly uses that road on two wheels and i think i think our respective backsides will be much pressure with this work being done duly noted counselor zealand well he 's reproducing something fresh to the discussion yeah something god did jim is being fresh but anyway all in favor of the motion against motion carried items 7.1 on page 18 counselors in regard to the section 86 Committees of management membership appointments to have a counselor wishing to move the motion in relation to the recommendation councillor Keef we have a seconder yeah cancel Patterson cancel O 'Keefe yeah look I just think it 's really important that we

good counselor Patterson uh yeah look we speak long and hard about our volunteers we all know would be down the gurgler without them today with whether you appreciate the ones to help can 't_''_1313.14 think the ones that have provided years of service as well any other council wishing to speak against this motion before the motion councillor giovanetti I can only read it right what the other two councils have mentioned I think it 's a fantastic that people are prepared to put up their hand in a voluntary capacity to work on these community committees and I think that as council Erik Keef indicated before it 's bulb on us as a council to support these groups as much as we possibly can good thank you any other council wishing to swim against the motion now for the motion good

inserted Oates currently allowances for category two councils proceeds do have a council wishing to move a motion just looking in or any do I have a seconder please answer giovanetti councillor hazel minh the minister for local government banking December authorized a two point five percent increase the allowances which mark from my recollection understanding the council did adopt at it 's December council meeting it did there is a provision though that the excellence relevant sections of the local government act is that public notice of that decision needs to be made bring this into effect and the public invited to comment on on the council decision so this in effect is a fairly administrative sort of process that 's giving effect to that public consultation component and the will be in the Shepherd of news outlining the the intention and inviting public comment which be the council will hold a special council meeting to hear and consider those submissions Thank You counselor counselor giovanetti Alpha Council hazel one is covered at all very well any councillor wishing to speak against this motion I 'm that hard to believe but they were the case any council

yuma corbin allen thank you for your input counselor petterson any other council wishing to speak for or against make the comment that I think we should spend the increase within the municipality yes my parents will be a Telugu for the way sir birthday good all in favor against motion carried item 8.2 I think page 28 the January 27 2017 monthly financial report to our Council wishing to move the motion a motion yes counselor Japan itchy have a second to please alpha Sutton just to be clear the motion is that the council receiving note that January 2017 monthly financial report council giovanetti I think I 'll take over from councillors vary as to his normal stance with this particular recommendation mr. handball yes and that I 'll ask mr. tights on to perhaps give us an overview over the financial report for the period up to and including end of January mr. title if you will q mr. mayor and threw you to the counselors if I can refer to the attachments start I think on page 111 of the agenda operating performance as reported in previous reports our rates and charges so recognizing total in advance and hence the year-to-date_``_1750.72 actual is on operating performance adjusted underlying surplus as a percentage of underlying revenue is quite high that is will come down to roughly in line with the adopted forecast of rates and charges received in advance in our cash balance being reasonably high at this time of year is running at three hundred and twelve point two percent that again will come back down closer to the normal operating range of somewhere around one hundred and fifty percent or slightly more by the end of the financial year financial obligations is showing what our current loan borrowings as a centage of rates is yet a date actually somewhat lower than the adopted forecast and the adopted budget at this stage and that 's because we took the opportunity to pay down a loan that had come out of a fixed interest period into a variable interest period and with will eventually refinance that into a cheaper interest rate at some point in the future the following page shows a traffic light report and as discussed in previous council meetings user charges has continued to be unfavorable against budget and that 's largely due to the amount of youth charges we 've received through the cosgrove landfill site at a report item later in this agenda today you 'll we accurately reflect current market conditions on that pricing offsetting some of that reduction in income is a favorable materials and consumables not result and that 's Jude lower volumes going into the landfill we 're paying less in epa levies and some other costs so it 's largely the variances the capital expenditure at this point in time is tracking pretty similar to next year and we 're confident that we 'll get the majority of the capital program completed by year-end I thank him is a total council sudden do you wish to add anything further thanks Chris you did good yeah the Council wishes to speak against this motion or the motion I just like make a comet always loved when we pay off a loan early half the fact we 're save an interest it clearly shows that council is an underling financial stress it 's a really good sign so yeah do approve of that that 's a very good point as a dividend you know I think Kara mr. tarsal is Kevin things adequately thank you all in favor against motion carried now item 8.3 a recommendation at the bottom of page 30 any council wishing to move that as a motion that 's what Patterson so you 're wrong what it was in check into place councilor chief counsel Patterson yes Isabel naturally our financial hardship policy unfortunately I have to use it very often it 's important it says so people understand there is somewhere to go if there is issues there wasn 't talk about i 'm reviewing it more regularly but basically it 's the same policy we 've heard for a while if we ever decide do your unseen circumstances we need to reveal we can review it straight away so i 'm more than happy the four years we 're only creating work for someone unnecessarily by doing it every year or two so totally support it 's a good policy it does allow for people get into hardship which is what it 's all about you never know who 's going to be there including yourself so it is important that we look after people that are stressing in this world and this policy does cover them good that well thank you any council we can speak against this version anyway I 'll speaking for now that being the case castle person any closing comments I figure all in favor against motion carried 8.4 counselors on page 34 our council a council planned progress report there 's a recommendation there does any council we should just to move that and I 'll just read it out I think it 's important the recommendation is that the council note the council planned progress report december two thousand sixteen which provides details in relation to achieving the two bullet points there one is the key strategic objectives identified in the council plan between 2030 and 2017 and key strategic activities contained within the 2016 2017 budget which will become counsels performance statement that is the recommendation councillor abdullah you wish to move that recommendation has the motion to have a seconder please as I giovannetti that 's lab door we should speak to it please so I would like to move the recommendation on page number 34 this is about the council plan the four-year council plan contains key strategic other plan it is important to regularly measure and track the performance of council plan council plan 2013-2017 is comprehensive and based around five strategic pillars namely active and engaged community enhancing the environment economic prosperity quality infrastructure and high-performing organization so the plan identifies 16 key objectives that are spread over these five pillars and for every pillar they are objectives and objectives have got strategies and strategies have got key strategic activities to implement those strategies one of the for instance I 'll just want to quote one of the pillars regarding active and engaged community where there was an objective to continue to enhance community capacity building and in regards to this objective the strategy was to develop and implement neighboring planning within shepparton and the key strategic activity for this strategy was to develop one plan and one locality plan endorsed now how to measure this activity the measurement of the result was the measurement was that they were they were stressing George 's throat plan and Shep East plan that were endorsed so just to give you an example that how this plan works and those interested community members who want to understand that depth and breadth of council activities and they also want to track progress of these activities this progress report is a very good starting point and hopefully they will be able to find some reasons to appreciate the hard work put together by counsel in making greater shepparton great so good work there slide areas of improvement obviously like any other plan there can be areas of improvement many objectives in this plan are about developing a strategy for example develop a strategy that identifies resources needed to attract new business and industry to be a chip it into greater shepparton I think it would be as going forward or in the next fans perhaps the aim should be to have the plan should have the implementation of recommendations from the strategy and to have it have the SMART goals kind of thing to make it more measurable and specific so yeah it 's a very good comprehensive plan and I think everybody who wants to know what the council is doing what the hell they are doing it 's all can say we do a counselor job Eddie I think you 're very thick just love do or has something up reason we will one of the things that has come out of our planning processes for the 2017 2020 our council plane is that we will be looking at a revival reporting format that is clear and concise and easily read for members of our community who wish to read it and I think it 's important part of our new plan coming forward thank you indeed any councillor wishing to speak against this motion any other counsel wishes to had comments for the motion yes I just like I could come and thank you i commend council Abdullah for her understanding of the plan said quickly probably understands it all better than I do and I been here for years since he 's only been here a couple of months the one thing about the current plan it isn 't easy to tick off as we 'd like to and we 're addressing that in our new plan that 'll be easy for people understand and will be completed that we 've kicked it off so yeah I 'm looking forward to that good never counseling to add comment full immersion or against and council Abdullah any closing comments no further comments thank you right all in favor yes motion carried item 8.5 councillors x 8.5 on page 37 report on the greater ship and city council general elections 2016 before we ask for a move of emotion on page 38 councillors there 's a slight type of graphical error on the second paragraph under economic impacts it currently states there are now identified social implications associated with report in fact it should read there no identified economic implications associated with this report so please note that we have a counselor wishing to move the recommendation as a version page 37 which clearly says that the council received the report from the Victorian Electoral Commission in relation to the greatest evident city council general elections 2016 he could councillor hazel min a second to please councillor chief councillor Hazelden me this is a requirement of the local government act that they see who were appointed to provide election provide a report and you could work through that report and try to our statistic our statistics but there 's a couple or I would like to comment on the number of ballot papers countered was 77.7 90 almost twenty-five percent of eligible people didn 't vote or invalid move out compared to the state average of seventy five point six seven that we decide to better than the rest of the state at the previous election though we did record turnout of eighty percent so our numbers dropped and the informal vote which was predicted what happened given the circumstances was 11.99 percent that was Aires with six percent for all post elections across the state and at the previous election in 2012 with 9.5 three percent so in terms of voter participation if we can plea deteriorate a position from the previous election Thank You councillor hazelnut council okay if you wish to comment now any council wishing to speak against dispersions for the motion I think just like make one quick comment on T reason for the high informal boat was there are so many good selections councillor hose them any closing comments wouldn 't follow that one out all in favor against motion carried now item eight point six councillors on 39 recommendation that the council note the publicly advertised contract awarded by the chief executive officer under delegated authority in tenders that have been advertised but not yet awarded to have a council wishing to move that recommendation as the motion before I do just let me just make another correction on the page 39 first paragraph that says tendered contracts awarded under delegated authority by the CEO in the one to fifth column it 's has more sink instructions listed as awarded to in fact it 's NL drainage so please make that correction counselors the council wishing to move the motion council giovanetti second to please as a medicine counselor giovannetti accused me as you indicated earlier this recommendation is to authorize the contracts that have been ordered on the delegation and and also the request for tenders that have gone out and as yet not been received standard process under our delegations policy both up Thank you Thank You counselor jebin ed any counselor wishing to speak against this version none any other counselor wishing to speak for back to you counselor do any other who 's winning they further comment mr. me thank you all in favor against motion carried yes indeed page forty-two counselors we have an item relation to the 2016 2017 quarter to forecast review it does on page 42 43 all the way to page 45 Council wishing to move that rather lengthy recommendation as the motion council Patterson seconder council O 'Keefe Thank You Castle person and there 's releasing key in this recommendation is enough to run about to council meetings on we split up probably how it should be says more understanding the parts i really do like about it is the fact that we now have a in our parks and open space we have the opportunity to charge market stall holders one hundred dollars instead of a considerable amount more for your your lines clubs your rotary clubs that are actually generating funds to the community i salute that and that is really good there is lots and lots of charges and through to understand them some have been taken away and put back in different forms to make it clearer Cosgrove as we we know there 's there 's been some issues there there is a section here that will hopefully it allow us to become more competitive you could nearly say there 's a rubbish Wars going on at present and we need to be fully armed and ready to go this gives us the freedom to attack so to speak when we need to and defend when we need to so I would encourage anyone that has an interest in their fees and charges to really have a good look right through it and lots of different amendments the planning applications etc very complicated all understandably correct and yeah I fully support it you can 't slow kiss yes look I agree with that and also obviously they 're not for profit organization they 're becoming much stronger in our region due to so much fundraising needed so I think this is a great step in that direction to really make sure it 's affordable for them to run if any counsel wishing to speak against the motion have anyone wishing to add further comments before the motion back to your counselor Patterson I think you open to being said all in favor of the motion against motion carried item 9.1 on page 52 council 's recommendation is that the council note the planning permit vcat development hearing panel and enforcement file information detailed in this report to have a counselor wishing to move that recommendation as the motion council medicine your arms getting bit of a workout tonight take into please counselor howling and sleep Edison oh yes this is good news when you read through it it 's to do with the beak at claims and also the performance-based you of our Planning Department last year the timber one we had was at 234 planning applications an issue of at 261 number of days to decide that last he was 232 this year was 257 this year 's 232 and average days to have the whole work done was 42 days this year compared to 47 last year so there 's a direct improvement there 's mention in generally council 's decision there 'll always be some for and some against it 's out of our control but they do a good job so like congratulate the planning department on their effort they are really making a dip they come into a lot of a lot of criticism but people don 't realize that when they put an application in and they might think it takes four weeks to get back to us for we send that out to the referral agencies and we can 't issue a permit or receive the reply back from all those in federal agencies so if one of those agencies are slow we can 't issue the plan would permit and we get the blame so the guys have done a good job retro later Thank You counselor counselor hazel Minh only to repeat that she 's a very very good news story we 've exceeded our performance from the previous year which in itself was very good the clear evidence is that the council 's planning function has been supported almost without exception at vcap and that very positive outcome that 's being maligned at some point points the issues of how the dhp works and that 's yeah work over the over the coming months so I think it demonstrates that through our planning department we are providing a quality of service that is probably better than most around the state hazel many would counsel wishing to speak against this motion for active counsel Patterson again no comments all in favor please against motion carried item nine point two counselors on page 59 amendments see 195 investigation area three rezoning to the urban growth zone consideration of submissions so do I have a council wishing to move that motion it was narrowly the recommendation printed on page 59 of the agenda and slaw Hazelden a second to please cancel O 'Keefe councillor Heslin Amos me it wouldn 't be my intention to debate the pros and cons of all the elements of the amendment that 's that 's not the purpose this is simply a process one of many that will we 've had investigation the area with the recommendation adopted by council to move towards a planning scheme public process all affected residents have the opportunity to you to put some board this is very simple initial process about resigning to the urban growth same and the consideration of submissions it 's not about a public acquisition overlay it 's not about other other aspects or development plans or contribution plans from developers or anything like that it is simply designating that area as an urban growth same and people exercising their rights have been able to place submissions and the formal process for those submissions is to an independent planning panel who will lend s those and make a report back to council that 's probably at the point when council mystic of the debate on the merits pros and cons or whatever Thank You counselor counselor chief account so wishing to speak against for the motion back to you counselor hazel and us when said all in favor against motion carried 872 of your agendas councillors item 9.3 a landscape plan guide the recommendation is regarding endorsing and releasing for public comment so councillors counselor Abdullah would you like to move that version yeah I would the landscape plan a landscape plan guide for landscapes in the agriculture flat plains did you drive a second place 22nd eligibility councillor Abdullah you back to speak to this motion yep it 's a good start it 's it 's the landscape plan guide is going to assist those applying for planning permit it 's three councils have contributed to this guide this is not for domestic purpose it 's for commercial space only it 's good to have a standardized approach across these councils and it was a collaborative effort to develop the document Shepherd in being the procurement leader as I understand and guidelines have produced a template for commercial use and enforcement of the landscape plan to make it mandatory to go to the landscape planners is part of that guide and a guide preparation was done in consultation with experts subject matter experts horticultural experts and others so yes it 's it 's a very good step to have this kind of guide available to of course to mitigate the risk of having any confusions and lack of standardization across the municipality in terms of very detailed landscape playing guide from from staff and it just goes to show the various options that people have when they are planning developments myself as the keen gardener that I am probably didn 't need to get much past page 1 because gardening and landscaping for me if it doesn 't involve a bowl with the sniffer or roundup it 's probably not in my vocabulary but I think the guy was actually extremely well done congratulations in the staff counselor Jeff anything any other counsel we should just speak against this motion pour the motion just one quick comment and the three council done a great job here the consultant I 've really taken note of disease bearing trees which is very important in our a book indeed it is I 'm sorry that was a really good good news good Thank You counsel Patterson you know the council wish to speak against all for the motion good counselor Abdullah any closing comments no common sense being the case all in favor of the motion against motion carried in almost similar vein item nine point four on council wishing to remove emotion in relation to the recommendation on page 76 as I o 'keefe second to please so certain was that you think that 's a certain guess okay which will be straightforward I 'm just obviously having a climate plan that pretty much works with our environment yeah pretty much it 's pretty straightforward but Thank You councillor Sutton you 'd like to add further comment I 'll just say this when we square shop workshops undertaken and they 've clarified what they need to do so they 've done a very good job with this thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this motion but for the motion ok council oak if any closing comments I think to add that being the case all in favor of the motion against motion Terry item 9.5 shipping and railway precinct master plan in Dawson released for public comment councillors on page 82 we have a recommendation do we have a counselor wishing to move that as a motion answerer hazleton that is to me thank you a second to please answer Patterson councillor haggling very brief draft master plan it forms part of the chaplain cvv revitalization project as a priority project there 's a range of partners and funding sources that have been identified there who have contributed towards this for the most critical part of the motion is that the draft plan is being released for public comment response to that with those comments know that we 'll be able then produce a final flame Thank You councillor Patterson I just a quick comment down 45 has made two mistakes and I started to work on Shepard and they turned their back on the river and they turned their back on the railway station and we can 't really reverse the river as much as we can the railway station but over time both of those will be corrected I believe so i encourage people have a root of this strategy and have an input Thank You counsel Patterson any councillor wishing to speak against this motion councillors wishing to speak for back to you counsel hazel in for a final comment none all in favor against motion carried hey counselors that was the item 10 am I correct Peter on page 90 want table motions there is none reports from council delegates to other bodies there is done report some special committees and advisory committees nil notice of motion is amended or rescission versions known as well documents for signing and sealing nil item 15.1 on page 93 we have a recommendation regard to the counselors community interaction and briefing program have a council we can compute that version councillor giovannetti second to please that 's like if councillor given is he as many of the recommendations self as is quite straightforward but it is interesting to note as a new counselor the number of meetings that councils are required to attend are more considerable than what I had ever first envisaged and it just goes to show that people see the role of a counselor as often as being one of someone making your decision but that 's probably only half or primarily quarter of the job really being involved in the various committees and groups that are within the Greater Shepherd at City Council is a quad an onerous task and and I didn 't add them up but they probably stopping talk about 70 to 80 meetings that we 've attended over the past month so it 's interesting as a safe for a new work counselor to just see that the breadth of the work that is involved in the role Thank You counselor counselor Keith Thank system a year absolutely supports are canceled Japan any there I think this is a little bit of an indicator to the public comments nowhere near obviously within the four years at alone 12 months of what councils are involved in I will say as a new counselor it 's part of the experience the positive experience I 've been on council is having that opportunity to get out amongst the community and from my point of view also learning such a different perspective of our community so it 's a wonderful thing to be part of this thank you can say any council wishing to speak against this and any counselor we shan 't add further comments for the motion none councillor divinity would you like to meet her all in councillors re councillors just so you know item 16.1 wasn 't listed in the index of the front of the agenda but it is in the body I 'm account until I find the page where the recommendation is printed large you sorry hand room before yes I will note the record of assemblies of councillors so do have a council wishing to move that kassel germany a second it please it was a sudden after giovanetti I was rather that 's all pretty self-explanatory to be perfectly us it is indeed council sudden any Council wishes to speak against for a closing comments counselor jerod-eddie rich me thank you all in favor how doesn 't you in favor or against oh yes I was just considering whether i wasn 't i right against and motion carried item 17 urgent another business public question time we can 't mr. Herriot Thank You mr. mayor we have two questions today from mr. John dry and John in the audience welcome John John 's first question as I recall when the victorian government authority succeeding the previous vicar burn has completed the allotments some of 1 million dollars will be paid to Council what is the current state of play in this protracted project and what steps including local promotion is council taking to expedite the timely conclusion of this agreement a response in 2002 council entered into an agreement with urban regional land corporation now places Victoria for the development of the land at Parkside as part of the agreement places Victoria undertook all the costs of the development advertising and sales with council to receive 10.95 percent of the net sale proceeds at the time the agreement was entered into it was anticipated the council would receive in excess of 1 million dollars however the development deeds started the council would receive a guaranteed minimum of six hundred and sixty-two thousand dollars the sale of land had been slow with one or two properties being sold each year in May 2014 places Victoria had the blocks very valued by the valuer general 's office and council agreed to reduce the price of the blocks in line with that valuation since then sales have been steadily increasing and to date this property is sold council receives payment of the ten point nine five percent so there is no lump sum payment at the end of the project council will continue to work with places Victoria until the completion of this project question 2 more than two years ago a clumsy these John 's words clumsy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt was made to close a highly trafficked to courage way in Shepparton the process cost council tens of thousands of dollars in consultants and legal expenses whereas if the municipal he had had a cost neutral road closure policy such as in the municipalities like Melbourne Geelong and wodonga the process would have saved that unnecessary expenditure has any progress not discounting sensible plagiarism being made to rectify this situation the response thanks John for that question circumstances the circumstances surrounding the proposed closure of Andrew fairly Avenue we 're driven by an urgent request from the or both the state government and spc to secure over one hundred million dollars in investment in jobs and growth for one of sheppard and its largest employers the urgency of the request required council its intent to close the road which in turn triggered the requirement for public consultation a road closure policies such as the ones referred to in your question would have delivered very little value to the urgency of the matter of being considered as previously advised John council does not currently have a road closure policy but may develop one in the medium term as part of other asset pressurization strategies Thank You mr. Lee Thank You mr. Herriot confidential manager reports nothing item modelling point one designation of confidential information reports attached we have a recommendation on page 105 have to move that mr. me Thank You counselor hazel and we have a seconder that 's the giovanetti as hazel minh paperwork mr. me good counselor jibon Eddie Alvarez confidential mr. mayor counts break speak with anyway that 's fine that 's good any other counsel wishing to speak against this motion and for the motion rather than they need for another minute either way counsel Heisman that being the case all in favor against motion carried Thank You counselors over that brings us to the end of the is it 65 _"

there may have been a little bit of confusion about the closing date initially we thought that was going to be the seventeenth of februari but our jury can 't meet the only day they can meet is the 14th of februari and we need to be able to collect the community 's comments to the jury on the fourteenth of February 's so we 've just pushed that back so the exhibition will be open just over three weeks so the community have three weeks to come in have a look at the five designs and make their comments now they can do that in a number of ways we have two hard copy here you can make box here or you can use the little iPad 2 starter here and put it in electronically or you can go on to our website so just on to go to shepherd and calm a you and find new projects as so there 's three ways that the community can make their comments and we really encourage the community to get on board come and have a look at these designs and make their comments to us because the jury is looking forward to hearing community has to say now just on call the jury I do have our director here Sam director Sam Rebecca can speak about things to do with Sam with the Shepherd and art museum but you can 't speak about the actual designs because she is a do remember the probe any of the design competition is paramount we have to be really careful that we don 't compromise that in any way shape or form so during the questions time Rebecca can answer questions about the art museum but not really about the jury process we also have counselors here today and their counselor manage the property process so they can 't make too many comments about the competition either so if you can all just have a look at the pictures let us know what you think of them through the comment process if there 's any questions Rebecca and I are happy to try and answer them for you so I were to questions we want interviews so very exciting Hamma Hamma Hamma rival the public by hole in the air that will be presented to the jury on the floor taking fabric now also on the 14 confirming each of these companies will be interviewed by the jury so they will each come in on the fourteenth and they will present it to the jury 10 to 15 minutes then there 'll be questions from the jury and then the jury will stick by themselves and have a discussion about each of the design concepts final recommendation recommended yes yes that 's the jury it 's a skilled skills-based jury so we 've we 've put it in the hands and people who are very good at design competitions and we decision so there will be one final winner they will win ten thousand dollars but they will also be endorsed by council to become the final architecture company so then we will work with them to make sure that we 've got everything we need in this design these designs are not construction ready so these are not the designs that will be will be going with there will need to be further work so that we make sure that these designs are construction ready Construction really desires we hope to have that done by the end of this calendar year financial year sorry so June July so just to confirm this is the five hearing of being invited to present concept designs and this case as a concept design is not something that you can design that they can you can build to but it is based on a very clearly detailed brief so those documents have been worked quite extensively and as a client which is great shepherd and of course it needs to fulfill a number of criteria it obviously needs to house the museum but it 's that first port of call when people come in from out of town come it also has KLR so it 's a really interesting exciting challenge and opportunity of the building because it does a number of things it when that finalist is then selected it goes to council it 's been decided and they 've been engaged to develop the detailed design you need to revisit all of those things and make sure that again it 's not just fulfilling the brief but it actually does everything all of those people going to be living and working and inhabiting and owning and having a sense of pride and place in that building so that 's it 's the next stage of a really exciting and ambitious architectural competition and part of that is also to ensure that it fits ask our budget all of these architects understand our budget and we need to stick to that budget as you can see it 's really quite an easy process you actually tick which design you like and you make comments so the collation will be who likes which designs to the jury so I think the comments will be quite interesting as well and I know as a juryman but you know that 's that 's taken very seriously and that just picks up on Matt 's question to you know this is not just a process we actually welcome we really invite we really hope that ever I comes in has a look and engages with these five visions more than I like it or I don 't like it but actually what is it going to do what

Susan evident in our enamels so it 's a half and start to bring and the other thing is our food production with a spoonful than a huge water we celebrate dad hasn 't started Britain at it because again sad student isn 't spaceship 's so we looked at what is suggested nearby friar street it 's going up a range of different food on offer us and there 's an experience headed to social environment so why don 't we lure on that activity to start bring some of that into the mall so after the end of the mall where you traveling favorite Christmas decorations and ladies this area brainy but when it comes down to actually on your level you know it 's not soft and inviting and comfortable and cool so why don 't we bring in some greeneries you can sit down and relax so you go to describe light sweet sit down with your mates and you know absolutely and you don 't even have to be eating you can just relaxed it and then associated with that so well how can we start to bring some more of our food culture different tomorrow rate increases so a couple of a sharp option to have each found this like what clovis low-cost opportunity dad it 's also stressful that we not it 's a very flexible break everything 't require any major constructions chambers again that way all of its remaining GT station hospitals were other options so associated with the pop up Mark sort this area here you know Syria but currently it 's not having you to eat again taken away from somewhere nearby so when we remove accessories ventures and put in notice your typical what likely part along like that having more like a diversion all the outdoor dining some pop-ups ceiling ports would be designed specifically for Shepherd and loop we designed some kids along recently and they 've been hugely popular they 've increased the capacity of cafes in the areas be able to serve more customers and they can be moved and respond to area and another benefit is they can also double up as a vehicle patrol so if we running an event at which our cars driving through then you can use these seen pods as a double whammy as you move along this area right until they reformed she want me so we broke them all up into three precincts Carlos you to be and doesn 't cover lately up as the food length and then cutting across from the cinema across the wyndham street to become we want to see that becomes a cultural precinct but art and scooter different local are distributing in that area just absolutely another cinema there so it 's already starting to leak into the arts so why not run field trip you need to think with a suggestion on white walls associated that we have a natural gallery where take ownership of that space for a while and show what they 're doing when other local artists because period of time to cater to our local institutional side to celebrate with pages so started bringing struggling against to make us uniquely shippers you might move along a little bit further than just walked out Oh _"

    "text": "note the time that you 're going to recommence Thank You councils so this note the time is now 701 will recommence our meeting Thank You counselors there is a recommendation as we noted early before the German on page 145 sorry 146 and many others are up to 20 146 146 do have a council wishing to move a motion in relation to a planning permit application 2016 330 use and development of the land for a caravan park including those farm primary produce sales and restaurant 215 mutual Road crowler mr. Muir I for shadow of motion shook the original motion be defeated Thank You counselor I was very that 's been noted margin being yes they might know yes sorry Cal so the motion things that are related but in relation to the planning application to 16 dash 330 that the proposal of a caravan park with host farm with associated primary produce sales and restaurant at 215 mitchell road color on the basis of the information before council and having considered all relevant matters required by the planning and environment Act 1987 Council resolves to granted this permit and I 've got a five-page document with a list of conditions subtitled amended plan section 173 agreement stage fill these are construction plan ranged discharge a whole gamut of them so I just flagged it meant so i was really information counselor hazel in regard to the motion to foreshadowed version if mr. merillat we 've got to that stage I 'd like to make some comments if that stage if and when I 'm sure you 'll be invited to do so thank you have any counsel wishing to move the motion as i said the recommendation sorry as previously mentioned oh mere oblivion deja printed on page 146 and 147 of the agenda we have a second down a whole seconds demand council patterson as hazelton during this application I 'm mindful of a number of things firstly the clear statement that as the land is situated at the moment it 's within the farming zone part within the urban floodways own partner in the floodway overlay and land subjective inundation these are not subjective assessments these are being determined and a part of the 's going to be some substantial rezoning of that particular area of lame the other point I 'd make is that part of the application required a cultural heritage management plan and the officers note that the plan does not cover the entire development site and then that effect it would be non-compliant i 'm also very very mindful of the objections raised by the golden broken catchment management authority another 's might claim yes they 're a referral authority but the council isn 't obliged to follow what the the cma determined i would suggest that by not following ama where we hit me into it a situation that I 'd almost described as an icky because I 'm you know by statute I guess your management thority and the council are required to establish a determined flood level at the one in 100 year event and that 's the standard planning tool right across Victoria any residential subdivision any application for direction of a simple house has to comply with that rule and where does the council get its flood levels from it gets them through those adopted authority and I can 't think of any circumstance any precedent in this municipality where the council has in fact gone against the the cmas recommendations and certainly I would think we 'd be dragging one leg behind as we were trying to take that to vcat and say well we didn 't like what the CMA were saying so we 're going to ignore what they said ignoring what at CMA says when in fact we 've already determined on the basis of information advice provided by the CMA the actual zoning of the land this this application refers to pretty big youngen are already accepted what the cma has said by establishing those zones in our planning scheme so any suggestion that we going to move away from this recommendation and I also note that the officers didn 't go to the extent of seeking comment or advertising it for the impact that it may have on neighbours or others who may feel they are impacted by it I think that point five of the recommendation is quite curtain in that that I 'm cancellation briefly briefly we the recommendation is passed and the applicants should then determine that the seeker review at vcat that the council position would be that we kept the asked to provide or require public notice of the application so in that regard all of the rights of all of the stakeholders are being protected Thank You counselor hazel and councillor Patterson is I 've been aware of this development courses most of us have her for a couple of years is a great proposal it really is it will be great for the town if they could get up there is a list of things there that the officers have put toward which basically prevents it I believe a lot of them could be worked around but the farming land is still going to be used as farming land in association with education on it that 's what I just cannot get past the catchment medical Authority soon as someone put an application in to oppose it that 's going to knock it on the head a large asleep repositioned in some way where it could go either fully supported I honestly because it 'll get an opportunity against to be kept on the plateau relation take a counselor any counsel wishing to speak against this motion Cancellara 's very thank-yous me at the commies both counselor heisman and of counselor Patterson ensure the as like Council of Patterson I too have been we 're of this impeller pending application and and on for a number of years this particular application I welcome there 's my fellow councillors to consider as a genuine example of what such the dorms could bring to this community goulburn valley particularly greater Shepherd and is deferred bulb we market ourselves as such and here is a perfect opportunity to put our money where our mouth is and demonstrate to the larger community that we are in fact open for business in the form of tourism and value adding to the net economic benefit of our community people love food they like to experience new things travel and eat and the application has an agricultural field come on ticks all the boxes to fly in opposition to such a development is to fly in the face of to Asia now we bang on about going to Asia and opening up that and the great things happening here campaign is an example of this newfound enthusiasm impetus and this particular application would fit hand in glove where our either look through that particular market we are an enviable and demonstrative reputation as a fleet clean food country to our Asian neighbors the preparedness of investors to invest in business in our local area can only be viewed as a positive step and further reflects favorably I us as a community what I look at it this way unashamedly pro-business because without business there is no community business-wise jobs opportunities lifestyle demand for schools and all manner of things which brings prosperity to our region and which some people lose sight of in the big picture I prefer to engage in the politics of progress and be a part of a can-do Council seizing opportunities as they arise this in my tea is together with the other application one of many opportunities I know this application has touched on by council eyes was not notified to surrounding properties as acceptable planning outcome and the most appropriate recommendation would be to refuse that application I also know that counselor hazel Minh is correctly identified the responsible authority is not obliged to refuse an application or include conditions required by this type of referral authority being the CMA I suppose from my perspective I 've he doesn 't write pre-emptive and whilst a note their assessment time counselors where would you like some more time no no you can ever three more minutes if you choose if the council 's agreed you were agree counselors yes Carol thank you i know 'd further there were no objections by Golden Valley Water the APA and hub transport Victoria I do note that cmi objected but their objection does not detail will stop the application these are in fact state legislative requirements under Section 60 of the planning and environment Act they 've been considered and noted from the body of the report and by me in the consideration of the matter Thank you Thank You counselor I was very you ever counseled wishing to speak for this version counselor for the motion councils we should speak against the motion council so i just i would like to note that in our tourism policy we seek to encourage the provision of tourism facilities and services including short term and home hosted accommodation host farms and simmer for similar facilities if we we need to promote things like this especially with the Chinese coming this development would bring us millions of dollars a year and I just think that it 's if we don 't do it we 're going to be a laughingstock of from China and we 're trying our hardest to do to get chinese investment and then we go and refuse something like this I just don 't think it 's a very good unit won 't be good look Thank You cancer certain any other council wishing to speak for or against the motion before us Chancellor giovannetti Thank You mr. me I 'll speak against the motion as a new counselor coming in obviously I 'm not okay with what has transpired previously we 've heard the officers give us the advice on this particular application and for honest we can be confusing because originally when the applicant made their application they were looking to develop a site on the north east part of the particular block council oxen did they change that application to the southwest corner of the bottling the horse had to be corrected on that and then in turn a flood overlay was created and it was deemed inappropriate I also think I recall that one of the council officers had indicated that the original application site was not totally under the flood plain well floodplain overlay so I just think that like councils certain if we if we shoot this application down I think we could really hold back our development with the proposal tourism and also the Chinese markets good Thank You councillor divinity any other council wishing to comment for or against this motion okay before we go the votes just to be clear the motion is to refuse the application so if we support this motion we are refusing the application if we are against this motion well we are against the motion to refuse to be clear if that Sutton 's so all in favor of the motion I 'll sorry Chris you do indeed I confuse myself so much councillor hazel would you like some closing comments agadir because you suggestions that the motion is anti-business or anti-terrorism it is the classic straw man argument it 's totally irrelevant in the circumstances what we 're talking about here is the use of land and all of the expert advice has come back and said the use of the land is inappropriate no one 's arguing about whether the the proposal itself conceptually it 's fantastic simply it 's in the wrong location and I 'm very very concerned that if we 're moving in a different direction that the precedent that is going to establish for uniform town planning right across the region if somehow we 're going to establish this prisoner we 're going to say nope we 're not going we 're going to ignore the CMA does it then become no rules no holds barred we 're just going to be willy-nilly we 're so proud of element we 're going to ignore the statutory we 've got to think long and hard about what we 're trying to do here fantastic proposal wrong location find another bit of dirt for it we have all the support from council we could find Thank You councillor hazel and I think it 's the methodology used in arriving at the assessment that it is the wrong location is probably on the minds of some councils in regard to this particular issue having said that I 'll call for a vote so all in favor of the motion and ocean loss we can indeed all in favor councillor hazel and councillor Patterson counselor you 're in favor it 's like if against council summer counselor or a govt sorry counsel certain counselor Aras vari and counselor Adam that being lost there was a foreshadowed motion counselor I was very yes thank you the mechanics of this is that it 's a five-page document which I started off in request to mr. Council hazel requesting what the good basis or would I really in your hands mr. Meister head this way to progresses how many pages are we talking requirements whether I 'm happy to read that document into the I don 't see any other way but reading a document actually unless we can point of what mr. chairman and nobody else has actually seen this document is it and nobody is going to have the opportunity to give it due consideration we don 't even know who the author of the document was the permian conditions that may well be attached to it do they stack up in a statutory sense I just find yeah impossible to try and deal with it at this point in time we noted mr. our group cancer Heisman I 've lifetime look at it can we put that up as a notice emotion next million or something so we have an opportunity to have a good read of it and understand it decision detergents I tend to agree councillors very I don 't think there 's enough time for councils to fully digest five pages hopefully they 'll understand you understand that as well I 'm not really probably want to do any I 'd suggest we by not making a the previous motion counselor hazel you look as if you want to say something I 'm just concerned that this ill-conceived action tonight the level of risk it 's now exposed as counsel to in terms of non-performance and that 's going to come at a significantly financial penalty to this council simply because the homework wasn 't done I think it 's amazing that a five-page document get presented at two minutes to midnight well it may not get presented that was the intent yes but surely knowing this item was on the agenda those alternatives could have been canvassed well before this event so that people were informed there is no way now no now we can make an informed decision I tend to agree I don 't think we can with royalty matter for me to withdraw the foreshadowed motion oh yes you 're right yeah well you can you what well I mean I don 't see a little too can that being the case we go to the next item right well we have no emotion in front of us I guess mr. mayor my of failure to determine on councils behalf reason d and what that may bring i 'm also i must admit concern that whilst in every other sense we 're interested in the neighbors and giving them an opportunity for comment if we were to proceed along the lines of this suggestion we 're making a decision without considering neighbors at all I just find that originally against what our principles are of this organization so I say that for what it 's worth and note that in putting up the recommendation for refusal yes we did officers did go and get advice as they should to ensure that their recommendation for refusal had sound backing and obviously in a flooding since the place to get that advice is the catchment management authority but the legislation does suggest that we don 't have to consult the neighbors if we believe a refusal is going to happen because we 're in a refusal since the neighbors are obviously not adversely impacted but it is the reverse when we 're going to approve something we should should advise the neighbors so that that we had have gone down that path Thank You mr. Harib my response would be that we probably should consult the public irrespective of whether we have a appetite or what we think we 'll have an appetite to refuse or grant but that 's just my personal opinion as there is no motion before us at this point in time I suggest we move to the next item what the regs do we give you our offices to deal with this matter I 'm sure the people in the planning department amaro will say what are we doing or will help we will deal with it in the future as they got a new one tomorrow morning what information do they provide to the applicant tomorrow or to the catchment management Authority or any of the other stakeholders in this when the council said William made a decision there is no motion before us to this castle vote on easy it 'll salai unassuming that when people oppose emotion there is an alternative and that daughter that alternative has been well thought out beforehand to enable people to make was well thought out and seeing that motion but as a point of clarification councils sort of the moral high ground in relation to the fact that would be due to the length and breadth of the motion it was institution time for my fellow councillors to be able to make an informed judgment as a matter of natural justice and fairness to my fellow counsel are going forward on this council I chose to withdraw that notice of motion gadelle to at a later time does it now I don 't know whether they 've got a another notice of motion there mr. Meg oh there could be a possibility but that may have to come up now because that item is now finish with in urgent another business possibly councillor council has me is correct by refusing the previous motion we here in limbo to a degree regard two directives to the officers that being said item 10.8 is similar item 10.9 sorry I 'm there 's also recommend and 64 this may go the same way councils I 'm not too sure so we have a recommendation move this recommendation as the motion then no one reading promotion laps item 10 sorry hang on a sec 10 point 10 withdrawn yes indeed it has I just want to say that the counselors please note that the applicant is this jordan therefore this report will not be considered item 10 point 10 item 11 got documents for signing and sealing we have a recommendation on page 118 I counselors would you ready we have a second to please else or suttin moment counselor summer what would that amendment be final point transfer of lens be removed we 're on pay the final job point transfer land sticks are transfer land to council due to unpaid rates and charges okay we 're dealing with the amendment now i will let it go through because it is relevant to the motion and it I think counselor some i would suggest it clarifies a motion or makes it stronger okay you will only do need a seconder for that amendment Castle I was very no summer when we 're doing something as drastic as transferring land back to councils you to of being quite political and controversial in the past we haven 't gone down this road and we have discussed the potential possibility of going down this road but I think it really does each case by case needs to come back to councillors so we can examine it in a little bit more detail because I don 't know anything about this and if somebody rings me up and says did council take land of somebody I really don 't know what to say so I would like that to go back to a briefing and then we make a decision decision at the board table the amendment is oh that we take this point out of this particular ocean so you happy to adopt the rest of them motion it was a second oh sorry Cass I sorry no nothing we 're happy for the original member of the motion councillor giovannetti for that amendment to take out that line are you happy with that no I 'm not mr. me we had discussed this at a briefing session and I thought it was quite clear amongst us taking in relation to some of these unpaid rates that has been unfaithful quite some considerable period of time I think you 've council offices imported out they 've obviously investigated the options that are available this is the last resort so now I 'm not happy I was just asking you because if you were that would make the process look he 's a that being said well back to the amendment we 've got a mover a seconder I councillor summer and counselor as well you refuse to refuse you for the clarification it was as I I thought as much when of order that the timers a normal second whether it 's a debate or not thank you any counselor wishing to speak against the amendment as a medicine I 'm really shocked at council summer come if he decides she doesn 't know any better so she 's going to move in them and I just can 't void but that 's been addressed of briefings there 's ample time and plenty of opportunities to ask the question but to actually move an amendment for something we would sort of moved on past that listen any other counselor we should speak for the amendment against now so some of you are oh yes we spoke at length about the strategy towards going ahead and taking land of people who refuse to pay the race and there was consensus there to have this snuck in at the very end of documents for signing and sealing when it 's going to have it could potentially have a very large impact on somebody 's life and no I don 't know where this address is or who lives there what their circumstances are it could be a run-down abandoned house or it could be a family of four and I 'm not willing to take the risk of people back lashing on to us because we 've rushed ahead and put all our trust into officers when really that 's our responsibility as well Thank You counsel Silla we 'll put that to a vote for the amount all in favor of the amendment against members lost we refer back to the original motion councillor giovannetti which is quite you like to speak to the original motion no just to say that they don 't do this just because they can I do it because for a reason and I just think if it 's been a long time being hoping no great Spade we need to do something we need to take action he counsels we just speak against the motion all the motion counselor giovannetti any closing comments all in favor against imagine carry our table motions counselors if possible I 'd like to table a report that was circulated by email last month it 's possible indeed what 's that report na ba economics report okay good so you 're moving emotion table that report have a seconder for that thank you guys I was very you wish to speak to that counselor okay Cass I was very so it 's been tabled by email correct we will have a copy

to be table before a certain time so we could comply with the state government 's requests in regards to funding or part funny of the trip so I put that down to have someone to do this you counselor

deviating any closing comments to summarize the great debate that 's happened on this particular subject no no okay we 'll right here and all in favor of the motion against motion carried item 18.1 the Assemblies of councillors there 's a reckoning were three solid recommendation on page 203 your second to please as a hores very councillor hazel me councillors very any when we should you speak against that motion for counselor hazel and rolling favor against motion carried urgent another business not included on the agenda grab any urgent other business I see basically mr. mayor I do based upon the fact tentacle neighbors defeated I 've got a recommendation that in relation to the planning application to 16 dash 330 that council remits the application with planning officers to undertake public basis of the application the other councils have a copy of this little know we on the we 're about to get to that mr. Herriot now counselor is very to be urgent other business of course is it something that 's arisen since the last council meeting as it risen as it a reason before the agenda is printed oh well this has arisen as a result of an agenda item you know the fact that I think we need some direction on this particular issue I will allow you to count LOL to be judged upon it for councils agree to it ocean initially you do we will accept it accept the item as an item of urgent business yes so is anyone wishing to remove that motion I 'll move that so okay do I have a seconder council I was very Jewish you speak to that I just procedural motion so that the substantive motion can come forward for some debate I think the sooner that happens the better so I was worried you wish they had any comments that all in favor hence all that 's carried so will allow this as s rose emotion counselor is very now that being said will move their motion yes the second two for the motion now good counsel I was very well given the fact that the OOP confused the original lion 10.8 was defeated and I 've moved the motion that allows the application for the planning office to undertake public notice of the application so its first in terms of that public notice would involve the capacity of the people who potentially objectives in relation to that application to be given an opportunity to respond to that application perhaps that affect the decision that we might previously in 10.8 isn 't we made was not to refuse not to support the recommendation but in reality that means we 're treading water on this issue now the Maya notice of motion was to allow the matter to go back to planning officers to undertake public notice of the application so in terms of gives the people the opportunity do we need a recommendation no yeah but that was defeated everybody sit all different was there legally on the right track yes would counsel hazel did you want to add comments give my comments to make it look at least half confident in dealing with this matter yeah we go back now and seek public comment and I have no doubt that public comment from the residents in that area is only going to strengthen the officers position they put forward earlier eight may not yep or could small well no not with this point I 'm and potentially it provides the applicant bow in the meantime can head off the week out on the basis of councils non-performance which opens up a whole new can of worms for us but at least by this process we 're at least allowing the public into the process and we 'll see okay but this could go in any number of different directions but Thank You councillor hazel and any council wishing to speak against this motion but else we should speak for the motion Oh beans it counselor I was very would you like to closing comments all in favor against after summer oh thank you motion carried is the other urgent number is now that will that was fightin ten just be clear on fine thank you I think we can but we 've rehab can we do that now but maybe we haven 't or have we wish to move for a similar motion again just go to the same person but the similar motion needs to be written other business again alright so the counselors I would you like to move another motion here out in relation to point not that in relation to 10.9 planning application to 16 of 331 council room it 's the application to planning officers to want to take public notice of the application take a no we 've spoken to that clearly insane all stages yeah anyone against this motion or for the motion oh sorry for that councillors road you wish that back or for the motion that 's fine carried thank you probably question time I 'm 20 sorry my question time we do have 2 questions and excuse both come from a mr. John Gray and as Rebecca pointed out needs to be in the gallery so we will respond to mr. gray in writing mr. me thank you very much yes I of confidentiality of information report attachments we have an item and we have a recommendation on page 204 for you council we should make that recommendation of the motion council something that says they confident we have a seconder pleasure and summer Council Patterson anyway we should speak against the motion on councils wishing to speak for the motion as a summer just like a summer okay all in favor great take your castles or declare the meeting closed at seven forty-two _"

dollars over three years so that 's an example of how we need to maintain and develop our roads we deal with a relatively small rate base when you look at how many roads bridges and drains we have

so for no cost to council we end up with a fantastic facility and that can have a large economic flow on to the rest of the community when visitors come here for sporting events we 've seen that time

something about it indications are that it 's not probably as bad as we thought the amount of traffic that gets down there but I would I know personally I 'll be having an orbiter into summer months to see if it is getting bad we do need to do something there but we need to get that balance right but do appreciate these people going to the extent of putting petition together you have taken notice of it and I 'm sure council office will be inspections during that the son of man says rely on most other councils when they 're open de jure which I totally reasonably daddy will be Thank You councillor Patterson any other counselor wishing to speak for or against the motion none councillor O 'Keefe any closing comments in favor of the motion against motion carried page 22 have a counselor wishing to move that as the motion councillor giovannetti have a second her I think council I was very good in early their Council hearing I heard him and his head went up in here and also Jeb inated would you be starting to the motion is obviously one of our larger contracts that we 're going to be awarding over the next several months contract ten thousand seven hundred dollars sorry 10 million seven hundred fifty 5624 dollars just not ten ninety percent off lefty couples around this is stage three of the cost ray tube site I know there is another word for it but live in the moment it 's a process that we have to follow our side side to is filling up and it 's a requirement now that we need to expand and if we look at like becoming a reasonable waste hub and this will certainly be needed so i think it 's it 's a car it 's a year a contract that we have to undertake and i believe both through council offices that there has orig estimates which is a significant amount Thank You counselor jebin Eddie counselor or as very no thank you you can also wishing to speak against the motion for the motion counselor summer I just wanted to make a point that waste management is complicated and it is expensive especially for councils waste the sustainability Victoria levy is about thirty percent of landfill fees going directly to the state when people drop things off at the tip it is expensive but that 's because of a lot of different external reasons it 's not necessarily counselors being greedy to get more money out of the tip site that 's not exactly true at all so I would just like to recommend people keep recycling so that we don 't have to fill that space up as quickly as anticipated and we could potentially save more money councillor summer ever council we should just speak for or against the motion council achieve and Eddie any closing comments being said all in favor of the motion against motion carried item 8.1 was on page 28 there 's a motion there mr. regard for 2015-16 any counselor we can camus the recommendation as a motion counsel some are printed on page 28 you do I have a seconder how 's the summer I mean cancel o 'keefe sorry yes for summer oh this is the annual review we 've had an exemption from the minister so we don 't have to do a four year plan it 's an ongoing working review of what we 've done in terms of health and well-being in in our council and there 's been a lot of goals kicked I think the last counselor on that committee was former councillor Kevin Ryan and he was quite vocal about issues such as smoking obesity and homelessness so they cover a broad scope of what it means to be healthy might do you to stop talk I was going to talk about the lead stakeholders but it 's all self-explanatory and it does show again that we 're more than roads rates and rubbish Thank You counsel summer council O 'Keefe all good any council wishing to speak against the motion and any councillor wishing to add any ok cancel summer any closing comments thank you all good all in favor of the motion against motion carried item 8.2 counselors on page 33 of the agenda the boulevard and golf estates neighborhood plan any council wishing to be emotional in relation to that Elsa last summer a second to please councillor Patterson council summer this is a more examples of the good work that we do with our smaller communities it 's one of four neighborhood plans that we 've done and that is also including locality plans like small towns and will to that in the next item but they have the people involved in this have been there 's been so many people involved in this and it 's a very valuable contribution it means that each locality can actually grow at evolve in the way that they seem fit there 's a bit of budget attached to this too which is great so if you get involved as it pays to get involved now anyone who does want to look at developing a locality plan for themselves can contact council for more information on how the report there 's a long list of suggestions and i 'll be looking forward to whatever comes out of that but yes increasing social capital by the people straight from the coalface the Thank You counsel summer councillor Patterson so just well congratulations good people of the boulevard and go phone the state to get himself together identify what they need and how they can work together with council on more we 're there in addition bellhop she goes Thank You councillor Patterson any council wishing to speak against this motion any council wishing to speak for the motion councillor Sutton first sorry counselor is very I just like to say that it 's nice to see a city power a city part of shepherding actually competing completed neighborhood plan as well as the small towns Thank You counsel certain councillors very thanks mr. mayor the thing that impressed me the most was how such a relatively small cross-section of the community can actually come up with such a long list of achievable outcome well a long list of outcomes which a majority would be achievable but also to a drinking fountain but also to advocate and support the route of bypass and things of the nature where to advocate for improve bus coverage within estates to me that 's a reflection of the fact that there 's a lot of thinking people out there based upon a lot of common sense in their own particular part of the community that they come from Thank You counselor counselor summer which like any closing comments in favor of the motion counselors against motion carried item 8.3 I 'm page 40 counselors there 's a recommendation there would counsel we should move that as the motion recommendation Laura 's married you have a second day ancillaries very this agenda item really dovetails into the previous item but a more global basis and is yarber arching rationale for the community plan the statistics spec largely for themselves and the community plan is all about people from within each of the 16 endorse community plan location who have demonstrated passion and enthusiasm to improve their own immediate area by way of achievable outcomes there are many outcomes thoughtful across the breadth of the characteristic that is the community members of volunteers they wish to evaluate the well-being of the community in which the plans are formulated and developed essentially it 's about developing relationships between councils and committees share funding grants from available sources whether that be local council state government or even non-government agencies Thank You counselor is very council summer ah yes we 've got a list here of the 16 different localities that we 've been working very closely with and they 've all had their annual review and updated all their information and we get to see what they 've achieved and what 's yet to be achieved there was no cost to the review but the total budget allocation is about 750,000 and that 's 330,000 of capital work so again it really does pay to get involved and sometimes the communities of the lower socio demographic are the hardest to get on board but they 're the ones who need it most that sense of community and I do hope there 's some champions out there willing to call council enough to have a go and really for thank you guys for summer any council wishing to speak against the motion councils wishing to speak for the motion now it 's always very said enough you think thank you all in favor of the motion against motion carried item 8.4 counselors on page 47 there 's a recommendation there in regard to

for all their efforts and you just thank you good thank you Kansas and counselor I 'm sorry Thank You mr. Mann the agenda item highlights the critical element behind this strategy and that is volunteering an essential community resource which promotes active citizenship and social inclusion but for my own effectively the strategies key priority is a great way counselor wishing to speak against this motion counselors wishing to speak for the motion at being said council Sutton any closing comments no good all in favor of the motion against motion carried next item councillor hazel min I think you 've declare the conflict it with me I of young declare a conflict of interest in this matter in that I

their hometown I think again it 's a great conjure between community and council and these committees advise us on a regular basis as to counselor counselor Patterson are you know just like my special mention of mr. berry available is actually resigned that 's great the manor work all these volunteers i think mr. roat soldier farm lipton shifting away should we notice that hardly advantages they do a terrific job and wish him all the best and thank you thank you very much for easy significant input about community of these and give any council wishing to speak against the motion council wishing to speak for the motion I just want to add my personal comments reiterate what counselor Patterson and counselor juvenilia said once again the people who give up their time and devote their efforts to being on those committees I just think it should be highly committed without these people these community organizations don 't run so we should really appreciate their efforts and congratulate them that said all in favor of the motion against motion carried counselors item number eight point or sorry counselor hazel you can come back it was Yorick 's of success or yes I 'm 8.6 on page 57 do I have a council wishing to please councillor giovanetti just beat you councillor summer well this is following on from what we were talking about before with community plans this one is specific to tell amber they have a very engaged steering committee and they 've consulted well with the residents so we have the latest and one thing I will mention is that it says here that there 's a surplus of three thousand three hundred and twenty dollars and that can be used for printing and promotion but I would like staff to consider perhaps putting that towards low hanging fruits in the plan such as community gardens a community notice board or even promoting business around the town Thank You counsel summer councillor jiminy he I 'm just reiterating what council summer has what he said I 've had the opportunity to go to land on a number of occasions and weep with the community out there I think they 're doing a fantastic job they really I really are committed to their community play and it 's interesting that the majority of the community of there actually know what the community it 's up to us to ensure that we resource them without any funds to be able to undertake the works that they require as soon as we possibly can wrestler and giovannetti as a patterson council generally said it all then cool can also wishing to speak against the motion and anyone wishing to speak for the

membership sorry we 'll go into the what they do in the next one but as far as the memberships go I 'm sure they 'll have a great time it 's a terrific committee and I do encourage others who are

see your hand oh I didn 't know I didn 't it 's just for something different somebody else might want to raise it but for nobody else will I will I need to want to and you do want to thank very Thank You mr. miras has become a custom I invite mr. title to give us an overview if he would please it 's a title you 're happy to do that thanks mr. may and threw you to the counselors I 'll talk to the attachment to the the report which commences on page number now anyway 300 and something the operating performance financial health and financial obligations sections of that report are all indicating that way about where we would expect at this time of year we are forecasting at this stage to do with operating performance that we will get hit or suffer a bit of a hit with some competitive action in the waist area with some other landfills in the Northeast region of the state and our user fees and charges for that are down we 're expecting that we won 't be able to pick all of that up by the end of the financial year and that will have an impact of of close to a million dollars we think at this stage but we 've got a report coming to counsel in to level take to try and pick that up financial health is looking good we 're forecasting that will be ahead of budget by the end of financial years our liquidity position is good and borrowings will track as expected through the through the year you 'll see on the dash traffic light report on page 367 that the charges are showing unfavorable as to in terms of the full-year forecast although their favorable here today materials and consumables is the other area that we 're paying attention to at the moment and they 're tracking 500 above by the 500,000 above budget at this point in time and that 's largely to do with some increased legal expenses some additional consultants around some planning studies and some occupational health and safety improvements we 've implemented through the first half of this financial year capital expenditure is tracking a little bit be behind where we would like it at this point in time a lot of that is due to the weather conditions that we favor that we experienced for the large part of the first half of this financial lot of that up through the second half with the letting of some of the contracts one of which you 've seen tonight which is the cosgrove 3 contract which is a fairly large piece of expenditure for the to be delivered in the second half of this financial year yassel hazel and you wish to at any comments and as I wishing to speak against this motion all the motion as long as very any closing know existed all in favor of motion against motion carry item 9.2 age 71 of our agendas contract 1718 provision of municipal valuation services 2018 and 2020 and I 'll be recommendation printed on page 71 you have second old signal listen yes I you miss me it was a set your requirement that every two years we had to take a valuation across the municipality for the purposes of establishing a rate and generating income for the municipality and to do that it 's an independent valuation LG valuation services have performed this function with the council previously and I do note that under the terms of this contract there are options for contract extensions for 2022 and 2020 for their sorts of dates most of us in the room won 't be thinking too much about what the valuations going to be but it 's a it 's good solid planning that this is put in place now and is in place over the longer term to ensure that the service being provided is both effective and appropriate some council Patterson is this unique opportunity for us to value the value is really L&G are one of the largest valuation companies in in Victoria and do a lot of council work right around the state so full confidence in them good thank you any councillor wishing to speak against this motion or the motion council so on I want to make a note that the cost of these valuations is significantly lower than if you were going to go out and get your property valued independently and i also want to mention that ratepayers do have a right to contest the evaluation as you can see here fifty five dollars per assessment for objections but ratepayers also need to be mindful depending on what value are fine but yes it 's very much a non exact science because we can 't spend the same amount of time looking at every ratepayers property in the detail they may perhaps like unless of course it 's brought to our attention that there might be substantial changes Thank You counsel summer any council we should just speak against all for the motion now counselor hazel eminently nothing in all in favor against motion carried item 9.3 there is a recommendation councillors on page 74 for our counselor representation on committees and 75 and 76 now are we is this some check just want to George your attention counselors there has been some slight are you mr. mirror these last-minute changes but at all counselor I was very very short straw changes they were well considered changes cancer is very well just draw your attention councils on page 74 we have the committee the Goulburn broken greenhouse Alliance we have counselor giovannetti as printed in your agendas in fact that is now counselor summer age 75 we have the Heritage Advisory Committee we have counselor only also on the same page 75 halfway down the page you have the positive ageing Advisory Committee we had councillor Patterson there we have counselors very Thank You councillor Azaria and on page 76 the last and he this city 's of Victorian Local Government Association these councillor O 'Keefe printed it is now councillor summer oh we have made a note of those changes Thank You counselors to have a council wishing to move this recommendation is emotion councillor giovannetti second to please cancel hustling councillor gym and Eddie yes miss Merrill happy to 74 with the amendment that we as we 've just mentioned I think it 's been a an interesting process for us all to go through chiefly some bus new counselors who did probably initially have the majority of the committee 's but that has now been wouldn 't say too much counselor at bars are usually able to get your numbers but i think all council looking forward to the challenge for the next 12 months indeed in working with these committees the table reflects a a diverse range of committees and activities that to get a relatively even work played but at regular times during the year on back on this agenda that we various reports will come back from these committees and we 'll look forward to seeing what those reports contain well indeed thank you any council wishing to speak against the motion or the motion councillor summer some of these changes may be made under duress but I just wanted to thank councillor juvinity for allowing me the swap to get back onto the Goulburn broken greenhouse Alliance committee because when I was talking before about the SV funds that come from the landfill they 're finally opening some of that up and there 's a pitch to government that we are going to actually move forward with a procurement that 's a cross shires to try and encourage electric vehicle use so i really like to continue that project and just to be involved and see how exciting it is that people are looking at alternative modes of transport and it is a really good group very friendly sad to be leaving the deck but yeah I think joint collaborations Thank You councillor any other counselor we should you speak for against this motion I would just like I was like that I 'm pleased that it seems like an eternity ago we went into caretaker period a lot of us to learn these committees were a few years now and enjoy working and progressing the committee and it seems so long ago that we have to stop now back into it get moving it does seem more than two months ago good pick your counsel Patterson any other counsel wishing to comment before against no counselor vanetti I don 't know closing comments all in favor motion carried item nine point four councillors contract awarded under delegation and status of contracts advertise and yet to be awarded November 2016 there 's a recommendation on page 83 do we have a recommendation to me you counselor hazel in do we have a seconder counselor is very counselor hazel in '_``_2447.359 feature each month is a contracts that are advertised here or published in the agenda here and there either they awarded under offices delegation or they 're a in a couple of these we mentioned the miserable valuation service we just dealt with a few moments ago the route recreation reserve main lighting similarly dealt with and there 's probably others in here but i think it 's a it 's a good process to publish these on a monthly basis that it provides information to the public and also in a indirect way and probably information to some of the people who are participating on where they 're progressing through the system hazel minh mr. Hayes woman is council hazel and I 've got it in one good any cows are wishing just speak against the motion for the motion yeah hazel and hugged me all in favor against carried item 10.1 counselors on page 87 actually the at motion the recommendations on page 88 in regard to the greater Shepherd a movement and play strategy draft challenges and opportunities paper do I have a counselor counselor summer yes thank you you have a second to please counselors very causal summer I 'm more than happy to support this opportunities paper uh we sort of have this and drive around the corner even if it 's five minutes away and don 't consider other modes of transport that could potentially be not only healthier for the human body because we are in the middle of a public epidemic of obesity in this region but also stimulate foot traffic which could in turn stimulate the economy so this is a very very broad way of looking at things that could potentially revolutionize the way we look at traffic travel and a lot of that is to do with car parking rate payers will be pretty happy that that will well and truly be part of this discussion will be looking at how to increase public transport especially considering our aging population and our low demographics will be trying to alleviate pressure on the road network and just to reduce the higher level of car commuters understandably many of those car commuters are from small towns and we do have an urban sprawl but if we can tackle the CBD and encourage walking and cycling and also I love you for the freights system up to Queensland and the on a good track to deliver a healthier community so yes please give us any feedback you have in regards to anything to do with transport and we 'll be looking at it in due course Thank You counselor is very thanks mr. mayor look look in my I suppose preparation or research it 's interesting that every major city or even rural city has got a time movement play strategy and ultimately aims like a people-friendly city improving conditions for pedestrians cyclists and those using public transport it should strive to achieve the right balance for accommodating these priority uses which dovetails into what counselor Somerset whilst also addressing the needs for parking loading and car accessibility further it 's also effectively a strategic document and of particular relevance at the moment is the CBD ml strategy outcomes that we would like to get started on and it also involves a degree of environmental sensitivity and progressive thinking and how we can progress our city along the lines of the strategy could Thank You councillor any can also wishing to speak against this motion council 's wishing to speak all in favor of the motion this motion carried I 'm 10.2 cousin Park Advisory Committee terms of reference on page 95 councils there is a recommendation so I have a council wishing to move that as the motion give a neti a second to please councillor sudden

tour of the of the city and I commend those volunteers from that group for the fantastic work they 're doing in a particular area terms of reference give them a clear guideline as to what they can do

motion I 'm good okay kelso chief any closing comments all in favor of appointing the recommended people yes in favor against motion carried congratulations we DS item 10.4 on page 104 and 105 many other pages to up to 109 C recommendation their counselors we have a council wishing to move the recommendation as a motion I 'll second I [Music] years old mover and seconder councillor giovannetti council person is former councillor Roman was very passionate about lack of commercial property integer we have a business here that 's struggling to find somewhere doc right from and here 's pronoun plication and it 's great a girl to move for them the danger of not having enough industrial land is that these businesses will go somewhere else which is the last thing we want there was a couple of objectives and I appreciate that but is basically going to be from an industrial so it I 'm so yes hopefully it 's been a bit of a battle to get this permit done but now we can get up and run into you through tonight and you can start his business coupe account Radhika Kinsler counselor giovannetti Thank You mr. Barry this application is a committed use in a farming zone as council parents and has mentioned before this air all areas looking at being rezone to industrial so this application fits with the permitted use in relation to all the objections that were received or think the planning conditions that have been placed on this particular site are more than adequate that and they should appease the objectors significantly I believe thank you any counsel is wishing to speak against this motion counselor summer I 'd like to speak against the motion for the simple fact that it 's in an investigation area is I correct just point of clarification so it 's an investigation area and it actually states that the planning scheme seeks to avoid incremental approvals and development in identified investigations area until it 's all use development subdivision all of that so basically we 're going against our own policy now more for more industrial edited sure we know that that is needed tottori is a thriving small town it was built on the back of industry in that area but we do need to be confident that we 're putting industry in the right place so during my last term I saw other applications denied because they were in an investigation area zone so which is it I 'm trying to get this council to have some kind of consistency in their approach here so at this present time it seems to me that will go against the planning scheme which means it would probably hold up if it was taken to VCAT and I tend to agree with some of the objectives that it does preempt zoning of industrial land before we 've even finish the process so because it 's an investigation area i am objecting thank you any councillor wish to speak before the motion yes counselor easily look in them in looking at this your issue I 'm a mindful is currently within the farming zone and as such it 's a permitted use in that zone the land is also in area that 's being looked at as an investigation area by the industrial strategy that 's been adopted by council some almost six years ago or five and a half years ago now and given that there is a lack of supply of industrial his own land insurer as others have said and have clearly obvious that into the future the land has been identified as future industrial land so I don 't see any conflict at all between the the fact that it is mean investigation area it is already even without the investigation area it would be a permit use in the in the farm farming zone I think it 's also interesting the and a mindful of the fact that the the applicant has indicated in writing that they have no intention to seek a rezoning of the land let those natural courses and take take effect so I think it 's it 's a good outcome but I 'm also aware that there are into account hence there is a very detailed set of conditions attached to the planning permit which would be the case with all circumstances where council is approving a planning application specific to the particular site and hopefully those conditions that have been applied will that 's why the objectives although I know there was a mediation session and no objectors were withdrawn so potentially this will go to another place for brother determination but hopefully on confident that the conditions that have been applied here will be upheld at that other place Thank You councillor hazel and any council wishing to speak against the motion as I was very thank you to me at the outset let me state that I support business attraction and development wherever it may be in the municipality the question though is at what cost this agenda item is a case in point the recommendation itself is pretty benign to the sensitivity contracted contractors depo and a farming zone which by all accounts as a committee is because in fact it 's not a specified exclusion there 's always been a call for more here tonight he was very vocal very passionate about the need and desire for this to occur and I support that when industry and residential dwellings however come into close proximity there will always be issues the landowner who purchased his residential property as a lifestyle profit understandably after almost 30 years of a join the amenity is confronted with the development which promises to upset what he considers an idyllic lifestyle they accepted order of things from his perspective and particularly so in the area behind him is farmland I understand and appreciate the very things that the objectives have raised at mediation and continued to object to to this very day and well understand their lack of confidence or skepticism in fact that should permit at issue in fact should a permanent issue that conditions imposed on the permit a have real teeth and be more importantly will be a force effectively it 's one thing to stipulate conditions it 's an entirely different proposition to enforce them the applicant and I stand to be corrected on this has the same business at another location but presumably is issues of dust noise truck Bergman 's ever-present issues at the current locality nothing suggests to me that miraculously they will obey that the proposed new location presumably these same conditions were expressed concerns for residents of the current locality and not unreasonable once for the objectives to be concerned about it would appear that the area that we have proposed about consulted water states that cousin street is overwhelmingly industrial based upon that in a northern section across cousin street as a council work to depot and the small hobby farm that includes crop paddocks and a house close to cousin street east there 's a vet clinic transport Depot and residences which all face onto ross street but a separator from the investigation area by the Golden Marie water channelreserve South there are residences in a small hobby farm that includes a cropped paddock which faces on to Hogan Street and a separator from the investigation area by the Goblin marie ward channelreserve and to the west small hobby farm containing and dwelling that is accessed from hogan street ensure by australian there is a multitude of different is consistent with the use that is already in existence of them potentially council depo and numerous other businesses however i would suggest it none of the existing uses our quiet time counselor hours vary the extension mr. me thank you all in agreement counselors yes continue thank you none of the existing uses a quad and the same vein is what the current applicant is proposing the test for the success of this application is whether the abject objectives have confidence in the permit and that the appropriate conditions to ensure the current level of amenity can be maintained on adjoining land in short effectively a leap of faith and a trust in the system I think that amenity is a very subjective thing before one I can relate to it and I know that it is not a defined use in a farm zone but by the same token is a u.s. more akin to a true industrial area where should there should be numerous businesses conducting like type businesses and which are not enriching on farms and residential dwellings and on amenity I do not support the speak for the motion against own counselor Patterson our year so first mortgage closing comments thank you sometimes you just have to have a look and most of us councils have a look on our bus trip you drive down there and you can see that it should be industrial area half at one side of the road is completely industrial already has been for donkey 's AIDS there is a small development down the end as counselors very described there is that there 's longer our cities not the armed as far as I 'm concerned it is openly he 's a farming overweight present if a business can 't_''_3477.77 set up in a place like that god help us where we 're going it brings up a place where a business should be far as I 'm concerned if we get to the stage where we stop people investing building businesses trying to set up jobs for other people in the town like this will happen if we can 't allow that to go I really have really would struggle for weird will have a future in de start a business run a business make a door from cell and employ a lot of people and cute counselor Patterson that being said all councillors your favor of the motion against theirs in place mr. me division all councils in favor in favor alpha Patterson Council O 'Keefe counselor Adam counselor hazel Minh counselor Jeff Nettie Council Sutton yes counselors against counselor summer and counselor is very motion carried in 10.5 counselors River draft through the katek strategic plan community consultation there is a recommendation on page 122 rubber Council wishing to move that recommendation as a motion I 'll move that recommendation review Council Patterson do have a seconder please council summer that 's the pencil oh yes this is this year of torment your roommate this is a very important doctrine of putting out for the next five years it 's a way forward for the organization the organization is getting bigger work better accepted it 's all about taking the river back to people and people cream coming back to the river I like make special mention Helen Murdoch from the CMA who has done a what 's he going through his change of staff and how long has put a hand up and did a great job of the strategy it is pretty exciting what we 're going to own for the next five years and I 'd encourage people have a reader when it goes out the consultation on the thirteenth of februari and hopefully they can get all the discussion points back into it for the 27th of March so what are the recommended good reading and it 's a future whether we had to take poober strategy to take account like councillor summer um I 'm new to this committee but we 've already had our first meeting and that was held outside over at the Shepherd and we 're which was great the rivers right there is right on our doorstep like literally if you turned a corner you can see it from even where we 're sitting right now and it is amazing it 's got all sorts of animals birds all of it there 's opportunities to go in kayaks and canoes airs opportunities to go on tours for this committee is all about that looking especially to get the young ones involved so that we can break that cycle just pretending the rivers not there because it 's amazing Thank You councillor summer counselors wishing to speak against this motion for the motion council Patterson any closing comments no it 's all been jailed interested good thank you all in favor against motion carried it 's counselors page 1 p-9 the parliamentary inquiry into community energy projects there 's a recommendation there on page 139 to have a council wishing to move that as the emotion council summer she 's printed on 129 second to please cancel certain now for summer quite simply we were made aware of an inquiry into a community energy project projects and we 've made a submission that hasn 't quite been endorsed until now hopefully but they were seeking information on how to better their to frame the legislation so that more people can take up opportunities in green energy and we 've had a few suggestions which will hopefully make it easier for our community if they decide to act on 't consult as far as I would have potentially liked to but at the same time but at the same time we were time-limited so that 's I 'm happy to endorse it Thank You counsel Sutton good any council we should just speak against the motion and for the motion and council summer all in favor against motion carried item 10.7 recommendation counters on page 133 and regard to a planning permit application 2016 299 application to self package liquor so to have a council wishing to move the recommendation as the motion Thank You councillor Patterson to have a seconder how 's ur doin Eddie councillor Patterson do it should speak to the motion is not been said about this basically it is a high-profile area on the corner and Cole 's of applied for a permit as you need is it right to have a outlet alcohol takeaway out there basically i firmly believe all the planning restrictions are in there will tension over coming in problem that there is this concerns that people will walk out of there with alcohol it open it and drink it that I 've seen around I live next door to a kohls or a little worse improvement and that was never a problem there I can 't see how if we were to knock it back kneecap certainly wouldn 't support our our decision I blue as I 've made it clear in a couple of a couple of cases that I 've actually commented on social issues how to concern to them they work solely on planning permits and the legislation have to work with so I am confident that there will be no issue there is plenty of outlets for alcohol in this in the tester now and other ones not going to make any difference so as I 'm concerned it becomes very much a financial decision of theirs and there is lots of those made there that have enough to wait out front etc and ASI I move this much you support the motion Thank You councillor patterson and councillor jibon it he will sort of the Council of Patterson mr. me and I think we all have something sense about the social so what could near the bus terminal I think what staff have done is good in so much as the hours of operation have been limited to the less than what the application was for which I think will have an advantage Kyle 's have also indicated that they are prepared to beef up security in that area as far as cameras if it 's needed and I think that as council person has mentioned if cuz if we 've decided to not practice application calls are targeting weekend so i think that the conditions that we have on there I think that we 've done what we can as a responsible authority Thank You councillor giovanetti any council wishing to speak against this motion councillor summer yes I have given this a lot of thought and I am objecting but I do agree with them councillor Patterson and councillor giovanetti I actually initially decided that there was no other option but we had to grant it because it ticked all the boxes but I think it goes a bit deeper than that so I am objecting on the grounds of social impact environment act it was presented to us very clearly that yes there will be an impact that is social but it 's unlikely to stand up at vcat and if it did go to vcap perhaps we 'd lose a few of these conditions that were placed on the permit but I 'm looking at the permit and I 'm thinking they 're pretty generic conditions anyway you probably need them just to get the actual permit to sell the alcohol the original plans for that corner was green produce they were going to open up the windows and it was going to be a amazing or healthy spreading a great message and it became boxed up and now they want to turn it into a liquor store so when they 're talking about cameras and security if necessary it does put a bit of a question mark on to what their intentions really will be when the crunch comes that 's been there for four years we 've blanked up blanked up boarded up windows so alcohol once the windows are open strangely enough they 've decided to open bottles here it says there won 't be any advertising on the windows but there is a question of whether that would be preferable to people seeing the alcohol it is in close proximity to the bus stop and close proximity to Centrelink there 's an enormous amount of foot traffic and we already have more than enough liquor outlets like people can say we have liquor outlets already so what 's the difference but the fact is it is proven that there will be a social impact and at this stage I don 't want to end up overhearing a conversation a couple of years down the line of people saying why didn 't council do something when they could have why is this corner turned into such a dive I would think that I actually stood up for something that I believed in and if it goes to be cut it sends a very clear message to these coals planners the multinationals that we won 't be making it all that easy for them to come in and take advantage this section 60 of the planning and environment to strengthen section 60 because we know it 's inadequate we know that vcap basically they consider what they think is significant without actually going into social effects but it states here that they 're intending to bring legislation forward to ensure that appropriate weight is given to community 's concerns as evidenced by the number of objectives and social impact so I don 't think we should just roll over and let them do this without some kind of a fight because I mean councils are there to take a stand and if they 're looking at whether or not social impact matters to councils and whether they should be changing legislation how are they going to know if we don 't actually record objections in the council meeting so it could be money well spent or we may even win Thank You councillor any other council we should you speak for version very calm even respect to aspects of social impact as part of the planning permit application the applicants were required to undertake a social impact assessment and in the assessment of the application council then engaged impacts of the application on both occasions they were found to be an acceptable outcome thank you for those comments any other council wishing to speak against the motion counselor is very interesting these type of applications because on the one hand that ticks all the boxes and effectively we what we do is we look at it from a perspective of risk risk assessment risk to the council in terms of not approving this application because what will happen is all will end up at their cat and VCAT will then dilute pardon the pun dilute our conditions that 's all well and good but the reality is i think is important and i support councillor summer in this regard by putting conditions to one side putting the conditions to one side I think people need to understand and appreciate that council is concerned about the social impact of alcohol concerned about the number of liquor outlets that we have in the community already within the CBD and I was discussing this with councillor summer and I think we can with seven and math was never my strong subject central business district the question I pose is doing need more the question I posed to my fellow councillors do we need more that particular location is a location that is popular and sometimes for all the wrong reasons I question whether the presence of another alcohol outlet notwithstanding the conditions that have been sought to be at to the permit will really achieve the outcome but again o mighty one vote and it really comes down to a question of how my fellow councillors to view this particular application I don 't support it and I don 't support it primarily on the basis that notwithstanding the correct permit conditions of things putting twice I know that the town planning is not a panacea for all perceived social games nor planning decision-making the forum for addressing all issues of social community concern at its heart planning is about the use the development and protection of land and I get that but it still doesn 't stop me from registering my disapproval in the oceans are not supporting his application Thank You councillor any other council wish you had any I actually went up there and had a Miss it around and a look and walk around the area that 's been proposed I do personally feel that it not the ideal location for another liquor outlet I do feel socially little bit socially responsible being being a long-term resident here on my life is either you need you to sit back and hope that you can make some differences I personally think that it 's definitely not the right spot and we definitely don 't need another thank you cancel the other council we should just be counseled certain all right here there 's only been three it was an only had three objections lodged and the objection relate to the location being an appropriate saturation of package leader and the count the officers engages social impact expert to assess the application which founds the application achieves an acceptable planning outcome so I just would like just to make it no that being said all councils are spoken counselor person which like any closing comments I would or would there 's been three council speak against it and I up in VK they are not stand up for what the decision is we 've got to make we can 't afford to get on our high horse and say people should never buy alcohol in the corner born in mod street there 's an application there that we 've got to deal with we can 't_''_4463.219 say there 's enough in this area already that will not stand up in VK don 't laugh at us it 'll cost us seventy thousand dollars that privilege if we want to go down a path and and become involved in trying to suppress the sale of alcohol in Shepherd we are made in this path that 's been thirty seventy thousand dollars of VK we 're better off tackling it from another perspective because that 's just throwing money away and what about mr. mayor is newington new information being introduced without course but we don 't have a chance for debate was that new information Oh all of it thank you for your comments continue counsel Patterson casual someone was concerned about people saying counseling to do anything about it the help counsel done I 've disarranged seventy dollars out with the baby in the bath water it 's a waste of money to defend it if there was another option you had no you would look at it but there is no option as far as I 'm concerned that he 's a hundred percent sure to go through a recap planning appeal I have no doubt whatsoever as not being one ground mentioned here tonight that would stand up against it so I support those counselors are speaking against it as far as we don 't necessarily need another alcohol outlet in town but knocking is back is just a silly way of doing it we 're wasting seventy thousand dollars it rape fires have got a pie including us including in there Thank You counsel Patterson I mean said we 'll put this to the vote counselors all in favor against motion carried isn 't please Mr Man well councils in favor councillor Patterson councillor key in favor councillor Keith counselor Adam counselor hazen counselor giovanetti counselor sutton against counts the summer and counselor or as very motion carried very council 's there for the clarification in the next item on the agenda 10.8 i understand there 's been an alternative motional seen our attention and I 've asked for short recess so that I can consider the new motion which has been put by council officers and also consider my position in relation to progressing this motion at war council is happy to adjourn for five minutes in agreement but we 'll adjourn the meeting for five men singh be back we can ever retire to the council sweet if you choose to and we 'll have a quick discussion _"

Australia have no racism and a preparation I 've known suffering and pain and lived with the impacts or personal experience and over histories or was done to them the families and communities there for a lil process of trust and relationship building is necessary it will take time energy and patience for a true reconciliation path to be forged we also gather today to remember all those aboriginals and all Strait Islander people affected by the practice or forcibly removing children from their families and communities remember we 're sorry pain and suffering it took the children away from their mothers fathers and an endless at all the children their mothers did culture and spirituality they wanted the children to lose it their identity and indigenous people many parents name is Logan children again many of the spiders suffered great hardship some of the survivors do not know how to love a great wrong was done and I speak of the war against the Aboriginal peoples in what is known as the frontiers Wars just why is it today that this war that occurred on Australian soil is not being remembered that the same same percent remembrance of the difference as to the other Wars that Australians were involved in today I simply ask the open question where is the bumping the earnest reflections the flower greets the Solomon crowd speeches of bravery and respectful acknowledgment of those that died in action of those who are shot down and killed while they were trying to protect their family their way of life their country one wonders does the target is a nap Awards recognition of anything to do with its casualties the victims those that the war was fought against are not being just men but women the elders teenagers little children bravery the honor and respect found out there and carried from such an unequal battle field lest we forget their other known and verified poisonings of claim groups I 've asked me constrict light lays the flower the many sanctioned masochism as many recorded illegal hunts by Stockman and settle up the chasing down from horseback of men women and children including the forcing of the MOBA clips or into water to them either drown or be shot it seems to me that we as a nation should be acknowledged and remembering that long bloody and eternal war before reciting owns of offshore Wars and assurance of those participants not being forgotten yes lest we forget indeed when I look this Aboriginal flag when I reflect upon that little piece of cloth means it was designed by Harold hommerson first phone in July 1971 he described as symbolic meanings of the flag colors it 's black representing the Aboriginal people of Australia the gold circle representing the Sun the giver of life and the protector red representing the red ochre red earth the ogre used in our ceremonies and speaking country it 's a bold and beautiful proud flag and i truly do love it it 's been phoned from the aboriginal ten obscene canberra since 1972 Cathy Freeman Ward and his along with your strange bag after a multiple moons in the 99 for commonwealth games and yes as my friend here said in two thousand a part of reconciliation we deployed from the Sydney Harbour Bridge with half a million people turned out for the walk for reconciliation showing the huge amount of supporters behind reconciliation this country for five and a half hours of continuous stream of people make your way across that they are not making it the largest political demonstration in this country that marks they don 't ate the public about the poor conditioners Aboriginal health of education and a welfare of the high prisoner breaks and a number of deaths in custody suffered by indigenous australians to me though this flag means much more can I point to you that the color of the black represents the eagle and the kiddies force to plan our people the rapes the forfeiture of one 's our traditional position and obligations officially sanctioned mass murders the conspiracies of silence the deaths in custody the poor house in the Air Force polity and the over-representation in our presence today can I speak to you that read of that beautiful flag can seemingly representing the color of the blood of our people they are brave people blood much by a forbearance flowing into the soil from such brave ancestors and a challenge the taking of their country wooden weapons against gunpowder and steel Canada rifle that bright better the flag represents the Koshien copious bloodshed our people murdered or take it as slow as prisoners of whole families and groups running so desperately from their lives from rifle bullet horsemen and club and if students from the school please don 't make mistake my passion for anger I 'm not an angry man even though our people had much to be angry at I personally choose not for the angry it 's better for one 's health as a person with considerable connection to country in a Christian belief system I watched with great attention or as I it happens I acknowledge body bunzl has been created desi he resented representing our Creator it is the goal of my flag that represents the Sun as the giver of life and for me I look at my flag and I say arisen some my eternal future I hope in the wondrous Dreamtime beyond this life after the darkness the most desperate of times they 're always towards a new day and there is a reason some unlucky to still have a faith than to believe integrations creator and be able to look forward to sharing Dreamtime these presents that little 3-piece flag there says that I am that we are that our people are still here you 're proud and loudly says we have survived the claims the truth of this generation and our last to survive there are children and their future children will not open continue to survive that they will thrive what is changing my story in 1962 do alcohol field family bonus my other friend what was then the family home her then husband a returned soldier retained the wall Commission home and she was single parents pension there was no such thing because of the lack of safe affordable housing because of enforced poverty me and my two brothers were charged after my mother was seeking help from services no offense placing about it and I visible means of support within maybe Ward 's of the state and incarcerated in a place called Tirana still registered as a prison today within friend from there to a place called a Labour reception center but it 's not like a reception you get in a wedding with in shipped take it to a place to come battle rap will be step years and children 's hunt up there and we now know its day current royal permission the any trees that were down there we hear something of Uniqua tease not all people are going to talk the cost is too much what we 're not hearing is of the torture we 're only hearing of the sexual abuse there hasn 't been an inquiring use of torture that occurred find out one lady who spoke to me and told me how she was held down a painkiller as a patient for stealing a packet of cigarettes her a girlfriend but it seems removed that you can still see my wife and I my family foster carers we 've had many many children come and stay some bleep son from month some free year they won for over a decade and that 's a wondrous thing because I know my experience tells me that if we have one child that is safe that are warm that they are well-fed that they have cared even only for just one night that 's a huge thing in that child 's life a week is better for advice better month is error but what is changing last night Victoria 's out of home care system is estimated there were six thousand eight hundred children young people instead can one in 15 of arbiters Aboriginal so gross over representation of what we may come one-point-seven percent of the population and yet in Victoria 150 children zap original in state care the flats the place of refuge whether you 're the other people flew tuned in 1945 no 1939 from covering place of refuge a place where because of the lack of safe affordable housing people forced to resign live there a place I 've not yet completely broken home a place of a dream of something sacred and warmth Australia 's come a long way I think the 1967 referendum the Freedom Rides in New South Wales in the early 1950s the Royal Commission to the deaths in custody it was a year ago in August this year the end premise Steve Bracks gave an apology to people who forcibly take a look at your returns one can 't help but cynical be circle though because the Victorian Government change the stables prior than apologies so that didn 't have to admit liability we apologize but how sorry are we today I encourage young people get the best education you can is absolutely priceless Aboriginal children you 're not Aboriginal children get the best education you can that was something that was rock for me you have an opportunity make the best of it wherever you can also want to speak to the healing that is on offer for our country but if you listen with your heart your spirit to country country can offer healing and as a Christian man I share i 'm not sure where country starts and stops and we 're gone our Creator begins and fishes I 'm not at all sure the country can talk to you and with them can be the opportunity for great healing and I think in the words of forrest gump that 's about all other the same the emerges age and every one of us to make reconciliation a part of your own story our future rain falls of the reconciliation must live in the hearts lives and actions all Australians as we move forward in the knowledge that we will the fenders for everyone that have diversity max is richer together we are stronger national reconciliation weapons and thoughtful illustrates the lever beyond our shared history cultures and achievers and to explore our agents can join the national

Kevin Rudd issues that apology in 2008 on behalf of the Australian people the legacy of generational grief and trauma which could continues to scare at our people and that of the Australia of the Australian culture sort of current Premier Daniel Andrews on the front page of the age acknowledged a significant rise in 2015 in their own care of Aboriginal kids in Victoria and I think we add they 're closing the gap report being handed down yesterday and then it hasn 't really saw the improvement that we 're looking for you would need tax the question as to whether the Australian people 's response to this admission has been up the necessary depth to breach the divide and to empower the people as the apology or did the apology stimulate validate or initiate action as it shifted their hearts and minds of the Australian people and leadership across politics and the industry and I think you know it has started to move and I think we 've got a lot of shift in attitudes across action plans that have been developed with major industries across Australia but the way in which some governments are now viewing the approach to Aboriginal futures is a lot more there 's a lot more focused on how to build the empowerment and autonomy of Aboriginal regions to to take control of the issues at a very micro level in fact in Aboriginal family homes I think then do you think we 've generated you know the necessary policy platforms that lead not too emotional reconciliation but to recognizing the call for a treaty something which Aboriginal people have been advocating for since the night since the eighteen hundreds do you think this apology is generated the necessary reparations to address the grief an ongoing legacy of trauma in its many forms we live in a very prosperous region this region as the resources to make the difference I 'm putting to you today that we need to take affirmative action on repositioning the value of indigenous peoples in the society in which we live in we can 't always be characterized by the poverty and the deficit that underpins a position of relevance in the social and economic community of the Murray Goulburn Murray of shepherding of echuca kyabram and the towns and regions were living in the apology signified that all tiers of government except legal and moral responsibilities to acknowledge and redress the humanity of Aboriginal people we are the original people we are dizziness to this land we have evolved dear in your honor country over many many many thousands of years our sense of spirituality has been aligned to the intricate balance of nature and the environment that shifted quite considerably with the imposition of the the invasion and the omit the imposition of Christianity and that their interpretation of the way Christianity works with Aboriginal spirituality and I think we 're still coming to terms with how that works our language the audio to language is intrinsically linked tuned to the sounds the smells and the physical expressions of the environment we live in we take this responsibility of spirituality and relationship very seriously it is embedded in our police of creation and the land our schools universities and libraries we 're in the in dance in some enchant our use of reckoning of maths of understanding of science of astrology of birth and death this purple sense of purpose in place of understanding of power of the mastery of our of of our existence changed as we all know in a very cuddly kind of a catalyst big way we are recovering but it 's a being a very very slow process dispossession and genocidal practices in the early part underpinned by notions of cultural superiority almost wiped our people out to the point where we are almost unrecognizable in our practices and their physical practices to our ancestors but we are strongly connected through our sense of identity and spirituality and connection to the land in which one which we then we have been generation Lisa been subjected to a process that has been attempting to systematically in the institution dismantle and replace our identity this has to stop in survival we pay our respects to our elders adopting that effort had to adopt the cultures that have come to our lens it is where without doubt the time to restore the our legal rights to country the benefits there is and the responsibilities that are insured today we have symbolisms of engagement we have the flag of the aboriginal nation that we have attached ourselves to we 're looking to merge the sense of symbolism of Aboriginal by Aboriginal identity with the Australian culture we 're close like camera ganja where we sought refuge we have organizations like the rumble are a cooperative we have the very famous Rumble our football nipple club a place of social enjoyment and cultural affirmation we have Aboriginal people in business in universities in universe in administrative roles in bureaucracy in sport in art in music run across the spectrum we have approximately 5,000 Aboriginal people in the region in which we live in here within a radius of a of around about 75 to 80 80 cows that 's a great asset to the region it would be an understatement to say we 're in a higher state of anxiety and the height and said there 's a heightened sense of urgency to protect our heritage our spiritual and cultural sites our families and being that the people where you come from it 's our responsibility but we have been challenged by our capacity to meet that responsibility we are doing our very best to protect to Spain restore the knowledge of our ancestors but we need your support to do that as you 're the order people or as Aboriginal people we are constantly translating and interpreting the way we go about everyday business to where we go about our daily lives into an Aboriginal view of that so all of our interview interactions we 're doing up off we 're pursuing the knowledge and skills in the universities and secondary schools that require us to get these skills to protect our position ourselves in the 21st century you would agree that a complexity of design of a struggle of society of Australian culture and diversity from our perspective will requirement Aboriginal people to have protection it will require a multi-layered multi-tiered treaty approach a formal legal agreement of our humanity and rights as you 're the other people treaty would be a gift to you to society it will facilitate the knowledge future in your future in the future of our collective society it will address the act of invasion of disposition and the legal land acquisitions of your honor country it will position Australian society the Goulburn Murray region to construct a future without fear to grow and mature as a nation to celebrate to establish a national and global identity that is inclusive and celebrated this region already stands out as a region of leadership it can stand out as the region that led this nation on reform it can be recognized globally as a place of humanity innovation and diversity this can have a significant economic impact on our collective futures so you know be active in your pursuit of cultural knowledge and understanding and engagement assist develop the institutional approach to building knowledge particularly through curriculum design and professional development you can 't_''_880.87 be a passing bystander complicit in the crime of ambivalence and inaction this is the obvious is the call this is what the what the apology gave permission for having for people not just happening but for people to to learn to seek seek knowledge lies in front of us in closing its 20 years this year that the rumble our football netball club has been participating in a competition and it 's it 's it 's been a very very positive 20 years and it 's where Aboriginal people have come into the social environment of this of the region that we live in in and in where we host the hospitality of other towns and other non Aboriginal peoples coming into our place which has been a fantastic learning experience both for ourselves and for the people that come in contact with us so in closing come to the come to come to rumble era football nipple Club become a paid-up social member paid up social member support the symbolism of social engagement in the sharing of hospitality celebrate with us and Barry for the power of the people so thank you very much at this morning _"

you can go up and talk to them or we have the amazing louise dwyer right in the middle there hand up so have a chat with them and let them know if you have any ideas on how we can continue to improve access and inclusion for people living with a disability and their carers also within our community council 's universal access and inclusion plan outlines a range of strategies and actions to improve access to council services improve access to information support and also infrastructure it is so important that all members of our community have equal access to our facilities information and support and that 's what this day is all about so i 'd like to thank the organisers and the community groups who have come together to organise this fantastic event i believe david mentioned most of them and i won 't try because i know very much appreciated so i 'll hand back to david and i hope everybody has a wonderful day certainly the weather for it thanks fern i just thought i 'd mention uh international day of people with a disability the theme for 2015 inclusion matters access and empowerment for people of all abilities the estimated 1 billion people living with disabilities worldwide face many barriers to inclusion in many aspects of society as a result people with disabilities do not enjoy the same access to society on an equal basis with others which includes areas of transportation employment and education as well as social and political participation the right to participate in public life is essential to create stable democracy active citizenship and reduce inequalities in society some of the sub themes of the day today making cities inclusive and accessible for all as a past member of the disability advisory committee i can certainly say that greater shepparton council is doing their bit to achieve this goal and he 's probably well ahead of a number of other towns around this area improving data around disability and statistics is that is out there about those people that fit into this particular day but on on the weekend of my 22nd birthday i decided to take the weekend off work and went away with four other mates who were going up up up into the hills to go camping full driving fishing and just doing what young boys do having fun um it was late on the friday night because we 'd all worked on the friday so by the time we all packed their stuff got our camping gear together and got going it was fairly late i i was a passenger in my own vehicle and it was it was raining we didn 't know the road on a right hand bend we were the third car there was three cars in convoy we were the third car and we failed to make it around the bend the back end of the vehicle slipped out on us and then we went over a 40 foot in bank then we rolled the car hit a tree and finished up in a lagoon as a result of the crash i paralyzed waist level down so i can 't feel or move anything from the waist when when we had the crash we were fairly remote so we didn 't have phone reception or anything and mates were going to try and get me out of the vehicle but i knew straight away that i 'd broken my back so i didn 't let him move me because i didn 't know what other damage that may or may not do to my back ultimately now wouldn 't have made much difference because the spinal cord was severed but at the time didn 't know that so uh one of them jumped in the car and went to get help while the others sort of tried to support me and stabilize me one of my best mates growing up you know i 'd lived up the road from him um growing up as a kid we were all we did everything together hadn 't seen him for a few years after school and it was nice having him there that night because he he was there with me the whole time to go through waist deep water in the middle of winter so it was pretty cold and he was able to get his hands down behind my back and he could feel a dislocated vertebrae and i told him that i broke my back but he he basically confirmed that i 'd done something fairly fairly major he said he couldn 't tell what what was going on but there was something definitely not right having the vertebrae sticking out the way it was so i was laying in the car in the cold dark knowing myself that i 'd broke my back because of the amount of pain i was in and in fact i couldn 't feel my legs um and i i kind of was thinking wheelchairs aren 't that bad are they surely i can i can get around in a wheelchair but that 'll be right um little did i know how hard it was going to be and and the other internal functions that are affected from from a spinal cord injury it 's not just the physical disability that i 've got it all those things that go along with with the disability and also the skin care pressure sores and injuries you do to your legs and and that and not knowing makes life slower and harder but i 've learned to deal with everything in the best way i can _"

    "text": "so I 'm just going to do a very quick introduction just take a little bit about the history of renew newcastle and how through entering new Australia so tell me a little bit about the the logic behind the program and how that works and then we can get a chance to check out this great way to the space next door so I just start what I quickly just start with the story of your new newcastle who 's beating in castle that 's all the good actually Vincent Sydney you get like half that number i dunno why but so Nickerson has a it had a very turbulent history ogres for a while there once upon a time the big steel works and you 've got some 20,000 people it closed in the late 90s 20,000 people out of a community of what three four hundred thousand something is like you know basically everyone 's family works the stewards and so the net effect was this very before crushing loss of jobs and whole community i came back i grew up in new castle I 've been and long story short I was just looking at the vacancies in the main street and just seeing hampi shop empty shop but this is the second oldest here in Australia to enter view of my life now boarded up that 's a beautiful long time this is beautiful model sorry I was pointing a laser pointer at this guy over here by colleagues without strong point to the model there of your old post office which apparently is gone you can 't assault post offices in the process of deteriorating quite neglected 20ft for 15 years and is falling apart before prozac there pragmatically there 's just a few I 'm a friendly shop along the 293 so in 2008 I went back to Newcastle and decided to set up it was a non-profit company base to had a really simple idea that all of these redbox between two buildings and you girls at the time were what opportunities can start something try something do something basic principle of renewed and be spaces for lost opportunities this property that we 're standing in has been empty for four and of those days was a day that someone didn 't try an idea didn 't try and launch a business didn 't bring a community to get up didn 't try and make something happen and after the battle communities for pleasure when lots of people are trying to make lots of exact whether their businesses community projects if whether they 're for-profit or not-for-profit communities work better with people are doing things that bring people together and there 's economic value to that is social value to that what we found and I think we 've sort of proven with the model canoe is that for property owners bizarrely letting building 70 is the dumbest thing you can do because you 're missing the chance to have people invest their initiatives their effort their sweat your imagination is doing things are trying painting those properties when you would otherwise just be watching the material right so we began what I put Michael the experiment back in the 2008 this had once upon a time being the main mall in your car since when when I was a kid my I know this is almost like not focus all but I can always remember it looking like that and 2080 look like this empty empty empty making painting that guy was here was literally one of him and those two people with it but you had this problem facing this block that these blocks there 's about a four walks trip in the set of gear castle where there were more shots in keeping they were full until you had this feedback where priests are anyone 's think that opening a new business we look at that area go I 'm not going to do it there because there 's no are there people the story of that area the whole narrative that had evolved was like why would why he like don 't go there it is sad now like you have yogurt it 's a sad story now the whole thing had become this self-perpetuating feedback so because shops renting Enid 's even the successful businesses that were there we 're moving out to the suburbs or other parts of town because the emptiness around that was actually process where we began to work with the owners of those empty properties to borrow and lend them to create event projects on a rolling 4 30 day basis so the idea is if the army gets a better offer they can have their building back we 're just going to like it for someone who 's going to try something may not work but the act of lots of people trying lots of things is what a community needs so they got in there ladies their sweat and their effort and they began to fix up and clean up buildings this is acquaintance of young man to make kids phones and bags and jewelry they 're big like a promoter put them into a shops turned out they didn 't really told me photography gallery I don 't know because everyone see what have a relative is a good photographer who like puts on my mind is anyone one of those people yes um so these guys set up immunity photography gallery really simple concept run they don 't hate this exhibition with local Newcastle and Hunter the landscape knows someone who takes great photographs right they don 't get opportunity to show any photographers multiply that by their friends and relatives that all came to opening night and you had a line up around the walk biggest block with the biggest view than that area had seen in probably a deca really really really simple stuff but made a big difference this is an old logo slogan store would fire by the way this is an interest visual art galleries now the quakes with makers milliner 's one of the things we can do work with whatever a building 's been straight since in this case we had a bare concrete shell who never had a fit out so there was nothing to break so we let out a senior government crazy with it they cover the walls in latex it 's a big it 's an antique I don 't know anyone open tab react to explain that no okay you don 't have to directly Kiki back if you had three drinks an exhibition opening ripping latex off the wall it 's a lot of fun hour _"

work the roof renew program is a new social enterprise designed to capitalize on community renewal economic development the arts and creative industries across the city it works with communities and property owners to take otherwise empty shops just like this one and make them available to incubate short-term projects or use for artists creative projects enterprising community of initiatives this here is actually based on the intellectual property experiencing case study pioneer Byron Union parcel which marks we 'll talk in a bit more detail shortly it 's established as a low cost low budget doing yourself urban renewal scheme there 's proof of a successful and generated in media and Community Interest locally nationally and internationally through a simple strategy based on in New Castle passivity that has transformed them less than two years later the direct result of Newcastle was more than 70 new businesses and initiatives that have been seated in around newcastle Lonely Planet hailed Newcastle 's efforts as one of top ten cities in the world to visit in 2011 due to the exciting collective creative community that have been sedated there this program is now being successfully rolled out over 40 different cities of red Australia with dramatic impacts on Baker Thomas and more importantly growth within new business and thriving new industries in areas the renew Shepherd of program is administered by the chef Chamber of Commerce and it 's not for profit leadership that trades a social enterprise within it initially the chef 's CBD the procurement works on a number of principles one helping to lower the cost of birth of getting into business the businesses utilize the parent bacon shops just like this one here and commercial buildings help increase foot traffic and drive interest in seriously VD that are generally run down really cool for foot traffic or just simply play nobly this particular buildings been empty for four and a half year so the first time in four and a half years has actually had anybody in it it certainly been locked up and awakened dark and also the program is designed to connect budding business owners artists local producers creative talents on incubating and growing their business ideas and certainly to model in core successful enterprise when we wanted to next door shortly to jenny 's operation inspired my feet it really will start to see some of the local creative artists here in town talks how about cleaning up the streets streets go to make visitors locals and shoppers want to come and visit the sides and finally from our point of view here at the chef and Chamber of Commerce we certainly don 't want to competing with existing businesses but we certainly want the projects to be unique and they must be local so how does the system actually work in short the shipping in team works with two core objectives one is to focus on working with landlords who effectively Lotus their building and working to achieve our objective principles much working with the landlord we gain access to the building through a licensing agreement as either a set period or a rolling 30-day licenses building it currently is vacant just like this one here stay available for lease should the landlord want their building back better yet tenant is found or the project monster sign of commercial lease that is landlord only needs to give us 30 days we can move the product down secondly we use our resources to determine and work with projects for enterprises for application we believe the American fulfilling successful enterprise will create munity interest and increased foot traffic the idea is to try new things new businesses new creative ideas and it 's important to note that there 's no failure in this project just an understanding that we have an opportunity to use these bacon shops why alone the successful applicant sign of license agreement with the renewing the specified offers that can 't_''_233.569 be done within the stores and what can be useful any commitment we ask from the project participants in these buildings here is equipment and also for twenty-five dollars at awards public liability it 's a very low cost solution for business owner to try their new businesses that having a sign of long-term lease program overall gives business owners everybody got proposed the idea to try to try their idea in fact there are certainly on a low cost again like a notice there 's no need for a long-term legal expenses at least we signed up for five years of their life he signed away the idea is simple edit and try if it doesn 't work we try a new idea and you enterprise into the building 's until finally select commercially the bit of actor the business here is successful and will want to sign up
