folk tale the title is the granddaughter who was eaten by the big fish and it goes like this once there was a grandmother and her name was bucum which is grandmother in cream her granddaughter was called Beulah and they lived together Beulah was a very curious little girl and she liked to wander away from the camp bucum was always telling her not to wander away but Beulah never listened one day bucum needed some water so she asked Beulah to get some water take the buckets to soup but she did say make sure you do not go swimming in that lake Beulah and I feel they said why would come why that guqin said because there is a big fish there and that fish will swallow you up if you swim and swim out too far in that lake so if you laugh it off with her two buckets and wandered down to the lake on her way she saw a little squirrel and she said sure away squirrel going to the lake then she saw a butterfly that fluttered by and she chased it round but then it became very hot she arrived at the lake and went out onto the very big black flat stone and gathered the water into the buckets she put them down got them set picked them up and started walking back to the bank and round the lake heading for home it was a very hot day so Beulah decided to put the buckets down and have a sit-down but it was really hot so she decided to go for a swim she dived into the water and it the lake all of a sudden she saw a flash of silver and she was cut up by the big fish swallowed down and into the fishes tummy Beulah could not believe that she said thought to herself I should have thought I should have I should have listened to guqin she told me that big fish would swallow me and there she stayed in the fishes tummy meanwhile Gookin was at home and she was wondering where Beulah was y 'all_._808.21 it was taking a very long time with the water so she gathered some wood to make a fire and got on with making her team she knew that Beulah was able to look after herself the next morning bucum thought hmmm I don 't know where Bueller is she hasn 't come home yet I 'll go and get some fish forward some tea so she went and grabbed her net and she walked down to the lake and she threw the net in and she caught six fish what them was huge massive big fish she started getting them prepared when she got to the big bucum was very surprised but then realized it was we yucky smelly fish slime all over her she started laughing and said oh I told you I told you not to go and swim in the lake and Beulah was very quiet she said nothing and bowed her head and walked down to the lake to wash all of the smelly fish slime off hair and that 's the end of the story did you like that that 's the end of little languages today everyone I hope you 've enjoyed coming to Canada with me some of the activities you might like to try making a big fish like the one in the story that swallowed up fuel up you could use a paper plate or some card all those for some paper you 're grown-up might be able to find those things for you or you could just drew another drawing from the story the lake and bucum and a new world you could also make some pancakes and if you have some maple syrup at your

    "text": "okay everyone we 're down at the uh the lake precinct and more specifically down near carlton street which is where we 've got a couple of trial lights right now as part of our lake lighting project with me today is the program director of strategy and implementation which basically means amy does all our major projects and amy 's leading this particular project so amy g 'day welcome thank you very much thanks for having me excellent excellent well i guess the reason why we 're down here really is because we 're getting a few questions coming through the my say part of our council website and it 's probably a good chance for us to answer some of those questions about it 's like yeah absolutely yeah awesome all right well i guess the first one that comes through a lot really is what is the impact of these flights going to have on on the things like wildlife and other environmental concerns with spillover light yeah it 's a really good question and something that the project team has been working on over the last we eventually choose respects not only the heritage precinct that we 're in protects the beautiful trees in this environment but also protects the wildlife and doesn 't have a huge impact on any insect life as well in the precinct so the lighting design that 's been chosen respects all of those we 've had consultant reports to confirm that this lighting design is the most appropriate and importantly it meets all of the relevant australian standards so you might be keeping the swans up all night that 's good to see absolutely not we plan to turn the lights off at about 10 p.m and turn them back on at 5 00 a.m or when the most appropriate lighting conditions throughout the year yeah okay so that was a key question that keeps coming through as well too is what times the lights go on and off so i imagine it 'll be on a bit earlier in winter perhaps and and on a bit later in the night when it 's the summer time absolutely we want people to be able to maximize the use of this running walking and coming here for recreation purposes so we want to be able to maximize that time and therefore adjust according to the weather conditions and the and the light fair enough question that keeps coming through too is about the budget so couldn 't the money be spent on something else why this project sure so this project um started way back in 2017 with the lake windering master plan a lot of people remember that the beach was a popular topic back then but so was the lighting in fact it was the number one priority ranked out of that master plan and from that the state government have at the last state election committed 2.5 million dollars to deliver this project this isn 't council money this is a state project that we are a delivery partner in and are assisting in the delivery of it so no we don 't have the flexibility to allocate it to another project it is specifically designed to meet the objectives of the lake lighting and the link to vic park and uh that 's what we 'll spend delivered by council that 's right cool cool and uh the style of lights behind us as well i reckon this is potentially an area which could be a little bit contentious uh so why not some sort of old heritage style light or solar powered lights we 've seen quite a few different suggestions come through so how do we end up with this style here sure again it 's about finding the right type of light to meet the conditions of the lake there 's a lot of tree coverage around certain sections of the lake which meant solar was just not a practical or feasible option it was also a lot more costly because the solar lighting requires a lot more maintenance and renewal over the period of time the bollard lighting is is too low and there 's not an effective light spill so it was pole lighting was chosen as the best option they are a little higher they 're at 5.5 at its maximum height that was so that we could reduce the number of lights around the lake um understandably the closer they 've managed to reduce that number to 224 at around a 28 meter separation so the light fitting itself yes it 's uh it 's not a heritage fitting it it meets the required standards but importantly heritage victoria and the heritage overlays that sit here they don 't want mock heritage they want the heritage that we have here to shine and these lights will really recess into the landscape so can we do anything notice to lessen the impact a bit maybe change the color yeah base as well absolutely and that 's what a trial was all about is we chose silver as the project group it 's gone in and we recognize that it 's not the right color and our preference would be going forward that we recommend that they go to the the green the traditional heritage green that we 're so familiar with so yeah absolutely we 've changed that color it 's good to see we 're trying to lessen the impact that 's great and look just finally what stage is the project at and where do we go so the application so what that will mean for the community is that the planners will now assess the application and we 'll go on to advertising for a 14-day notice period again that will be an opportunity for the community to let us know what they think both positive and negative we would also love to hear from people that are happy with the likes we 'd love to hear from everyone from that the process will be the planners will make a decision based on the planning scheme provisions and they 'll determine whether a permit should be issued for approval or whether it should be refused there 's always third-party appeal rights as well so there is the option to go to vcat as well so we 're in for a little bit longer uh but we hope as soon as we know where we 're heading we can get onto delivery fantastic well look i guess there is that that formal planning process to go through so i encourage people to to have their say because that 's what we do when we 're going through proper planning on giving comments through the ballarat council website uh but look ultimately hopefully we get to a stage tsunami where we can see these lights functioning in a way that works for most people yeah let 's hope so fantastic thank you thanks very much that was amy boyd joining us down the lake talking about the lake lighting project _"

the mice came and overtook the ruins and that 's where they lived and then they the numbers grew of the mice there were lots and lots of mice there was a lake nearby and to get to the lake a herd of elephants had to walk through the village to get to the lake to have a drink when they walked through the village the mice got trampled and the leader of them of all of the mice said oh this can 't_''_769.279 do this is really very very sad i must speak to the king of the herd so the mouse leader went to speak to the king walk through the village they trample a lot of mice and they are all very very sad when the king of the elephants heard this he understood he said we will find another way to get to the lake we will go around the village and get to the lake another way and the mouse said oh thank you very very much when you need us we will be there to help you but the king thought this was a bit silly how can all those little mice help all of the big elephants so they lived happily for a little while but the king who lived nearby wanted to get have some more elephants for his army so he sent out his soldiers to gather some more elephants that he could have to march in his army the soldiers found all of their elephants near the lake and the soldiers threw a big net over the elephants and they couldn 't get out they tried and they pulled and they pushed but they couldn 't get out of the net the king of the elephants remembered what the mouse good time for some help by the mice so he trumpeted very very loud and the mice came do you know what the mice did the mice ate the rope of the net in lots and lots and lots of different places and all of a sudden the elephants pushed again and the rope all fell off them the net all fell down and the elephants escaped from that day on the king of the elephants was very very pleased with the mice and they have been friends ever since and that 's the end of the story did you like that story that was a good one wasn

    "text": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] perhaps the least likely destination for a new york style bakery and coffee palace in the 1880s was ballarat victoria but that 's exactly what master baker john reed created on his lydiad street premises during the height of the gold rush john reed was a illegitimate son of a german nobleman and and he was cast out by his family went to new auckland the baking trade and then you know came to ballarat and and ran his new york bakery and built this fantastic amazing opulent coffee palace it was the days when the temperance movement was pushing and we had big coffee palaces in the major cities and ballarat was without one so he he felt this this was time so he engaged architects and they engaged builders and built reed 's coffee pillars in two sections one in 86 the south section and the north section in 88. a savvy businessman john reed knew the prime position next to the newly established ballarat railway station would deliver him customers right to his door hadn 't been long built when there was a fire was destroyed the brick facade came crashing down in lydia street narrowly missing one lady i believe and john reed himself in underwear had to jump for his life and his son had to jump and landed on the balcony which wouldn 't have been the balcony we know centuries of use and wear and tear later and the prominently positioned reeds is now a guest house run by the uniting church yes so the building uh has always been run as accommodation and it was being run as accommodation when uniting took it over it had had some additions to it and some painting done and some interesting wallpapers so a lot of that sort of heritage value had i suppose been covered up over the years and there was yeah quite a bit of repair work that needed to be undertaken in 2017 we were lucky enough to be awarded two hundred thousand dollars through the living heritage grants program and heritage victoria and the city of ballarat that was really for the restoration work of the outside of the building the parapet was in quite poor condition fortunate enough to have another additional amount of funding which then allowed us to carry out more works on the facade and then come internally and do a lot of the foyer and reveal what 's now here today the old coffee palace required a lot of tlc fortuitously the right tradespeople were available and local most victorian houses in ballarat are highly decorated originally underneath all the woodworks grained often stenciling and this place is originally wallpapered though so this is a second decoration uh the ceiling is much later than the stenciling so i imagine the top of it was all stenciled originally not mural so at some stage there was a fire in here in some stage they had to redo it on there was a lot of the artwork that we really weren 't sure how it was going to turn out many of the scenes that are in the freeze on the top floor and first floor were just scenes with with wallpaper around them it wasn 't until we started peeling back that wallpaper that it revealed that the rest of the pattern and exciting to find all those different paintings and scenes and and shields and flowers and all that sort of stuff it 's great well the fellow i reckon painted all this used to be a set painter at her majesties he was a debater too like a an orator and he his father owned the building a couple down it wasn 't an easy job at all part of rod 's brief was to remove all the paint from the brickwork externally so that all that had to come off all the paint and around the front to try and get the bricks back to you know how they would have been built in the first place to spend a lot of time on it used a um chemical method there so it 's chemically treated captured pressure cleaned off treated probably three or four times to get it back to the raw brick andrew thorne a well-respected conservator researched the materials that had been used in the original construction his team painstakingly worked section by section on the murals to help the painter replicate what once was there so sit in a spot and do 10 square centimeters a day the state of the building obviously prior to the work so it was quite run down and it was it was tired you know it was a hundred and year old building and for particularly for some of our guests that are going through difficult times and uh probably not in the brighter space themselves to be living in that environment would only add to you know the troubles that they 're going through so to have a bright open space with you know fantastic decorations and painting really lifts the spirit i believe you just take a lot of pride in this sort of work to see might be 100 years 150 year old and then to get them up to a current a good standard it 's awesome so yeah it 's a challenge it 's history it 's there so to to be able to uncover it and show it it 's a fantastic thing i think i think john reed would be quite happy with that outcome and know that his building is really serving a purpose within the community [Music] you _"

    "text": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] on september 28 1860 a crowd estimated close to 10 000 people gathered in stuart street ballarat to witness the laying of the foundation stone for the ballarat mechanics institute back in late 19th century mechanics were people that had knowledge of some type of engineering some kind of trade so someone that worked with machines someone that worked with tools you were essentially a mechanic so mechanics institutes were formed as kind of like a precursor to tafe mechanics institutes provided access to books and newspapers lectures talks and demonstrations in victoria alone there used to be over 1 000 mechanics institutes today less than 10 continue to operate in the state the ballarat mechanics institute is one of the most grand and intact of these 19th century buildings the minerva space the grand hall back in the day was used for lectures for dinners for concerts we had a lot of famous people perform here dame nelly melba performed here at the ballarat mechanics institute the architect for the stuart street site was chosen in an 1860 design competition melbourne architect charles boykitt won and mechanics institutes only included a public hall and library the prosperity of ballarat in the gold era and the cultural desires of its citizens soon saw a demand for larger premises in 1868 a new competition for building extensions was announced this time the winning architect was a local man john holmes jones his plans included a three-story frontage building with grand classical facade a museum on the top floor a mezzanine level with offices and living quarters shops on the ground floor and a basement with a kitchen scullery smoking room and store areas in 1935 even more space was required for the library and reading room and the old mining exchange hall next door was acquired for this purpose it 's a building that has adapted and changed with time and circumstance the mechanics institute has been a number of different things over its uh lifetime it 's been a cinema that 's been four cinemas the britannia the odeon and most people will remember the vegas 70 or the sturt cinema so it 's had a lot of people different people through a lot of different organizations century it was in a bit of a state of disrepair the final thing which led to the government giving us some money for restoration was the fact that the ceiling was pretty much caving in the roof was caving in couldn 't really hold the weights of all the stuff that was happening so there was just water constantly coming into the building obviously causing more damage to keep this magnificent building functioning it was imperative to tackle the water damage as well as repairing and restoring some of the more neglected areas of the institute much skill and care was taken to protect and preserve the magnificent humphrey room the grand minerva space and the wonderlic pressed steel ceilings a lot of stuff was done by hand which is what they would have done back when they originally built the building the current phase of restoration work now winds its way below street level to tackle the basement the basement has previously uh been used for a number of different things as well most recently it was storing our newspapers so we had the majority of our newspaper been used for also a number of different things there are other spaces down there which were the men 's smoking room so there would have been a separate entrance off stuart street for men to be able to go down into the basement and just smoke a popular misconception is that the level of stuart street has been raised over the decades street level of ballarat has never really changed um a lot of people do think that you know that the street level used to be one level lower quite incorrect the the basement of the mechanics institute has always been labeled a basement right from the first original plans until now it 's always been a basement when you go down into our basement and many other basements there 's windows that sort of look like it should be at street level but that 's because there are grates in the footpath so we can see where our grates would have been underneath the footpath and that would have let light into the windows so the light would have come through the grates and flooded into downstairs and a lot of the plaster that you see now as much as we 've got to do some restoration work it 's basically staying as it is the 2021 renovations to the basement highlighted the dramatic candle burnt graffiti on the roof when people think of graffiti i guess they think of spray cans and paint um down in our basement it 's not that it 's uh remnants from burning candles so people would have had candles put it up to the wall and dotted nice graffitis onto the ceiling from what we can tell there 's people remembering the kreswick mine disaster it looks like there 's dates that refer to the kreswick mine disaster the restoration of the basement at the mechanics institute will again utilize local trades people all local all ballarat people involved with this so a specialized plaster contractor comes in and he 'll help us so we work together and the painting um again it 's got to be done in a way that it 's sympathetic to what the old building is so there 's some particular products that have to on finishes that you can get what i look at when you get into these restoration projects of which we 've done many um is the amount of time that must have been involved in doing what was done it won 't be to make it look really amazing and stunning because that 's not what we want we want it to look like it just still in a basement we won 't be changing a lot of stuff down there it 'll be all passive sensitive and respectfully done every week i 'm here i learn something new about the building and you know i 've only been here for two of those years so i 'm just a small little blip in its lifetime and it 's really cool to be able to add to the history and be able to care for the building so that it can be used and cared for by people after them [Music] [Applause] [Music] you _"

    "text": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] in 1874 a large gathering of ballarat dignitaries in townsfolk watched the ceremonial laying of a foundation stone on a parcel of land in lydia street the owners of the land the wealthy clark family had instructed their architect george diamond brown to build a theater worthy of the successful gold mining town just nine months later the academy of music held its successful opening night the show the french comedic opera la fille de madames the building is now known as her majesty 's theater ballarat arguably australia 's longest continually operating theatre with a famed rake stage and unmatched architectural beauty her majesty 's theatre is is the beating heart as far as i 'm concerned culturally within a region anywhere so a theatre plays a critical role ballarat is a historic place and the theatre in whichever form be it another building or this current building has played a critical role in the formation of a city theaters have a long history of change there are very few theatres that you walk into that haven 't actually had one or two or three iterations flawed hall it was a music venue it was a music hall it had one circle it was transformed in the 1890s by william pitt the architect a very famous theater architect the architect for the princess theater and so that it was then turned into a lyric theater and it was when it was first called her majesties this theatre is a victorian aero theater with all the flourishes it 's got all the filigree you can imagine and beautiful styling and touches and it was built with theater in mind a specialist in theatres and industrial buildings architect william pitt increased the theatre 's capacity by elevating the old single balcony closer to the ceiling and then adding a second balcony the dress circle below it thus creating the double horseshoe balconies that still stand today the stage was also enlarged and a magnificent dome added in the ceiling over the decades there were more changes new fashions new owners new content in 1965 the renowned royal south street society purchased the theatre using it as the home of their prestigious stedford competition in 1987 the ownership and of ballarat who set about finding the right people to deliver the much needed tlc for the grand old building we began our involvement at her majesty 's in about 2016. when we 're approached by council to look at a report that had been produced on where to go next with her majesties our role essentially was to come on board as the principal architects for the project and to initially sift through what was a an amount of work that probably was of a value of 20 25 million dollars and say well we need a first stage that council can afford and what are the priorities and it 's not really until you actually peel back some of the surfaces particularly with any historic piece of architecture particularly that as complex and as as brilliant and as amazing as this venue that you truly find some of those elements that you sometimes wish you didn 't the theater for a long time had structural issues both with its stage and with its flying system and the fly tower and what we found as the engineers began to the trusses above the stage and with the stage itself so that part of this first phase in fact was to look at completely rehabilitating the stage house the nature of the restoration was all the problems were yet to be found for example we removed all the lead paint we had to try to deal with the rising damp i think as everyone will be aware the props and scenery on a theatre traditional theater are hung from ropes and cords that hang down from batons in the ceiling from what 's called the grid and so the grid relies on a very solid structure in in the stagehouse and so what happened was the engineers designed new steel trusses that have been inserted three massive steel trusses the stage floor was not structurally sound to build a scaffold on for the roof so part of the project was to pull out the stage floor rebuild it to where we could get it to a strength rating so that we could then build a scaffold on top of the stage all the way up to the roof and then three steel trusses alongside the timber trusses inside the buildings so i got to see the the bones of this building that hadn 't been exposed since it was built the beautiful elements that we found though were hand-hewn timbers this the stage was rebuilt and through that process we got to see those timbers exposed for the first time that were holding up the stage hand forged nails you know these rectangular nails that you just think about how somebody had to manually drive in into these you know hardwood timbers this is not the first restoration project that our company and the local trades have undertaken because it does take a collaborative approach otherwise you can 't_''_342.96 do these feelings very hard to know what the scope is specifically we had to find a ceramicist with the heritage toilet in downstairs their ceramic drains had been pulled out and replaced so we had to get new ceramic drain drains hand made by a ceramicist we had a local tradesman here as a sheet metal to fabricate the copper gutters which is probably a bit of an art plasterers specialist trade because it involves what we call hydraulic lime not hydrated line so there 's no cement products in any of the work that we 've done here the pleasure in this project for me in a sense as with all of these projects is about the future it is about undertaking work that is about ensuring that heritage has a relevance now and will have a relevance and viability in the future i think when you do a restoration project you always like to tell people that love this theater and so many people in ballarat have a connection to it doesn 't matter where i go whether i 'm talking with young people or i 'm talking with friends and i tell them about the project they always say to me well what have you done well the secret is you can 't tell what we 've done what i 'm most happiest with is that it actually represents the same that it feels like it did beforehand however knowing that it 's structurally sound that you can now knock on that wall and not feel like out we 've got a building that 's been built on multiple street frontages by hand with hand-hewn timbers with heritage just oozing out of it and a an absolutely supportive owner who is in a position to ensure that it lasts for this community forever the theatre 's a place of building connections it 's about relationships it 's about experiences the joy of this project in a sense is ensuring that we 're part of a journey for this building that ensures its relevance that ensures its functionality it 's a place for everybody and at some point in time there 's somebody that 's been on this stage who will remember that experience more than many other things in their life [Applause] [Music] you _"

    "text": "hi i 'm hilda hinton i 'm the author of the loudness of unsaid things and i 'm talking to you today about reading i 'm an everywhere reader i love reading at night in bed obviously snuggled up that 's the best but i read in the morning i read in the afternoon lazy afternoons i also read in the car because i do love an audiobook just sit in the left lane listen to the story and let all the stress heads drive past you and there 's some beautiful beautiful books out i 'm really loving wolf hall at the moment it 's beautifully red i don 't like the ones that are really over the top i much prefer a sort of smooth melancholic read uh to listen to so basically i fit reading in every minute that i can because it 's my favorite thing in the whole wide world um the first book i fell in love with as an adult was the deptford trilogy by robertson davies i 'd been through my teenage angsty years where i 'd stopped reading you know that the deptford trilogy and it starts with a group of kids and one of them wraps up a rock in a snowball and throws it at the other kid and the kid ends up in hospital and the ramifications the first books about the ramifications in the social group about this incident the second book is the boy that threw the rock talking to a jungian psychologist in the swiss alps and the third part of the trilogy follows the boy that got hit in the head who ended up becoming a well-renowned magician whose life and mind was forever changed not necessarily in a bad way a bad way by being hit in the head with a rock uh so it brought me back to the magic of reading um which i 'd had as a young kid and had those teenage years off so that was the first book i fell in love with as a grown up so what does reading mean to me well basically all life 's experiences whether it 's love death loss grief uh doesn 't matter what you experience in life when other people 's reactions to those same experiences so really i 've met tens of thousands of characters that have dealt with these themes um so you find out who you are and gauge your moral compass on other people 's reactions um you also learn a lot about yourself who you want to be and of course there 's the visual landscape that you create in your mind uh it 's just magical you start off with this blank slate and the world slowly builds around you and you start seeing the faces on the people and hearing the way they talk and and your creations going to be very different to the world created by the person next to you reading the same book so it 's a marvelous experience that 's got its roots in reality um but also gives you somewhere else to go some other place to see and be so reading during lockdown i 've definitely changed what i 've been reading during lockdown i 'm doing a lot of historical crime fiction i 'm finding some comfort in reading about other places and sansom series set in tutor england following the following this hunchback lawyer who goes around solving cases and has to work politically within the classes and the palace so that 's that 's been terrific um also solari gentles series set in 1930s 1920s sydney that 's that 's been fun as well uh following that ragtag crew uh who happened to stumble across dead bodies every book uh as an aside really uh that 's been marvelous sort of viewing australia you know through past eyes so reading during lockdown for me is definitely about focusing on something that isn 't in my life um and i 've yeah i 've really really enjoyed getting into those so authors i admire uh it 's a tricky one for me uh because i tend to like individual books rather than particular authors bit like i like songs rather than bands or singers you know i don 't follow particular musicians i just pick out random songs that i love so it 's really the books themselves that i admire you know people of the book by geraldine brooks i just i haven 't read their other works maybe i should maybe i will admire them but i admire them for the books that i 've read and basically i admire any author that can finish a book um you know it 's not it 's not an easy process and it 's pretty hard to knuckle down and do the work sometimes and i just think anybody who takes it on and wants to give it a go is worth my admiration all right so what 's next for me in terms of writing ah well loudness of unsaid things came out about a year ago and in the meantime i 've been working on two projects one is called heroes next door which is a book i 've co-written with my brother samuel johnson and it 's a fundraiser for our family charity love your sister when we 're out on the road raising funds for cancer research we just came across so many people going over and above doing extraordinary things and they 're just people living in our streets so we put together a compilation of their 'm looking forward to that coming out in a couple of months just about to do the proofread um so that 's exciting and after that i 'm going to be focusing on my new novel there 's a new leading lady in my head her name is evelyn she has a laundromat in a strip of shops she 's very helpful she does a lot for the community and frankly she 's not very appreciated um she 's very mindful of her customers she follows them home just in case they ever need help because she 's not a stalker so she 's helpful now evelyn um she 's not very likable uh but you grow to love her uh as i am and i 'm looking forward to her adventures you _"

    "text": "welcome to ballarat libraries in conversation a series of discussions with authors about books and writing my name 's anna and today i 'm going to be talking with author wayne marshall about his new book of stories sherl first i would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we live and work the wadarang jajjawarong and boranjuri people and recognize their continuing connection to the land and waterways i pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging and extend this to all aboriginal and torres strait islander people today i 'm joined by wayne marshall who is somewhat of a local author hailing from bacchus marsh wayne 's stories have appeared in going down swinging kill your darlings island and the review of australian fiction his story collection shirl was shortlisted for the 2019 victorian premier 's literary award for an unpublished manuscript and was published this year by a firm press he 's the co-founder of the peter carey short story award wayne thanks so much for talking with us today and congratulations on your book it 's really interesting it 's us a bit about it sure well um for starters thanks anna so much for having me um it 's a real honor uh so the story collection um so there are 14 and a bit short stories in the book and those that have read the book will understand the 14 in a bit part there 's sort of a half a story lurking somewhere in the pages um the collection is a bit of a roller coaster ride through australiana and on a more critical level it 's a playful look at white australian masculinity within an outer suburban and rural context but it does so it plays with this in ways that are comic and absurd and fantastical so for instance in one story aliens invade and place a ban on afl football for a season in another grieving yowie goes looking for companionship in the town beneath his forest only to end up at the town 's desperate and dateless ball but there are also a few meta fictional stories in the collection as well so for instance in one i look at i went through writing this book so one of the stories looks at that as well so a bit of a mingling of the comic and the deeper stuff so hopefully there 's the collection as a whole is a bit of a mixed bag against the roller coaster ride yeah it definitely is a mixed bag i think um can you read us something from it wayne i 'd love to yeah so i 'll read the shortest story in the collection um and yeah that way i 'll be able to read a full story without reading just a section so this story is titled bruce we 're just a small country town nothing ever happens here although there was that one time a shark showed up in our public swimming pool we called him bruce fetting barbecue chickens from the iga up the road for a while all the kids in the area held their 18th on the grassy slope by the pool drinking and dancing while bruce 's hulking shadow swam laps at the deep end we had photos taken of ourselves beside the pool our smiling faces made when that ran its course local fishing enthusiast stumpy taylor took to scaling the fence in the middle of the night and casting a hook baited with marinated steak into the pool bruce ignored it and ignored it until one night he had enough and tore the rod fishermen and all into the water ripping stumpy 's left arm clean off we stayed away from the pool after that admiring bruce freeze take no attitude but knowing he 'd overstepped the mark seasons went by years the surface of the pool became a rolling swamp of mold birds the lawn beside it grew tall and feral we figured bruce was lonely but by god we were lonely too and so life went on until one good friday lynn keeley 's boy went riding through town shouting that bruce had gone belly up we all rushed over for a look sure enough bruce had gone ballia for a moment we stood in silence heads bowed admonishing ourselves for taking so little care of the one interesting thing that had come our way in at least a decade but then there was all hopped out of the way watching as jimmy smeaton left from the driver 's side and scrambled through the tall grass his forehead dripping swept as he winched the shark from the water and hauled him back along main street to his shop where bruce presides still to this day a once wild thing reduced to a taxidermied head on a menu board staring down on us every time we open the door to jimmy 's and step inside to pick up our fish and chips i love that detail that um people go and have their 18th birthday party in front of the swimming pool because i just know that is exactly what they would do in a sport yeah everybody does it right um so that gives people a bit of a taste of where some of your stories go um where do you see your writing style sitting in terms of literary style do you think it fits into a particular category like for instance surrealism or magical realism or fantasy yeah okay so there are certainly um fantastical elements in in the collection as we be defined as magic realists um peter carey franz kafka gabrielle garcia marquez um so those writers have been hugely influential but since putting the book out and speaking about cheryl i 've also um realized how much of an influence something more local has had on me so i grew up in the outer suburbs of melbourne um grew up around football clubs a lot and the yarn culture the the culture of tall tale telling with all its exaggerations and humor and twists uh i see now how much of an influence that has come to bear on my writing my writing style so i guess i 'm not sure exactly where i fit but those two styles between the writers i just mentioned and the kind of um storytelling culture and oral storytelling culture that i come from i think somewhere in there the collision of those two things is where i belong and when my book fits yeah and do you think that 's a style that you will stay with um can you see um your writing continuing in that style yeah yeah i mean turn out like this so it just happens it 's not even a conscious decision i just sit down to write and it 's all what if what if this happened and the grand large storytelling style it just happens so yeah i highly suspect that i 'll go along the same road right um i have to ask you about the title sherl and i know um that 's a character in one of the stories um but people have said to me oh is that based on shirley strawn from the sky book so i need to ask you that is it anything to do with the sky hooks wayne no no it doesn 't have anything to do with shelly straw okay but i think that 's quite a funny thing people picking up the book and assuming that it 's somehow a um i mean i think the cover would give it away as soon as people saw the cover that it 's probably not about shelly strong that 's funny that 's funny yeah it was so um there 's a story in it as shirl and it 's quite a a telling thing and it 's hard to speak about without giving um plot twists away spoiler alert everybody exactly um just look at the cover um but the the collection when it was shortlisted for the victorian premier 's leader award was titled it had a different title it was titled frontier sport and it was only once a firm press signed the book um they indicated pretty quickly that they were keen for the for the book to be titled shell so i mean it hasn 't struck me that there might be some mix-up with um thinking this is something else so nobody else has asked you that i thought i thought people must ask you that all the time no no i mean it makes sense now that you say it but no no okay well because about three people asked me if it had anything to do with that yeah um we also invited people from the community to submit questions to you wayne and the first one i have here comes from joe in ballarat um so your what draws you to the absurd and is there anything you think would be too absurd okay um what draws me to the absurd i guess is that 's just been my reading interest since i was very little um i 've got some books here i was going to show this bit later but i guess one of the great the bigger influences when i was young was reading the paul jennings short story collections if people can see this this is undone and unreal and there 's a whole stack of those books very much in that absurdist style and there are some crazy things that happen done with a very australian sense of humor and very australian in their settings so i guess my imagination was shaped very early on by these absurd things so in terms of combining that with the ordinary i 'm not so much of a fan of out and out surrealism so i really want these strange things to be grounded in a recognizable reality and for me with all the stories taking place in the sort of the outer suburbs and you mentioned with the swimming pool um they 're key i really want the stories don 't live for me until they become real they always start the first image for me is always the shark in the swimming pool the yowie coming down the mountain the the aliens invading account but i really want them um to come alive through that detail and and for that for that for those things to collide with our local culture to say something about that like the band ball which speaks about the football obsessive football culture here in australia and victoria so it 's really key for me um getting the the ordinary details in as far as are there any ideas that are too absurd uh yeah definitely um yeah i think that um of the stories that i wrote for cheryl only one in four probably survived the first draft stage the other three the reason that they didn 't survive it i didn 't continue them is that they were too crazy there wasn 't um a reality to them and it wasn 't speaking to anything in over drafts 7 8 9 10 of the book but you do get a sense early whether this this crazy image is going to have legs beyond just something novel so absolutely there are things that are too absurd and i 'm throwing stuff out all the time because of that yeah um so you did sort of touch on um that a lot of your stories um deal with things of masculinity and australian identity um and i was just wondering where do you think well men are at and i suppose uh where where women are at too and where society 's at do you think in in terms of masculinity sport um and those influences big question um yeah i think man men are as they 've always been quite strange beasts um and that 's a lot of the fodder for my collection so it is it is quite a nostalgic book it does look back written in a time that was my childhood in the 80s 90s growing up um as for as for men yeah i i the book looks at a lot of to express emotions um i certainly think that 's changing um and in terms of just awareness of the partners and kids outside of the obsessive obsessions with things like sport yeah i 'd like to think that 's that 's changing too um yeah just more of an awareness outside outside themselves um yeah you bring up women to do with their partners as well um hopefully things are changing for the better i sense that they are yeah yeah oh that 's that 's good um some of your stories are quite dark in terms of relationships i think um but yeah i can see that maybe um that 's just sort of a discussion that you 're that you 're having yeah i mean myself and a lot of my friends um had parents that didn 't stay together um so i guess that was me traveling further inside myself inside my own history as the book went on i think that the darker relationship stuff came a little bit later as the book progressed and i started hitting more in an autobiographical way even with crazy something personal uh yeah and i think that explains why there 's a lot of that happening in the book and it does look at their relationships yeah why they why they fall apart yeah yeah um and i loved that nostalgia that you brought into it i haven 't thought of mcewen 's for such a long time i forgot about humans i think that brought a little tear to my eye oh it 's a bag yeah yeah supermarket but it was really nice to paint that picture of of a bygone era and i could see um that i think talking about masculinity and that sort of thing in that historical context um gives you distance and gives you an opportunity just to talk about it i guess from a remove but yeah i really like it out of it yeah and a lot of that so growing up in the 80s even if you look at australian advertising at the time how they represented masculinity it was so over the top like if you think of the solo ads solo man ads if you remember those the ocean and the solar drinks dripping down these hefty mustaches and like that just feeds this sense of the australian absurd that i like to get into it 's it 's just so so far over the top that um yeah it draws me into it yeah it 's great to remind us of of that era i love it um we 've got a question from jess in ballarat and she 's asking how much of yourself is in your stories yeah well i guess i was just speaking to that a bit um the first few stories were perhaps a little bit removed from myself but as the collection went on i started putting myself more and more in there but still there 's there was a nice remove for me that they were personal but um they 're about something else on the surface so the stuff with me is quite it exists in a kind of metaphorical allegorical space um there was a story uh gibson 's baton ball about the sports theme park and was the first that that was in an australian journal the first reviewed story for me from that and um it was commented that um the theme park was a monument to a broken marriage which is it is in the story and a it 's quite uh eloquent i think to say that for me and i still hadn 't finished the collection at that point when that review was written it made me realize that i was heading towards my own parents separation in the things i was writing just with that one line in one review and that took me the book ends on a kind of fictionalized version uh of my parents breaking up and i don 't think i would have got to that without that review and so that was the story and that 's obviously hugely personal so i kind of saw see the collection as a journey towards that and and the story that the collection finishes on that note yeah there 's a um a couple of lines in the story levitation uh where you say um but also as a writer more than anyone i 'm guilty of cannibalizing experience something that satisfies my imagination so i guess i would also ask you how much of yourself are you prepared to expose in your stories i guess those two stories so levitation is the story about um me going through cancer and weekend and aubry about my parents and that would probably mark how far i 'm prepared to go okay when i 'm working on what i 'm working on now is is not that is removed from that so i was a little bit uncomfortable doing that i sort of they came quickly both those stories and just rushed out which was fantastic and it was only until i was sort of polishing them i thought uh should i really do this and put myself out there and other people out there um so that would mark how far i 'm prepared to go and i think it was pretty far so yeah i agree yeah um i 've got a question from toby in dale 's fed um do you imagine an ideal reader you 're reaching out to in your work and in a perfect writer 're writing for well i think um no i don 't think i do imagine a reader i think i 'm writing for myself i 'm writing the kind of things that um i 've wanted to see i guess things that entertain and engage me when i started writing for for the longest time there was this model of australian writing very a realist lyrical quite grim australian short story and that was the kind of short story that was um almost the only short story for for a few decades back there but there are there 's been a change to that there are lot of writers now that are doing fantastical um experimental things which influence me and the stories i i just take off an idea and i think i 'm entertaining myself first and foremost i mean i started writing it with the cancer diagnosis and that was purely to entertain me to get me through that um i didn 't imagine that there would be a book at the end of this i didn 't imagine that any of the stories would see a entertaining myself and that 's kind of continued i feel freer rather than thinking of what 's another person going to think i sort of want to try yeah just let rip a little bit and think about that up down the track yeah um have you always thought of yourself as a writer or that you 'd like to be a writer yeah so when i was 15 i took up music music was really my first love and i played the guitar and wrote lyrics for a band and i played music for 15 years in bands it wasn 't until i was in my mid-20s that i started trying pros short stories so i guess i 've always wanted to be a writer of varys description it 's always been there when my music turned into the songs were very narrative driven and very epic it was just seemed a very natural thing to go into writing prose so yeah i have for quite a long time yeah that 's great um um with the when your book was shortlisted for the victorian premier 's literary prize kind of at my end with it a little bit i 'd written the story gibson 's baton ball which i talked about before and i just i couldn 't write anything after that it had been six months i hadn 't written anything and i saw the vpla for an unpublished manuscript advertised it wasn 't something that was on my radar something that i 'd been meaning to submit to because at that stage i only had 35 000 words of a book which is not enough um i saw it i tuned into four of the previous winners speaking about it and one of those writers melanie chang who has a short story collection australia day who 'd been successful with it spoke about having her short story collection of similar size to mine at about 35 40 000 words so i submitted not really thinking much other than i need something to pull me out of the rut that i was in and um i received the call like five o 'clock on a monday night i was cooking tea for my kids there was mayhem the call from the wheels center that had been shortlisted and it was just out of body yeah i 'd heard the writers who who had success with it speak about as soon as the short list is announced that you 're on it you will hear from publishers and agents and that just seemed fanciful like a fairy tale but when the shortlist was announced a week or so later the same day i heard from six publishers a few ages emails private messages on social media oh wow usually it 's the case of where they 're scraping to get eyeballs from publishers on it let alone them coming to us yeah that was it was amazing it was such a whirlwind it went for six weeks until the winner was announced and i don 't think in that time i really even bothered to consider will i win this because with an unpublished manuscript award really you 're sort of fighting to get the book signed for it to be published and to be represented by an agent if that 's something that you want rather than 's been published already so i spoke to a lot of publishers i signed up with my agent martin shaw who 's over in germany um it was an amazing six weeks and and that immediately fired me out of the creative rut that i was in because i thought yeah once the book it 's not big enough and i want to make stories really quickly so probably in tear up as much as anything i started writing and it just came you know the four or five stories that at the end of the book just came so um so are those stories different in style uh did your uh writing change at all after being um picked up by a publisher yeah so i wrote levitation and weekend in aubrey after being um signed by a firm press the deal agreement was write four more stories in four months well i 'd written one story in a year so i had to get cracking and i was aware that i wanted some different stories to fill out the collection because thematically it 's they 're very blokey stories so i wanted to write one that was about an australian woman writer that i 've been dreaming of for quite a while um that i wanted to write and stylistically with both of those stories and tonally there 's a departure from the com more comic stories and i just i didn 't have time to second-guess it or fall into doubt which probably i would have normally i 've been considering again the cancer story for the best part of three years and i just didn 't have any time and i just left into them and they kind of happened and they were done and sent off and part of the book before i knew it so yeah it was fantastic um i 'm going to ask you a question from finn in ballarat he would like to know how have you found inspiration to write while in lockdown and stuck at home and i 'd like to add to that is writing the best perfect career for um pandemic conditions i think so maybe um so i 've been a full-time stay-at-home parent for seven of time around doing stuff with my kids yeah so really this isn 't that different to me the covered time um my kids are at home a little bit more i have a daughter who goes to primary school well she 's been off school and we 've had home home schooling for quite a while now but it 's still just the same thing of grabbing snatches of time so i 'm not particularly out and about a lot the social stuff i 'm a writer i 'm i 'm fine with solitude um so yeah this has felt quite normal to me and and and my moods have risen and fallen as they always do which is on how my writing is going on any particular given day so i have been working on something since show was published um as far as motivation and inspiration goes um i 've always found exercise to be really really key because i 'm not out much i 'm home with the kids but i think exercise is really key to the health of any writer i would recommend it does coming into it to get an exercise regime that works for them so i started running laps at a local oval a few times a week once covered hit the first lockdown in march the weather was still nice and so i would write and it would give me ideas i would run and give me ideas for the writing and keep that creative energy going because being stuck at home and getting lethargic can kill that a bit so yeah yeah exercise great that 's good because um we had a question from jess in ballarat that wanted to well she was asking about writing exercise but i 'm um thinking that that answers that as well because you 're talking about physical exercise to promote your ideas and so on yeah yeah and levi and ballarat would like to know which writer 's festival you 'd love to be invited to and why oh um i think i 'd like to be invited to to colleen 's to booktown ah i love that yeah i um i 've only had the opportunity to go once but i atmosphere and i do love the more regional festivals there 's they 're a bit more relaxed than the ones in the city and yeah cloons is just beautiful um so yeah everyone 's watching um from booktown i 'd love to come that 's great we 'll all be able to come and see you if you are there um the peter carey short story award that you set up can you tell us um how that came about and um you mentioned um kerry 's writing earlier has he been an influence on your writing um so i 'll talk about peter 's work first yeah uh peter 's collection the fat man in history which anyone who 's interested in fantastical short story writing or heightened short story you should absolutely check out uh was hugely influential to me uh when i was in my mid-20s when i said i started prose writing um i was doing an arts degree and in one of those classes we received a handbook with various short stories in it and peter 's um life and death in the south side collection and it was just like a transmission from an alien planet it was um very strange but a lot of the local elements in it you felt that this was an australian writer at work but written in a way that played down the strangeness of it in a very detached reportage style so i go back to i think you answered one of the earlier questions if i am stuck i go back and read uh carrie 's short story collections often and i go back when i 'm stuck because i still find them they 're written in the 1970s and i still find them so fresh such an energy um and and i 'm so inspired by them in terms of the peter carey short story um award we have a writer 's group in bacchus marsh the maurable writers craft and the surrounding marvel shower um in 2016 i think it was the local library the bacchus marsh library asked if we 'd be interested in helping stage a writer 's festival just something very small um and myself and gems holly miller and a part of that they asked would you be interested in doing a short story award just something local something very small and it was one of those things where everyone was just piling ideas and and suddenly it became well not just a a short story award for those in becca smarsh but for victoria for australia let 's open it up and then someone said well you know we have perhaps the greatest short story australian short story writer ever grew up here how about we ask if peter will put his name to it yeah and jim my friend went and asked peter 's agent and he came back and said yes and it was amazing so we 've been doing that for four years um and we receive 350 stories again this year from all across australia so it 's quite competitive and we have uh myanjan uh melbourne literary magazine publishes the two winning stories every year and it 's just been a fantastic experience i 'm still pinching myself that i 'm involved in such a thing yeah that it is that 's fantastic um feel like we could talk for hours more there 's so many more things i 'd like to know but um maybe another time maybe it clues yes exactly um so thanks so much for talking with us today and if anyone hasn 't read the book yet um i would urge them to go and buy it or borrow it from their local library and wayne will look forward to seeing what you produce next and where can people find you in terms of social media yeah so i 'm on facebook and twitter my i 'm not sure what the word is handle i think it is is wayne marshall one for both of those so people can find me there and i just like to say thank you to anna and to the barra library for having me it 's as i said before it 's an honor and a privilege so thank you oh you 're very welcome um and thanks to everyone who 's sent in questions for wayne and thanks for everybody who 's watching this as well and if you 'd like to books and reading page on the library website all right thanks again wayne and we 'll see you later bye bye you _"

seeking they had many good times together maybe a few too many good times oops hey oh it 's getting dirty and grubby one day they realized it was time for a new couch so they piled into the family car and off they went to find one one that was not too big or too small but just right the lego family found the perfect couch they 're going to take it home but on the way home something went wrong oh it 's come off the car llama found a couch llama braid hello to the couch but the couch didn 't say anything llama tried to share his lunch but the couch didn 't seem to have much of an appetite worse than a dry dusty tumbleweed the couch was useless take it away but it just wouldn 't budge the lego family noticed something was wrong oh no where 's the couch meanwhile llama decided to just ignore the couch and pretend it wasn 't there this got very very boring so llama snuck up and pounced and bouncy bouncy bounced whirled twirled bumped and jumped and fell down into the smooshy mushy fluffy puffy cushions he 's coming back he actually finally completely loved the couch oh look at him the lego family found their couch and also a llama oh specifically a stubborn couch-loving kind of llama they had a great idea don 't worry llama we 'll be back what a surprise a couch just for llama at the end of the day the lego family was happy with their new couch but llama was the happiest of all

to the rabbit oh that looks delicious rabbit oh yum and the rabbit said well you can have some for your lunch but nancy knew that the rabbit would ask him to help and ansi didn 't want to help he was lazy so he said to the rabbit well i 've got some other work to do but what we could do is and then the other end of the web will be on my leg when the lunch is ready and while i 'm working you can let me know by pulling on the web and i will feel it on my leg and know that lunch is ready and i 'll come the rabbit thought this was a good idea so and nancy went on to his friend the pig and the pig was making some potatoes he was baking them in the oven oh and they came out of the oven and nunzi thought oh they look delicious and the pig said well you can have some for your lunch but nancy also said well i have got some work to do so maybe i 'll tie my web onto the pot onto the tray even when you 're ready you can pull on it and let me know and onto my other leg and i will know the pig thought this was a good idea a nancy then moved on to his friend monkey who was mixing up some delicious beans for his lunch and nunzi said oh they for some luncheon nancy but anansi didn 't want to stay and help so he said well i 've got some work to do so what i tell you what i could do was maybe pop some um some of my web connect that to the pot and then when it 's ready you could pull it and then i would know that it 's ready and i could come it 'll be connected to my other leg so monkey thought this was a great idea and off an ansi went he went to some other friends and by the end of it there was eight legs with spider webs connected to them to all the different pots and trays with all the different food and nunsey arrived at the river and while he was sitting there he didn 't he wasn 't doing any work he was sitting there and all of a sudden one of his legs started to get pulled by the web oh he thought that must be that must be rabbit oh it must mean that his um greens are ready fantastic and then all be pulled and they were pulled by all the other animals who were making lunch for a nunsee and they kept pulling and pulling and his legs were getting longer and longer

    "text": "hello there readers of ballarat my name is jock sarong and i am the author of the burning island i 'm here to do some answers to your on reading questions i hope these are useful or helpful or in some way interesting first of all when and where do i read i tend to read mostly at the end of the day in bed um i will read and read until i fall asleep a little bit like eating indian food i think i 'll keep going until i have long since passed the point of physical discomfort if the food 's good enough if it 's a great novel i 'll wind up asleep with it on my face i read magazines over breakfast strictly over breakfast cereal at the kitchen table and nowhere else it 's a lifelong habit and i don 't know why i do it but i associate magazines with breakfast cereal and a lot of them have sort of dried milk on them yuck um if i 'm really feeling extravagant i will read in the bath or even um by the fire luxury event that i get really carried away with getting it perfect so with the bath for instance you 've got to have a balancing plank of wood and a glass of red wine and a towel to keep your hands dry and there 's the risk of dropping the novel in the bath with the fire the fire 's got to be perfect the armchair has got to be perfect you 've got to have the room to yourself there 's a lot going on so although i love the notion of reading a novel in the bath or by the fire in reality i very rarely succeed on those fronts um i 'm a very obsessive person i i 'm one of those people who can 't walk on cracks so um i have a thing when i finish reading in any given session that i have to finish on the left hand or verso page of the book and preferably as high up the left hand page as i can i don 't know why that 's the case it does have the inherent advantage that when high up on the left hand page but beyond that i couldn 't explain it to you the first book that i fell in love with as probably not as an adult but as a young person was a book called the chronicles of thomas covenant the unbeliever by stephen donaldson and it 's highly unlikely that you 've heard of this book but when i was a kid i had a paper round out of the local news agents and they had a small book section and i used to scour through the books while i was waiting to load up my bike um there was this huge beautiful hard cover it 's actually an omnibus of um three volumes of this long series that stephen donaldson wrote and i saved up the paper around money and bought it and i think a lot of that had to do with being in love with this rather beautiful cover and the fact that it was a big hardback rather than knowing anything about what was in the book but they turned out to be really very very compelling stories fantasy to the kids the other day that um it 's the story of a modern leper who is not a nice man and is widely reviled and somehow his white gold wedding ring his wife has long since left him but his white gold wedding ring transports him into this other realm where he 's a hero and uh the books trace this very gradual personal transformation in thomas covenant and um they 're really rather wonderful in a strange kind of way um what does reading mean to me i think mostly reading is a chance to slow down and particularly now but always it 's a chance to tune out of panic and negativity in the media escapism more than anything which is probably why i 'm not really drawn to dystopias i like to read in the other direction if i can i like to marvel at the language and the ideas [Music] increasingly for me i suppose as a professional writer it becomes professional and it becomes quite comparative so i read um to look at how other people are doing it i um as you i like to read paper i just love the physical artifact of a book and the smell of it and the heft of it in your hands so i 'm not a tablet reader although that would be a hell of a lot easier on planes back when we used to have planes [Music] i think reading also for me because you 're really looking at ants on a white sheet i love the fact that it causes you to generate your own mental images and that those can only ever be entirely subjective and personal and a film obviously doesn 't do that a film dictates the terms of the visual experience a book allows you to create your own which is why the process of adapting novels into films is always such an interesting and contentious thing because uh when i think of my gollum from lord of the rings no doubt your golem looks completely different and the golem that was ultimately invented for the screen looks different again and it can really rile you up as a reader but i like that process of imagining worlds reading experience i think is probably to be on a plane to a far away place i 'm always amazed at how much of a book you can devour when you 're on a plane the one that i remember being most incredible was about 20 or 25 years ago when i was working in the western desert with aboriginal people and we were camped out a long long way from civilization uh in extraordinary heat and um the people i was traveling with had lit up the spinifex and there was fire all around us and i was lying under the shade of a tarpaulin covered in sweat and completely exhausted and demoralized and i was reading the brothers karamazov by dostoyevsky and the passage that i was reading was about a troika that was buried up to its axles in snow and the the incredible contrast of the two ideas um has stuck with me ever since um what have i been reading during lockdown i think there 's an interesting discussion to be had about the notion of um reading when times are difficult and and what um around the same time in my life as the work in the desert i uh i went through a pretty low patch and a friend gave me a copy of sudata by hermann hess and and it was amazingly therapeutic reading it 's only a small book but it was amazingly therapeutic i love the plague by camus but i wouldn 't dream of reading it right now it 's just far too close to home but it was a beautiful human treatment of a crisis and it was much more a book about people than it was a book about a plague there 's hundreds and hundreds of books in my house and i can 't remember what happens in most of them but when i look at the spine of each one i can usually identify where and when i bought the book and the circumstances in my life when i was reading it which says something curious about books and their role in your life that it might not necessarily be about the plot at all but about your relationship to the thing and the story little list and you might know some of these or have read them i read a paragon by column mccann which i think you can probably see over my shoulder there i read the rain heron by robbie arnot which is also just behind me there which is a wonderful book by a young tasmanian writer who i think has a very big future i read the silent listener by lynne yowitt which is yet to come out it 's a thriller and uh i think it will have a pretty big reception uh i read the orchard murders by robert gott um again that one 's yet to come out but it 's as good as everything that bob has written and possibly even better um stone sky gold mountain by miranda rio who i 'm talking to on podcast in a couple of weeks to launch my own novel uh the mother fault by kate mildenhall i 'm in the middle of that at the moment and on the topic of dystopias it skewers a lot of modern life and politics just brilliantly but it 's also a it does similar things to what i was trying to do in on the java ridge and it does a lot of them a whole lot better it 's a great novel uh i thought because i read about writers always reading murakami i thought god i better read some murakami so i know what they 're all on about so i read the wind up bird chronicle it was odd i i liked some of it i found some of it quite perplexing but the more that i 've read about murakami and what he 's on about the more i reflect on that as a really interesting reading experience it 's very different i read a book of mark lanigan lyrics because i love mark lanigan 's music it 's a little collection called i am the wolf and lanigan 's lyrics as somebody who suffered horribly for the rock and roll lifestyle his lyrics are very very compelling and i 'm trying to read carlos ruiz zafon 's the shadow of the wind in spanish but i can 't honestly tell you i 'm more than about a spanish dictionary and it is taking me forever i really don 't have a lot of idea what 's going on in that book but i am perversely proud of the fact that i 'm trying to read it in spanish how does writing a novel impact on my reading well generally as a novelist you get sent books which is lovely and you get sent them for a few different reasons your publisher will send you books because they want you to read the other writers who are in their stable and be familiar with their work people will send you books because in the hope that you might comment on them on social media and those are people who don 't understand how little social media profile i truly have and people will send them to you asking you to review them so it means that you 're being given books which you mightn 't otherwise select in a book shop and that 's a really positive thing i think i before i was a published novelist a lot of my reading was down very predictable paths give you a shake-up by sending you something that never occurred to you to read like a paragon it 's a book about the middle east it 's a very big novel written in an unconventional way and probably not something i would have selected but something i 'm really grateful to have read it really opened my eyes to technical things but also to the human side of the middle eastern conflict um i suppose as a novelist you read to look for the strings in the sticky tape you 're trying to work out how certain things have been pulled off and some of the time you know instinctively that those devices those maneuvers are not going to work in your own writing but sometimes you look at them and you think now that is a thing that i could do with my material this is obviously not as close to the bone as plagiarizing it but it 's more about thinking of the shape of the story and the methods that have been used and whether those are things that you could deploy so a little bit look at the way the ceiling joists have been done and thought that 's interesting i could i could use that when i walk through a book i am looking for such things and and sometimes it 's good to try and switch that instinct off and just enjoy the ride really um i think when you 're writing a novel there 's probably there 's a number of phases and they also heavily influence the way that i read so at the start of a novel i 'm reading for research and there 's a lot of miles to cover and it puts a dent in my my recreational reading then i start looking for laterals and parallels and analogies to what i 'm writing so i 'll try and read obscure things or classics and then later on you 're just seeking escape from the whole project so you back right off and just read for pure fun which is obviously the best part of the cycle uh a book that changed me as a reader and a writer and in fact i 'll say as a person which is a book about the human psychological relationship to the sea it 's um it was written in 92 that 's still 100 current and it 's really lyrical and very lovely i 'd also say all the russians i just love reading russian novels despite the density and the melodrama and the troubles with translation um authors whom i admire and why i would again point to the russians i think everyone between about google and all the way up to salsa nitsan i love conrad and poe i love reading kate grenville helen garner i really love great evocations of australia and australians as well as those weightier classics what 's next for me in terms of writing well i am releasing the burning island kind of as we speak which is the second of three books about bass strait and in particular about the inferno islands in the eastern side of bass strait so at present i 'm trying to write the third of those three books and i 'm five drafts into it there might be up to kind of a dozen drafts before i i suspect i will turn away from historical fiction and similarly a couple of years ago i turned away from writing crime fiction i um i guess i 'm constantly looking to explore new territory um but the other thing about you know the great joy of being a novelist is that you 're just in it for whatever story happens to grab you at the time and i wouldn 't even think of that in genre terms i i think of it purely in terms of that story and has it taken a hold of me and will it sustain me over a year or two of writing um that 's what really matters so there you go that 's a little bit about my reading habits um i hope that 's been interesting to you and uh i hope your reading is enjoyable and that it 's getting through getting you through all of this um difficulty and sadness and monotony all the best to you and thanks for listening bye you _"

be done at me with no equipment required however you can use a yoga mat or something similar on the floor for your comfort we 've got Charlie with us again today to do some demonstrating so before we start we 'll do a little warm-up so we 're going to do our stretching to make sure we stretched our back and our tummy muscles before we start so first stretch is our angry cat shake so rounding our back and pushing up to the roof our second stretch is our happy cat so staying in the same position but now pushing our tummy down to the ground after stretches our lazy cats are putting our bun down on our heels and pushing our shoulders into the ground if you find this easy you can lift your bum up in the air to push your shoulders more into the ground next stretch is our seal stretch so into the ground okay that arms nice and strong and finally we 'll roll onto our back I 'm going to do three tuck rocks once you 're done I 'll talk to them and they son in our back we 're gonna do one more exercise to make sure our heart rates up and I tell me muscles are warmed up we 're going to have our arms about our head and we 're going to lift our arms and our foot I 'm going to tap our opposite foot we 're going to do ten of these cats once that we 're going to move into our session we 'll go through each activity once on the video but we recommend you going twice through each and doing it as a bit of a circuit first activity is Russian twist so we 're going to do 15 of these for our Russian twist we need to sit in our B shape we 're going to put our hands together and then we 're going to tap the floor on either side of us 15 times if this is your basic shape this should make it a little easier trying to keep our balance the whole time once we 've done 50 Russian twists we 're going to roll into our front support shape on our stomach once in our front support shape we 're going to do 15 mountain climbers they bring our knees up to our chest starting off nice and slow and then speeding up so I make sure our knees come right up to our chest and we stay it out of the front support shape after american tigers we 're going to lay back on our back we 're going to do a sit-up so we 're just going to do ten steps today you can either do full situps like Charlie 's at the moment and that arms across our chest keep your knees bent and a fake file on the ground or you can do a half to that for our past adapt we put our legs on the top of our hands on the top of our legs and we slide ourselves up as far as we can so you can going to do ten sit-ups following have sit ups are going to stay and after that position with our knees bent and we 're going to do ankle taps so the clothes do you have your fake to your bottom at the moment that easier they 're going to be so make sure it 's a challenge moving out a little bit further for this we 're going to lift the shoulders up off the ground and we 're going to twist and tap our ankles so as you can say try this happier ankles if she moves has paid out a little bit further it becomes more challenging and we have to twist a bit more so just have your faith wherever is comfortable for you we 're going to be 15 over time for taps once we 've done our ankle taps we 're going to do some leg lifts now you can have your hands either where Charlie has them down by her side or you can have them above your head for leg lifts we want to make sure we keep our back flat on the our back we 're going to lift our legs up as high as we can nice and slowly keeping them together and then we 're going to lower them back down to nearly the floor without touching the floor and then lift them up again these will be easier with your hands by your side rather than above your head making sure we do the nice and slowly and controlled keeping our back flat on the ground just going to do five leg lifts today once we 've done our leg lifts we 're going to do our ditched hold so we 're going to do a 10 second dish hold once Charlie 's going to demonstrate if you can hold your disco for 10 seconds you can try doing 10 seconds of dish kicks so can he legs up and down while in our dish shape or dish scissors so maybe I like the side to side you can choose what you 'd like to hold for 10 seconds or you might like to try holding for 10 seconds and then doing some kicks for 10 seconds our final Superman hold so arms on that is lifting our arms our shoulders up and our knees up we 're going to do the same with our dish so we 're going to hold our Superman for 10 seconds if you can do this comfortably you can either do 10 seconds of kicks or 10 seconds of scissors they 're like side to side good and the side was our dish you can able to do them one or the other or you can try holding for 10 seconds and then doing some

people and recognise their continuing connection to the land and waterways we pay our respects to their elders past present and emerging and extend this to all aboriginal and torres strait islander people this year is a significant year 100 years ago on the 2nd of june 1920 prince edward the prince of wales was in ballarat to open the archer victory this arch is significant not just for ballarat but it 's the largest arch in australia and is also recognized internationally on the archdi triumph in paris this arch is significant not just in its structure but also it 's the beginning of the avenue of honor 22 kilometres of trees recognise the service men and women that served in world war one on the significant anniversary i 'd like to acknowledge all of the ballarat community involved in building this magnificent arch but also i want to make special mention to the arch of victory avenue and work tireless to make sure we have this beautiful structure in the condition that it 's in this is a magnificent piece of history and we look forward to continuing this for another 100 years it 's very important to acknowledge the centenary of our arch but any consideration of the arch also needs to take account of the arch precinct which is the area immediately adjacent to the arch because that 's all part of the archer 's story 3801 servicemen and women who are acknowledged in our avenue and of those 757 servicemen and two nurses lost their lives during the first world war and are listed on the role of honour at the australian war memorial in canberra of that 759 who lost their lives 303 have no known grave which means that their tree and their plaque in our avenue of honour is the nearest thing that they have to an individual headstone that commemorates their service further to the grief associated with the loss of those 759 there were 53 sets of brothers who lost their lives commemorated in our avenue 47 of and an additional six where one brother is in the avenue the other away from ballarat and that explains the reason for our creation of the garden of the grieving mother which is immediately adjacent to the arch of victory since the opening of the arch the precinct has been developed with the addition of the memorial wall and the rotunda and the garden of the grieving mother all in relatively recent times but in addition additional plaques have been added to the arch acknowledging the service of ballarat citizens in the second world war korea malaya borneo vietnam and in international peacekeeping missions there 's often discussion about the naming of the arch of victory the prominent use of the word victory which in some cases is interpreted as an imperialist triumphant statement about the outcome of the war i prefer to see it as something of a consolation and comfort to the ballarat community which had experienced four years of intense anxiety and grief during the war and at least the word victory provides some assurance that the hardship experienced by the community was not in vain i long-serving and immediate past president who 'll tell the story of the creation of our avenue of honour the construction of the arch and the official opening that occurred 100 years ago yes in 1878 there was a young mother called eleanor price she was widowed in 1878 to fend for a family of three girls and a baby boy edward price who by the way is my great my grandfather she used a donated sewing machine to make garments and sell them from her small home in ballarat ten years later she became eleanor lucas and was again widowed inside 18 months when her husband was killed in a mining accident in sebastopol the garment business was reinstated and developed to a cottage operation at her home site in the next 25 years leading up to world war one the company developed and that son edward price became the driving force and became also owner and manager of e lucas and company so that by the time we got rented 1917 they were employing girls and they were termed the lucas girls well in may 1917 at a meeting edward price offered for his company and the employees to plant an avenue of trees to recognize and honour all those who enlisted in world war one in eight plantings from june 1917 to august 1919 3801 trees were planted by the lucas girls assisted by local dignitaries and others including the premier of victoria who planted tree number one the lucas girls raised the necessary funds for the plantings led by sales manager tilly thompson they sold throughout australia thousands of handmade dress dolls and they were they were all made in the lucas factory in addition miniature bricks speed necklaces garden parties and the first woman 's football match in victoria which was attended by 10 000 people all raised funds the girls also contributed cuppins in the pound two pence in 240 pence about one percent of their wages for two or three years and raised a considerable proportion of the cost of the archan avenue combined not sure exactly whose idea probably probably with my grandfather 's to construct an arch is a gateway to the 22 kilometer avenue that 's that 's what it was for the avenue and that avenue by the way the longest in australia of its type and probably in the world the archer victory construction began with the laying of the foundation stone on february the 7th 1920 by lieutenant general sir william birdwood the object of the then was to complete that whole the arch by 2nd of june 1920 when the prince of wales was due to visit ballarat during an australian visit and that 's that was only four months away from the laying of the foundation stone in fact those the 16 men involved in it under george brooks more or less a great bricklayer by trade and with 16 tradesmen he completed that arch in three and a half months and if you 've seen photographs of the the scaffolding and you marvel at the possibility that it could be done in such a short time a huge crowd assembled for the opening including the 450 girls the prince julie arrived and cut a ribbon to open the arch and he was then presented with a pair of silk pajamas made by the lucas girls were it was a major renovation done in 2011 actually in the arch and it 's why it looks as good as it does at the moment it 's in very good condition and it was interesting though that the spanish flu was rife at the time the arch was being built in 1920 and now we 're battling cavite 19 at the time of the centenary i think by and large the people of ballarat are very proud of our arch it is a very well recognised symbol of ballarat it 's recognised across australia and the fact that it has achieved international recognition so i think ballarat people see it as a very special precinct in which they take pride you _"

    "text": "[Music] it was really special to to be a part of that event and i think for us and particularly for me i think it 's been a long time coming for all indigenous people are in australia i think for me you know growing up in madrid we 've got a quite tight-knit community there with our indigenous community but for me going through school i was quite quite blindsided to to what what really did happen that day and it wasn 't until sort of like late high school when i was like late teens that i really sort of understood what what really did happen on jan 26 and it was probably from then when i started to really not not celebrate australia day with my mates like i 'd like i used to like going to the barbies and getting on the piers and having fun and playing cricket and doing all that sort of crap where now it 's a really good opportunity for me to reflect on what actually did happen to my ancestors you know it 's been what 250 years now and it 's it 's something for us to be to be quite proud to be a part of and to have my kids um be there as well and to hear hear the stories from from from our elders and their stories from from those massacres um for them to hear that at such a young age is really important because you know i i didn 't get that until i was about 17 18 19 years old so um yeah it 's it was a really special special thing to be a part of and you know i 've done what the the anzac day dawn service in the past and for us to now finally get some recognition with the dawn service for ourselves to be able to celebrate that it 's it was really nice so um and it 's like a ripple effect it 's like you throw a rocking rock in a pond and the ripples slowly make their way out to the edges and that 's what what events like this start to start to happen um and i 'm now starting to get up with who are non-indigenous and that i 've played footy with and just saying hey clarky i 'm thinking of you today and you know because you know it 's a quite a hard event for for your people but yeah for them to to finally shift their attitude a little bit it 's it 's good because we know that it 's finally starting to work which is cool so i was expecting maybe a couple hundred people to be there um and yeah i think i think it ticked over just over a thousand people over there which is really really it was actually really surprising and really it made me feel really good and i know like obviously all the kia people who who worked really hard behind the scenes to get the event up and running i know it would have been a really good feeling for them as well and then to look around and see obviously a lot of my non-indigenous friends that i 've worked with in the past that i 've played footy with you know my non-indigenous family with on it was nice to see nice to see the amount of people that actually turned up and was a part of it and more in particular than the digital community in ballarat as well actually it was it was really special i guess you know growing up as a buck kid in madria and i felt i was a little bit arrogant to what the day meant to us because i guess i was robbed of of learning that history through school but um because it just wasn 't taught to us and you know finally things are starting to change in the education system where it is slowly starting to be implemented into the curriculum which is great but um they 've got a long way to go so yeah i felt i felt robbed and cheated out of out of my education with with that side of things but now that um you know i 've been quietly enough to work in the education system for a few years and to see to see it finally start to change is really cool and now that i 've got and wanting to celebrate their culture within their school and share it with their classmates and their teachers is really special as well and then yeah for us to get the recognition of the dawn service um yeah it 's fantastic to see ballarat as one of the first regional communities in victoria to be able to to be able to do that is really special for us to be a part of so um you know i think over the last four or five years we 've gone down to melbourne and share the spirit festival um so that 's also another really really special event for us to be a part of and see the numbers that that 's grown into it 's been it 's been actually quite ridiculous how big it 's gotten over the last few years um and then i think melbourne and a few other registers did the dawn service so for us to be able to stay here at home in ballarat do the dawn service gross and bracky jump in the car and cruise down to melbourne to see family and so um yeah it 's nice to see ballarat be one of the first ones to take that first step in making the change which was cool yeah it was it was shared and promoted really really well um i think the community really took it on board as well i think yeah i think just like emily just said it it could have quite easily gone the other way um but yeah because because the times are changing the way things are heading at the moment i think yeah the community are really really able to take it on board and accept or start to accept what the day is actually all about you know australia does have a black history um and it is a dark one so it 's nice for us to be able to share those stories like only marrying any all those stories and the numbers from the massacres like it actually took my breath away and it does bring up a lot of emotions and stuff like that so you know because they are that was my ancestors and my family that they that were affected by the stolen generations and you know that then is affected onto me because it is an intergenerational trauma that that does happen so for us to be able to have events and stuff like this finally happen it helps not just my ancestors and my elders here but it also helps me heal as well and then hopefully that 's going to be able to help my kids move forward and and sort of understand the true meaning of what did happen on jan 26 because it is isn 't a nice thing to to be a part of and to understand what had happened but yeah it 's nice to finally see australia i guess pull the finger out and do something about it which is nice it is hard to to hear and it does does bring up a range of emotions and always is pretty hard to talk about but i think if you don 't talk about it and don 't show emotion about it it just shows that we don 't really care so um yeah it 's like i said the right path so and to be a part of the ballarat community for 10 years it 's it is it is home for me now and um i don 't think we 're going to be going anywhere for quite a long time so yeah to hear to hear those stories and to see what annie died nicholas in there um you know i know she 's been through quite a lot you know obviously with her family and being part of solar generation and obviously health stuff as well so to be able to see her her there i guess when the sun came up and to see the emotion in her face it was like a sense of calm and a sense of peace had sort of come over her because it was something that she 'd probably been longing for for quite a long time so to see her and the other elders present there to to see them be a part of it and finally get that that healing is it 's nice [Music] you _"

    "text": "[Music] I 'm just going to share some of my reflections on the survival debut and ceremony Howard by the city of Ballarat I think my initial thinking and thoughts around the event I was a little bit unsure on what to expect I probably would have to admit that I didn 't have high expectations because I think that recognizing January 26 from an Aboriginal perspective is it mean for the city of Ballarat and I think that it 's a significant part of our hidden histories as Australia and the histories that we don 't like to talk about or share so I 'm sure of what to expect but I was pleased that something was being held I also is pleased to see that Aboriginal voices and Torres Strait Islander peoples voices were a part of moved and a key focal point on how the veterans ran and I think that that import was clearly reflected in in the running of the events so I think they live not sure and I think that for a lot of Aboriginal people that lead into January 26 days have a whole range of reasons so when you come to that event you choose how and who your associate was very carefully I think and I think that from my perspective even from my family 's perspective that we 've always traditionally headed to Melbourne and protested on that day we may also attend the survival Day concert in Treasury Gardens however recent years we 'll probably stayed a little bit more local and going back to country on those days just through a flip them paying our respects to our ancestors but also to acknowledge the massacres and impact that January 26th and that day means to our mobile into tomorrow people so often will go back to country and just spend time there and do some reflecting this so that 's normally what we do but I thought it was very important this being the first event to support and this initiative so on the day I guess my reflections from that day were that I was pleasantly surprised by the number of gather at people who had turned up for this event and any particular the amount was really heartening from an Aboriginal person he 's we develop for the majority of my life it was really heartening to see that there were people that cared enough to show up at that time of day but also bringing their families along and showing their commitment and solidarity to average you and Torres Strait Islander people so that was great to see I think that the actual running of the event one of the things that I really loved about the ceremony was that it was a great reflection and representation of our diversity within our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in Ballarat and I think the people who have lived in this community for a significant period of time would say that that 's one of our strengths the diversity of of the different groups and and coming together and celebrating Aboriginal Australia and the culture as a collective and I think that that was represented really well through the I think also knowledge and information that we 'll share although it may be confronting for some people that were attending because as I mentioned earlier history that we have the in particular different histories of things that we don 't talk about the things that people don 't get taught at school and for a lot of people there are leaders coming about and and learning about this like in their life which is a really hard thing to process when you 're a little bit older so I guess I guess being able to share that in a non non confronting line and you know why that celebrates and reflects those shared histories that I think that that was a job well done I really enjoy having youth voice there as well and I think that Michaela and Jo did an excellent job to represent young people and that 's really important for me because it just demonstrates that that transgenerational impact do history to current day and being able to support and young leaders to be able to take for those messaging and in to work with them to create the change we need that we all need and probably a final reflection is that I really strongly encourage the city Bella out kind of get behind these initiatives and war initiatives like this which share hidden histories and stories of the past and really tackle some of those hard things that make us feel a little bit uncomfortable but you know when done in genuine partnership and in the right way are really impactful with all members of community not just for Aboriginal and Torres Strait other than people feel but for the broader society and I think that we 've kind of stepped taking a step forward now and really should continue to push us out post that tokenism of of some of the events that have happened in the past and and not being critical of event to the past but just really highlighting that this particular event was very much a shift in the dynamics of relationships a shared celebration where everybody felt that they could contribute and feel safe in doing that and I think that those are the events that they like need to see more [Music] [Music] you [Music] _"

    "text": "hello everyone Council met again in relation to our council meetings and we did that physically within the council chambers where we followed those social distancing rules but it was good that we 're actually in those chambers because the audio was a lot better as well as the the layout of the setup was a lot better as well for people to see from a recording and people at home you can dial into our council meetings when they 're on to actually see what 's going on and if you want to submit questions or representation to certain items that are on there a big item last night that we had to deal with was the quarterly report and the biggest thing is is covered 19 is affecting everyone across our community from businesses to individuals to and what it means to to how we actually move around the city with the restrictions that are in place but formally it is a big burden across the city and councils not immune to that either and we 're looking at the financial report we 're probably going to be of fifteen million dollars behind where we should be and part of that is due to about five and a half million dollars do services around car parking Ballarat Aquatic Center and others that we provide to the community that 's not coming in with income anymore so this is a real big issue for us as a council that we need to deal with and even though we 're dealing with it right now from from this financial year next financial year we 're going through the budget process now to deal with how we can manage that and maybe we do need to look at borrowings to manage that cash flow also looking at projects of what can be delivered coming out as a stimulus package for Ballarat and also in addition to that is how we then recover from covert 19 as a community over the next few years another item on the agenda last night was also council 's part of Stewart Street with the bike and shared path so this is from Granville Street to Dawson Street following the same principles of VicRoads and that additional consultation or the consultation to come back to the council meeting to look at but it was actually then that motion was not supported and the original motion to get on with the works do some consultation with the businesses there and then get undelivered the funding that 's been available from the federal government to do that so we 're looking forward to seeing what that means the plans are there but then the next level of detail plans will start to come through with that concept in addition to that we also had the update of the carbon neutrality plan which is just a quarterly update and it was good to show that where we 're tracking in areas that we can do better on and the big thing for Ballarat is looking at ways we can reduce our carbon footprint as a city and we 've got that target of 2030 which is not that far away everyone again please dial in when you 're able to on the council website Ballarat Vicki are you and you can be part of those council meetings and any meeting will be done online so it will be very different and for me as the mayor it might be different to how I manage the individuals on on those Brady Bunch look on the screen if that makes any sense in how it comes up but that 's something that we have to work with in this climate and we have to do things differently Ballarat again you 're doing a fantastic job out there and really if we can keep these these cases down fingers crossed we can start to look at raising those restrictions in some way that the state and federal government might correct but at this stage you 're doing great you 're staying well you 're staying safe and you 're staying at home which is really important thank you everyone be kind I 'll see you next time _"

    "text": "hello everyone I 'm down at Eureka Center in Ballarat East this has become the second site to meals-on-wheels it 's a really important that as a city we have those contingency plans so creating two sites was important to have the distribution and meals to we 're vulnerable in the community another thing we 've actually allocated 40 staff of Ballarat so being able to be redeployed to handle the deliveries that are needed across this city the meals now I 've increased from 650 a week to over a thousand and that 's really important that we can handle that capacity and I know there 's even more capacity up to about 2,000 meals a week that can be provided if the requirements there in the community but for us it 's really important that we continue this service it 's really essential and we need to be kind to the people that are in our community that need this and it 's really important for our drivers of all to interact with those those people and the residents that are there because sometimes this might be the 're really careful to make sure we maintain that social distancing and maintaining the health and well-being of those individuals that need these meals so Ballarat again it 's important be kind to yourself be kind of business and be kind to others as well which is really important at this time thank you _"

    "text": "welcome to online balance play so whilst this is it the same is coming into the gym to do balance play we 're going to give you a taste of some activities you can do in the safety of your own home these activities are suitable for balance play age children and will help keep them active and stimulated whilst we 're in this crazy time so today I 've got a little helper with me to insist in demonstrating this is Charlie hi so Charlie 's a little bit older than most balance played kids however she 's going to help with the demonstrations today so the video today will be about 10 minutes in list will include our three normal stretching songs that we do in our balanced play cloth and then we 'll have seven different activities that you can try at home for these activities we require just very minimal equipment all we need today is a balloon so just going up nice and small if you haven 't got a balloon at home and a little softball or a soft toy even will work just can be a bucket of hot a pan a bowl anything like that and we also need we 've got some toilet paper today some rolls of toilet paper or you can use some small balls anything like that will work it 's just to throw into the bucket and our final piece of equipment these are your a piece of rope and we 've got some tape and we 've taped a line on the floor this is just a balance along so it can be anything you like that you 've got it behind to balance done so we 'll get started now we will do our free warm-up stretching songs for balance like so if you 're ready we can sit on the floor in our L shape the legs out nice and straight in front of us and arms up nice and high with our MC Wincy Spider fingers ready to go and Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain and washed poor Incy out out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain so Incy Wincy Spider climbed up of stretching I like that our next one we 're going to sit in our tuck shapes and they sent up to our chest hugging legs so for old ones we can do this by themselves or little ones you can see in your parents laughing you 're tough shape for this one I 'll be ready Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after lumpley and our final warm-up song for this morning we have open shot them so having our hands outside today and open shut them open shut them give a little clap open shut them open shut them lay them in your lap creep them creep them creep them creep them right up to your chip open wide your little mouth but do not let them in roll them roll them roll them roll them roll them just like this shake them shake them shake them shake them a little kiss beautiful so there are three stretching songs that we know were included a balanced play class so they introduction to stretching and a bit of an awareness of their body state things like open shut them is great for getting to know their fine motor skills so we 're going to move on down to our activities so today 's theme is animals at the zoo so all of our activities relate to animals that you might find at the zoo so activity number one this morning we 're going to bounce like a kangaroo so we want to have our kangaroo hands up free lovely and what we want to do is we want to stick our feet together and then we going to try and bounce two feet at a time off you go to Alice good so it 's important when we 're doing this that we 're encouraging our little ones to actually bounce with two faiths sometimes we see little kids and trying gallop or try and do one for them so this is great for working on how to footed jump we can also try it going forwards or backwards or try and hop bounced around in a circle good we can can try it on the carpet if you go to Emmeline have a go on the trampoline all these different places it 's great to work on having our legs together and doing our nice to footage um making sure that when we land we 're laying with bent legs in a motorbike shake and you don 't show that motorbike shake guys great work so that is our bouncing like a kangaroo so I second animal activity today is standing on one leg like a flamingo so you 're going to have our arms out nice and wide we 're going to bring our foot up to on me we 're going to try and balance on one leg for as long as we can now with little ones we can balance they can hold onto the edge of a table or the couch and the thing just to try and get there and balancing skills up we want to make sure we have our arms out nice and wide even if we are holding on to something now we can try on the other leg as well good try closing our eyes and doing it as well so they can do this even with holding on it just helps them to gain an understanding of when their legs are and where their body is lovely well done charlie activity number three so this one we need a little balloon and we 're going to turn into a seal wonderful so for this one we 're going to be feel me I think we can balance the balloon on our nose button up there way as if we can let go of it look this one 's a bit tricky good so working on holding our head nice and still it can work also really well if we try sitting down on the ground and doing it we might be a little bit more stable another version of this activity you can try is getting your little ones to balance it on grown-ups notes good at activity number four simple a balloon aside for now I Tiffany number four we 're going to face the pelicans at the zoo so for this we need a bucket out and we going to stand back a bit good and then we 're going to try and we 're going to try and throw our balls into the bucket and seeing how many we can get in a rope off you go Charlie here sit down oh no good so this is a good one we can even get older siblings involved in this try to land them in the bucket there and see if we can get our little ones to count how many they can get into the bucket in a row that 's the activity our next activity we 're going to balance like an elephant on the tightrope so this is really a piece of rope for our line on the fourth we 're going to practice that balancing skills so arms out nice and wide good I 'm going to try and balance along our line there 's lots of variations in this activity that we can do so we can try balancing forwards on our line one two little ones and last two this we can try going backwards along the line good we can also you 've got a rope or something different to a line on the floor you can also try changing the shape that you can try and make a circle on the floor few little ones to balance around or even if you 're using tape we can make a square lots of different shapes and options on our balancing so forwards backwards on our toes even balancing sideways can you balance sideways Sally who is trying to walk sideways along alone online luckily it 's easy with your arms out you can also make an elephant truck so as we 're walking along we can make our elephant trunk and make some elephant noises lovely our next activity we 're going to stand by Matt up for good and we 're going to walk like a bear this time so when we do a bear walking we 're gonna have nice tight legs we 're gonna have our hands down and bum up to the roof for this one and we can try a bear walking forward keep your legs nice and straight looking between our legs or we can of an obstacle course and we give our walk around some obstacles so going around trying to keep our legs nice and straight and we want to make sure we 're looking through our legs the whole time lovely and our last activity for today is a crab walking so similar to our bear walking but this time we have our hands behind us and we have our tummy up to the roof and we have our fingers facing our toes in this shape so same thing we can do this going forwards or you can go backwards or we can go around some obstacles good if your little one struggles with keeping their tummy up they can sit their bum on the floor and they can still see if they can crab walk backwards or forwards this will just make it a little bit easier wonderful so these are all of our activities for today so today 's activities focus on balance coordination and so what we 'll do is we 'll try and have a new balance like maybe obliques and different activities and a different thing every normal balance play classes so hopefully these activities will keep the little ones engaged and bring some familiar activities and songs into the house so some other resources you can use for this theme is and if you google we 're going to the zoo there 's some great songs on YouTube which helps them and different animals and actions that you can do along with it so a bit of fun to get a run in the house involved in so thank you for coming along we hope this a healthy and safe and that you enjoy our activities today bye _"

Jeanette every day they they lived and one day they went further than they usually do they loved going near the stream and they went along the stream and found a house now this house had a pink roof and the house was made of candy lots of lollies they thought it was wonderful so they went and they aged for some bits of the house they started breaking them off and eating them up now in that house lived Darryl he was a wolf he could hear someone eating his house he shouted out the window who 's that eating my house Jana Jeannette ran away and hid in the forest he came out and he said who was that eating my house Yong said it 's the wind so mild it 's the women so mild that lovable child go answer it wasn 't really sure and he went back into his house the next day yarn and Jeanette went and play again and they found the house again because they love the candy so much they went and they had pieces of the candy off the house what do you think this eating my roof and my house but Yong and Jeanette had hidden and Yong said it 's the wind so mild it 's the wind so mild my lovable child a girl grumbled and went back in the house but he was a bit suspicious they yawn and didn 't came back out there are a bit brave and go wrong ran out and found them eating his house he had a bad leg but he was still very very quick Jana Internet ran as fast as they could and really really really fast and Garin was chasing to them but they came to a river where there was some just go run kept going yon Jeanette were panicking how are we going to cross the river the jacks in the middle to the docks came over and they said please please can you help us can you get us across to the other side of the river and I said yes of course we can so they jumped on sir the duck 's back they went over

now if your baby 's under six months old their eyesight is only about thirty centimeters so about from breast to face and that 's the perfect distance so that they can bond with you if they 're over six months they 've got perfect eyesight twinkle just wave your fingers in front of their faces about 30 centimeters away and you 'll have probably already noticed that your babies are attracted to things like ceiling fans and shadows on the floor and different lights that 's why it 's because of their eyesight let 's do twinkle twinkle and we 'll do it twice here we go twinkle twinkle little

sky twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are beautiful flip clap now if you want to you can 't keep your baby on your knee or you might already be sitting on the floor with your baby sitting down between your legs or on your knee and you might like to switch them around for the next song and you can lay them on their back and the reason for this is that they can then look at your face no be laying on the mat so that he could see my fingers moving above his face and we 're going to do Incy Wincy Spider Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water spout down came the rain and washed poor Incy out then after came the sunshine and dried up all the rain so Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the spout again shall we do that one again let 's do it Incy Wincy Spider climbed up the water

months try a hunk a high-contrast book like a black and white book if they 're a little bit older I have a six-month-old they 're really good books but books for them I 'll lift the flat books and the touchy-feely books but we will definitely have a story next time we do baby bounce this self final song for the day and as I said grown-ups this is a bit of a treat for you it 's the very calm you

everyone let 's get on with our story the very big by Eric Carle and it was written a long long time ago so long ago that maybe even your grownups had it when they were kids and you might even have this story at your house if you know what 's happening next in the story please read along with me if you need to this is a good time to zoom in so that you can see what 's happening on each page in the light of a moon a little egg lay on a leaf can you see that little egg one Sunday morning the warm Sun came up and out of the egg came a tiny and Very Hungry Caterpillar he started to look for some food on Monday he ate through one Apple but he was still hungry can you say that but he was still hungry on Tuesday he ate through one too what are these called yes that 's right but what was he he was still hungry on Wednesday he ate through one two three do you know what these are you might not have seen them before they 're called plums three 'll know what these ones are on Thursday he ate through one two three four strawberries that 's right but he was still hungry on Friday he ate through one two three four five oranges but hey was still hungry and this is where the book gets interesting because on the next page there might be some things that you 've ever ever seen before on Saturday he ate through one piece of chocolate cake one ice cream cone one pickle have you ever seen a pickle we don 't talk about people 's very much do we one slice of Swiss cheese the one with all the holes in it one piece of salami you might know what this one is a lollipop a piece of cherry pie have you ever had cherry pie before I haven 't one sausage one cupcake and one piece of watermelon and that night oh he had a stomach ache oh that doesn 't sound like fun does it the next day was Saturday again the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better but he wasn caterpillar he built a small house called a cocoon around himself and he stayed inside for more than two weeks grown-ups that sounds like us at the moment doesn 't it and then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and [Music] he was a beautiful butterfly and that 's the end of

me my favorite frog is the library frog do you know what he says read it read it you might not get that joke but your card that 's probably will it 's bit of a dad joke isn 't it let 's put George down there we go so today we talked about the Very Hungry Caterpillar sometimes when we do story seekers we do an activity that goes with it so today grown-ups this is my suggestion for an activity got some spare blank paper at home draw the shapes of all of the fruit that we have in the story today the apples to pears three plums four strawberries and five oranges and then if you can do that again so either trace the page that you 've just made or if you 've got the ability at home photocopy its have got two sheets exactly the same then ask your little e to color in and cut out their fruit after that you can talk about how many apples are there how many plums are there you can do some counting together and then you 're literally can do some pasting so they can paste they 're colored in picture on top of the blank sheet that you already made so it 's a great way to talk about colors different fruits and Counting now if you 're looking for other things to do don 't forget that the Central Highlands libraries has great online resources we have story box library so that your children can watch stories online we have borrow box so that they can listen different ones called ABC Kids which has lots of crafts and busy things that has lots of problem-solving games so don 't forget to have a look at those resources while you 're at home looking for things to do all right before we finish up today let 's have our very last I 'll just put my book away we always finish storytime with the Hokey Pokey so boys and girls grown-ups it 's time to stand up and it 's time to dance here we go you put your hands in you put your hands out you put your hands in there just shake them all about you do the Hokey Pokey and you turn around and that 's what it 's all about now go into the middle of the room whoa the hokey-pokey run backwards whoa the Hokey Pokey back in the middle whoa the Hokey Pokey and that 's what it 's a little app out there grown-ups if you 're picking up your children for this bit remember we need to carry them safely so sucking your tummy 's super strong like you 're will protect your back and make sure that you 're not doing bending over

    "text": "councilors officers ladies and gentlemen would you please be upstanding for his worship the mayor of Ballarat and the reciting of the councilors affirmation didn 't use my microphone sorry everyone who might be streaming in counsellors thank you very much I discussed yesterday after the circumstances we 're dealing with across the country the state and in this city to call an extraordinary meaning of council councilors we are in very interesting times unchartered waters that we 've never been in a situation before as as a community from a councillors point of view we we don 't know what could happen in another 24 hours so today a special meetings being called to do with the item of the CEOs delegation I 'll start with item 2 which is apologies for absence there is none all counselors are here and councillors disclosure of interest on this item there 's Neil as well councillors we only have one item today item 4 which is the officers report which is the s5 instrument of delegation Council to CEO I 'm going to ask the chief financial officer the director Glynn mr. mayor currently in the CEO has a delegation of 250,000 for Sonya of contracts and other issues such as that in the current climate we 're in that would not suffice if an issue came up that required more than that amount of money as it 's not anticipated that we run in contracts committees or council meetings in the foreseeable future unless the local government apartment allows us to conduct those meetings by remote so in the interim in order to safeguard being able to provide essential services to the community the situation came up that the CEO need to water contract in excess of 250,000 Gatien modified we 're recommending five million dollars as I said I 'm precedent times we 're not a not sure of what emergency may come up and what that may require the organization to spend to deliver those essential services so that 's the whole reason of this meeting and the delegation that 's in front counselors Thank You mr. Kelly Oh counselors to have any questions absolutely mr. me a second a second of councillor McIntosh there was a question you just to get some clarity on so I take it to mean that within the state government guidelines we can have normal committee meetings I 'm just a bit unsure about that dynamic I would imagine that the social distancing becomes an issue but by the same token is that state government having given this provision to hold a meeting by any other means through you mr. mayor no unfortunately the state government hasn 't allowed us to hold meetings remotely like I 'm like now agenda briefing last last Wednesday we rub to have two counselors not present the local government is very strictly and bit archaic that you have to be present which removes our ability to quickly call a contracts meeting if an emergency you come in and we needed water contract for in excess of 250,000 we could not quickly convene a contracts committee to do that if members can 't come to the council chamber we couldn 't do it remotely so the provision of this item allows the CEO to approve that we would probably put in protocols where we would advise councils to have a CEO use her delegation you need assess of 250,000 and then get the CEO to do that as the harris continue one more question i just wondering the pie needs increased delegation and i was just wondering what feedback council will have if that was exercised comment thanks thanks Kelly through you mr. mayor my I 'm the protocol that I were doing that that would be put in place we would advise cancel what the issue would be we would advise cancel why the decision has to be made now why would not be practical to call another meeting especially if you at this time last week you wouldn 't have anticipated that we would be sending all our staff home to work I would envisage that in the next week or two that non-essential travel would be not allowed by the government hence we couldn 't all assemble like we are now so just looking ahead as this is not going to be a two-week process governments are talking about could be a six-month process we have to set the organisation up that if in counselors together or a quorum of counselors together that we can make decisions to continue to deliver those services in the delegation we 've written it in such a way it 's only in those circumstances that we can 't get a contracts committee or a council meeting together in order to approve the works that need to be done if we are able to do that Finnish delegation cannot be used so we 've written it with that safeguard for council that the CEO could not just use a delegation whenever she chose to it 's only in certain circumstances that that delegation can be used canceled until it has a question in McIntosh the explanation from mr. Kelly has changed my view a little bit I did think the five million was perhaps a bit a bit high but if the delegation is written as he has indicated strictly that it can only be under those circumstances and that the counselors will be informed before it 's exercised then I guess the five million is money because it 's effectively it 's effectively a quasi vote of council the money but we must we must be in a position where this organization can run unfettered in what we could imagine has been the worst of circumstances I suspect we 're not in the worst of circumstances yet so you judge that 's a good question so so long as we are comfortable what that is the that the intent of it is that we 've been advised the question in relation to what happens should to c4c however god forbid would be issue as it happens near the sea goes on leave she makes a delegation as best you can I would like to see an agreement whether it 's written or except if the delegation is to be transferred that the council be advised who the title of CEO how would that then be structured yes thank you counselor again as we are in unprecedented times what I would ensure that all counselors are advised in advance of me putting in place acting arrangements for our enacting or interim CEO that those people will be drawn from our executive leadership group so the directors in the first all councils will be advised prior to that decision being made a coach had a question I yes mr. mayor through you perhaps to the CEO it doesn 't appear to be becoming more likely by the day that face to face Council meetings and briefings including our ordinary meetings may be canceled I 'm aware that perhaps some councils are moving to do that today I think city of yarra have advised that they 've canceled their all of their council meetings and briefings Thank You counselor my recommendation to council would be that we don 't follow that path I think incredibly important that the the governance of the city continues we will continue to provide briefings and information to counselors as has been required to yes we are in an emergency situation we don 't know how long that will last fall but there are still core activities that the city is responsible for and the councillors are responsible for directing it would not be prudent to forecast a suspension of council activity council more activity with that regard we I saw my recommendation to counselors would opportunities for council to meet a remotely so that you can actively participate in civic life and actually implement your roles as councillors Council Rinaldi next question thank you and maybe to the figure you 've come up with five million dollars and we 're talking about an unknown certain going forward whether us can be so so the question is is that enough at this point well how did you come up with that number director Kalia thank you three mister me just rely on a bit of experience in local government and possible scenarios that may come up I can 't think of a scenario that would come up that would exceed the five million dollars if it did exceed five million dollars I think we would be a lot of strong so most most scenarios that I could I could think up five million dollars would cover those I think it 's greater than five million dollars then I think the states in a huge emergency it would be different control Thank You councillor Macintosh had a question through you mr. Muir just a question in regards because there 's not that item in the recommendation I 'm wondering even in reference to councilor Hudson 's view as well as the mover of the recommendation whether we could have something similar to must have seen our sales representative report or advise council on each action this delegation allows so that we are informed the community to expect that we are the decision-makers we have been elected to do so on their behalf and I think it 's imperative when we 're talking about such a significant amount of money that there is the appropriate information and communication with the whole group of council also just wondering councillor Hudson your views on adding an item to that recommendation that suggests to see I must or the CEO is rep must report or advise Council on each of the actions in response to this delegation so thank you council Macintosh just before we do ask that question just wanted to get the understand this is a fairly standard kind of procedural type of motion that set in place is that something first thing that can be added in there is council looking from the organisation point of view to structure it that we have that process in place can I go through to you Betsy I think you mr. mayor thank you council Macintosh for the question the it would be possible to put an additional recommendation although it would not form part of the delegation so I needed to be really clear that the delegation has to stand in its own right but if council so wished just to take an additional recommendation or additional motion that stipulated that a procedure needed to be put in place which meant that all councillors were notified prior to the exercise of that of that delegation in advance of the exercise of that delegation in I think that would be appropriate so that would need to be foreshadowed and we do with that after this motion you can either do that or it 's an amendment councillor Johnson just had a question first thing yes Cyrus Thank You mr. mayor I have read through the recommendation a number of times and I just can 't see where it says anything about it possible to make that clearer in the recommendation it 's over to director Kelly 3mr no it 's actually in the schedule if you if you have a look at the schedule it 's it 's out very clearly that it can only be exercised if a council or a contracts committee can 't_''_876.17 be held so it 's not possible for the CEO straight after this meeting to go and award a contract for 300,000 sorry can solaris council on you had a question for sorry my fault m 'lady yeah thank you mr. mayor 's for you and a follow-up to the two councillor mcintoshes question really and I see how his response that you know I accepted the CEOs suggestion that we have perhaps an additional element to the motion which requests or requires the the CEO to consult with counselors on extraordinary use of the delegation powers but also if we could add to that that the CEO you know also consult with counselors about the change of her role if she 's unable to fulfill that role is that is that possible and I seconder of the other motion and Oliver the second question as almost me yeah and question to council Hudson and thank you mr. hero I guess reading recommendation one that says they 'll be delegated to the person holding the position to me that 's pretty clear that whoever is occupying the position of CEO this delegation will actually ride it with them at the time so the other bids we 're talking about that will become self-evident whoever is the other CEO or acting see how in the absence of the CEO I would imagine would you also look at putting that item additional line in in relation to a procedure around that communication and what level is being used yeah quite happy for that to be added when I think though if I was saying it will be a procedural matter anyway councils will be in form so quite happy for that to be well the intense of that to be captured in a sixth recommendation thank you yeah additionally as well mr. mayor I guess if you could please mr. Marin some comment as well in regard the local government minister and Victoria I just find it potentially staggering and I would hate to think that this is potentially one of our last meetings of the council is to delegate a lot of our powers effectively to the CEO it 's it 's a fairly mind-boggling exercise to think that we don 't have the ability as many businesses are to meet online and to make decisions so if we could please get some comment from from mr. mayor and madam C know about the approaches have you made big one for myself is communicating with a lot of the mayor 's across the region from a regional cities Victoria from the Central Highlands and even through to Melbourne as well around that reason how do we actually function of a council bound under the Act which doesn 't provide that flexibility to number one close the members close the gallery and also number two how do we run a council meeting where you have to be physically present if there we are in locked in and what does that mean we 've been putting that through sign through the local government Minister the M AV and the local government Victoria as much as they 're filtering information through it has been limited information and it is well behind then what 's been led by the the federal and the state so we really are going by what 's being put and really what everybody 's getting that information at the same time and then we 're waiting for that what that interpretation means to us as a council the CEO in the leadership team have been working very hard to put together the right plans in place to deal with this and that is why the organisation went very early last week in doing the closures that we 're done and then and then trying to respond to that as we go I don 't think it 's high on the priority of government right now but in these extraordinary times absolutely we should have some sort of exemptions as part of the Act considering the act that was adopt or Parliament did will not be enacted until May we stood in exemptions so that will we can get those changes so we can run the business of counsel madam sir do you have any other comments Thank You mr. mee and again Thank You counsel money for the question because I think it 's it 's an important one to highlight in addition to making direct representations to the minister I have also made representations to the CEO of local government Victoria and to the CEO of Municipal Association of Victoria last week also requesting the ability for council to meet remotely and to use similar clauses that that were modified and applied to library corporations so for a number a number of years library corporations operating in very similar ways to to local government to local councils those requirements were relaxed to enable remote or teleconferencing so it 's not that they can 't_``_1180.13 happen they could happen but it doesn 't it 's not provided for in the act currently so I think with these emergency situations and that we are facing at the moment we will continue to lobby on that in that regard that 's the Harris then councillor Coates Andrew currently known however having said that there is a requirement following the election assuming that the election still goes ahead in October this year there was a requirement for council to review this delegation in any event what you could R stipulate is that you wish it to be reviewed as soon as the emergency is so that would be an additional line that we need to put in there yeah councillor Coates just to clarify 3ms mr. mayor to the CEO so they 're there just to be clear there is no provision in in the new Act either and we 're coming in in May for any remote voting nothing in the new act there is an item in relation to closing to the public if there is security concerns in this case this would be the case but that by the looks it hasn 't been enacted as that act of Parliament and the indication was May so we 're still a couple of months away Who am I missing sorry counselor Mackintosh thank you three mr. mee just wondering what other states are doing in this comes from state government it gives us these guidelines that we hold is that exactly the same for each of the other states or is there a different way that they are great throw to you I don 't see I think you can some mcintosh each individual state has come very different approaches to the way that local government is operated it 's vastly different between so for example Queensland and ourselves I 'm not aware of any special arrangements that are being made in other you know the state basis so and and neither would we be controlled centrally so effectively from centre from a central government perspective effectively we are local government isn 't yet recognised in the Australian Constitution so we 're reliant on our state act through you mr. me just to follow on from that really all I was after there was if there is an operation in another state that would set some really good guidelines for us that could give us some good reference points if they 're doing something already that works well that 's more around my questioning so I aware of any other states operating in a different manner every state has a different act in relation to it in relation to Victoria councillor councils they 're cancelling some means of this stage and we rely on the local government minister to provide exemptions around what our act is my question was not a ever I 'm very aware of the current situation that we have here in the state it was just our other states operating in a different manner that we could benefit from if they 've already got a different way of operating with their meetings then it might be worth us looking at that that was my question thank you Kessler Johnson Thank You mr. mayor given that these changes would have to be voted upon in fact the Parliament would have to amend the local government acts that would require Parliament meeting they haven 't actually set a date for when they 're going to meet again in it at this time I would assume that it would be very low on the priority list given everything else that 's happening in a state local government act we 're going to have to continue meeting so have we considered what that looks like and how we can potentially be how we can potentially adhere to the guidelines about social distancing and still as required today I think director calico said what is the definition of essential versus non-essential and what would be put in place as it 's changing every 24 hours does that mean accounts lose essential or not essential it 's still an unknown to what that is and then the next question is what happens if we do have a couple of people that might be affected and then also the risk to family and friends that that might be there as well mostly family it 's an unknown situation how we continue to run if things could change very quickly and at this stage the meeting on the first is still scheduled to go ahead but that might change within 24 hours and what we 're capable doing what they 're capable of doing can I just ask a follow-up question then within the local government does it stipulate how in trouble if we can 't achieve a quorum or or do we have to at least try to meet and see if enough counselors show up and then we are at least complying with the act okay but we have our schedule set at the beginning of the year each year we set our calendar but there 's a very different times and uncertainty in what we do but your comments on that there are only a couple of council meetings that are required to be to be held one is the council meeting immediately following an election and another is the call of the council so there was a call of the council required all others are in accordance with the schedule the ordinary meeting schedule that where that has been established if we fail to achieve a quorum it does provide some difficulty but but no sanctions and I think that that 's probably the the point that we 're at at the moment the other component part is the ability as he 's evidenced by today 's meaning the ability of the mayor and three or if we can 't achieve a quorum it just means that the resolutions can 't_''_1573.77 be passed but there 's no sanction for four counts or more council always if you can 't attend those meetings well what 's really important is an exemption I think the local government Minister could do an exemption for us to have one close to public and number two to then do what we do now which is actually online or in some form to be involved but yes counselor Tillett you had a question I do actually I 'm referring to the schedule which is really what the meeting is about it 's we 're about covering the situation and to schedule clearly that 's two things it requires the CEO to be satisfied that the council can 't meet then she can act but she can do a lot more than spend five million dollars because point four point two and a four point I 'm probably beyond actually indicate other things that she can do which we normally would have had the responsibility of doing so this isn 't just a the event we can 't meet the circum in all the circumstances that officers think we might have a problem just in case and I think it 's a very wise move I do think that the edge or which are the conditions under which we are giving this delegation it 's quite appropriate thank you and those items were under previous delegated authorities as well so today the only change is actually that financial limit under the controls thank you councillors councillor Maloney yeah thanks mr. Mehra it 's probably a follow up from what councillor till it 's just asked peps I made reading it wrong but my interpretation of it says the delegate amazing a CEO must not determine the issue take action or do the act or thing if it involves one of the following and one of the following is council tilts point out is 4.23 report 4.9 talks about things such as making local laws approving the council plan strategic resource plan special committees a whole bunch of other delegations is that corrected maybe oh just a point of clarification 3 mr. mayor the actually allows the CEO to to do those additional things so it 's more than just the 5 million all the delegation it 's also the approval the council plan making local laws and several other things as well I interpret that as not do those things mr. Murray Thank You mr. me through you yes that is correct those the limitations of what the CEO cannot do those are the limitations that are being applied in relation to the only thing that they are exactly the same as the current conditions and mattei shion 's that is in her current instrument of delegation the only difference being is what has been applied in item for point one is the condition where a council cannot meet or a contracts committee cannot mate the exercising of a delegation in excess of the 250,000 which was the limit has been provided as a limit to five million okay so just as a quick follow-up to to director Murray I suppose we in that case why have the CEO effectively coming off making local laws as she so chooses not that I trust want to again clarify that so we won 't have a situation of CEO making up local laws without our consultation you getting through you mr. mayor yes that is correct council has any other questions no councils we had a lot of discussion around item 16 process around communication and in process or the communication and also what the steps are doing that delegation and also item 7 to actually review delegation once completed as the yes was canceled to it alright council making time sticking this are you happy with that can touch thank you do you wish to speak Thank You mr. mayor and clearly councillors we 're in a period of uncertainty like we 've probably never seen before and ordered our own parents seen in the in the hundred years prior to it we were all from World War two I should say not quite a hundred years but clearly we need the organization to continue we 're seeing statements come out of federal and state governments and clearly there is the role for local council to exercise its powers and the things that it that are changing on a day-by-day basis we need to understand that the office of the chief executive officer is vitally important to the ongoing function of our city whether we can meet or can 't meet at times and certainly the intention is around full disclosure to councillors of what those delegations may be used for the urgency around some of those but in the interim that we can 't get councilors together to actually exercise that in a formal vote we need to empower the chief executive officer to do that on our behalf certainly also with the sunset clause that while we are still in the state of emergency or when the other tiers of government are able to say that we are through on the other side that then absolutely this power this delegated power should then be reviewed and we 've revert back to normal business practices in terms of CEO delegation picking up some of your points mr. Muir I also think that we should be looking for the direction to the local government minister to actually not be seen dragging their heels in city of Ballarat but all around the state of Victoria that are equally as impacted can actually come together and still do their function as they would intend to do as state government or federal parliament to think today with such urgencies as stimulus packages that are being put through Parliament we found the 90 members sitting in the house because of social distancing and some would argue could that not have been done in a much more consistent way so I think where we are seeing some of that being addressed by federal and state comments and saying now is the time when this particular issue is in front of us we need to see creative thinking outside of the square as to how the governance around decision-making obsolete is at all levels of government can actually continue about in relation to the special powers for the CEO and the delegated authority I 'm very comfortable that we need to do this we need to do it now to ensure that the CEO can act when accorded when required in terms of the days and weeks and potentially months for everyone the item six on those will read it out just so people have got it without of a screen in front of us the chief executive officer prepare a procedure that outlines notification process to councillors prior to the exercising of the delegation outlined in item 4.1 of the instrument of delegation to this chief executive officer and number seven a review of the delegation be completed as soon as the emergency event has ceased I 'm happy with that Thank You councillor McIntosh you wish to speak as a seconder absolutely mr. mee this is a very critical time for us as a city for us as a state and for us as a nation and we want to make sure that the delivery of essential services does go along as smoothly as possible we know that it does mean is likely to mean an increase of critical roles that maybe we wouldn 't have considered in the past to know that the CEO has that ability the support of all of our council to make some significant decisions if the need arise I think we 'll confidence moving forward through these really difficult days it is imperative as you 've heard from the group of counselors that we remain very informed of any of these extended decision-making opportunities that we as a council or group remain very aware and in in the leadership roles that we were appointed to by our community and that we do have the opportunity to have significant communications and response as well as we 're moving into a slightly changed format so with the extra additions to the recommendation as we 've discussed and I certainly do support the process this recommendation and the opportunity for the CEO to ensure that there is a prepared procedure that would be delivered to us as a group of counselors to ensure that we all remain informed and that we can therefore represent our community with a great deal of confidence Thank You counselors we should speak for or against for counsel Maloney thanks mr. mayor I 'll speak for okay I think it 's it 's extraordinary I guess and with it ruch a special meeting of council and approves and pretty vast a time and no actual formal briefing but hey we live an extraordinary time so it is something we 'll just have to adapt to but I would hate to think that this has potential to be our last council meeting we have take a period of the council elections in September and for our last act as councilors effectively be to hand over a significant portion of our councillor roles and powers to the CEO but again I support the motion for the reason that we are in extraordinary times and we don 't have much choice local councils are important local democracy is important and we will be expected to play a major role in Barrett 's recovery when we start to come out the other side of his pandemic and it will be hard to do that effectively with one hand tied behind our backs if we 're not able to have formal meetings and make formal decisions as councillors just purely because there is an archaic requirement in the Local Government Act and even the new version of Local Government Act which requires us to be hopefully we understand the state and federal governments have far bigger issues on their plate right now but hopefully that is something that comes to to the state government 's attention in the very near future allow some mechanism to be able to continue formal decision-making processes but nevertheless we are in extraordinary times and any other time I would be pretty pretty frustrated having to approve such such Whites sweeping changes to the CEOs role but I 'm comfortable especially with the addition of the sixth points to the motion that requires consultation thanks speak Thank You mr. mayor I support this motion I would also like to extend my gratitude to staff who have been working extremely hard over the last few weeks and particularly in the last 24 hours given the changes announced and wish you all the best in the weeks to come I will also just raise an idea that I heard given the difficulties many of our local businesses are experiencing at the moment that the fun that we have set aside for events grants that that be deferred be diverted rather to supporting provide some sort of rate relief to our commercial ratepayers in the city of Ballarat acknowledging also that we as a council have tough times ahead financially in in continuing to run our services based on what we predict will be significantly decreased funding for our organization I support the motion and as I said I wish everyone the very best in the challenging weeks and months ahead Thank You councillor Johnson any other councillors wishing to speak councillor Harris yes I 'm deeply disappointed mister me don 't speak for the motion I 'd really dislike this a lot this is delegation councillors there 's no there 's no consultation it 's notification that 's all we can expect we can 't do anything else unfortunately this is just we have to have provisions for both in response and recovery we have to have this provision put in I am deeply disappointed with the local government ministry I mean how you know I I don 't really I mean you know people are working hard particularly in the health sector but this is necessarily simple you know this day Act was put in they should have put these provisions in it is appalling to think that we can 't with the provisions that we 've got be satisfied that when we meet very video otherwise the people have understood the issues and conferred on those issues it 's just it 's a nonsense and you know state governors got to do better in this space it doesn 't leave us in a great space it 's going to be a hard six months I would much prefer it to be with consultation and an appropriate council input I think it is the time we need to serve our community well so I feel that damn by state government and they need to do better in this space and there 's no I don 't let them off the hook to say other things to think about a lot of people have things to think about they just should have done better but I wholeheartedly support we do need this provision to be able to move forward we will have to put into that space in terms of how we governments got to do better in saying what that role is going to be it 's been particularly quiet in terms of specifying whatever responsibilities will be within the responsible recovery phase so state government says let us down here local government response responsibilities will be thanked you can Solaris cancel the codes a quick question if I can first and then then I 'll speak to it so the question is whether there have been any discussions or possible projections that budgets may be deferred at all has there been any discussion of that possibility through state and federal governments have delayed their budgets but from a request to account actually go director Kelly oh I 'm sure of any communication around what that means throughout Kelly oh I 'm through you mr. mee unfortunately the low gum Department just reiterated the Local Government Act to us when we asked them a few questions so according to that Castle are still required to adopt a budget by the 30th of June from our own ability to continue to deliver the essential services those ratepayers that will go through this that they pay their rates so that we 're still able to do deliver essential services so even if the government gave us the ability to delay doing our budget until October because of the way in which our phones come in that would be disastrous for the council we expect a fairly big impact on not clicking rates both this year and next year but so we 're going to be relying on that those parts of the community that do have a job got impacted from a financial sense from the crisis so delaying the budgets not a good idea but nothing 's coming out of government on anything so and I wouldn 't expect much to come out of local government mr. Coates yes I will just speak for the motion it is I think a real bind for councillors that were in a really difficult position that we 're in emergency management mode and really unprecedented times and hopefully will not have the the CEO won 't have to enact too much in in line with those those additional budget requirements but if it is needed to day basis so I will also think the CEO and and the directors and the staff for really stepping up that it 's it 's just so incredibly important for community confidence to see really clear leadership really really clear messages and and to maintain really really calm but confident sort of decorum around around how we 're how we 're dealing with it and I think it 's really important for us as counselors to to to really to really be consistent in in line with what we are communicating to the community in these really difficult times and and really acknowledge the social consequences that it 's it 's a health crisis but it is actually quite a social crisis as well anxiety levels are really high for a lot of members of the community whether it 's around health concerns or business concerns financial concerns environmental concerns connecting with each other all of those sorts of things are really just we we didn 't see it coming but I think it 's it 's also an opportunity to pull together and really really learn some very and social connectedness if there is one small positive I 'm hoping that that will be one you can that 's an econ solution to speak no men against I 'll put the vote against all those in favor Thank You counselors that 's past counsel just before we close again things and president of times things are changing rapidly every 24 hours were even less than that the big thing and councillor Coates has said that we are all in this together not just as a council as a community as businesses everyone 's in this and we 've got to think about emergency services providing that service through this tough time and they 're doing an amazing job right now but as we all know what we 've seen elsewhere this is kind of just the beginning and we 've got to then work on this together and the big thing is which we 've been pushing is about number one looking after yourself looking after your community they 're looking after what that means to business so they kind make those phone calls keep social distancing and of this a stronger community as well as a hopefully we can put back into the community from an economic point of view at the end of this as well from the council Thank You counselors meeting closed at 11 at 50 thank you but in the morning in the afternoon _"

    "text": "good morning everyone it 's Monday there 's been a whole lot of changes across Victoria and across the city in the last 24 hours with the announcement by the premier Daniel Andrews these are difficult times and we 're really in uncharted waters around what 's happening and what we need to do one thing is though as an organisation that there 's a council we 're working really hard to ensure that we can maintain the things that we talked about which is a healthy workforce a healthy community and making sure businesses can still continue through this time one thing is today we 've got an extraordinary council meeting today at 00 p.m. this is very different to do it as I don 't think it 's ever been done I know that I 've been aware of it in this council but the reason for that is we need to ensure the council business still operates if we don 't have council meetings we need to be sure that the CEO has the delegated authority to continue to keep the bills been paid and keep people meeting today to work through that now I 'm with the CEO just they just things been working hard with the council team and I even know yesterday Sunday they were here at the Town Hall working through what implications are and they 've been trying to do the best they can in these unprecedented times so just saying what are the services that we continue to do as a council I think you think used to me look the city of Ballarat does provide 70 different services to community but we really focused on those essential services to keep the city going and functioning and also to look after the most vulnerable people in our community so as of tomorrow as many staff as possible will be working from and this is to comply with the isolation and buffer distance requirement some announced by the both the Prime Minister and the premier yesterday and today and as many of those those staffing is set up to be able to do that work however our essential services that will continue no matter what include the following so waste collections so your beings out on the dais and the standard days that you 're used to doing please put your beans out at the front west collection also extends to keeping our transfer station open of Achilles strength so again we still recommend that you apply that social distance requirement something to either going to turn not to the transfer station Street cleansing will continue in home support that 's really vital for the most vulnerable in our community maternal and child health please keep your appointments even if you can 't physically get in place make contact with other children child health nurses very young they don 't know and the animal shelter will remain open as a service learning open for direct contact so again please call through we have our rapid response team that 's in the infrastructure and maintenance area so if you know the weather turns a little bit inclement we have trees down that rabbit response to Malaysia provisions are being made for child care remains open so with priority access given to health care and emergency management personnel so the children of healthcare and families we understand that but to keep our workforce going and particularly those health care workers I think is really important and again immunization it remains operational so when the vaccinations do when you 're able to get those vaccinations and we again encourage you to make sure that you the situation is fluid it is changing but these essential services will continue to be made I think just think as you say we 're practicing the social distancing it 's really important that we continue to do that and it has been cleared by federal and state that that 's what we need to do these times are unprecedented there are charter waters that we 're dealing through but it is important that we do stop that spring now that as I said we need to make sure we stay healthy and most importantly we need to think of others at this time we need to be kind we 've really pushed that message because we 've got to think about everyone that 's out there that might be going through different times at the moment and might be phone call to family and friends even your neighbors just make sure they 're okay and anyone that might mean support make contact with them and see how they 're going we will continue to provide updates as we move along but as I said these are different in in relation to times there is uncertainty but what we can do is make sure we respond from a city point of view and continue to provide services that are needed especially vulnerable across that community thanks pal _"

    "text": "possibly the largest item in the city of Bal rats historical collection is this wonderful painting it shows the Legislative Assembly in Victoria located down in Melbourne in 1896 the question that occurs though is why is this particular painting here it 's one of those issues which hasn 't really been resolved all that clearly at the time that it was made 1896 Australia was in the grip of its discussions about Federation and Ballarat politicians and citizens were very much involved at the forefront of the discussions about the role of Federation and the part that Valerie might play in brokering Federation and leading the country down that particular path the interesting thing at the time when there was an election on the issuer referendum on Federation the seat of Ballarat recorded the highest rate for Federation which was about 97 percent which is a remarkable figure when you think about it one of the reasons why Ballarat was so in favour of Federation was the fact that they could see that Ballarat should become the national capital and there was a great push by many of the apt to be nominated as the as the federal capital and they were also very much integrated into the process and the arguments that went on at the time this particular painting has another interesting connection with Ballarat in that sitting in the back corner of the painting just here is Alfred Deakin Alfred Deakin had been a member of the Victorian Parliament but at the time of Federation he switched over to become a parliamentarian in the new federal parliament and he was the member for Ballarat for the first couple of terms after nausea three so and obviously he became the second Prime Minister of Australia which really put Ballarat in a very privileged and special position if you like in the Federation story after 1901 so it 's a very fascinating picture you can see each of the figures that are in the picture can be identified there is a list of all the names of of the various portraits you wonder about some of them that are facing away from the front of the image and some where you just see the back of somebody 's his top hat and not much else so interesting elements about this picture it raises as many questions as as it answers and a fascinating element of the historical collections of the city _"

    "text": "[Music] back in 2012 the city of Ballarat asked the Ballarat community how their much-loved Victoria Park could be better used and protected into the future through this conversation the Ballarat community told us that there was a strong desire for an enclosed play space that was inclusive of people with a disability Victoria Park presented as the ideal location for regional sized inclusive play space for a number of reasons including its proximity to schools and public transport its large open space its existing amenities and the provision of extensive accessible car parking an inclusive play space enables children parents grandparents and carers of all abilities and ages to socialise and play side by side on the same equipment in the same environment it is not a dedicated playground for people with disabilities but a play space designed for the use and benefit of all community members ensuring full integration of children and families and improved community connections the inclusive play space at Victoria Park was delivered by the city of Ballarat through a model of partnership with a touched by Olivia Foundation the first stage of the inclusive now twelve months on the city of Ballarat is asking the Ballarat community what they like or love about the space what can be improved and what they feel must be protected and enhanced [Music] very went at the new playground at Victoria Park it accommodates all of them I 've got a ten-year-old boy old and two-year-old and the idea of a playground where all kids could play together regardless of ability sounded just amazing I hadn 't even imagined it my mum loves it so much because it 's a fenced environment where she can just go in and the kids just run off in whatever direction but there 's only the one exit point so she can relax having the open space in the middle and having very open sort of barriers on the main play structure as well meant that pretty well anywhere in that playground you can eyeball your child you can take ball type of free speech but tell you I love the Flying Fox you can see it actually all of them do well what 's your favorite thing we take up one at the moment are the spinny things not my favorite part because if I ever get on whether I almost feel like I 'm gonna lose my lunch the water my daughter could leave in that winter summer rain hail or shy and she 's there she 's like to strip all the way off and you know undo one of the things I was really looking forward to with the opening of the play space was to be able to have Sarah 's birthday party there and what made that special was because we could take her onto the flying fox so she could go on that with her sister we could put her on the carousel she could play with that with her sister and her other friends and kids she 'd never met before fear of this dinner it 's malting yeah now you like it I had the musical instruments and the drums those things work I loved the fencing defense seems fantastic things like the toilet facilities barbecue facilities and the water was always like a surprise and fantastic illusion and then when it came after we could go into the changing places facility and I could do that on my own with her I didn 't need help to get her out of her chair because the change table lowers far enough to do a transfer and I didn 't have to put her on the toilet for or hide her behind some bushes somewhere in order to deal with her personal hygiene yep sorry she likes to start at the top and write down the Gillan and all the way around the path and its really build her confidence up I do love play I 've never grown up so I actually love playing with the kids and being somewhere where I can get on stuff without you know feeling like I 'm too large kids can look out for each other through spaces like that so when when there is an organized play area where it 's like someone has to have a team and if someone has not turned I can teach each other to death some of her friends from her school came along they also have disabilities and they three wheelchairs on the carousel and that 's something we 've never been able to do in Ballarat before how things terrific I pushed them as far as I can people when they say that 's high enough I just push it that extra bit to get the thrill on their face when they swing down it 's like this is fantastic older children the wall of the flying fox times me Anna not an ideal space for lots of families to host events so birthday parties and you 're not fighting for space there was a moment on the opening day when Sara was on the nest swing and having a lovely time and another family came up who I didn 't know and the father said would it be okay if these girls got on two and that was the moment that I realized that Sara doesn 't just get to play with her sister now she gets to play with anybody and there 's beautiful children said things like I wish she got those things on her legs and I was able to explain that you know strong and it keeps them in a good position and they asked why doesn 't she talk and I could explain you know the messages just don 't go from her brain to her mouth to enable her to do that and so Sara got social connection with people she 'd never met before and these kids learnt things about Sara that they would never provide the opportunity to learn and that was amazing that was an unexpected joy that that was probably the moment that I realized just how special that place spaces this is great [Laughter] I really love the open space in the middle it would be great if that was a greener area all year round sometimes in summer it can get a little bit dry now obviously with Sarah being in a wheelchair sure Poland isn 't something she can access very easily but a lot of her friends from her school have autism or on the autism spectrum and for those kids that jumping motion can be really calming it can also help them sort of focus and concentrate a little bit too so the play space my tenure I 'd like to play on the grass with each syllable you know maybe crooked or something and sometimes it would be mushy my oldest child Lily who 's 12 now has always been a climber right from the Wii ago she just up anything so it would be great to have some climbing device whether it 's a tree or whether it 's a rope or whether it 's something that but also it has to be decent height definitely does definitely likes climbing as well yeah thank you exploration of play like natural play spaces I think really valuable things like having an area with a couple of little cubby huts where kids can decide you know this one 's a shop and this one 's a school have Adobe playground is so needed in that life my mum would appreciate some more tables and chairs she 's not so keen on sitting on the ground we need more barbecues what do you think I would like a treehouse yep probably misleading yes a climbing susp Eider web type thing because she loves there isn 't one of them at the moment [Music] it just needs to be maintained and turning to em it 's a fantastic asset in Ballarat and it should be it should just keep getting better and better and better and better it really is [Music] you _"

mother one day and as young boys do he ran ahead and the mum was yelling out for him to come back she 's can come on back come on back well of course the boy was deaf him hero and he thought she thought how am I going to get his attention so she had a little bit of a thing and she picked up a rock and then so maybe this will work maybe I can get her in his attention this way so she threw it around a bit and then she threw it right towards him well it hit him in the head and his head started bleeding and it was an awful awful thing an awful way to get his attention hi hi oh hi how are you I 've been trying to get your attention it 's really frustrating when you don 't respond oh you can stamp on the floor or you can flash the light so you can just simply tap me on the shoulder ah that

we 're about to see we had a chat about what we might see we start to watch and then I start to look I asked my family member next to me what are they sign not sorry so I watch for a bit more and try and understand what 's happening ask someone else what did they say I there it 's very frustrating the movie finishes my family we all go out and we chat about the movie but I feel quite alone at all

love signing I know my voice is it clear I know it 's it 's not a great voice I would rather sign don 't tell me not to sign it 's my voice it 's my way of communicating it to my choice and again the teacher would say you must use your implant you must never take it off and i wanted to say i want to take it off I don 't want that noise in my head I know you want me to talk but i would rather sign it 's my body it 's my choice it 's my language and it 's my communication sorry what did you say can you say it again that can you say that again please I 'm finding it really difficult to lip-read
