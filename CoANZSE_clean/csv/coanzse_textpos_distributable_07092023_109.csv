And Sarah Templeton welcome we've also got two meetings like again part Part B so we'll deal with the first one first are there any issues that you want to highlight there yes we have an part 8 there and elect means information exchange the naming of public realm spacers on page 43 the board decided to support the creation of a policy on the naming of public realm spaces with an emphasis on local names now should probably have ended up being a part a because it would be something that council would have to address oklahoma uh this was raised in discussion over the naming of the laneway and the justice precinct and we thought that since there are many public realm space is being created small and large within the city at the moment they're having a policy on the naming of those spaces would be really useful for the council that we do have a policy on well suturing mein Leben a on the throne but not public realm as some more clarity this also came out when we had the public realm clear that there was no clear policy around naming spaces within the puppet realm which is why the board asked that that happened my recognition is that that hasn't been handed over to the public realm so that the decision about what that that Lane was called was made who has been made prior to the restoration of that public realm to the council it's not busy but this is it just came up as part of that discussion that generally there will be lots of public realm space is created within the city that's right we understand that that private justice right of way or lane is the domain of the justice precinct and the justice minister what we were looking at also need an equal when we well I mean if we had any influence over it we might have chosen a different name but we we don't and it's not that you know there's nothing we can do about that but what we can do going forward is we didn't want that heated and public realm space because there was the people that are doing the presentation they said there was no policy around how public rum space would be known that's why we thought it would be good to try and get that in place with a focus on local names because he's saying that that√≠s and create the advice you received from staff wasn't creepy so or your interpretation wasn't like carefully to use the price public realm before so it's unclear what we're referring to if it's rose then we can so many years of in-depth and now we know that and reserves and parks or judge council and the capsule means those with learning I think the thing is the board appreciates that the staff through both Sarah and counseled and huge wigger a public realm plan and we're in a new dynamic where there's a whole bunch of land that's going to be developed by government or by us that's in going to either be vested and certain certain ways whether it's reserved writing public realm and we just think it would be names to reflect our local history and character rather than just leaving it at the whim of however the example that you're using is not a helpful one so in every other circumstance they foot within the definitions that Peters described so look I mean the thing is is that developing a public realm policy of naming public realm spaces doesn't make sense unless you know exactly what it is that they're going to be how they are going to be established as public realm there are parts of what the the sort of discourse at the moment describes as a public realm which will be resumed there are parts of it that will be straight there are parts of it that will be you know and that's what we need to understand is is there any gap and that process yeah and it seems to me that what you're really saying if using your example is there in the discussions between Sarah or CCD you and the council in relation to elements of the developments that are occurring in the central city if they that there ought to be a way that that is consulted with with the council through the appropriate mechanism and it's and that may be a community board but it may be the full council so yeah so that that seems to me to be the way to resolve that problem but we do have policy around naming reserves and parks and we do have policy around naming streets so I don't want to get staff to be spending time valuable time developing a policy that will have a time-limited impaired while ccdu controls the central city I think that the sum of the spaces at the moment are being called public realm generally when we don't know where they're going to fit that's right and so they're being named the concern is that they will be named before they are allocated a sort of specific area therefore node naming policy will encompass them yeah that's right so but the but the trouble was is that they're being named while we don't own them so so maybe maybe a better idea that we need to raise this with ccd you as a concern that has been raised from one of our community boards so I'm happy that perhaps we changed the recommendation that the report be received and that the council inform ccdu that we wish to be involved in the decision-making around the naming of any public realm spaces within the central city and that was that that will pick up the issue that sparked off the discussion alright would someone like to move there Paul second it Jonnie any discussion I'll put that oh so I just wanted to hear 20 around the boot still item a number eight removal the trees in Colombo street Sarah thank you for your involvement was involved with it and I understand from Jane perfect that means the council will get information to to confirm what the discussions that you've hit with council staff and I understand the letters now those trees have been indicated in the space that has been consulted on currently inaccessible city part to the current consultation stuff that's happening yeah it's those trees information will be coming to us as a council or to the new committee good okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now on to the 17th of September
Now and I presume again Jana you'd like to move that and Paul would like to see conduct yep so Sarah was in touch with me just to ask that that this item could come forward as a part because it was a partay rather than wait for another month to get it on the agenda of the council so I happily agreed so would you like to speak to it thank you and the summer community center and library museum rebuild theirs now budgeted and as underway with the planning we're very keen as a community board to maximize community involvement of us and would like to set up a joint working group and it was recommended by the joint community board and community committee meeting several months ago and so it will be really good to have community involvement at this level to have it resource in to get it underway as quickly as possible so that's why that's needed to come to the meeting today yep so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that thank you very very much okay and now we've
2014 there any issues there none okay moved Paul seconded yani I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried now you hit another one that somewhere else on the chairpersons report page is ready I'm proposal to take
And item 12 you yes we had we had some issues around this as well but it was just a matter of process so so you're saying that this is even though you've resolved to approve the removal that that may in fact be reviewed it may change yes Pauline had a response from Jane Parfitt with some questions yesterday and will come back to Council as a part a for Carroll Park approval and so obviously the trees will not be addressed until their decisions made in the US that's right oh good good okay well that's that's very helpful because I think there's been a there's certainly been a lot of public interest on and and and what's occurred and it's it's interesting sometimes processors look like that they straightforward but actually they aren't and you know we need to get better at identifying when they're a sort of potentially other issues and I think the word that I've been using as the word amenity you know that the community has an interest and the trees and where they're located so yep ok so again ref mangie this time and Jamie Gulf moved and seconded is there anything else that you wanted to raise not reading it right now Al's on what seems to be good okay I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried Peggy Peggy ferry me community board

F which is the report of the Opera warrior community board and welcome came Richardson to the meeting noting there are no Pat a reports but perhaps you'd like to speak to the to the report itself yes the well there are a couple of things I'd like to say if you come to a car at the moment we are a town and great movement great growth everywhere you go there's something that's happening the roads are being repaired with sewer repairs and upgrades we've got the echo Museum on its way the we've also got an integrated family health center that's moving much faster than we anticipated and maybe looking at 2016 opening but things are working very fast and echo at the moment and we're looking forward to a cruise ship season the first cruise ship visit was cancelled the ship was not an conditioned to sail around New Zealand so it's coming later in the month but we are a community that's got a lot of pressures on it from work that's going within the I actually go and back and look look through these minutes well there is an exciting email that Jane just gave me as I walked in the door here and it's um as a result of that first deputation that we had on the air on page on page three so Jane I just wondered whether you would like to say what what what's been given to us as a community as a reply to of something we're very delighted with piece of paper with the details so I'm I'm happy for you two all right okay well and there was that has been discussion about GF engines property in a Curragh that's on the banks furniture track as involved with conservation area and there were problems and issues with his his Road and this morning was an email that's come through that yes the council will look after and maintain this road and repay him some costs so that was a very positive outcome for us we don't very often hear of things but it's good to hear that well went through the agenda and there was a bit of you know concerned that it was a Part B issue and we were worried that it might get lost in the system so that's fantastic many thanks whatever all around really appreciate that so then if I just we just go to the last page and just on page six Tecopa Nikki reserve management plan advisory group now this is a group that's working at looking at raising the profile and putting a management planned around the area takapuna key is very special two-night tahoe it's very special to a new COO it's a place as important as maybe as Waitangi it's Canterbury's Waitangi area it's on the foreshore on the far side of the bay from greenspoint in a Curragh and it's where the council have a sewage treatment works at the moment so we're working through a program to remove that work system from there and redirect it but the whole area now as we're working towards national reserve status on the site site is very very important I'm on the working advisory group along with a number of other members looking at a management plan for that particular area so it's an exciting relationship that we've got going and I must say that and a number of processes now we're working very closely with my tahoe we're also working very closely with our own anger and we welcome those opportunities of working with them so that's just a couple of little highlights out of there right now will put more and take questions will will get the motion on the table that port be received Andrew Turner move seconded David East so there any questions for pen Ernie thank you I was just kind of puzzled about that whole road is that a private road or it's not a private right and that's what this week there's a public road yes someone went in folks yes and now we're giving the money because they're fixed yes well they put Cole Watson it was basically for a culvert that they put and they had to do it March caused considerable amount of damage and the the landowner and the family had to do it and there's been debate about who's whose ownership of that road was but it's now been clarify is being public right I guess it's really a question for the chief do we have a process in place I mean appreciate this is extraordinary circumstances but do we have a process in place where by other residents of facing similar situations can do things like this or zero kind of policy we need to develop so that we don't get into the situation where after a living we have this kind of big disagreement about who pays for it I don't think we have a policy in place that's been on a case-by-case basis I guess the issue is about identifying which are public roads which are private roads but there the other issue around us is that links to a conservation area yes yeah I guess I was just thinking of places like in my ward or pause ward where you know say we had you roads been you know damaged if people went in fact I wouldn't know that there was kind of an expectation that we were just been Tim council the bill and we'll pay it I'm a little bit worried about the precedent that the spice hit it so it would be on a case-by-case basis and I think that the issue really is that if something like that happens they should account contacting the council initially and do we know if council was contacted in this case the council has been involved in all the way through this process or this discussion council staff have been involved with an all along the way and I am aware of documents that identify the roads that are maintained particular levels on big spinach they all have a category that they maintain to with their sealed with the shingle with their m12 s are cut I'm sorry I guess can't_''_362.02 remember what stages of them is but it's sort of like my name to sort of thing and they are given a particular level of maintenance to deal the list whether it was on the list of roads that were included as council roads or not so we asked the question and this is the reply that we've got there yeah it sounds as if this was an issue around who owned the road and it's been clarified and it's been resolved I think I'm certainly very happy to he it so okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried it's lovely thank you very much and now we have the item
I resolved to exclude the public for the reasons set out on page 41 of the agenda do I have a seconder term scandrett I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and we'll just take a short break while the all of the technical people switched everything off and we'll move into committee thank you
Um Bucky moves ref seconds no no no we're not we're not gonna be naughty yeah yani have you got any more questions had a get to stuff but um I guess the bigger question around urban design so last week we removed our urban design plan change and I just wanted to kind of understand how urban design was going to be put given that we've removed whether we should actually be putting that plan change into the space one because it's pretty important so it's kind of a general question around how do we give a fit to the urban design stuff that we spend a lot of money a lot of time a lot of work on through this submission can we include that into here and the g3 madam chair all of the information all of the work that was done to support their urban design plan change has been incorporated into the chapters that have been passed you through this stage one some of it is still coming in some of the chapters and stage two the only reason it plan changes now not needed because it has been incorporated into the district plan review it's not that the work hasn't been useful and it's not that the outcomes haven't_''_108.619 been put into the district plan review and you've been through all of the urban design elements of the residential commercial and various other chapters through the briefings is there nothing in that plan change 56 that's different that uh swim or even designed them what's in the current proposed plan but my recollection is that we removed some stuff around industrial around and plant violence over certain size for commercial for urban design plan changed 56 proposed requirements verbs for a resource in assent to assess urban design in our assist empathy one business one in business to zones which are and the commercial zones and the commercial chapter is no notified we've essentially captured requirements for an urban design assessment and the thresholds differ slightly from what was in plan change 56 but that been discussed previously and so you may recall before Council's approval of the chapters to raising the threshold so that less consents were triggered and so the thresholds in the chapter going as notified reflects those discussions and so relative to the operative city plan this proposed plan introduces new requirements and those requirements reflect in large part what was in plan change 56 there's only some master plans that have been I think it was some in Littleton oh sorry Boston and little son in the submission can we add the other master plans the exists the plan is notified includes a special web and design requirements with a higher threshold triggering more concerns for some cinnamon littleton and the submission seeks to add to those Edgware and wilson to reflect the other master plans adopted we can certainly do that in the second phase new brighton we deliberately put interface to to consider and discuss with the community what the outcomes they anticipate her and with today it had some engaged with the business community but we'll continue that process and phase 2 when we come to you and include special provisions for New Brighton the main road ferry road bingo what I'm unsure of is how much was in those master plans that related to urban design but if you're happy to do that I'm happy to include it I think it'd be good all right so so why don't we just have a blanket amendment that and I'm sure the mover and seconder would become full with us that that that relevant master plans that contain urban design provisions will be added to the submission yes yeah question of you really as you talked about making a kind of principal statement around I guess some values that we have as a city so things like reducing notification requirements reducing consenting requirements I think that I'm accepting the point that Brigitte made that this is the technical update to our submission of the of the plane it's really the amendments to what we've sent through what we're going to receive though is all of the all of the public submissions and one that I'm particularly interested in and have signaled is the whole of government submission and I think to that I guess the issue I have as it looks quite awkward today making submissions to reduce notification requirements and then at the second phase of submission saying actually we support notification and community participation but these are the these are the amendments that were made after we received the feedback from the two ministers which we are legally required to take into account I'd much rather have a strong statement from the council as a whole on all of these matters when we fire on the second lot but I mean I mean I don't mind having an overall one I mean maybe maybe we could just have a and the and the opening statement of the submission some police state reinforcing the the community's desire for quality room design and Lee and the rebuild of our city and that what you know an opportunity to resolve some of the historic you know sort of happy to be there yeah you know what I mean so will include a phrase on that but do we need to include that as part of the I think include an overarching statement of commitment to quality even design and the rebuild of the city as as as as proposed through the stage one chapters yeah of the replacement district plan yeah but but it's basically in accordance with the desire of people cry she a tremendous it's really to reflect to include an overarching statement yeah that's right to reflect the communitys desire but there would be a why apostrophe s communities desires not the right word but the patient's aspirations yeah yeah the community's aspirations for the city yep right how it's possible to do this because there's a few changes but I am really concerned about the outline development plans removing the notification provision so yeah I don't want to vote against the whole thing because there's actually some limits here that make sense the tardy tardy arms but we're they're removing the public notification around a manometer notification around changes to OD peace I don't support alright so do it let's have a let's have a secret thing that you can it so it's an amendment that that we remove that we remove that the provisions that but sanam eminence is that council removes the approximation proposed submissions and regards to reduced notification requirements for changes to our own development plans okay so you're moving that do we have a seconder that Paul all right so too narrow open the whole thing up for debate um I just I'll be very simple because I think I've made this point but the lessons I've learned from a few few years and local government particularly around planning is that people like to be involved in planning processes when things are finally agreed with apps or an environment call or through a council process and outline development plans are put in place that is part of a collaborative process to weigh up to different arguments and I think it's really important as we go forward as a seed that those those people there participated in those planning processes where things change have an opportunity to be involved in the process it doesn't always mean they'll get notified to those people that do consider to be affected then actually you get a much better outcome we eat together rather than having this group excluded and I just again remind you of the cases like the gnomon subdivision the changes to the outline development plan and the way that that process happened if it had been notified at the start I think possibly we would have saved ourselves a lot of energy a lot of resources a city and we would have been able to weigh up the different competing interests so I just you know fundamentally disagree with removing the notification requirements for communities to be involved in planning that as and again I'd refer to pyramid as being probably not the best example to use of what we want to see in an outline development plan as a city and any encroachment into removing even less public community from larger developments I think is something you know which we would expect the community we should expect the community be able to ever say so whether it's very made whether it's his curve whether don't support reducing these notification requirements okay all right David East just probably a point of clarification maybe staff might like to answer what impex well this is the debate part we've already passed the questions sorry is there anything I was just concerned about the the government's move to amend the RMA and a lot of it is trying to reduce the number of consents that are notified and what impact that this amendment would have on that on the general thrust of what's being proposed an RMA reform so I'm just not too comfortable with the thing at the moment all right so the so I'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that's carried go okay all right we have to remove all of the submissions and regards to the reduced notification regarding the outline development plans just absolutely beyond comprehension anyway no it was a clear-cut vote but I mean at least people didn't realize they were voting for the amendment right they did right so I'll put the whole no that's carried thank you sorry about that right so I'll move that we
Any outline development plan in the district plan can only be amended by plan change so if someone applied taking the belfast example the developer could decide that the alignment of the road that runs through that zone is different to what shown on the outline development plan and apply for results consent to do that yeah but what we're saying is that resource consent to shift the alignment of that road doesn't affect parties other than the landowners within that area I perfectly understand that yeah and I encourage you all to think about what happened with noble there was a whole issue about the the road layout being changed and the neighboring people were really upset because it wasn't publicly notified and it impacted on them not in that specific development but further up the road to an adjacent development so if those people adjacent to those areas are now excluded from being able to participate when things are changed it seems like a real get but I mean I think I was really trying to when I read through all the reasons that have the submission that supports the minister's statement of expectations which I personally feel very uncomfortable about there's a number of other examples we made a decision right we would we would reference the statement of expectations is we're legally required to do what we made a decision to reference the statement of expectations is that there's really a meeting so there's a really three reasons why we're putting for these amendments one is that there is those statements of expectations that we reduce notification requirements there's also in the in the current operative city plan these provisions which precludes notification or written approvals and to now remove that to open up the ability to notify an application really goes down the path of increasing potentially the notification requirements or leading to more applications being notified and the third reason is that looking for these rules for instance Road setback we don't consider that to be affected persons other than where it's opposite a residential zone so taking very mean for example there's a setback required of 10 meters from the and industrial most of its industrial zone land and not standing some of the thing occupied by commercial activities but we don't consider that an application that of a building and treating into that 10 meter setback should be notified to a wider area I I mean I don't know if I were just about against this whole thing but you know if you took theorem it as a really good example the local community and the people that use that area it's got poor pedestrian immunity or cyclist immunity it's got you know it's really not a showcase of a modern development in terms of access in terms of amenity its exact reason why people get upset when they see a nice plan when it goes through a plan change or our own development plan when it goes through a consent and then all those things that you know try and provide some balance to the use of that that space for the community are done away with without any notification people get quite upset so you know I I mean um yeah I as if it's your private property do what you like in regardless of the effects on other people outside of your private property those people don't have rights to be notified or involved and I mean I fundamentally disagree with that so maybe it's best I just vote against it well I mean is there is there an argument that that there may be landowners affected by a change to an ODP that are not within the ODP area is and the people that lived above the noble subdivision in circumstances where an outline development plan specified the distance for instance that a board should be set back from the rib from the boundary of that adjoining neighbor then yes but these outline development plans for Belfast for theory made for North Hall as well don't go into that detail and don't specify those matters they're concerned with the location of public transport facilities are concerned with the location of a main road through that zone that in some cases specify the location of storm water facilities but the if we felt that there we're certainly wouldn't be putting these amendments for to you right thank you madam chairman also say that these submissions relate only to the three outline development plans and the commercial chapter there is another chapter coming to you in stage two regarding future urban development areas yeah and there are much stricter stronger rules in there to support the outline development plan and that might be of more concern I think when it comes to you in stage two so are there any other questions that people here have you got many more because I might break from morning tea and you could give a list of questions to staff and that might hurry up the process I just I just wanted to get a kind of sense I know it in here that um you've added rights road in which was something we actively caught without and discounted to the office parks which one page 155 so that's quite a significant change so I just I wanted to kind of understand you know the significance of the submission in terms of changes that have which one of you took the ferry I mean the policy Trek signing change saw by the council de 38 topic we don't lean fronting rights road on the northern edge of Eddington Raceway yeah avoid the development of new office parks blah blah blah and Ed rights road after the show place so we had that discussion as a council we ruled that out but now you're saying we should put it there come so I'm just trying to understand how many other issues have we discussed that we've taken a position that you're now changing through the submission process I think if I take you to page 167 which shows the map of the area on that on that plan there's a large red circle rights road is the road with an orange line on it which continues then in the southeast direction and the gray area on that map is beddington Raceway now on the north side of that in turn Raceway there's land that's currently zoned in the operative the city planners open space and over recent years we're putting forward in the submission now is that the planning map should be corrected to reflect what is developed on that site and to zone it as an industrial office zone in the same way that we've zone hazeltine business part the same way with showplace so to recognize the existing area that's developed for offices but not to allow for further extension of that office development around the edge of the reading eddington raceway I understand what you're trying to do in fact I was the counselor at you know six months ago or three months ago that see it why isn't this included but we made a conscious decision not to include it we were told that they could apply for existing use rights because it had been subject to a private plan change so what I'm trying to understand is how many other things are in here that we have made conscious decisions not just not to do that a now you you're asking us to change your mind on front from memory that that discussion we had several the south along rights road and the fact that been for a recent plan change to zone it industrial which permits officers and they haven't yet developed that land and the discussion was whether that should be where we should in fact provide for office use within areas that have been for a recent plan change correct me if I'm wrong and in response to your question officers had not undertaken to undermine any of the decisions that were made that by far the majority of the submissions are corrections or clarifications and much of it was signed off on the fifteenth of August when the council signed off the plan to go through for notification and that's why I've written though and 4.3 of the report the nine more significant and submissions that there are whether or not you want to go through those madam chair is up to you but certainly the majority of all of these submissions are technical and either correction or clarification nature so there are there other ones that you want to raise or I just have a general concern of other things in here but was it worth while breaking for up morning tea and you can have a chat to staff yeah I mean I yeah that's that's why I still don't_''_581.55 I think it's hard with I was hoping we'd have a workshop on this because it this one actually it was it was on the agenda for the council meeting last week and people have had a whole week to raise these issues I'm you know it's it's it's fine to suggest a workshop now but it's too late last week was a workshop but that's oh no we didn't_''_602.88 we asked for it to be delayed until this extraordinary meeting because people had only received the information the day before and hadn't had time to absorb it so well why don't we break for a morning tea and we'll come back and deal with it after that so we'll resume at quarter past eleven thanks
The next item on the agenda as the council submissions on the proposed replacement district play in stage one I have an additional recommendation that I want to to make an in regard to this one which is that approve by now I might need some help from sup on us but approved by round robin which is essentially that we will circulate it and time for the submission but as a council we would like to make a very strong statement on behalf of our communities to the hearing panel hearings panel because you know we hand over the district plan and we don't receive it back until it's completed we would like to really emphasize the elements of the strategic directions chapter which emphasize our communities desire for quality urban design and the rebuild of our city and to emphasize other aspects of the really the principles that have guided us on the work that we've done and to emphasize to them that that that probably that there is a concern that with all of the stresses and strains that people are under at the wider community you know you know that we've received and so we want to kind of place that on record that these are the that these are what lie behind and that we're speaking for our community not for you know some sort of you know sort of planning paradigm and morning councillors she you think you I think that that would be a great idea may I suggest though that that may be best placed to do as a feather submission once once we know all of the submissions that come in because for example I'm aware that there will be a hold of count a whole-of-government submission and it will help yeah impacts on all of the various chapters generally this first round the spin ultimate meeting that we're having on submissions as the second to last step the very last step or input that this council has before as you say it goes off shores and disappears to the hearings panel until decisions are made the very last step is fear the submissions where the council can make comment on original submissions what is already the council's plan so we've already approved it to go through and be notified that's why this round of submissions are technical purely technical for the most part simply to make corrections or clarifications but the further submission rounders when it's a good opportunity to the input council's final sort of stamp on on the submissions room so what's the time for that ok and they close on the six of november I have talked to the staff who organized your committees to pencil and a date on the fourth of november for that final submissions process right are further submissions it is a very tight timeframe the these submissions or the original submissions are to be made publicly available by the 22nd of october then they're open for 10 working days for further submissions so we we are actually looking at the submissions as they come in and taking note of where issues arising so that the staff here who wrote those first chapters can offer suggested recommendations to you for a further submission of considered necessary and then what round how how quickly could you have for us I mean are you able to sort of kind of provide us with the sort of an ongoing sort of highly will you know these are the submissions type things I mean I'd be really interested in having a briefing note that's not as long as the whole of government submission but a briefing note on the whole of government one with the flavor and the darice is is we will turn that around as quickly as possible and what has happened is the norm across the whole of New Zealand as the future a few submissions trickled in the first couple of weeks and as you know they're open for 20 working days for weeks now they're starting to flood and and the biggest ones usually come in at the very last day which is what I'm expecting possibly for the whole of government submission and legal submissions so we will turn that round as quickly as possible we need to anyway to be able to have them available to the public that we also as soon as possible for your approval of that through this machine I saw your statement I think with yesterday or the day before you know sort of reminding people to get their submissions own because it was we are concerned that the public themselves really ought to be making submissions that the process is for limb that's good yes I might put out another submission next week it closes on wednesday decimal places on the eight years yeah right thank you yani we've just been given this um happen I see rather alarming map around tsunami inundation areas which sort of wipes out quite a lot of but a lot of our ward exhale on the coastal community they just would be quite useful just to hear actually what this map is for we I was under the impression the other day that there was still so we risk modeling that had had yet to be completed and done so yeah I just really wanted to understand the implications of what we've just been given and I think it's important publicly for you too absolutely you have in front of you or you've just been given out an extra two pages which have two new submissions on which weren't in the report and the one regarding that map that you're talking about and I will ask Scott here who's the author of that chapter to talk to this but the map is replacing a whole lot of words that were originally in the district plan and we've had feedback from people that it's much easier to understand the Met than it is the words but so if you look on the very first page of the handout that you were just given it's the first submission hi Scott would you like to speak the origin on the origin of the map is essentially the report by the Regional Council and regard to a study they undertook last year it was concluded last year in regard to a potential a nun deja Neriah resulting from an earth quake originated originating on or near South American so we're talking about a tsunami and earthquake that would happen on his water that would travel across the Pacific and then come to and basically it could hit christchurch it doesn't it doesn't deal with as I understand it a nearshore earthquake event at the stage I understand that at some point of future the Regional Council will be looking into that at this stage its position and the city plan relates to Sierra's sierra's intensification provisions of the 60 December last year where they notified the land use recovery plan and as part of that land use recovery plan there were a number of intensification measures relating to things like the replacement of two houses for one or the enhanced development mechanism or the community housing redevelopment mechanism now a part of the exclusion areas on those were the tsunami areas was this tsunami area taken from the Regional Council report in terms of the study or the work that were there council officers have undertaken in the last in the last year or so and regard to their potential and intensification measures additional to those and phase one we've we've used the same criteria that we feel are at the stage inappropriate for intensification because of the risk associated with the with the tsunami inundation area that's not so we're not or the council is not proposing any additional rules so in terms of structures and those and those sorts of things that soon it's simply a one of the criteria that we use to identify areas that that should not at the stage at least to be intensified because of the risk associated with it is that all intensification or is it just the provisions that came in as probably a nice recovery plan around where you could it's the extra it's the sixth December loop intensification measures and it's one of the criteria that we used in identifying or discounting areas of intensification for an increase in density the format living run until into the living free the residential medium obesity so if you look at New Brighton there's no l3 going into New Brighton well there are existing their existing high density areas there that we that will remain but there's no new question over this is what it's one thing I think to be responsible as a council to give indicative sea level rise mapping in the district plan for me I just wonder what signal this could seem to the communities but by way of future investment there's a tsunami inundation not saleable rhinos that the sea level rise must be included but this domain seems quite alarming know that they're required to under the loop under the loop the intensification provisions do not apply and tsunami inundation label sorry I've taken this to mean that you're replacing words with a masker injured and the words actually referred to the map that was in the ekm website so I don't know I mean yes it's it's pretty blunt we're not sit out like this but that's what the word seat so we're not changing anything that's it's what we're retired I sued yeah davis a game at the seams for the community yeah I know but but the truth is is there anyone who lives on a they're going to get that before anyone else look I just like comment on the map itself and as much as right along that coastline there are anything up to 14 meter high sand dunes which don't really show as being there included in a flood prone area and I think you know the word tsunami conjures up a sort of a 10 meter wave coming and we're talking about a continuous wave coming in and it's flooding not surge wave coming in rather than so it's a flooding area and I think really that whole coastline on the map is there's not portrayed accurately that the flooding actually will come in through the history and then what potentially inundate the area's behind it and it's not showing that actually a large portion of that coastline does exempt from flooding the map indicates really that maybe it's a bit of a blurring between the district boundary and the the hash marks of the inundation area but I don't think it clearly outlines the high ground along the coastline that's think you know it is a worry for people that live in this area in terms of the long-term future when we talk about these inundation areas and tsunami and lowering of of the land post-earthquake so I really like that map to accurately reflect the fact that the for probably a good 50 meters or more inland from the high water Springs mark you cannot flood that area with with tsunami so the map to me is needs needs refinement and and it's clear that you know there are other areas along the coast II particularly Sumner that for that area to be breached it actually requires the the Seawolves and things to be breached you but once the sea walls are breached and it doesn't need to be breached from the front it can be breached from the side and it's got nowhere to run and some that would be someone is actually the highest all right and then I'm just saying that the map itself does not really reflect but we're not scientists and so perhaps if we could get through you is not a mech that we can change it is the mayor that the loop asked us to revere to through through the work that my understand is to be undertaken and to hazard management strategy such a map can be changed or included into a future district plan review or a plan change I'm just suggesting that the map is inaccurate but the map isn't ours and it was referred to in the original paper but anyway Paul and then Jamie concern for me is this is a tsunami inundation from a shelf displacement coupler elavil it's crap so have we done any modeling of a shelf displacement not closed wrong is it obviously this is quite alarming but I would imagine that one closer with it almost reaching from central city that would be would be these these two parts to that I understand that that the Regional Council will be undertaking some further work in terms of it a closer if quake event ensure or just offshore how far a tsunami would go is from that event is very hard to ever be pure suppose us help how much displacement shelf this place when they're actually is to have bigger wave and how how much sir just going to have that's correct but we are very flat so you can assume that be what whistle is not being nice to both logically at night no as I'm sure I'm sure no no no this year there's a potential for the column of water from afar event to be to be larger yeah they're not there in an era of him I think there are there have been studies done on on modern unsure would do and I I've got on my mind one meter one meter displacement at the bog raphy offshore really our fault lines are all cheer lines they're not displacements so the potential for a close action seismic action that would cause a displacement to cause a tsunami wave locally next to nil the nearest one is a slump and in Kaikoura trench yeah would actually cause something that we come down and fire at sumner but directly offshore from our coastline there that because was it good we should we should actually have this discussion and the public arena with all of the factual information and I think we're going to do that with the natural hazards chapter would that be right yes you threw your chair that we've actually had two earthquakes we didn't fault lines we never knew existed so you know I would actually say that what we have what we haven't got we don't really know yeah but Dave's right in the type of it does matter what type of fault line it is so but but I mean we are going to do a lot more work on this as part of the second phase yes we are doing more work and where the coastal hazards work is all in the second phase of the district plan so there's further modeling work being done and you know in response to councillor East concerns the what map you draw obviously depends on what size tsunami you are modeling so in smaller events you're correct not all of those areas would chosen here to map a larger event and it's it's those sorts of decisions which lead to the different maps not going to inundate an average along our coastline at the moment is probably somewhere about eight meters of st. house I don't go to inundate them point of order yeah look I we needed the debate but and and check the questions worth with the staff from a scientific point of view and then the other debate and I'm consumable X into the process yeah but I also I'm just a little bit concerned that people are reading into this more than what it is all of those is that the government has said with the land use recovery plain that these are areas that we don't intensify under our district plan so they don't change the rules under the district plan and they really change nothing there just simply saying the government's not interested and intensifying and these areas that you know that they're more exposed than areas that are aren't marked on people that doesn't mean of a tsunami any old time so they were Jamie and then that was and then Glenn yep thanks given that little some neck or are obviously part of our territorial Authority limits with a med why are they hard is not include once met and what are if you need the implications for those two areas because none of their areas were covered by the loop for intensification and indeed that is one of the issues that is raised in the first bullet point that I'd like to bring to your attention the first two bullet points and a 4.3 of the report we raised at the community board meeting on the steps of September that we have with counselors where the counselor for those areas also considered all sorry the community boards considered that some of these intensification areas should extend out to littleton and wider on the banks peninsula and scott has done a lot for the work to indicate whether or not that could or couldn't happen it is in the district it is here for your consideration as a submission whether or not whether you would like to leave that to the community board to raise in its own submission as something fee and it's probably a you know a question for another day by and I realize that loop isn't and covered in that but I just think with a map like this it's going to raise natural questions around that just because they have post ones they have harbors being part of the crisis that's correct but what I'm suggesting with this map is no different to what you had already signed off in the district plan review all this is a replacement of a met forwards and the plan that you had already signed on yep Glenn do you think you quite happy to have this information at me obviously we have to leave we must but when it comes to that discussion and mapping etc do we include some of those features that may help mitigate their for hazards such as the Jun's he can says that the minimum zhuhai must be seven meters along the coast and up here and not for for them to make up their own minds so you just present them with that what we would do so we would actually met it's the purpose so I mean I'm sure that those things can be addressed when we get to the chapter but the purpose of this map is purely to identify the areas that the loop will not go in terms of intensification so it serves no other purpose other than that and all we've done is replace words with a Mac now the Met has obviously you know highlighted the fact that that would have been highlighted if you've gone to the ECAM website and looked at the map when you and you considered the words but the truth is is that I mean we had a mess of program for considering the various chapters of the district claim that we've already done and I didn't go and look at the tsunami picture but I met but I've seen it before I've seen it more than once because I've often looked at the ECAM website for various's not a surprise but it's but the only thing that it doesn't say is there's what size tsunami ISM modeled on because I think it is modeled on a very high wave of water which is why you know the risks are relatively low and the point that one would make is that is it there's an enormous amount of time given as by way of warning I guess it's just the board presentation yeah that's the concern no we done well I don't_''_1387.79 I don't know the size that he can used it no no I'm sorry we don't know there's some they were behind it we can find out if you'd like to know it would be useful just just for us because I mean obviously this will spark some public interest now but there will be more information coming through on all of these coastal type matters yeah the coastal chapter which is part of socially totally get back but this will be the subject of public discussion as a result about coming up fantastic thank you all right yep well we haven't_''_1428.94 considered that because of this matt is yani so really welcome the opportunity to provide the kind of high-level principles based on submission but when I read through this submission it seems to be taking on board the minister's statement of expectations in reducing a whole bunch of notification requirements urban design requirements and the need for consents which I think is quite fundamentally different to what I would feel as accounts but that a district plan should require so when I look through your commercial and industrial chapters I see a whole bunch of things being removed to give one example outlined development plans you're watering down the ability for people to be involved around notification if there are mended given what we had with noble I can't_''_1487.47 I couldn't support doing that in fact okay so they should be strengthened so what page using the page numbers on the bottom out 144 and watch particular member yeah so if item 40 the requirement frequency it talks about non-compliance of medicine on the ODP which not anticipated to affect persons other than landowners that is therefore not considered protocol to require written approvals or public notification to a wider area we've already agreed to that it's that following it's the wording and the last column that we're eating by way of submission the amendment sort is to run on approval may be sought from other landowners and or the Canterbury Regional Council and respect to the location area for a public transport interchange however any application required but also not require written approvals or be limited or publicly notified to other persons so let's think a judge that's proposed and councils submission in respect of a row 38 which is the Belfast ODP area if I can just comment as you may recall when we came to you in response to the minister's comments we put forward as a response to the minister's comments and number of clauses to introduce that removes the need for notification and doesn't require written approvals and we visited what we put to you then and gone back and reviewed what rules that we're proposing that clause for reflects what's in the operative city plan so the Belfast future Belfast commercial centre for which there's an outline development plan the current operative city plans states that except for landowners and the Canterbury Regional Council there shouldn't be other parties whose written approval is required or that any application and that respect shouldn't be notified so what we've proposed in the submission is really reflecting on what is in the operative planet present time and applying that to ferry meet and the very me doubt my development plan really reflects that approach in the operative plan to the Belfast outlined development plan well I hear what you're saying I guess what I'm trying to say is that the outline development plans at the moment don't work they they fundamentally are flawed because what happens is you get your IDP and yeah it's easy to change it without the community knowing what the changes are changes get put in place and community feel excluded from decisions around the future of their local neighborhoods I don't personally support adding any further tix that gives you know a direction that people should be excluded from participating in ODP I just I can't support that given what we've learnt from noble from very made from other areas we are actually the community have said they would like to be notified of when there are changes because of you know they feel that that's an important aspect of their local neighborhood and I when do we change that how do we change that the the proposed amendments are sort for and consideration and councils submission the bell first ODP area that ODP defines masters such as the location of the public transport interchange within the site as well as the root of the road that runs through that zone but you consider the surrounding context and you've got a railway line on one side you've got a commercial development on the north side of that zone you've got a state highway on the west side and the effect of parties in respective where the main road goes and where the we're not preventing the notification to those landowners or to the regional council we're saying that someone that lives half a kilometer away northwood shouldn't be notified on where the road goes through that zone because it's really a matter for council to assess and determine what is the most appropriate alignment for that road and if you get in the process of notifying all parties or a much wider catchment then that leads to a potentially longer process and more costly process when in fact the effects are going to be limited to what's within that zone I can understand no I don't understand the point that you're raising the requirement for consent is triggered by one of the following non-compliance with an ODP non-compliance with an approved development plan a non-compliance and not identifying matters required as part of the development planets all subject to the approval of the ODP surely that's that's only control of the council at that point don't doesn't the council sign off on the OTP
Well how about how about how about matters referred put it put into communities Housing and Economic Development matters referred under parks and open spaces from the from the Environment Committee so that the community committee has the delegate has the authority to to receive a paper on referral from the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee yeah the main issue with parks really is is that we give back from fee because maintenance so I do think that it should parks irrelevant what they are should fit under the Environment Committee I mean I don't know what other people's thoughts are but your for instance the classic one of sports fields with regards to length of grass general maintenance of them so I think that should be going to the Environment Committee there's Michael's just to just to clarify we wanted as simple as possible formula that's it at the right place it's the bottom line would look we're coming up with some wordings about we are there us over overlapping responsibilities the chair so a general statement at the and the and chairs of the committee's will determine which committee as the appropriate committee to consider the matter how's that David let's make a comment under the extra notes there on a point see that that particular meeting there is really specifically for the irons accreditation we're not worried about any other items of responsibility for their committee yep we're there are overlapping responsibilities between committees my point but really what I was trying to do was provide the public in the community a sense of wheat ago so just having listened he it doesn't really help that such as they go to the Environment Committee and if there is an appearance of an overlapping assured then the chairs get together and decide so they'll start with the Environment Committee their cover pacsun yep that was put on that hasn't been discussed as the one that was discussed earlier that we are suggesting an amendment to the district plan review subcommittee that it has a quorum of three as a yes to half its members yes an additional amendment that put up there now under with the district plane so not all councillors are going to be able to get the air and I don't want it to fall over for want of a quorum it's an important piece of work we also just said after he be part botanic gardens as well because I think they're two quite distinct they've both got management plans but I think it's good to just provide them yeah okay so people quite clear that a hagley park and and the botanic gardens yeah and the christchurch by tena guns yeah as opposed to the other law as for ions or okay meats from to it to ensure that the irons reporters able to be received is that right I just wanted to make it clear that we weren't expecting a thoughts from the resource unit and many other reports that would normally come to that meeting with just a specific yeah okay that the rig that that a special meeting of the regular regulatory and consents committee yeah yeah Oh extraordinary rather than special all right okay so and I think so an a it says note that the activity management plans timetable was indicative only and that Monday sessions will not start until 10am to allow time for the council and formal sessions the reason for that is is that we've got we want to reinstate some meetings with with ccd you Sarah which we have on Monday afternoons they're very valuable and we're also going to look for a Saturday where we could just you know take take a large chunk of their activity management plans then just work through them I think that I mean I know that's unfair on stuff but I think just getting them off the plate would be would be preferable from everyone's point of view so if we could find you know a group of activity management plans that would really break the back of these then I you know whip yeah so we'll find a date that is suitable work it out with you guys but I think I mean we recognize how urgent it is so but I think that the the numbers of meetings for the district plan review meetings so there's just yeah we'd like to get clear as many away on it on earth on a weekend as we possibly can and then I think that will alleviate the pressure no I can't promise that I can get Sarah their next Monday as soon as they can we will do that but at what it does is it just says that they are indicative so we're not signing off on them as agreed meeting times right so three more okay well I'll move that do I have a seconder Phil Clearwater any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much thank you the new
And we move now to the adoption of the revised terms of reference for the 2013 2016 council tomb and that's on page three of your agenda and we're just making some changes to the schedule d which is the image but I think that I just want to speak for a minute on this page here because I think this page actually does indicate to people the intention of the council so for all of those thousands of people that are watching online at the moment if you'd like to flick up to page seven on your on the internet of the agenda then it will identify for you really the substance of the changes that we are going to be making today I hope so the Committees of the council instead of eight counts the council committees they become for so in fact we're having the number of committees that we have we have communities Housing and Economic Development all sit together we have regulation and consents committee as as it was reinstated strategy and Finance Committee drawing together the strategy and the finance council and as a good model for us to adopt and then infrastructure transport an environment and what I've really liked about this process is that we have a well I guess from my perspective I've been able to observe as a mere the strengths of my colleagues around the table and I think that we have managed to develop what what I would call a matching resilience framework with the resilience framework that we are developing as out of the 100 resilient cities network so it's a very good model because what it does is it says that you can't separate community from economic development economic development does not exist for any other reason other than the community supports and housings there is a as part of that commitment to the overall overall well-being of the community we know we have enormous challenges in that regard regulation and consensus obviously a core critical part of our core business as a council we have to get this right we know the consequences of getting it wrong we've got irons coming back here next month and committee that is incredibly allude to the detail of ensuring that that their activity is up to scratch and able to have the accreditation reinstated about great comfort with the quality of councillors sitting around the table strategy and Finance Committee that's a change to the way things were before councillor mangie obviously stays and the role of Finance as the deputy chair of this committee but the overarching strategic role that's what the with the mere hate talking about myself in the third person but there you go and and the so I do see that it's an important body because what it does is it brings together the chairs of all of the committee's so the strategy and Finance Committee has overarching connection with each of the committee's and I think that that will give it considerable strength and by tying strategy with finance we actually finally get the the disciplines sitting alongside the decision-making on the strategic directions and I just honestly think that this is going to be an incredible committee I'm sorry now ref but you're going to not there obviously as the Deputy Chair but also still maintaining your leadership role and finance and I'm very grateful to you for the work that you have done in that area as well infrastructure transport an environment again that's bringing together the core functions of the council and and again I think you know counselor Clearwater has taken a lot of leadership and these areas and I think will really bring that committee together now understand that you're agreeable to start beating at eight o'clock in the morning so that people can get to the later meeting if they want to and I'm very grateful for that as well and so the committee's then report to the council or will have delegated authority to make decisions and there are some that we need to look at in terms of some of the decision-making that will be delegated down to a community board so we're going to get to that paper next and I hope that we get our staff working on a proposal that will enable us to think strategically about where've got great confidence and the structure that we're setting up here that we can delegate more to the individual committees and in fact as a result of that delegate more to the community boards as well so that's going to be the next stage of the process sitting underneath the committee's the working groups task forces in forum some of them already up and running the development forum I think has already had a couple of meetings and the feedback that I've had has been hugely positive it's about engaging out externally with the community in that regard the development community and the response that I've had has been incredibly positive and I think this new way of working engaging governance alongside staff alongside the community that that that you want to engage in a particular issue will the strength of the new process going forward and in that regard I just want to comment on the housing task force which canceled Livingston will chair again the concept of bringing people together around the table bringing people to the council but also the going to get us the real lift that we need in that area so I'm really looking forward to the response alts of that cancel the lonsdale legacy projects and business recovery I mean you've already proven yourself and your private life with the restart more you know the idea that we want our community to have legacies from what would otherwise be the memory of a disaster that's to me why we're here so I'm really looking forward to you providing that sort of link point to get the legacy projects underway and business recovery not just in the CBD you've already proven yourself in their area but New Brighton and sand Albans and you know Sumner and all those other places where there are small business communities looking for some leadership and support from the council and that's a really important role so I want you to bring other councillors with you and involve themselves and involve themselves and those sorts of activities council the chin with international relations you know there are so many projects within the international relations field a function last night on Antarctica but then I went to a Chinese banquet rather late for chinese national day and the point was made you know in five and a half thousand dollars was fundraise for the for the people and yunnan province who experienced a tragic earthquake in recent times and you know I was reminded of how much support we got from our sister studies at the time of the earthquake but then when you think about our sister cities we've harm incredible opportunities with a connection to China around education and around Science and Technology their universities linked with ours you know this there are amazing opportunities gansu province with its historic links through reawy alley when you think about Seattle and that the real potential for the technology of Seattle and the technology of Christchurch to be part of our future you know there are incredible opportunities around international relations so you're a big task in front of you but I'm sure that you're up to it and you just bring other counselors on tight as you need you'll be working externally on so many different projects that I I think you'll be very busy the development forum I've already referred to events and festivals you know term c and roads already had a background in this area but I know that his knowledge personal knowledge and capacity to work with others will enable us to see events and festivals probably divided up into the different categories you've got your small community festivals and they really ought to be organized by the community for the community with the support of their counsel but then you've got the strategic ones the ones that are part of selling christchurch or seeing Christ Church as a place that things happen you know I think it's happening as the phrase that we're adopting to put 2015 with the world cup and crooked and the under under-19s you have for under 20 and those of a fifa world cup under 20's yep so you know that that's that there are incredible opportunities and but that has to link to not just with events and festivals but you tourism the International Education the and and and you know all of the Antarctica stuff in all of this all comes together as part of a picture of crash each and you can see that there are other colleagues around the table that you need to draw into into that process as well I no injuries got a particular interest in the in the tourism side as well the mural quality regulation reviewed task force now counselor lonsdale I asked Paul to do this and it's my it's one of my babies I've got two babies and I've got him doing one and yanni doing another one that mural quality regulation reviewed task force now and I drove people but that's when I was minister of commerce and small business because I used to say that the best thing that I ever did as a minister was the quality regulation review and what it was was going out and finding from finding out from business what were the barriers what were the barriers to business growth and it was interesting because there was a huge town the beginning of town wanted to have quite broad frame works within which to set their own rules as long as they got to the end a safe workplace the particular you know safe food etc as long as they had though you know proper properly established milestones that they wanted to set their own a principles-based approach to the rules but when we got to the when we got to the small end of town they just said tell us what to do and we'll do it and it was that they really wanted strict rules that they could just follow and yes it was a tick-box mentality but actually when you're running a small business you haven't got time to sit down and think about things you actually want somebody to tell you how to keep your business safe how to keep your food safe how to meet the certain requirements without you know falling over and what I found is that regulatory bodies would people would go to a regulatory body and they would say can I do this and they would be if that's ok but we'll come and tell you if it's not after you've broken one of the rules and that was that that was very much an osha approach you know and I want us to be as a council and we've talked about the can-do attitude help people comply compliance must be the outcome so why wouldn't we help them from the outset and perhaps take a slightly less risk-averse approach around the regulatory side of things and help people deliver safe food deliver safe environments and meet the regulatory requirements that we are obliged to support on behalf of our communities but do so in a way that minimizes the red tape so Paul that your job and the skirt and rebuild a line alignment working group yani that this isn't the one that's my baby the next one is but this one is it's one that you've raised so many times in this forum you've said over and over again that we're missing opportunities I couldn't agree more scoot as conducting a work horizontal infrastructure but they are doing a big chunk of it they're halfway through and it's it's not too late to do this I wish that we had done it sooner but to align the work of scoot and our rebuild ambitions I think is absolutely vital so thank you for taking bed up now now to my baby which is the citizen participation and representation review working group I believe that this is an amazing opportunity for us to be talking to our communities and asking them to define themselves as communities to look to who their neighbors are to see who they share their assets worth and enable them to think about becoming part of a participatory planning environment rather than one that simply as top down from the council so that and participatory planning and participatory democracy that's the the direction that we want to head unto and so citizen participation is an absolute key to that so again a huge responsibility Yanni and and thank you very much for taking it up Pauline's probably drawn the short straw around land drainage is why you're perfect for that role but the thing is is that I mean you you know you represent an area that has got enormous challenges that's not to say that other parts of the city don't as well but I know that you will engage others from your committee and and wider is necessary to make sure that we've got really good oversight from a governance role in terms of the land drainage recovery program and the public transport working group of course is a pre-existing working group and on a regional sort of basis but this is really to get the public transport focus right and it may even extend into that sort of active transport area as well because I know that there's a lot of work being done in that area and we really do need to ramp up in response to a lot of concerns that are our communities have so thank you for that the second tier committees and subcommittees of the council obviously there's and there's a number ones there but the one that I from the way that it was before I've got councillor Jones cheering that but what the submissions panel will do now which is different from what it was doing before is that it won't just make submissions on formal documents so when the government introduces a bill and call for submissions it won't be just focused on that sort of formal process but also we will be inviting the submissions panel to make informal submissions or even proactive submissions on issues and I think that's going to be a real a really good vehicle for the council to have a voice on behalf of the people of Christchurch on issues that we cannot direct but which we hope we can influence so I'm really looking forward to the to the work of that group as well this confirms the other committees that were pre-existing the audit and risk management committee externally cheered excellent process for the counts I don't think that had an external chair before and I'll just mention the insurance subcommittee because that's a very good example of a committee idea around all of these set up and and discharged upon completion of terms of reference which means that we can pick up other issues and and take leadership on other issues as we go through so look thank you all very much for the extraordinary amount of effort that has gone on to making this happen thank you to staff who have worked an extraordinary number of hours trying to bring this together into a format that allows us as a council to meet on a monthly basis as we were before and then to create some flexibility around how these different these different groups working groups will operate so I will I will leave it there and perhaps if we could have staff at the end of the table and and I'll open it up for any questions or comments that people want to make at the stage of I've made a couple of amendments to the staff recommendations noting that the strategy and Finance Committee will will swap on the schedule with Community Housing and Economic Development and the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee will and consents meeting between 12 and one next week so are there any any questions Yanni just to just clarify the terms of reference for the environment and prescription transport committee or the sorry infrastructure environment in transport potential and environment just there would be my preference that hero parts sports parks for example that you've got the community one looking after sports and recreation but you've got the land actually being looked after by the Environment Committee so I just in terms of today where we've got identified areas that we might like to make amendments should we be doing that now or as their ability for those committees to actually resolve that between themselves the two cheers could potentially resolve that or you could potentially put it in both areas and the resolve which part of this part spanning set with which committee I'll take the chair at the committee I would be happy to make adjustments as we go along if for example r impacts issues that came up with but you know specifically related to what happened on the packs or that then go to the other committee or not I think an advantage of having it clear within one committee is we were able to keep track of particularly what happens because the bottom line is often the the infrastructure sort of arrangements and that has to be done and we don't want to miss that out so I just think having them I know there would be other ways of for example delegate them now to to the the committee's committee but I think to adjust it as we go along Woodward best I've had briefly discussions with council Andrew tuna but I'm sure he can speak for himself yeah yeah I mean I'm certainly happy if we can do it within the decision we're making today and then so if we can make the decision today based on what we've got in front of that works and then if we need to make changes or if we want to make changes we can do that informally afterwards I'm sure and I'm certainly happy to take counsel Johansson advices previous chair of issue just to help me out here what sort of issue would more appropriately sit with you know like give me an example of an issue some people over hagley park where they felt really unclear because cricket comes to the community committee to talk about playing cricket on higley park and the environmental impacts it's not clear who dealing with it so through example garden and heritage parts would seem to sit ideally around that kind of cultural and sporting and recreational activity so garden heritage park so I think could clearly go to that new community economic and housing committee as would return at gardens in hagley park it would seem to me along with sports parks so you've got a really clear one one one point of contact where's regional parks I think the bigger part should could stay with environment okay glee park would I mean it's almost like a class on to what sighing that's not yeah but the point is that it's this confusion in the community about which committee looks after peg lee park because their the Environment Committee because it's got its own special legislation I don't think it should sit in the community committee I think it should be under parks and open spaces and I probably agree that garden and heritage pass could shift into so the issue was sports park so that was the other thing that sports and recreation comes under community but sports boxes to a new environment so that I mean that's just a really good example if you think about the activity that happens on piano it is money around big well why don't you put after sports part put a break head I mean if it can be worked out between the cheers that's maybe we just enable that to happen but you know I do think it doesn't make a lot of sense as it currently is just around parks the fact that neighborhood parks are example and the Environment Committee not community boards well why don't we throw it seems to make sense that that we don't divide parks and open spaces so we just leave them a bracket something after parks and open spaces in conjunction with the Community Housing and Economic Development Committee where appropriate or something I don't know what what would what would some weeding be about where you might have a what would spark off a discussion between the two that wouldn't be
Just mostly everyone morning I'd clear the meeting open and call for apologies Abby Jones I don't believe there's any other apologies to Stella Jones will be done by then Pauline moves that that'd be accepted seconded by Phil Clearwater I'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried
One of the matters committee I'll move seconded by Bucky buck is there any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's Carrie
That was kind of development corporation on to the appointment of counsel representatives to the water management zone canaries selection working groups and we need to appoint two elected members each to the crash which we smell turn and sell one by horace election working groups I don't know whether is there any has anyone been working on who these would be yeah I have a question on this because dave east and myself are already performing these roles is there a reason for this you know what's what's the reason why we're refreshing the roles having made those appointments the beginning with council term ah I wonder if it's just the I wonder if it's the timing ah just it just thought that this we've done the Selwyn one hora one recently too okay right it's impt the answer from somebody who knows I it was basically just to UM just to get a couple of names and I guess I was under the assumption that we would need to nominate again I if councillors east and Turner are happy to so so we'll just say reappoint the two elected members yep yep as is it to two elected members to each of the groups it can be up to two so well it's it's art it's our option okay yeah is there anyone else desperate to be on there there appears not to be I shall put the oh sorry I'll move it seconded by phil clearwater I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried thank you crush it stadium trust funding application I'll move this seconded by 50 buck questions oh sorry to that copy of the new recommendations some I understand is that being changed well they are and that bit there up the hood have you not got a copy of that sorry we have Wyatt I've got a copy of it but I've scored on it so I thought you had a whole lot of copies right sorry I thought that because I've been given one before the meeting and I thought there but I was given other copies I thought that everyone had been circulated all right so if just working off the screen at the moment if everyone can read the screen it might be worth just providing some context around why the recommendations have changed and I think mr. engine this morning to cover that off that's because there's a trust they could not return a surplus to the City Council because we're not a trust ourselves or a charitable trust and as such this is now reflective of the same type of relationship that mr. Anderson was looking for and the return comes in forms of repayment of a loan rather than surplus coming back so that's the context behind why the recommendations have changed that became apparent last night so we yesterday so John Folse Elvis I've been here it's been working and very diligently to come up with with this which from my perspective looks quite appropriately ok so we're being circulated now so has anyone got any questions Jamie ok it's really unlikely but I just want to cover off often we the operation of the new stadium does occur later then that's actually quite good from Council as far as security on giving the loan back in more money because there's more passion and trust reserves just just so I'm clear on the flip side of that little unlikely but let's say the state of the new stadium was signed sealed delivered ready to go 2019 that's obviously earlier than 20 22 what sort of position would the trust be and then to pay back what's owed being angry with us thank you and and if they were unable to what position does their lean muscle over fardale Peter on it well the trust wouldn't have the finances to pay for the definition costs 2.3 million they've essentially break even and they wouldn't have the funds to pay for any additional maintenance because that popped into the ice Danny things um my understanding from the information we received that really that the stadium trust wouldn't have sufficient funding until december twenty twenty-five to pay back the loan is that now we specifically said if the stadium was to go later there longer than the 31st of December 2022 could you repay us and they said yes they were very clear about that preacher and that's why I'm not proposing any change to the day right um we heard also that they needed to get consents I think their consent expires in 2016 in terms of the risk of them not getting the consent what would happen in terms of buying the seats I mean if they buy the seats ahead of getting the consent what safeguard do we have that that money is not just wasted sorry yonni I could you repeat that question so my understanding us with the current trust arrangements they've been established for a certain purpose they've got a certain time frame by which the stadium you know is to operate they need to go through consenting process if they don't get their consent so if we haven't got the consents before they purchase the seeds what safeguard do we have that their money isn't wasted firstly were proposing to the surf they purchased the seats the security would be against I've of the seats or they see the other buildings we have are contacted the staff members looking at the the district plan review and they say that rugby league park has been a stadium for a number of years it is unlikely that the necessary consents are regarding resource consent would not be granted so it's a it's a very unlikely scenario Peter and I but peter macdougal and I have looked at the trust asset management plan and their schedule of works we've looked at spire Consulting's peer review of that and we are are happy that the infrastructure will last and it will get building consent resource consent it's highly unlikely that they won't get it through the district plan review they'll be an awful lot of bigger fusses than the stadium if that doesn't happen it's not a big risk it's the final question for me is um in terms of understanding the risk around the timing light of the new stadium I presume state I'm in the stadium trust to set up by government so what comfy can we have there in a you know if it's earlier that the new stadium was built 2019 second quarter as is proposed that this money isn't wasted either the conversations with what Sarah have happened they knew this report was coming up they're supportive of the approach they were contacted initially as a potential funding agent as well for the seating there's no commitment from them at this point that obviously as you know has to be a joint agreement and discussion around time frame this this gives us options this is a set of money that allows us to have that conversation whereas without doing that it doesn't I mean for me to encapsulate this it's a pretty poor commercial contract that's currently there with regard to the seats and the money that's proposed here would enable them to get out of that so commercially it make sense to purchase the reason we're being looked at as really as the thunder of last resort space but we're obviously very interested Thunder of last resort because there is advantage to us to have that option to delay and expenditure of a quarter of a billion dollars and that's really why we're sitting sitting in yeah we we've got no understanding of whether that delay as possible there is no firm commitment to that it's providing us the option to have that discussion so why wouldn't you tie the end of this report because there was a conversation that will have to be taking place within the wider frame of the cost sharing our financial strategy yes right cookie oh well no we'll wait no questions first mle just with regards to the securing the loan against the assets and you mentioned the seating I don't know how big the seton marketers and I don't mean that as flicking because it sounds but I do know for example the Isaac Theatre Royal has some seats that they're trying to find a market for so what is the actual then you are off what you are going not prime quality assets the the trust is working with us to do its absolute best to give counsel the best level of security you are quite right these are secondhand temporary seats these are boxes that will have had a lot of use but will still be functional so the assets are functional if we can find a home for them are they the same as securing your against a good bit of land or a valuable commercial opportunity no we are dealing with a temporary Stadium but we're also dealing with a trust who are doing their very best to give councils and comfort in their investment all right so any discussion okay and this seems to me to be absolutely logical and sensible to go ahead with what's happening there's Stadium in date at the moment was intended to be 2017 the Sarah report makes very clear that this new stadium will not be in place by 2017 so whatever we do we need something that operates as a stadium for a period of at least two years probably a lot longer but at of achieving that outcome the good thing is that we have we actually get the money back and we have we create some options in the city for events and for a stadium that may be there for quite a lot online yummy yeah I'm I'm really supportive of this approach I you know want to do this as part of our annual play I think it made a lot of sense we can't go back and unravel that bad deal to spin so much on leasing seats but it is a shame but we're in this position and I think the sooner that we do this the greater leverage we didn't have around the timing of the major new stadium in terms of whatever happens there I do have concerned that we not time this into that process I think it's really important that we try and get a River process with government going forward around us because we are actually quite linked it's a 500 million dollar project it's already been deferred two years by government we've never agreed support it the longer we push up than 500 million the more money we have to spend on some of the other things that are key priorities so you know I am concerned that we're not trying to extend this with the commitment from government now there is a very real risk in terms of not doing that that if things go as currently planned we basics been this 2 million for two years and probably the chance of getting it back in 2019 is pretty limited if you read the information that we've got so I think we need to make it really clear today that you know we're supporting the stadium trust we're supporting it in its current location but that there does have to be an urgent process to work through with government over the timing of the new stadium that they've proposed through the blueprint I was happy to add december twenty twenty-five and here I'm not sure where we got to in terms of the 2022 but I would like to signal that I think we should be raising are going to see some time frames because that will actually give some certainty and if you look at the figures that we've been given again I know that we've had a deputation this morning but the issue is around the demolition cost and it's really clear from the figures we've been given that 2025 is the is the first year that the loan could actually be repaid if you take into account the demolition costs so I think that's the contract but a lot deferring or doing everything we can to defer the 500 million on the new stadium this is a small investment that hopefully buys us time and buys us opportunity to do the other things that are more important so I'm happy to support it Phil 10 David I just like to say that that Jim Anderson representing the stadium trust was really clear that in fact that the 2022 time was absolutely worked for them and in terms of how they're placed because councils be weird in fact the stadium trust the statutory time finishes up in 2017 to consider this is a good investment and so the loan for these seats yeah can allow the stadium to continue for even the foreseeable future but in a fit in effect the timing of renegotiating of the other our arrangement with us with the truck with the trust can be reviewed really at any time so I think this is a is a great great value for money and I think we're lucky that in finger in this position to to have a temporary stadium like this at a time of a Lewis quake recovery when we have no other money Tim thank you Isles sorry sir yeah I'm sorry I have a speaking with you were out of the temple yep don't think so anyway look I'm just looking at a food just with regards to those savings and operating costs with this two million dollars through to 2019 would be in excess of two and a half million dollars not with that saving can add value to the venue and then looking past 20 19 due to whatever date that maybe will allow very good investment and down think you joined the team for that with okay cheers for making it alone people well David thank you I also will be supporting the recommendation I think it's a very good process for the trust I just like to to know that I feel that the any suggestion of trying to put a date Theon 2022 is not appropriate at the stage the trust did also make the point that at the point at 2022 there may need to be an extra investment in the facility at that stage two if it was to go further we also have to consider the rugby league considerations the first least expires in 2016 and the second one and 2021 so I think the way this document has drawn up is very good it gives council quite a lot of room to maneuver and I would certainly will be very group okay good I'll put the motion although up you I'm sorry but the debate is concluded so and you've already spoken so I'm not going to call you again missed it resolution so we move to discussion on the resolution so if you want to move in ammendment you need to move that before I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you Nick
Learning center who who would like to move there oh yeah le Jane's Phil Clearwater well then I'll second it just too yeah okay so though what's your amendment well it's been quite contentious and and there's been a lot of really good discussion in involvement with the community and stand the staff at the center but I just think that it would be useful for the report to come back to the new community housing and the economy committee rather than only being delegated to the staff so in fact in effect the committee would sign at all well it is so futuna dog this is to tinder this is not to make the decision well if efforts implicitly in that the decision would get incisional candidates account so I pretty much does okay I'm fine with it okay so Scott do you mean yeah um well Ali had a question just to do on page 24 3.3 points6 the proposals been discussed at cetera et cetera prime consumed from the moa is centered around its licensing requirements now does that relate to that there's a there's quite a lot of different criteria that have been then put it so you know I do think it's important that we do site I think it would be good to just maybe go past the chair of the the new committee and the community board just before the tender document is released just to check the criteria that's being put on based on the feedback that's finger them so I don't think we need to delegate it away from staff but I do think it's probably good that they can just at least site it before it goes before it's printed to make sure that the number of concerns or comments that have been made are reflected in it so you're concerned that the criteria won't be wats to identify it on us well if you look at the number of comments in the key criteria it's really just ensuring that you know that they're aligned to the comments who could who could this be just cited by that's nice ass out of the committee yeah I think that report makes it very clear what needs to be in there you're going to do what the report says if that's what you agree to so the problem is I can't see from this report what the Greek criteria is based on the comments that have been provided I can see the under three there's a lot of comment around criteria does that capture all the comments that have in mind that's that there's the best summary of them in terms of putting them together into a coherent grouping use it doesn't capture I mean there are bound to be people who have comments that aren't captured by that because one person with one comment doesn't make a criterion but this is that this is the condensing that all the comics we've got back into something that Mexico here and hold that a provider might be able to actually adhere to if they wanted to take on this pioneer early learning centers so it's what it is that's what you agree you know on that just with respect to Y on ito I think it's very very clear in here and I don't think he's suggesting and into tude but I have to say that perhaps by suggesting that what is here won't be in the the document does suggest no well then in that case what's in here in my opinion is very very clear and I would actually agree with my hummus oh no I well I'm not a hundred percent sure I mean I'm because it's got to come back to us we'll see the tender documentation you know and I mean if it hasn't if it wasn't tendered in accordance with the spirit of this document then I don't think that we would be signing it off so I don't know if people want some comfort around I'm happy to read the criteria when when when the tender documents but I don't want to read 150 pages yep I'm quite heavy that because council will sign it off then in fact be part of it hey yeah oh but we'll make sure the chief executive will make sure that she sees the criteria before it's before it signed off we don't need a date to be included in the resolution because I'm sure that the team at the end of the table will have good that night but certainly there chief operating officer here's because it was her suggestion yeah very good okay so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank
If I'm dealt with well it's not their number 18 application to the Metropolitan discretionary response fund zoom Bucky back would like to move and seconded by somebody Phil Clearwater there any discussion cushions put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no let's carry pine
15 Housing Committee the facilities rebuild program social housing status update move by Glenn Livingston seconded by Pauline Cotter councillor Livingstone I presume Doogie mr. moon I love it admit ya know prana thinks something for you but I can't boss all day boss ya know like you that no I just like to thank the committee at this point for all their hard work over the last year I think it's been a good block of work I'd like to acknowledge especially Pauline as deputy chair who I asked sort of a long to be my eyes and ears and to give me a good kick along and I think you've been doing there how think we've well as a team also like to acknowledge Vicky's huge and tremendous work over the Accord the entity and the social housing hearings as well enjoyed win with the committee it's been great we look forward to the next incarnation of the committee is part of the puccini anyway with the waiting list with those figures there we'll need an update on the September figure was up a bit on orders are a member at the time and it that list does go up and down over time as you probably appreciate we're very conscious of the closed units and trying to get those open they are being worked on some of them at the moment others going to come back and our comprehensive report next month at that new committee over how best to spend our money the Knightsbridge elaine development continues the roofs are actually on so that that's the first part of that report before the financial status did you want to receive any questions at this point this is Boston I was just joking around fell thank you I've got a Christian in relation to 4.1 and nvm the reappears their tongue in little son just referred to and its really I see that we have to seek approval to proceed with them and I'm just wondering who I'm not quite sure who we need their approval from we talk miss in relation to eq c or does that clearly is holding things up Carolyn to a 4.11 just and underneath the chair right so in terms of the four units under a pier 11 units seeking approval to proceed with repairs that's in terms of the processes and the delegated authorities internally so they're actually what the sentence is saying is they're actually going through the process in terms of getting approval to you know procedure um and I guess like I've previously expressed concern about how long this is taking and that we've got four and repair as a start but that we still have no 20 that in fact could be straightforward repairs and I'm aware that a report is coming but it kind of like is becoming a while so I'm really just one flea that I'd like to move rick an additional recommendation here that we make the surgeon which does well in addition to the recommendations and the report I just like to move that we asked council to urgently commits the repairs on the other 20 social housing units which are straightforward as referred to a 4.11 24 in title Tweety so okay so help what how where how do you want the amendment to well under there's a staff recommendation which on page 2 18 that the committee have confirmed and received a report and I just like to add this to that so it becomes 6.2 and I'll just repeat it sorry at the moment it says that the committee received the report so it's at the report be received and that just talking about oh right pretz Carolyn can clarify that but my understanding is that those 20 those 20 would still be closed is that correct Carolina so the staff who are able to get the advice are not present at the moment but we can get just from the report we can get that from the report it would appear that they're still closed we can build with more application things right so so that the report we're receiving that the council urgently commence repairs on the other 20 so sorry this season the financial implications that on 5.2 that the housing portfolio will be insufficient to appear and place financial pinch by actually making this recommendation so I would like to understand how much it's going to cost to repair all these 22 units not forgiving it we want to see them open but in relation to how much money we have lived in the housing portfolio the Housing Committee we're really aware of the urgency to get closed units open we've been working with stuff to try and get this into the program as much as it will fit in with the budget so you know we are we are aware of that as a priority so I'm wondering if we really need to order it does refer to setting a priority and the existing report and I just wonder whether we should take on board what the deputy chair of the committee sang fell when maybe change it to that that the report be receive and that the council you know expresses again the the urgency and getting the repair program you know underway you're thinking I getting the explicit which is already happening yeah Scott Scott Scott peanut will give us there but it's council expresses that the urgency with which you know repairs must be completed on our other social housing units we've had some meetings with staff aside committee meetings to really prime yeah focus on this too so but I don't know whether you may wish to ask Scott yeah there's little bit that'll be fine yeah so would you like to give us an update thank you yes right so in terms of the the table that you see there we've we've broken we did well with classed 75 units in total as what we think our economic to appear they've been subject to prioritization on a complex basis as well so and then with further broken those down into three categories the units that we consider sort of straightforward repairs those that have a more structural element and those that have a significant structural element of repair to them so with respect to the easiest category the ones that we've demonstrated a straightforward repairs we've got four units that Boyd cottages currently under a pier there units at old ones courts which are currently under appear as well so that brings a total of fifteen closed units that are physically in play being closed unit so physically in play being repaired now and the remainder of those straight forward or peers units that I've defined and they were going through the various elements of the damage assessments with those and developing the sort of a you know the components were those so we're trying to what we're trying to do as well as doing the earthquake repair component I but we're also wanting to make sure at the time that we've taken off all linings that we're you know we're looking at things like insulating and in sorting out those components so that we get the best value for money in terms of that so we're doing that at pace behind the scenes it's not hopefully that clarifies the current situation so that it doesn't like since this was written clearly that more is being done and I'm very pleased to hear there and I basis school very muchly right so so rather than focusing on the other 20 social housing units which is straightforward which is out data then maybe it should say with which repairs must be completed on our social housing units full stop is that okay because then then we're we're sort of just really reinforcing that you don't see with which we need to be acting with your permission Phil I think you were focusing on the closed units actually prioritizing getting the any closed units open that are possible absolutely it is the clothes units because clearly if they can be fixed big and living them and the social housing draws the rent and we can progress yep so it's a closed units and perhaps it would be speak yeah okay thank you Yanni can I can I just check out of the 445 total closed units we've got 75 that our economic to repair yes what's the time frame for getting those 75 repaired we're actually working through that assessment at the moment so I'm hoping to those the first by Christmas that's were working to through to that time frame and with respect to the other ones that are coming in behind that there's a whole lot of prioritization work on those complexes that's going ahead so we you know we're delayed by we're limited I should say by the amount of engineering resource we've got available externally at the moment and we're also delayed by the contracting resource ittle bit available at the moment so I can't I don't have an accurate forecast okay and so how many closed unit repairs have we done since the earthquake I don't have that information because to you but the 75 is the figure is the remaining that's remaining so that we think are viable at this stage based on the information is it you know other resolutions we should pass today that would help you enable you to get those 75 done sooner and if so what would that be oh I think probably you know the the process that we've got currently with the delegations has been've had us we compare what the actual what we've assessed the contractor has assessed the actual cost to prepare against what the insurance repairers and if they're within twenty percent of each other we can get a director approval to proceed with those where that where that delegation will where it's outside that delegation that forces us to come back with a council report as part of that process so that's what you've been seeing concurrently so you know we've bought to counsel the reports to proceed with Boyd cottages we've brought back to Council of ports proceedeth alderans courts and there so it's really that that process and itself that adds probably you know a couple of weeks to write a report and then sort of that process of going through the committee and then council approval you know all up is giving us sort of a two month six weeks to eight weeks period of of getting that approval but ok so if there was a prioritization done on all these 75 you knew that subject to money being would actually speed it up yeah correct so I don't know I get that that's fine as cool so we can we can do that make sure that it's done and then the second thing is there any update on that if you see yes there is but not right now okay but I probably just just add that the of the last units that we've talked about the other 12 closed units with we're looking at reliving those and we're getting very close to repair versus rebuild cost so we're a warn their viability assessment all right I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye there's a place I know that's carried and financial status a general status up to take yeah so that's moved by you second up by Pauline yep all good no no if there any questions you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that's carried and the final oh sorry okay the cheese reportedly accommodation supplement see you move that obviously has that would you like a little bit of rationale for the cs or the we're asking the minister to bring the accommodation supplement for christchurch is a sub-region of area three in line with area one the rents as we know of increased at least forty seven percent since the quakes here in christchurch but the supplement for the cereal for area three hasn't changed since 2005 so what we're honing in on this in our view there's been a disconnect between the that supplement being increased in relation to the quakes the rents here and various suburbs are now on a par with Auckland the suburbs chosen in that report I chose from a press article and there's some months ago at the beginning of the year and use that as comparative data you will notice some of those suburbs and Christchurch are now ahead of some of the Auckland suburbs the CDC report today backs up this report in fact rents have gone up another ten dollars since that the and so what we're asking is that the minister reconsider the accommodation support for that 7.2 comes out of 7.1 but I would suggest we treat it separately we're not quite there yet that we just look at this so I guess all right I tell you what there any discussion any questions yet I just wasn't sure have government previously being asked to raise the accommodation supplement not as not as far as I'm aware but they have been there's been some idiot in front honest and just I mean I'm happy to support this but I do worry that simply giving people more money puts rinse makes rents go up even more rather than it addresses the underlying problem which is I'd lack of housing a lack of read stabilisation I've discussed this with amis welfare office the suggestion there is that if the minister for instances and she's already indicated that that that could be the case that we look for something in lieu such as a winter heating supplement for instance that would be his suggestion it's a different question if we if we raised the accommodation supplement that I think that second guess it my suggestion would be to await the minister's response and then take it from me without asking for anything else yep my comment on that is that that would be a fair response in a normal situation but this is not a normal situation and market is being affected also by insurance companies that are paying for temporary accommodation so you can't take something that would be a normal rationale as you're suggesting out in which normally I would agree with the issue is that the swear in an unusual situation and this would not be a long-term thing it has to be addressed as soon as possible and that's why we're suggesting this you know the CDC report says today historically Christchurch rents have been below the national average we are now above the national average yes a very unusual situation yep till I think that the only kind of like longer-term solution to what council your answers referring is that if there was a clear limit on Reed's but I think to do that we'd ask there so I think that the an increase of the accommodation allowance is a good step at this stage in terms of making them a little more affordable Marines yep yannick okay um yeah I I understand the situation we're in and I appreciate that this is just but one thing that we could possibly ask government to do that try and help the financial burden on people in a city at the moment I dunno in the housing Accord there is an agreement for us to work with government around other other issues other initiatives so you know I just wanted to signal that I think we do need to do some more work around some of those other interventions I again refer to the tenets Protection Association retooled survey which show that there's really four main areas where we could assist people one was the cost of leading fees and moving one was the warrant of fitness one was the security of tenure and the other the final most important one was rent stabilization post-disaster so you know I'm happy to support this today to see this as the only solution actually it should be put in place but it actually needs to be backed up by other mechanisms rather than just creating an incentive for ins to get even higher because the government's just simply going to top up but I appreciate the circumstance that were at the moment I know people were struggling and I know that this is a very short term way in which some people could get relief so will support it I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie thank you the is about the seat s you're just dumb why be separately young or if you included it now I included that when they hire oh yeah oh it's a bit different classy we'll just passed it sorry I'm sorry I I had no no one requested that they be delicately I meet you Nate but that's okay oh oh it's all good okay sorry I suspect the council would have agreed in line with the yeah there's the part anyway to speak on that the reporters a whole be adopted okay may I just think Pauline it's a police she's had to go but she's really pushed her over the pre insulation offer and a lot of our units have been now updated with insulation 264 out of 700 which qualify at the moment growth it's been a great you know a great way to finish off the Housing Committee it was a real chocolate it was rising from that meeting last night yeah great well done okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you
Community committee libraries 2025 facilities plan we're going to defer this and refer it back to back to community boards for for their further input so and I think yani you'd like to move there we're not deferring it we're just sending it to a community yes sorry formal response there's been some informal discussion with community boards but the board's have expressed a desire to have a formal charts to consider it and I think that's really good I think the other reason that that makes a lot of sense has given the decisions from the previous view the studies rebuild prioritization there's a few things that could be added just to give a bit more of a clear up to date picture so I happy to move that this report is formally referred to community boards for consideration yeah and seconded by Phil Clearwater I'll just make the point to that following on from the from the earlier discussion it did go back to Shirley papanui on the Redwood belfast issue and they wanted to have it considered by they go back to all of the community boards for their no not for a decision that this report is referred not to food to the community boards for their consideration for their formal consideration and put the word for and after boards that this reported forward yep right so that's been moved by yanni seconded by full clear water I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the next part a as the perform sorry it's the arts update report and the motion is that the report be received and that be Jana Johansson actually a committee recommendation so happy now so what the reporting received that the but what we wanted was that a formal report prepared that provides information on extending the creative industry support fund to wider than the central see you recall that we've spent a lot of money on doing transitional projects in the central city but there was a desire by the committee to look at how we could possibly extend that out for some other areas is that is centrally funded that's our fun right so I just wanted to also just make brief comment on this report just to say we heard with CDC around you know how good recover Canterbury was I just would like to place on record that I think their creative industry support that the council and the government have provided post-earthquake has been a really outstanding example of a collaborative good positive working relationship and also has made a real difference and impact in our city both locally and nationally and also internationally and we were given a really nice presentation at the committee just to show the different projects that have been as a result of this funding in collaboration and you know I think it's something we should be incredibly proud of as a city so just want to place on that dead on record well I mean get is actually the sort of thing that I I think that we should record formally by way of resolution and that will then enable me to to you know sort of refer to that because I think that we should view because it's a view that I share and it's really important knowing in a post disaster environment that the creative industries the ones that really get their juices going and other ones who absolutely lead often the social recovery but also elements of the economic recovery as well so I just think that it's incredibly well represented so how how would we put their Yanni to capture what you just said it's it's a little bit tricky in that there's really two different groups of people there's the funders just probably the easy job really just giving away the money but that I think the harder job is the people that actually make these projects happen hmm and so I think you really need to recognize both that the contribution that the different agencies have made but also the contribution that a number of local citizens and sometimes not local citizens have made as well so so what are attentive it in one resolution that the council places on record its appreciation for the collaborative approach between what funders and yeah I the wider arts community and what India supporters because it's not just those that are involved in the industry it's their supporters and making our in supporting and supporting and supporting the recovery is that does it that's enough is enough to sort of capture the mood yeah I think it's more than recovery but yeah that's gone well what we had supporting the city post post-earthquake okay and supporting the city post the earthquake yep yep that's great so I'll yani will move that and Andrew second it and we'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or those opposed say no that's carriage and now we move to honor the future tunnel event janna you want to move that thank you this is well who wants to second out who you came for this entertainer I just there was one change that I that I considered that we might wish to make was just rather than being an annual of it just to enter a regular event or maybe just an ongoing event so it was just year but actually the idea of doing it every so often was a regular event although you know I think part of the attraction is that it that's not a regular event so it gives people an opportunity so yeah so um I know that I know that the cyclist would like it closed between eight and nine every Sunday morning but really just to reflect that you know I thought that if it was a real positive for the city and I think there's a real desire for for us to encourage people to get involved necro active recreation and there used to be a regular cycle event I think through and you could skateboard and rollerblade through so there need to be some work done around it the staff advice was that this was the best way to proceed then we try and organize a meeting to talk through what's possible with the people that are you know obviously have the most at stake around making it happen so I'm releasing what about doing that I'm really open minded to what what format did think it was provided a wonderful boost for Littleton provided a wonderful boost for the city and I think it you know it was really something that we should look at doing well maybe you want to add the Littleton community and Tibet because into the into the meeting you know well that's why we had the chair of the two community boards so that it was this was just us to start looking at what was possible and then I think as it progressed you'd obviously involved more people yes I mean because it is a it is a terrible imposition on the poor company when mirrors a shop and poor you know like fought for a lengthy period of time but you know you know I have to say that the idea of having something at the other end you know the you know the wonderful market day they had if you can organize the weather and advance so you know it's a really good idea to ice it to a cycle waste project a major cycle ways and that we will have a so yeah you know it's a really exciting it could be a really exciting feature of the things that we're trying to do as a city in terms of promoting active recreation it's true and but yeah it also seems to me that it's got some wider positive potential so anyway so rather than an annual event we're changing it to a regular event yep all right so and by the council requests a meeting and I mean I'm quite happy for that to be you know delegated to the I don't know the environment transport committee uh or or whether you want it just the the for community that the that's it's really five well I spoke which communities the spread and Heath could not connect it up you cook it was it called spray and Heath kit Oh we'll fix it up and the represent we'll fix that up on the representation review all right so so so that all that then eh well why don't we just delegate it to the 22 yani Andrew to and I think yeah but the board chairs are already there and I just think what Kevin do you want to be able to fill as well with your transport hat on and cycleways and all of that is awesome yeah so and Phil Clearwater yep right and I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carriage and then councillor yo hints and would like to move and who would like to second that resolution that we receive the report Andrew tuna I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you good we're next item
All just a part b report so I'll move that second a poor lonsdale have a chocolate fish award for deputations by point by ribbon Peter Beck and even sweep yep that's right so that you're rewarded by being the second of the motion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried
A section on there and I presume that Paul lonsdale would like to move that and it would like to be seconded by somebody Tim scandrett Yanni Christian of staff who's here for the for this item and I'm very much understand the logic of removing plan change 56 when the rationale previously off council was that it was better that we do that and retain control of that process given the government's view around a reduction of Evan designed rather than an increase so I just couldn't understand the logic of why we would take this out of a council controlled process and put it into the government controlled process given those earlier concerns particularly in light of the statement of expectation that government have put in place through the order and council which talks about significantly reducing urban design controls the the district plan the proposed replacement district pen will be heard by an independent hearings panel so that that panel is appointed by the government and consultation with the council so we don't see that as a government control process as such this work will be integrated with the replacement district plan provisions in terms of the previous rationale which was basically assumed an identical or a similar process that's already been agreed it was thought that given the concerns that governed had expressed about urban design and given what we've seen now through the certain of expectation which have kind of reinforced their iced I just really want to understand why we would suddenly be comfortable with us going into that process when before we wound and because the process is a cheat is that much effect of anything that's gotten worse for urban design rather than then then as it was those decisions will still be made by the panel and the the statement of expectations and my understanding is that the panel must take that into account but it doesn't override the purpose of the Resource Management Act so the decisions will still be made under the purpose of the Resource Management Act so if we didn't remove 56 if we didn't withdraw it what is the material effect of that if we agreed to what is the difference in terms of outcomes in what impact would that would we have to hold separate hearings at the same time that the panel was hearing submissions on the others we would have to hold separate hearings and we would also have to notify it separately though there would be a whole parallel process in terms of concert notification and consultation submissions further submissions and hearings and it may also cause us problems in terms of consistency with the replacement district plan hasn't it already been notified and submissions have already been held the buttons have been received but those those are all that's a plan change on the operative plan and we now have in place a proposed replacement plan right so so it's amending the wrong plane so effectively even if we did this plan change we would get the current plan having the changes be promoting urban design and then what you're saying is the current plan that we've got for consultation because it's different would have no relationship to even design well there may be's right as there as there a chapter around urban design in the new district plan review that we're proposing and if so what's the schedule for that it's not a no there's not a chapter so the urban design the urban design meters are addressed in the residential chapter as well as in the commercial and industrial chapter so they even design meters are go across the plain rather than a chapter on their own all right I think I mean oh yeah I have real concerns about just 36 being withdrawn and I do wish to signal the possible amendment I'd welcome other counselors views and that we do delete it was 20 or 50 60 yeah I mean you can movement amendment of you if you want to so counselor Johansson moves that plane changed 56 be deleted from 6.1 is there a seconder for that view it fails for want of a seconder so I'll put the motion you'd like to speak to the yep yani um thank you um I know when a an odd process with our in council and we've got another process going but I go back to the original and team of doing plan change 56 council had this consideration previously about whether it should be something that was put into the district 10 review as a as a priority in with it should be done through the ladies recovery plan it was of the view and in my opinion that it was better to have it done through a council control process rather than putting a head to to the worm of an independent process effectively become lead by government through through the order and council or through the ladies recovery plans so I feel really strongly that this our community wants good livin design I know a lot of work went into this plan change in terms of 56 this was the plane change it was hopefully going to give some teeth to the suburban master plans that we spend a lot of time developing with our communities and I'm just really concerned to see that we would withdraw I don't have confidence in the new district plan reviewing panel members appointed by government have to have regard to and take into account that we will get good urban design outcomes and so I think basically we've got an order in council process it has put a pretty clear expectation that that urban designers is reduced whereas I actually think we're much better to get this in place in terms of our own processes so it can be incorporated into the existing district plan if you want to look at urban design encourage people have got a bay the street and have a look at some of the new buildings and just look at the kind of lack of urban design and what that does to a select areas that should be at the rebirth of our rebuilding our recovery areas that in the CDC report we heard before terms the objectives of having a well-designed sitting taking the opportunity but it is great if you actually look at what's going back without any urban design control in Central City some of it is pretty concerning and won't do anything really for the benefit of these plan changes it's unfortunate that they're not separate in terms of 61 and 56 I will vote vote against the whole thing again this is also a lot of work that we've done at a huge expense that we simply walking away from and I don't think that's an efficient use of resource I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no record yani johansson against that's carried thank you
Lucky buck will move that the report be received and will be seconded by Andrew Turner and I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no XKE thank you regulation and consents committee again part
Reporters read I just like to highlight a couple of things so one of course was that the whole motivation is focused on the long term plan to make the statutory requirements so that's the kind of priority in terms of the work of the organization obviously the council as well to lean right over it hit be done good thank you you so that the whole organization is really prioritized work around the long term plan to meet statutory requirements and overview to having a draft for the council to consider in terms of directions by December with consultation earlier in the new year just some of the other work though that's going on is particularly around how we enhance concern customer experience both internally and externally and we've got a workshop on that with staff next week actually to start thinking about that but there's a number of things that are already underway so for example as a way of improving customer experience the call center we're targeting and having all staff trained and really the top areas of questions that come in issues and we're well on track to do that but also in the evening shift the call center staff are calling back customers and telling them what's actually happened about their queries for instance around wheelie bins or the rubbish being picked up and customers have been pleasantly surprised that follow-ups happened that actually has been a really useful thing to make sure that thing's actually do happen there's also a collaborative projects between the council and other government agencies have been well received it's particularly around sharing information and the council drop-ins sessions recently held around long term plan district plan flooding and consents well received and I guess an example of how we can actually continue to share information improve our transparency and decision making and we're working closely so that we have much more joined-up communications with Sarah so that communities receiving you know the same messages the same information and reducing the duplication that's been happening and also just recognized that there's a lot of context with the counselor over our through our various mechanisms so in August emails request online and visits to the website there are about 287,000 context so it's a very busy place and getting that right as our front face of the organization is going to be very important and I'll leave the rest of the the paper is red but happy to take any questions Ali yes just page 31 at the end of all was 2014 etc talking about the training of the five skill sets and you mentioned the top issues cowling to what end what level of expertise and advice can be delivered what does it mean for the customer because those issues that you rates and the building for example I would imagine there would be a lot of very specific questions and so how are they they trained so largely they're trained around that the high number of questions that come on so the common questions frequently asked questions some of it's about how to access specific information are where to go to and some of it some of them is about referring on to the right people but largely there's a that the call center and other staff can help with directly Yanni um just on page 39 I see that revising it with guidelines for skirt program have been adopted by the three funders in a revised budget screen back on Megan to 2014 1 question 2 questions on that one is what is the environmental impact of those changes to the standards and seconders the review that's happening by the first of December there's a report coming to council around the terms of reference the scope and who gets appointed and what process is underway to ensure that we as elected members have oversight of that that's right I'll just ask my colleague data Vincent respond reference of being delegated can be signed off by the chief executive and by the by the deputy chief executive of 0 they have actually been gone and talked briefly that the draft we've had a draft and then we've actually modified it we did talk to a short line up yesterday about it because of the timetable of councillors and that's gone back now they about what we've thought of the changes and so I'm now waiting for a response from them obviously we've got one December deadline to get that going and so I have just flipped an email round two just a couple of the officers and I'm just waiting for a reply hopefully I might get a reply by this afternoon of whether that's acceptable or not acceptable when what changes they are proposing if there are any changes but they are putting it back up my understanding to Treasury so there's a few players on their side that they want to actually consult with and if I could use trying to understand this because I don't be great too if I could risk add to that the cost your agreement says that it would be signed off by myself and the deputy chief executive Sarah but it's our plan to ensure that the council is involved in that discussion all of the provisions of the cost share agreement if any clarification is required they can be signed off by the chief executive of you there is the provision and the cost share agreement and and which is why we got two clarifications signed by the chief executive of the council previous chief executive the council and by the head of ccd you certainly one of those clarifications is of considerable concern to us that signed up to commitment on anchor projects regardless of the insurance recoveries so so we've certainly indicated to the chief executive that we want to be looking at the terms of reference of the of the review we have had an initial discussion about that and and we're very happy with the proposal that the council has gone back to Sarila and then the second question and I mean I can follow that up offline but um the second question was when we had the presentation from our city of engineer over the impact we saw some quite because of the revised network guidelines I would see a reduction and the standard and quality of repairs and meaning that we were there was going to be some environmental impact what's the environmental impact assessment of those of mine was the water pressure mines which I understand government had put a halt to being fixed last year and we were seeing a high number of water leaks so what I'm really trying to understand us what they're revising it with guidelines that have been agreed for a doctor what is the environmental risk and impact fix it for the city we could I just wonder whether it be better to come back with a report on that because I mean it's not something it's wait for the independent review and then we will know definitely what the guidelines going forth then we can do that work because that will give the standard and the scope of the work and we can do it we could do you know a third it's done being by the old standards if it's done by the level of service stands and so there's quite but I think once we get it a way forward which I hope will be well with whatever report by one December that should give us some clarity rather than through the physical works at this point in time and so it could be a lot of work on something that's actually not that relevant in six months time yeah eration is that we keep hearing that you know we're waiting we're waiting we're waiting but then we get the presentation that shows the environmental impacts it's currently you know which just keeps getting worse and what would appear to be getting worse and worse and worse so you know when the truth of the matter is there until the review is done we are we are stuck with the ones that what's the total 3.93 point 40.9 minute yeah yeah I just throw it easier here okay but the other thing is that we're 43a and 43b a line is work that we're proceeding with whether a huge differences and there's economic reasons that would be good to do the two together we are actually looking them so they're going through and we're choosing project by project to try and work our way through that would actually maximize that will be done in the long term so you know there is a little bit of intelligence being put into what's going into that program and as you'll see if you look at the script program there are a number of projects on hold as we work our way through those kind of issues well there's still a lot of ways I lutely imperative that this is placed in the public arena that the public know what the decisions that are made you know within both while all aspects of the horizontal infrastructure project what they mean for the council going forward because obviously things that are not repaired to a high quality standard now will will have a higher cost on our operational expenditure you know over the short to medium term and and we will be in there repairing that again at some stage in the near future and so all of that needs to be calculated and it needs to be part of an overall discussion that we have to have with central government but we won't be having the discussion with of December report so what I don't understand in and I appreciate that the first to December is the critical date that's when we'll get the information why would you revise the network guidelines ahead of that process and what influence will it have on that process they revise them Oh before we were elected this cost sharing agreement the gate is actually held by Sarah Sarah actually says what work goes through that gate and what doesn't go through that gate and so that's really why that they've got that ability to revise them and some we are quite happy with another's were young yeah it with guidelines for the skirt program that's referred to a bullet point through what page 39 39 paragraph three bullet point three basically what the standards they have to have standards to design to them basically at the end of the day it'll be no use designing up to standards it wouldn't go through the gate so basically there's some and like I say in some parts we're doing catchments in two standards pretty much aligned so there are areas that we can continue with work doing that infrastructure a present yeah installed on a minute I'm going to end this line of questioning and I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask that we get a full report to the next council meeting which actually sets out and some detail all of that that the the sequence of events from the outset of the program all the way through and I mean it's not a question of asking you to do a lot of extra work here because their information exists it's just a question of pulling it together and to a single report so that we can see the timeline of events when things were changed because they have changed twice and I agree with you that it is absolute I mean no amount of questioning is going to change the fact that at the end of the day they have all of the work has to be signed off by Sarah and so it doesn't actually get through're saying is that you're protecting the interests of the network throughout this process by ensuring that we're there is a vast separation between the two standards that that's being put on hold yeah well that sounds reasonable to me so we'll get a full report to Council so there was Ellie no no term of so it was at full sorry Thank You Kelly page 44 under accessible City and that you've got made reference to the public workshop on the draft parking plan I was out there and was an excellent workshop and well attended and also what was it within the contacting plan was within the context of an accessible City and like some some great seduced his life for example and it wasn't new but incorporating for example park and ride as part of the inner part of the inner city packing plan your suggestions like there but my really what I want to refer to is how can we ensure that in fact there's good follow up to two there too am very good workshop just so we some work on it I just want to make sure it's a priority for us counseling probably for the Environmental Committee and so we can feed back to you in terms of what's been done agreed and how we move forward so Jamie issues the first question on page 40 regarding to the repair the town hall in here the staff information regarding to the operation of interest to repair tango was released to the market on night of September my question is regarding the scope scope of the work is the whole building and facility repair us part of me yeah yes it does each one yeah oh ho beauty yeah facility yeah but but but it also identifies what different stages diversity yes it has the right to exclude all hold yeah oh okay thank you second question on page 41 plus new southwestern I in the service center because regarding to this issue I've repeated for many many times but I review the content still the same as the last month my concern is part is the time frame is there any the progress try and ensure that we update more fully around some of these valent into the southwest hub time frame around november this year to December there we consultation with the community board the community committee and then coming to the council to agree and approve the preferred site it's possible xmax if the ex you in for pull in to learn content thank you le page 37 with regards to the skirt program 51% complete and work in the central city is approximately seventy one percent complete I just wondered is anyone able to answer if you take the central city out of the 51-percent that's complete what is the delivery of the skirt projects in the rest of the city does anyone able to answer that even a notification I'm knocking could we come back to your ship because I think that's probably fair yeah great thank you thanks it maybe we could do it board by board that would be great because I know that counselors would be very interested in them across the city some sodium I think I've got an updated it up surely but I also bring you up about the current with the latest on the word program because scattered right through there is a hot part of works on hold and design being it top being so it's it's not straightforward I know and you know that there might be work happening on earth yeah I mean I think I think it's a reasonable question if it can be easily put together and I'm sure that the skirt people could could show that because I just remember after the earthquake you know the Orion used to report you know about enthusiastically about how much of the city had on power and it would go you know with the sixty percent on power and was seventy percent on power minus eighty percent on to power and I remember saying to Roger Sutton who was the head of a run at the time you know you know you people in the East think you don't know about them because they're eighty percent without power and it's better to and so he started changed eighty percent on power but we're twenty thousand houses still without power and and tomorrow we're going to get another 4,000 of them on the power you know so people started to see what was happening and felt that they were included in the and the reporting Glenn thank you if I could mention two quick things the previous council did used to receive skirt reports by ward that came through the Environmental Committee I in community board the number number to both Carlene and the CDC report indicate roads a twenty-seven percent complete yeah so if we're going to lead some explicit kind of status update on the roads and I think bill at Pegasus hagley very neat especially those eastern areas there you go yeah people are really starting to get pretty impatient so yeah it's been four years roads will always be the last because you will always do the infrastructure underneath I'm sorry that just has to happen otherwise we'll be you know the last thing we want to say is putting you rode down and then we dig it people wouldn't go be grateful for you know holes to be temporarily filled you know because there's nothing worse than going down a road and then just being you know yeah I mean you know you know that I hear ya know it's when you forget that it's there and you do it for the second time that you actually can actually blame yourself for doing it David and with the report on roading give some indication as to the timing of the underground infrastructure appeared when it's due and thirst I mean I think giving giving some of the eastern suburbs and surely pepper new award as well an indication that yes they erode is was pretty rubbish eat stool but the underground infrastructure needs still needs to be repaired and this is scheduled for a date for the works together after the independent review we hear agree between us and the crown because basically if there's an optimization process the roads are going to be there may be the Cinderella of the services again live we've still got a whole pile lot of the roads out eastern Christchurch and again we've got a meeting with Sarah the middle of October we want to come up with you one of the workshops just to confirm the infrastructure we need we are we're thinking about stop banks we've still got 60 or 70 houses within the red zone I think some occupied some not so there are a few issues that would be very very difficult for us to put a program around rolling around the worst affected areas until we do that but we are intending to get that at a briefing to you as soon as we possibly can I think the works been done I think you've seen it anyway or most of it and I think there's a good agreement about ninety-five percent of it it's it's principally about writing networks and potentially stop bank positions that we need to talk to you about yeah all right us on that on page 38 the optimization group I know we've had a workshop over and we got presented with a number of've never seen backwater final and all that optimization was and is that coming back to Council or is that going to the in the P number of you or is what's the kind of sign off mechanism for that basically part of that is what we can get through the Gateway so we can continue rebuilding Christchurch as I've said we're approximately fifty percent of the way through that infrastructure I believe again what the first part of the independent review it says what is the scope of the work and that is the first question we were asking second question is what a surprise of the scope of the work to actually meet the obligations as set out on the cost share agreement I think of those two things and then we will get a final group now and maybe the design standards will change the purser gate will be will be out this could be really useful for us to get the existing current optimization because I know on that chart we saw there were things like you know the road going up to choices that were made on each one I just think it'll be good for us to understand at the moment what is the current schedule of works in terms of that optimization there would be helpful we have over to our communities in our cabin and attend a briefing on on h-i and yep I'm Jamie I'm happy to receive the report oh you'll move there yep and Ally considered it falling thank you under some those scoop briefings that go around the community boards as long as we could just check up on that program because I don't recall them having been lately get inside and they were quite comprehensive reports Ward by ward so I wonder if we could just just make sure it yeah it sounds like the scoot brief things have slowed up lately with community board so it might be worthwhile raising that with them yeah late from a comms perspective it's great getting the pdfs of the work start work notices and things they are really hard to use on social media and so what I've asked then use through either Twitter or Facebook because we can post those and I think the pdfs come out before sometimes they're actually put onto a website so it would be great if we could align that so that we're actually getting them as urls that we can hide you please I think there's a lot more that we could be doing better in the social media space in terms of advising people so that that's that's very timely reminder I just think that with this whole question of the horizontal infrastructure it's obviously raised a number of issues but I I think that we we will get a complete report together and bring it to council so that people got an absolute line of sight because I don't think people need to worry that we have signed off on like this is where agreed that this is the position going forward we've agreed that this is what's going to be acceptable within the budget within the time frame so that scoot doesn't stop working but while we have the really a deferment while we undertake that that detailed analysis so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you if we've got
With the leave of the council will just deal with that and I'll move that the report be received I think will be the thing would someone like to second that motion Jimmy chin I'll put yep Yanni it's just I'm chasing up on that question before is there any resolution that you would like me to put no I will raise up with the government as fine it's it doesn't need a recommendation from the council thank you right I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carry it thank you very much
So next delicate our deputation as Tom Hooper and gough canopy from the Canterbury Development Corporation and we have item number 20 on our agenda which I do propose that we deal with at the same time because it does include the information that you're going to talk to so good I'll hand over to you thank you thank you metal million well first of all you've had an update from CDC which has been tabled and I just thought that since this was the first time would be in front of the new council just to make a couple of general points at the outset firstly our role our role is to make interventions which will stimulate the regional economy as far as what actual dimensions we should make and will make we are guided in that by an intervention logic and that logic recognizes this sometimes a political dimension to the interventions that might be taken but CDC is strictly a political and we take guidance on the interventions that we make with public money from both the city and central government the question I influence these interventions that we make and I can tell you that firstly we listen to the public policy position that the council takes but more specifically tom has since the elections been and seen all of you at least once some of you twice and some of you more than that to to get a feel for the new flavor of policy four of you are sitting on the CDC board in the governance role and but the key process is the Lt process and the activity management plan that's a council process to distill the council consensus and that defines our choices through the levels of service agreement which is negotiated between your executive and ours they might ask what's changed since the new council came into into being well first of all we were asked to get closer to the City Council and used the CDC's resources to help uh City Council with the rebuild and to use independent relationships with government to support the council in that process and to that end tom has been seconded to the mayor's office for a infrastructure of CDC that he can draw secondly we've launched a major new project on suburban community redevelopment and local business enterprise they're just coming together now but it's a major new initiative for us and the third area is that we've started providing a lot more guidance and formed by our business links to target internship and apprenticeship programs which support the underlying long-term economic growth targets but I'll let Tom tell you a little bit more about the detail of us some of the things in the report thanks guys so we thought we would use this basis a little bit of an opportunity to talk to full council of the direction and CDC's going in and and also really the activity that's been happening in recent months and since council took over so just with regard to progress and current activity Garth referred to the central government relations that CDC has and in the last 12 months those relationships have advanced in a number of areas so we now have fairly regular contact with in the Treasury the Reserve Bank a variety of other ministries those relationships come about fro through a number of the efforts that CDC have so firstly the economic the regional economic reporting and information that we produce and I think you got the quarterly economic update in the reading pack that information is now used by a number of different ministries as the regional economic reporting for the region so we we have responsibility for the economic recovery monitoring and reporting for Sarah that was one of the first activities that was transitioned out of Sarah we use that report and a number of others to collate a variety of regional economic indicators which now our number of ministries are using his information on the region but the other area where we engage significantly with central government is around national programs where there is a regional delivery element so CDC is a partner of the crown in a look a whole variety of initiatives that we look at and in the last 12 months in particular there's really been some significant progression in a number of those areas so notably there will be a hub that's being developed that CDC has initiated the business model for actually the the entity that will run it is a CDC owned subsidiary but the capital and the vast majority of the operating revenue will be provided by central government and that's actually a relatively significant investment so we'll see a physical infrastructure built in the built in the region along the same lines where a partner in the innovation precinct with mb and as part of that partnership there will be an innovation hub developed within the innovation precinct which will provide coworking space it'll be somewhere we can run the incubation and accelerator programs for young entrepreneurs and startups who want to get going in the region and again same thing CDC will run that program but actually the funding provided comes through comes through our partnership with mb so we have a number of very strong operational partnerships with the different ministries just to give you an idea in the last 12 months with either renewed extended or signed new contracts with crown departments for 13 and a half million dollars annual funding is from from Council at the moment so we work pretty hard to leverage our council funding with the with the crown relationships to make sure we get we get good return and just well I'm what I'm talking about in particular some of the some of the different programs that are that are out there in conjunction with the innovation hub that's actually part of a wider regional innovation program that has a number of different programs that sit within it and one of one of the other elements that will be new for the region in the next 12 months is we signed a we sign a program with mb to deliver an accelerator program into the city so there's only one of three that exists in the country and it will see a dedicated tailored and really quite a defined short-term program to accelerate company growth come into the region will be based in the innovation hub and the innovation precinct and we'll see a number of businesses ideally be able to be developed significantly faster than they would have on it a little bit as really is to do what we can to to help the wider overall economy I think you mentioned one of the other one of the other changes that we've talked about which is considering the suburban economic communities so one of the challenges of the rebuild is that it isn't just about the CBD actually it's about some of the wider community areas as well so as a result of conversations with our board with the other councilors where we got a very clear stare that there was some concern out there we've been out and had a little bit of a look at a number of the different communities and in particular the business the business communities and the suburbs and we do have some concerns in particular we have some concerns around building costs and as a result of building costs rental rates for businesses that will be you know traditional businesses that would be in the smaller communities we think there's a piece of work that needs to be done there that piece of work looks the idea would be to bottom out what actually is the role CDC and the city can play and trying to ensure that those communities recover and have have strong local economies that's a specific area of focus and one we're intending on spending a little bit of time look rather than rather than talk for all of our allocated time we thought it might be useful to throw the floor open to questions and just respond to anything that anybody would like to know well it was a good point that you just ended on because I know AlI's got a question that she'd like to ask that it probably legs on to that yep yeah thank you hi I just wondered if he'd done an evaluation of recover Canterbury which you know we're all in agreement and more broadly speaking I think across the city it was he from our perspective a hugely successful and much-needed program but I just wonder about the evaluation of that and perhaps identifying the successes where it worked really well in some of the specific examples as part of the wind up of recover Canterbury with the crown there was a really pretty comprehensive paper developed on on recover Canterbury the organization what it actually did what we felt worked really well and actually what we would suggest should be done differently if we did it again and that's a civil defense actually hold that as a kind of in case of emergency break glass paper that other regions can use around what you set up because the whole not just not just within the city but the whole national view of cover canterbury was that it was an outstanding success and really the way you should you should do things so I've got I have access to it yeah would be great if you could distribute it to councillors you should cool yeah I'd certainly be very interested in reading that as well did you give Neil earnings out of it that you've implemented yourself you know like I think you know some of the work around that the smaller localities came off that that's why I thought they were that recover Canterbury highlighted was the sensitivity of the outlying regions and some of the some of the challenges that they face but the other huge thing that highlighted and probably the biggest critical success factor that drove recover Canterbury was the importance of collaboration so you know recover Canterbury was the chamber CDC government ministries including Inland Revenue you know all working together and engaging to try and help the business community and that was what really drove the success of it if I could make another comment where the the wage subsidy and the speed with which that was introduced was an outstanding decision actually the other thing that I observed was that speed in setting up the legal entities is absolutely critical because the amount of money likely to be donated tails off dramatically and exponentially with time so that if you take too long to set up your trust the amount of money you clicked as linville doesn't last long the window yes tree Jimmy chin and then Jana well question regarding to the use the resources to rebuild reconstructor city I'm wondering I you know all those resources like a technical technology and skilled people from the International so where is the strategy to assess of 10 lowers the resources from overseas so to retain the international resources that are coming in for the for the rebuild is it so we would say that's part of the workforce and migration strategy one of the huge pluses that the region is currently enjoying and part of the reason why our labor market hasn't got significantly worse has been a very good migrated inbound migration into the into the city that's partially rebuilt driven but it's also some some of the other highly skilled workforce that we need for our underlying economic sectors coming in we think one keeping migration going really strongly is very important in the upcoming couple of years but actually the retention of those people in the economy beyond the rebill will go a long way towards determining the growth of the overall economy so Julian sits within the workforce strategy and around how we make sure they stick into the into the region but migration is and then Andrew think you um thank you for the work you're doing and thank you for going to counsel today um I was just interested in how you're getting on with the independent peer review of the economic benefits of the Inca projects that we asked for early last year JC things are progressing and be really good to get some understanding around that you cannot benefits of those projects so what works being done and we can we expect to see it so Sarah have not completed the independent the economic benefits of the overall anchor projects for us to peer review so we haven't been able to do the peer review because we haven't actually got the piece of work that we needed from Sarah to be I would appear of you we're ready to do it at any time like what I don't understand is things like the bus exchange then the justice precinct they're already committed to are you saying that you think no business case Lambos so we didn't we haven't seen a business case is they haven't provided us with an economic and overall economic benefit analysis for us to be able to peer review so what do you need from us to actually be able to do that work do you need us to formally reduce government provide those business cases to you it just seems like you know I think in terms of our investment in the rebuild in the recovery we kind of want to make sure that actually investment is you know suitable given the potential economic benefits that are being espoused but yet we've had no information to show why it makes sense to invest and say you know essential class interchange versus housing or an even River precinct versus wider places in the city so there's anything we can do to speed up how get that process hit me question so we could counsel could request the economic benefit analysis if it hasn't been completed which I suspect is that which I suspect is the case yani then I'm I'm not sure how we will go and get in getting work delivered need the government to provide you with the figures as I mean if you take over a precinct what is it that you wouldn't know that that would stop me from doing a kind of economic benefit or social analysis of that so we we could do that but that's different they have been asked to do the original work County they've been asked to peer review the work that the government does so but but I think that we should have thought we should follow up on this I think this is an important issue because at every stage of the process you know our ratepayers are asking us for for this kind of value assessment and I think the peer review role that CDC can players action important one so we can certainly raise that with central government about the getting the business case analysis together so that we can actually ask you to peer reviewer I guess I guess I was probably coming at a more fundamental change and that is asking for a peer actually the right mechanism and should we could we review we took that we don't fund CDC to do the original work so I mean they're not set up to do their original work they would need access to all of the information that Sarah would have so I mean Sarah's the right organization to be providing that advice to ministers but I'm along with Treasury and others but it seems to me that we're a step removed from that process so but I think it is a valid point to raise and I think how we now take it forward as something we can raise messenger so on that you're doing the economic reporting for Sarah and the government on the region yeah the region economic monitoring and reporting on the economic recovery so yeah that's probably pretty important ticket the annihilation of it with the money spring speak to there are two different things yeah so they are they are slightly different things look it is a good point okay but I think the points been made so and I don't really want to let andrew have a question thanks for the presentation this morning I'm particularly pleased to see consideration of the challenges of development economics in the suburbs and certainly aware of some suburbs in Christchurch that will benefit from that work can you perhaps expand a little bit on there as to what your areas of focus would be and to what extent they will be aligned with the suburban master planning work that the city is already done and some good work that's already been done out there by local business associations thanks Andrew so answerers has to be has to be aligned with both of those groups so anything that we entered any interventions that we actually line up would be with those as fundamental partnerships so the city around the planning and the local business communities around around work that can be done areas that we think are of concern I think I touched on already affordability of rental rental space in local business communities clearly looks an issue in particular around rebuild of rebuild of vacant sites so that's one business a business attraction and retention within some specific of that actually can be mitigated with consenting and planning I suspect a little bit but there are there are also clearly I think some strategic tweaks needed in terms of how we can ensure we don't have flight out of the suburban business communities and I do think there's a little bit of risk there just at the moment the last question as mine because I'm allowed to what we did have a discussion about this as a as a group but when you talk about an innovation ecosystem what do you mean by that and how does that how does that start to emerge in a post disaster environment okay oh I feel inferior talking about this with the chair next to me who has 30 years experience and this stuff but look at innovation ecosystem as the idea that it's not about it's not about things it's about the system that supports innovation so that that's from capital and the ability to fund startups to enable them to get going it's through the ability to advise businesses and entrepreneurs of the type of people that will make entrepreneurs and those can be social entrepreneurs they can be commercial entrepreneurs the innovation ecosystem in New Zealand is really tough because we've got a relatively small population we've got thin capital markets we're a long way away from big product markets so to get things going here is more difficult than other places in the world we've got some unique advantages in the region so we have seven of the eight crown research institutes in Canterbury we have three tertiary institutions we have what will be one of the best district health boards in the country if not if not in the in the continent there's an awful lot of fantastic IP generated in the region and one of the things that we think about is how do we turn that into successful growth both in new businesses and as importantly within existing businesses so there's a that great Kiwi DIY attitude is a real strength of ours but it's also a weakness in some ways and that we tend to bootstrap things and it and say all where's the logical partner and how do we get that going CDC's intent is to create an ecosystem around all of that that says we can make the system more efficient we can create growth within the region and we can create somewhere that young people want to come because actually innovation is treated differently yeah it's not just well intervention it's it's a range of interventions that it's a type of soft infrastructure we've created in Cantabria it's unique in the country but it means that if a professor at canterbury university has a bright idea that idea is supported all the way until there's a small company with its own board set up and operating to commercialize it and and the infrastructure comes in behind that process previously we just dropped the ball time after time and the professor win got another grand at something else and put the IP on the shelf nothing happened yeah but that's but it's also about the young person that comes along because they they hear that lonely planet or something and and and they're incredible ideas suddenly you know tuning into something maybe more social entrepreneur oriented so it's both it's not one or the other look absolutely really yeah so the new precinct the new the new attitude that Christ Church has the opportunity to present what we're doing here is now being used as the template around the rest of the country so the the National the National high tech incubation program that has just been released where again Christ Church has we're one of one of three of those nationally that is our template so the Crown has taken what we do here and the way that incubation program runs through powerhouse and they've put it out nationally so it's now being used as a as a national template based on the way we're trying to trying to develop the system here great no I think that's a very positive note to end on so thank you very much under them sorry it's taken so long you know to have you here but one thing I did right so let's deal with item number 20
And now we'll move on to deputations and we have a request from crashed out stadium trust Djem Anderton and Tim Shanahan thank you welcome with Council on other occasions and just recapping very quickly where a statutory body set up by the government to administer the stadium until 2017 it was a temporary stadium built for that purpose we became aware that there was a possibility that the stadium the new stadium may not be ready by 2017 and we made both the government and the council aware that if we didn't take steps to upgrade and improve the infrastructure then the bill the the the complex would have to close because it wasn't built to last any longer than that but our engineering reports which would provide the council indicated that the stadium had along the life could go to 20 to 25 or even beyond but there would need to be significant or significant Alton's anyway financial investment in the stadium to to enable it to occur we took engineering advice we gave those that advice of the council and the reality is we make that investment now the stadium runs at a break even level we we haven't required any further money from the government or the council or anyone else and we've got significant sponsorship we've probably got the whole stadium covered in sponsors now I don't think is any left and we can break even but we haven't got the funding to invest in an improved infrastructure if that's necessary so that's why the request is before you on on balance you have to decide at your decision as to whether you want a stadium there after 17 and if you do then some assistance much of it could be repaid because the longer stadium stays in existence the more reserves the stadium will build up because we with this money we will purchase the rest of the least seats we have some of them already but you saved us about 350,000 dollars a year but this purchase will save us about three-quarters of million dollars a year and that three-quarters of million dollars would be used to upgrade the stadium so that metaphor negotiation between the council and the government has nothing to do with the stadium trust actually we are statutory body set up by the government to administer what's there now and insofar as it's there we will be administering it but that how long it lasts is not our decision that's yours there's a set of recommendations which probably if I just work through fairly quickly most of which are relatively unexceptional from our point of view the proposal to lend the money rather than granted is not a problem for our purposes because we intend to hand over the assets of the stadium to the council in any case there is a there was a problem with our trust deed in terms of extra funding being handed over because of the deeds it has to be handed over to a charitable trust of the same set of objectives as we have and with all due respect I don't think I could count and law the council as a charitable trust or charity unless you want to change your status so so we have to pay back the money if we get excess over that then we have some issues but but they can be dealt with by council negotiation so the first recommendation is not exceptional our point of view I'll just run through them and then you can comment if you ask questions of us we have to purchase the seats by December the 20th I think that's the drop d date we have to pay six hundred fifty thousand dollars in lease fees for next year if we don't do that so it'd be a bit of a no-brainer to miss that because you've already lost 650,000 this year with more to follow if we don't do the purchase the the trust will generate most of the increased revenue for reserves over time the first year of two or three are it's a moot point that depends on the engineering requirements and how quickly these endless infrastructure can be settled and so on but most of the money we save will be used in the initial year or two for the infrastructure upgrade but we pay the money at the end of the term say to 20 22 or we pay some of it over time is not a great issue for us because the money is held in trust it's not our money so we'll be expensing it in the way that we we are committed to do pay back the loan or to share it with others the loan is secured over the essence of the state of course it's like your s it's not worth much less you're going to sell the building or whatever and in a real sense the assets that I was something the land itself you already own but the stadium has assets which are much more valuable than the even the extent of this loan of course but what they're worth that depends on what you're going to do with them like the corporate boxes and and there's like towels and and everything else which you have and then the seats themselves if we purchase them all those seats are actually owned by the stadium and our intention then dispense them to sports bodies or use them and whatever you wanted and of course you always have the option of using that stadium as a as a second tier stadium but that's entire you're you're cool our obligation is to hand it back theoretically as a level playing field so we have to demolish it and that demolition actually costs 2.3 million one of the benefits of this arrangement is that we'll be able to afford that demolition so as you get back a bad piece of ground if that's what you want and we'll be able to pay for that plus have enough reserves to fund back most of the of the loan the financial projections out to 20 to say that we could meet the sixty percent in the recommendation relatively easily the longer it goes of course theoretically the more reserves we build up except that at some point there may have to be more upgrading to a higher standard than we met for the 2022 extension the engineering reports indicate that but in truth I think if you review probably the year before say so if I'm not saying this will happen but if there wasn't a stadium going to be ready in 20 22 to say then you need an engineering report that would say well in that case you'll need to spend x y&z on the setting the other that you wouldn't have had to spend if you're going to wind it up in 22 same position really as you're in now but it's quite clear that the longer this goes on with us owning the assets now and not having to pay these lease fees which was a total of about 1.3 million actually a year then the the larger the reserves are over time the stadium will have assets as we indicated and they will be they'll be handed over to the council for your your purposes the truss current promotional focus is this in terms of acknowledging your contribution we have a video that's played on the big screen every game and we would be amending that to put the cat city council in one of the organization's is assisting us the allocation of the fund money that we pay back to you to your building and infrastructure announcers and child of your business we don't you can do what you like we're just giving it to you back and said it one more is what this is a question of planning the consent consents we have go out to 2016-17 is a little bit of a gap leavitt that's relatively simply closed but after that there will be consents required and we we can only say will give out do our best endeavours in that regard because whether we get the consensus building and says and soul or not as is up to the process that you set up and we don't we don't have any up any say in that in a sense we make our submissions and we didn't get consent well done building it after close that's it so we can't do much about that and if that happened well all bets are off but we'll do our best and too many problems we we don't seem to have any vexatious or seriously contentious opponents to the same at the moment and we never have and we've got good relations with our neighbors the league people were and we're in discussions within probably at the end of the day it may be better for the council to be in discussion with them but because you own the land ultimately and the lease that they have is with the council not with us but at the moment we have good relations we're talking we may be able to I'm relatively certain that we can come to a reasonable arrangement with them for the extension but they their release has to be renegotiated 21 I think is another 20 16 2016 and then 21 so there's two more negotiations to go for them but they're reasonably positive they might want a little bit more money and something I don't know but we'll work that through and we reason to be confident about that and then it's at the final one no it avoid the lease payment delegated authority is desirable and my advice from op officials is that if authority was delegated to deal with the details our legal advisers and and accounting advisers and so on would work with your officials to just tidy up all the details that need to be done to make sure these recommendations are applied properly so we're we're comfortable about that arrangement so that we don't have to have another council meeting or go on because time is now the essence and and we will be in serious difficulty if we don't get this arrangement cited by the 20th of the symbol I think that's all earlier I just have one question and it really relates to you know some of the you know potential for delays in terms of the new stadium and so the end and the sort of magic around the the december twenty two day so say for example the stadium couldn't be built by 2022 say it was later than that would you still be in a position to repay the loan at 31 have a 22 dates because in some ways that gives us a definitive time frame to meet your requirements and we we believe on our projection that we can do that although we've given projections out to 25 and 28 to the council officials and those projections show that we are in a bit a bit of better and better position the longer it goes on you can never be absolutely certain about these things and as I say at 2022 if you wanted to extend it out then that possibility is there from an engineering point of view but we haven't got a full costing of that so we couldn't be absolutely certain we can say for certain now on all our best information available we will be able to meet those projections but after that it's it's a bit more guesswork and I mean every time you turn around running a stadium like this there's a drainage problem or there's a turf problem or there's something and and another couple of hundred thousand dollars goes down a Googler I mean possibly comment well it's a reality of life and and we're able to cover that cost you know in and the good news is that the stadium is well used I mean people of Christchurch have been pretty loyal to it I mean we're if you look at the national average for IDM attendances else as well up on and and we we never really fill the stadium oil we fill it for test matches and we fill it for the odd you know a local derby or something but but in the quarterfinals that wasn't fall so about 14,000 15,000 it can hold up to 22 for a test match but the truth is and we have to recognize us that the tier 1 test matches like the Lions games and and probably bless her cub and so on would not be played in that Stadium own time I and you can't blame the rugby union for that I mean they want to get 45,000 people in the stadium if they can and we just don't have it so we have to accept won't name the companies their country to make into trouble but there are number of test matches it could be played here and probably will and they'll probably fill the safe in our state but they won't feel like that we don't have a 40,000 or whatever stadium to to give to the rugby union of course if they want one like that they could pay for it themselves which good I think on this two points I'd like to make when the stadium missed out on a test match this year there was a lot of comment and that in the media that that means Christchurch has a second tier stadium it can't compete with a lot of other stadiums what was never reported and it was disappointed nobody ever came to the stadium trust to ask us we had a contrary with me on rugby union that said the stadium was to have a test match in 2015 no test match in 20s so test mention 2014 no test match of 2015 World Cup year there's only two test matches and host Crusaders England and 2014 give up our test match in 2014 and be one of only two cities to get a test match in 2015 so from our perspective we made the smart decision to ensure to international rugby teams came to Christchurch 2014-2015 so I think some of that information that was put out there was was incorrect we had actually already done the negotiations so that probably addresses the aspect in terms of is the stadium good enough to host test matches there are other information that need to be considered also going back to the original question in terms of our capacity to repay the loan guess we have confidence however it's also appropriate to notice that in our financial projections we're saying five hundred thousand a year spent on maintenance decreasing to 200,000 in the last two years because that's when we start to to wind things up if we are pushing past then you would expect us to stay at around five hundred thousand for each of those subsequent years until we do know we're winding up and we reduce confident yeah the predictions are conservative I think that was the security that we wanted I don't think where are we up to a time sorry I can't read the yeah yeah so I would thank you very much for your time I'm not where I'm not going to deal with this item now because we have another daily a deputation so oh that's fine thank you very much
I will the minutes for the 11th of timber sorry twenty eighth of august to end the eleventh of sep tember could have someone to move those Andrew Turner seconded Ali Jones yep just as small creature was just our paid to raise us again because was but um page 26 item 24 it was just to record my vote against it was picked up in the next item but I also voted against that one page 26 item 24 sorry Vicki 60 yeah yeah okay so noting that that we've recorded a vote against from counselor golf on net item really and I would love to see kinder than I wasn't the you went there so I was just looking for somebody who was Pauline cutter councillor cutter I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried
Decorations of interest I haven't received notification of any decoration of interest as account yet directors of of council controlled trading organizations yet or organizations yeah I hit one for the Finance Committee there I have a family member at FX 0 0 step aside when it comes with me right okay thank you so so those disclosures are made and we'll deal with them councillor Livingston or step aside for that from that decision
And have I missed anything supplementary zor anything in the main part of the thing because I've got resolution to its local public next right okay guys we're going to exclude the public now so we need to kick you out thank you very much for attending yes so always a pleasure to see you how long do you guys need to unwind
Subcommittee me Andrew move what do you want us to do with p√¢t√© just is it's at the recommendation to go through the council yep so the small grants pond of made their decision and that now just needs to be approved by council okay right so pat pat a first the review of it so I appreciate the work was done and that how the grants are working one thing that I raised in an earlier grants meeting was that at times there can be a trust that sits alongside some of the agency and organizations are applying and I just want and that's that's happened here again and it's been signed off I'm not saying that the agency concerns shouldn't have got their funding but I am saying that the financial information should be absolutely clear when there is a trust that an effects at salon cider and its main purpose is actually to support that organization so I would like that to be added into a recommendation that in fact is like a 1.7 something like that all applications or applicants the purpose for their interests will be to clear any in each arm unique if there is a trap any trust hot holding money and in their interests okay you just check with chris earth you've got your wording right yes can I suppose teach your beneficiary and I suggest that goes in as 1.6 and then 1.6 becomes 1.7 yeah and the funding review board group also consider the process for and what Phil's suggesting and 1.5 because it all feeds into that work yeah and while I'm on that note no just need chris catch up with you sorry you ok Chris ok good with it yep and then we refer to the community fund we refer to the the funding review group if we're going to align the terminology here with the terminology in the ER care report we should refer to it as the community funding working group so that we know that we're talking about same thing ok and there's a yeah there's and that community funding working groups got quite big terms of reference coming as well that's one point for you want to change the funding review group to the community funding working group ok thanks ok good with us so put Part A moved Andrew and sickened it Ellie put there those in favor please say aye those clothes Part B is for your information ok put that needs to be paired seeking to anyone yep and we put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried that the reports to hold these up it I care the end those against know you've carried
We've got a quorum so we're going to start an accessible City page 243 welcome back welcome Jimmy right do you guys want to say anything at the start then I'm Charenton cheeseburger my right and really this reporters bit of an update from where we left things off last time and that we brought something to council an early August to seek approval to go out and consult on on what we call transport project one and five that's just finished that consultations just finished yesterday we had a huge degree of interest in that so we've got some really good feedback some positive some negative and we'll work through that over the next couple of weeks and then bring it back to council for decisions so these projects that we've got in front of you that the key ones are really what we call transport projects 1911 transport project 9 is really the extension of the one you've already we've just gone out and consulted on which is the extension of that the one way eastbound of Turin street to Wayne of the portion of Litchfield street from gone straight to Manchester and that's quite fundamental to now those anchor projects which sit along that Street and particularly to you know that the car parks as well the cross entire Park does that be to wade and TP 11 which is really I guess converting that portion of Colombo street between here foot and some Esav to a cycle friendly pedestrian-friendly portion and that picks up you know that the bus interchange and some other key components of that central city so the report really focuses on those those three and it provides you with a bit of an update on a couple of other transport projects as well but what we're suggesting is that those are not sufficiently far advanced to to provide you with any kind of plans at the stage and we come back and brief you on those listen to further detail in the future inside the moment all we're really seeking this as yes we're keen to go out and consult get community feedback see what everyone has to say there any questions Yanni has this been to the local community board we briefed the local community board hon would brief them on the public rail network plan of which some of the principles are in here we did a quite significant briefing I think when you away overseas on the overall and accessible City and the transport modeling and all those other things I'm not and as part of the stakeholder engagement over these schemes we will be intending to brief the command board directly over the detailed implications of each of these three schemes there before council I guess I mean it would be pretty normal I know that there's delegated decision-making I think to council on this one so because in summary of the central city but I think it's really important um the other thing is what I don't understand is I'm chew em straight it makes assumptions about where cycleways it going but our community board is really concerned that we haven't got detailed design or or even medium level design for the sideways outside of the central city until we've made our decision to connect them up so what seems to be happening is the central city suffers driving the cycleways externally out of the central city and we've had no opportunity to to approve those plans so do you want to comment on that guy's the the major weight cycleways design team the design engineers that have been looking at that have been closely involved in the detailing of these concept plans for the cycleway on choo m street are in broad order we expect the quality of those facilities there in the level separation for cyclists there to be consistent with the City Council cycleway design guidelines that apply citywide to the major cycleway network and so it is those very sort of details that were were keen to get feedback from the community over so the level of separation there on these key cycleways is intended to be consistent with the major cycle routes across the city also which are looking at levels of separated it's all right sorry yonni can we just be clear what that actually is because this a packed car and the truck so what do you actually mean by the circle ways will be consistent so in this instance the keys cycle ways that are shown in an accessible City the intention wherever possible on those is to achieve a physical separation between cyclists and adjacent traffic and that is certainly the case as far as that cycleways shown here on chew up straight is concerned greatest comment to councils in relation to the cycleways yes the environment environment committee members have had a briefing on that and clearly all councillors shut up there it the briefing will go to all elected community board members before the end of the month I think it's about the 25th so that it is important that they they be connected they will be of course can I just add to though that it just seemed to me that one area which does affect cycleways and and staff might add a comment on this is around the bus exchange because that enters of all this plan it seemed to me to be the area which potentially would have the's a good point yet the the options for the delivery of a separated cycleway on tuned street are summarized in attachment to to the report and that has been one leading option for the design of the cross section 42 m street and that was which side of chew and street that a eastbound cycleway was placed on so it's been looked at at both sides of the street so putting it on the south side alternative alternatively on the north side it is the north side that we are proposing primarily because that's the natural line of travel for most cyclists there on the left side of the street in most streets and the alternative design of putting that cycle way on the south side created a number of legibility and confusion issues potentially at a number of intersections as a cyclist travels along chillun street neither side is without its issues in terms of designing arrangements for that and so there's a lot of works gone into designing the access arrangements across the bus interchange and so that is one of the specific aspects closely with Environment Canterbury about is around the control arrangements for buses and cyclists around the interchange perimeter itself 25 8 30 258 the picture with regards to the Litchfield street and you've got the buzz that transport interchange on one side and opposite that you've got the driveway lime take this and to a car pack of that yes but how many what's the capacity that care pack compared to say the old Litchfield care pack and the former public parking building at Litchfield street I think had a capacity of 888 spaces and there were about 300 additional spaces associated with local developments of it so it had a capacity of about 1,200 yeah the former crossing car park which this replaces had 222 spaces so I think the proposal that that is associated with this is for circus 600 spaces acts off of litchfield street at that point because I just from my memory as that you know like when you've got a Yanni mentioned it earlier on as when you came along the the terrace and you came into literature sometimes that durham street and a section and that left-hand turning lane would be by accident or by virtue of numbers we're waiting lane for that lets your car park and I'm just wondering I mean if you've got a single line of traffic trying to get into that litchfield or whatever I'm just wondering what steps are being taken to just I think that key things with with that a good design I mean that the litchfield one it used to have the arm down right at the front yes I none of the cars could get them before they've gone through the barrier and paid their money or got their ticket so with modern design you can you can really engineer that out by putting that further down so you got your queueing occurring within the car park itself so you know those are the sorts of things that you'd expect to find and a modern car parked litchfield street as it was pretty quick obviously wasn't that and you know we've got a whole raft of criteria which were pulled together workshop on a couple days ago which provide key direction about how these things need to be designed to ensure that you don't get those safety issues and the conflict with pedestrians happening so and it's probably back best about also of course the Litchfield Street previously was was a very busy one way span street which that traffic is being shifted to chew him as a result of these changes so that the overall quantum of through traffic on Litchfield Street will be significantly reduced as a result of these overall network changes so the majority of traffic that will be on that central section of literal street after these changes will be as associated with the parking buildings and the premises that are immediately located off of it there will be very little traffic heading to other destinations there okay let's see I just can't understand how a 600 car park is not going to create a lot more traffic and if you look at Colombo Street design you've got just pretend this just screams potential gridlock because you've got one line's like a hero and crosses at the same time you've got one line in litchfield and you've got a 600 car park building so people coming from chill street will turn into Colombo and then intellectual it's the only way they can access that car park and that doesn't seem very logical to me and it doesn't seem like it's it just looks like it's going to be a disaster only how do we buy how do we get those concerns addressed through you madam chair we've we've undertaken extensive traffic modelling at an evening peak hour of 20 31 with all of the central city developments from the recovery plan broadly in place or our best estimate just a level of traffic that they would generate and we've undertaken a number of assessments that have looked at the Durham street litchfield Street intersection the Colombo Street litchfield Street intersection the interchange access and then the Manchester Street Litchfield Street intersection all of those assessment indicate to us that arm there there will be at that time some level we'd expect through a with a vibrant central city but not to the degree that we believe that those that levels of congestion there would be unacceptable to people heading into and out of those developments there one of the critical issues we've been keen to get to the bottom of and that's why the plans in front of you today proposed a signal access arrangement to the to the interchange is to achieve bus primacy between the interchange access there and chester street and so that proposed signal arrangement there is our best way of achieving that to achieve good access to the eastern part of the retail precinct opposite there but to ensure that that does not have with that quantum of car park capacity a material impact on the efficient operation of the interchange so what I can't understand is as the cycleway on sharam street I share the concerns why you wouldn't put that on Litchfield straight and the final question for me is just what's the cost we don't have any costume so what's the cost for their there was 72 million dollars basically allocated through that the crown funding agreement and council was up for 27 million of that the crown 27 million and NZTA through the Korean up for the remaining 18 million so it's all within that overall budget of 72 million so what we brought to you in May was was basically we sought to refine the original transport projects that were in the ground funding agreement and we push them out and brought them and so we could support the opening of the interchange but we're still looking to do that with them they're 72 million dollar back up and but we're still doing further work on what needs to be done in the costs associated with it so they'll need to be some value engineering yeah so what I think we need to do when we approvingly Sekot consultations know how much money and tell the community this is how much money we're going to spend we've just gone out for a financial consultation to say what are your priorities what are your options to go out for about I mean I can't tell how much from here 10 million 12 million maybe 15 million of money being spent without any figures attached to show us or show the community what both choices are 33 you madam surely the costs were outlined in the council report of May the 22nd I'm afraid I don't have the three costs for the individual schemes that were talking about here in front of me but the costs that I do design teams are working on today are wholly consistent with the three individual scheme costs that council were were praised of on May the 22nd in that amended first phase program so as Richard says it's all within the 72 million agree with her a few changes it's not directly related I know you'll tell me the green on the maps shows cycleways stroke bus lane those cycles and buses are sharing the same part of the road generally speaking not always I mean in some cases the greens just been used to show either a bus laying or a cycle me okay thank you very much no also didn't know that's good so that's the answer the question they will not be okay no right ah Danny I just um I have to say I think we try to do too much on every Road just this just looks like a disaster if you think of the old Litchfield crossing carpark the lessons that we should learn from that if you think about having tram tracks cycle lanes bus lanes cars car parking it this just seems to really really change and add a lot of confusion to the central city if you take children street for example that is really concerning they have buses going where the cyclists are going I'd invite anyone to go and look at humphreys drive very Road where their intersection happens where you have cyclists going one way and cars going the other and it's quite dangerous and very very dangerous so this I just don't think this is these are good designs with all due respect I think we're trying to do too much and a cycra way into the city is the road that all of the pedestrians and the cyclists and the buses and here's the road that will have the cars so I'm not comfortable I can't vote for these to go to consultation knowing in my mind that these designs are actually really dangerous and will not actually provide a good amenity for the central city I just I also think about the cost and I'm not convinced that this is really the top priority for our spending if you think about the amount of construction that's still to happen in this area what we're seeing is that parts of the city where we've got construction and sometimes demolition the footpaths are being absolutely destroyed and then left unfixed for years so the concern I've got is the timing that if we were just planning lanes down lines on the road call spend a little bit of money do that but in terms of these significant infrastructure improvements ahead of construction of buildings it seems like we're just getting to spend twice the come back later and fix it so a number of reasons why I can't support this those are a few for clarification we're supporting this to go out for consultation we're not approving the plan zone so dr. people all right those opposed do you want it recorded jaani jaani spoke to cliff against ok that the reports the whole be dr. close in favor of Chris say aye those opposed carried the metropolitan small grants fun
The other part of this debate it's on page 303 in the supplementary and it's the ratification of the housing Accord that will be yep oh yeah we've already did that actually I think yeah yeah I did it while he wasn't weren't watching moved so seeking did Jamie stop so good never so secretive Andrew okay can I just put that maybe no no I I just really want to just to point out under on page 3 13 I'm other areas of joint action under 22 Stephen so it's really important to stress that this is a starting point for addressing the housing in our city but as was mentioned earlier there's a number of other things that we need to also consider and work with government over and I just wanted to flag that you know under 27 of they called we've got that opportunity to really progress some of those other things that we know are causing distress to local community so um yeah yeah let's thank you okay Andrew I'm just for the sake made in the other record yeah can we move paragraph 4.2 and make it into a 5.5 yeah or copy 4.2 making into a 5.5 and then change the last line to read the council confirms that it would not establish the entity or make social housing assets available to it without such confirmation and it just makes that all everything else subject turn the prop of that confirmation thank you good with it that's the same flaws as last time I'm Chris going into 5.5 yep yeah it's the same one we've just adopted okay yep yes good again can't believe she sees um I've look all I wanted to say was um and I didn't get a chance to say it before but it's important that I do and I wanted to think Vicki for work on that I want to think the hearings panel and a big thank you to staff the other thing I want to say is I enjoy working with my colleagues around the stable yeah yes the time and the reality it's that you you've got counselors songs that have different views and that's democracy and we've bloody boring if we always agree all the time so I've exercised my idea of credit right put saying on the table and I respect what you do and thank you again to star for this work quite fair Jen yeah okay can I put it with that addition those have we got that addition quest good on you you good with it android cool okay it was moved and seconded I'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed cat sorry and those are put you have to wait till I say those opposed and then you say no okay do you want that record it too yes okay because we have gone past one o'clock can I seduce that we have a break for lunch because I'm hungry and you from PR do and two o'clock is that ok guys I think we've got about another 20 minutes to knock it to knock it off but I'm not suggesting you do it now
It's that therefore so he'll be adopted thank you thank you thank you and save the social housing obviously this is a report back of the hearings panel and comes with a raft of recommendations which I think there might be a few minor changes being sought to well can I just start on page 22 17 2.1 that in the second line we substitute the word part or for a proportion of yep council so you you're okay and that Chris you got that I'm just making sure that day yep and then vicar just won't show so I felt I'm sorry a proportion of yeah 3 a proportionate was it or a portion a proportion purple shirts in the legal yeah yep right and I just want to check it seems to me if at the end of at the end of that paragraph 72.1 if we can also add in terms of the the accord or any other council lend does that further yes yep so I know maybe it'll be a two please draft is only trophy record right think you also had that the council's contribution to the entity contained in the housing called a Nightline 17.2 one yes did you want to add that this weekend write the answers contribution to the entity contained in the housing accord and then the other addition I've got is under 72.3 that we in the last line of that it goes that any surpluses reinvested in councils social housing a second of fun no no because the surplus may some surplus may go to the entity so it becomes the entity social housing okay I believe it there there are some other while I'm speaking for it to some other suggestions I've got and that is that under seven 2.2 we take out the although it sees two options were discussed that which we actually take out the rebate part so delete were we can just delete that if you like it's just really the I think I think if we delete all that probably is some bits just seeking you know he's we've just taken doubt oh so just delete the winning a note of what was discussed and it's just seeking clarity which may which will arrive anyway that's really cute blend options I can't keep anything nice race lite um I'm really women it out so it will be another Shakey's oh sorry it will be delete the word to it will be up in option discussed it's just a procedural issue just want to given that there's gonna be some amendments to this with us so we could sort up over lunch and deal with when we come back and deal with some of the other stuff that was least kind of big cuz I yeah I mean that was just another suggestion hey I thought we might be finished before lunch obviously optimistic in my okay um no no no just a minute can I I've got I've acknowledged Andrew and then Glenn I'm going to go through to one o'clock anyway and just see how do I we get but I because I think most of these things have been sort of that Jonnie Andrew okay on page 34 is yet to be confirmed by mb that the proposed entity really capable of meeting the requirements registration as a community housing provider although it will have access to the government's income related rent scheme for current tenants now clearly the whole point of establishing the entity is so that we can take advantage of the IRS so I'd like to also add that Clause 4.2 from the supplementary agenda into the recommendations here because we wouldn't want to do any of this work if it didn't land in a position where we were able to take advantage of the IRS so it's just right yes okay so did you want it in here or in the supplementary no I want it here it's already in the supplementary but I want it here as well okay fine so so Chris if you look at 3.2 on page shopping 304 what can you just add that in as a seven point two seven is that right Andrew yes so that we make everything we're agreeing to hear something like to the otherwise it's not otherwise it becomes the whole thing becomes a pointless exercise it's absolutely and the other thing I'd like to do where we've got this note on page 24 the hearing hearings panel notes the preferred option of the majority of submitters I'd like to strengthen that to be something that we actually rather than just noting something that we actually put there as part of the what we're adopting and so do you want that included in what page you know seven point four point three is followed by a paragraph so this is on page 22 to the hearings panel notes that the preferred option of the majority of the submitters was the I think what we need to do is to have counsel noting their right as well just do we just need to strengthen that so if we could make that a seven point four point four you need the word requesting the for capital injection that was just okay can I just deal with the first one so seven point four point four on page 222 becomes it becomes with proper paragraph rather than just in civic thanks for what you got that Chris okay right a twisting a capital injection and sorry it will you now pull anything paragraph last line preferred option of submitted for requesting a capitulation ok so seven point four point four Chris just becomes the paragraph below but it says the council and the hearings panel note and everything then except down to second to last line the preferred option the second preferred option of submitters was requesting a capital injection write fiction from there Vicki B from the housing subcommittee to direct on their tour would we do that now there's a requesting a capital injection from the central government that comes from the housing subcommittee for hips whatever it is well so what we're adopting is actually the entity is but requesting the kid capital injection that was a word the castle note that that was the option that's not the option that we're going with the option that we're adopting is the one that the majority of their yeah you can do that changes right Jimmy The Wiz review the page on two to one in the page on to 237 point of white the third bullet point in here the last sentence one specify the other at least two cohesion of 1000 additional unit but into page 221 here they didn't mention cuts dalglish in there and there was as you recall from the early it's tough there was a total agreement from there from the hearings panel on additional units they didn't want to say a thousand or 950 or 1100 official o is a school of parliament lesabre country only included a comment so know that this is what's come back from the hearings panel yes it's their recommendations among the hearings panel they didn't want to tie it down to 1,000 and they wanted war 900 or 720 that just put additional units so it's a change from where it was earlier and minor change okay thank you okay are we right Andrew yeah just questioning where my comments about paragraph 4.2 ended up the I didn't see on-screen so sorry four point four hey I'm so the part about I'm sorry it was that not done a story is yet to be confirmed by mb blah blah hire counsel confirms it would not establish the entity or make social housing assets available to it without such continent away right um and we not had that initially yes sorry but matter that might need to be seven point four point five and I'd suggest changing the wording of the last sentence council confirms that it would not establish the entity or make social housing assets available to it without such confirmation hmm um can I think that covers it then can we just yeah that fundamental to the establishment of the entity is the exes to the IRS yeah I think they say council getting firms that it would not establish the entity I'll make social housing efforts of able to it without such confirmation comes this doesn't it Rhett okay yep clear I'm on all sorts of things what would you like Jamie you don't mind Christians now offers additions are in the your questions for we've been alone just go back out to see them to when I just want to check that the please yeah no that's okay Scott you're good Glenn you good good good questions Jamie it was just it was really close to the main ones one was around the 15 million you got there for the red zone probably I just wanted a Pepsi are could provide a bit more detail around exactly what that's going to the right I'm just a wee bit unclear on that actually all that stream artist is that we clarify that issue it's being raised as a question it was raised as an issue it was raised as a question by one of the submitters and so all we want to know we don't even know that that has actually ever minuted in the council books so we just want clarity so that we know what the situation is and then once we know it how do we resolve it or do we resolve not just as true your ratify though when there's issue actually yeah so we're making a decision before we have clarity around that's the only thing that I'm just leave it no no this is within the capsules own finances this does not impact on their housing accord or the sub or the creation of an entity okay this was the taking of 113 residential red red zone units the money was put in apparently perhaps I don't know to the cost she rearranged no I don't yeah yeah so it's just clarifying the issue it may not be an issue Jamie and it's not okay one that may be more of an issue for me though is that I what I really struggling with is the seven point two point one contained in the housing of cool comprises up to 15 million proportion of bar below you can read it all there I find that really vague what exactly is that somebody might look like where is it going to come from it's just it is too assumptions I guess in there where is that actually coming from I'm think that's spelled out in seven point two point one from a proportion so it comes from social housing either land from social housing potentially other land it doesn't come from any cash and it doesn't come from rates but there's no business face around I don't know if it's possible it's just there's a lot of hands and possibly and you know that sort of thing it's it feels I just doesn't feel very tangible concrete so the council has a large portfolio of social housing but it and if you look at the changes on page 3.11 that section of the housing Accord says the council will progressively capitalized the entity or entities with an injection of 50 million of land and other assets and there are two possibilities one is land and or social housing transferring from social housing Christchurch City Council to their new entity which is about social housing and the other possibility is that the surplus that's made in the entity could form part or and as in the supplementary could form part I I get in tune of it and I see I see if I was just property but what worries me around this is you know this can't_''_848.8 be taken lightly and just right here words like could and possibly it makes me nervous because I just want something a bit more tangible and I need that as a decision-maker I wonder if maybe Peter could clarify will give me some comfort then so yeah I'm very happy to ask because I go there the very clear intention is that rates like social housing is not rates funded that it doesn't become rates funding but that it also doesn't I appreciate that but if we don't have anything concrete it's hard for me to a cave in my mind and assurance that one the case I just wanted to clarify on the the rights issue and particularly around that or any other council land so that if it's other council land that we've got on budget to sell then we're expecting to get that as a revenue through and that is instead to the housing portfolio would have an impact on race so only in that instance would have ever rates except perhaps if there is 15 million dollars that's transferred out of social housing and so that's why it's important and clarify second point absolutely yeah so that's why those possibilities will need it thing is I it's still not strong business case though it's a it's a list of assumptions that say hey everything should be cool no no question that okay so it's the quiz question is is there a business chasing can we have something more concrete than assumptions well it's sorry I do you want to answer front from my perspective it stays very nicely within the social housing portfolio has no impact on rates if the other council land isn't considered if the other council members in seven point two point one then it has the potential to impact on rates and whether it does or not as a wee bit tied to seven point two point two yeah I think seven point two point the need to have that last three or four words and seven point two point one okay so would you like to suggest a change a change in that or I mean that's obviously the root what the hearings panel has suggested in or that's not a decree that okay shall we put shall we put because the herans panel was very clear on this that the intention is that social housing is ring-fenced and that rates do not subsidize social housing and social housing does not subsidized rates that was our clear intention throughout the way throughout their hearings because a number of people came and had assumed that actually rates funded social housing for its 70 years so we were clean keen to dispel that myth and would it be more helpful if we put that as a seven point two point one that the intention because that was quite clear throughout the hearings panel that the intention is that social housing does not subsidized rates and rates does not subsidize social housing said of fear I think to put yes additional a civil court to that so to see it's it clarify your point sort of it I guess the only the only problem I've got with it sort of comes into that land when you know if someone says you know at a governance level and then goes on to say a whole lot of micromanagement type things just because you say other governments liberal beforehand doesn't make it so I my fear is that just by saying okay wrong is it then doesn't give the hell though it says that you know it in broad terms it could but we don't have a business you know you well okay just to make it really clear and shall we put or any other council land subject to the determination of seven point two point two would that be sensible so that if if 15 million worth of of social housing assets have gone to rates then we might need to find a way to address that yeah at such that social housing is not subsidized by ratepayers and that ratepayers is so sorry yeah and that it does not yannick responsive raised right sorry Ben or any other council land subject it so we're on the bottom of seven point two point one now Chris subject to the clarification of seven point two point two can we do we need units the woods after that she jeweled for demolition or indeed we need those foods in there because that we restricting us to only use those or with units yes I think it could come out just yet we don't need them yeah so delete that after units sorry just come yeah can back up seven point to point to reveal and or with units yep after you and then delete scheduled for demolition or intensification young okay so if it remains so just in seven point two point one it should read the intention is that the social housing far as social is that social housing the council's social housing is not subsidized by ratepayers social housing continues to be not subsidized by ratepayers that's not very good English as it will fix their and it does not subsidized rates okay that first new social housing but I just don't quite understand in seven point two point one what that does in terms of things like development contributions what it does for things like you know if you take the central city for example if we built social housing we're given private developers rate subsidies around dcs but we wouldn't do it for our social housing so it doesn't it doesn't seem to make much sense to me I think the key thing for me is that the operational aspects of social housing oh no the capital where speaks as well actually haven't been subsidized by rates I my understanding from when the social housing was first built that it actually did was part of that hey no just actually an injection from the government I think remember those days was nineteen fifty eight so can I just ask a question of staff what this means in terms of practice because there are other things that we that we do as a council that do provide subsidies to housing developments and are we cutting I'd say yes I just think the phrase subsidized by ratepayers is so wide and doesn't doesn't really make much sense when we tryna offer and seemed to us to get housing bill so the only disease that we've allowed other 10 million in the central city and there's not that much of them left I don't think it's going to be a big issue the new issue for what diseases that on each development we can now do what we call development agreements which work out how much subsidy council will provide towards infrastructure this is how much will charge possibly in disease and so it's really technical but ok can I suggest then continues to not be subsidized by ratepayers except with those subsidies are available to all ratepayers set sensible I'm not keen to put it in rule I don't_''_1356.58 I think we want to be very clear that social housing is not a rates function so I'd much rather leave it as it is if they miss out on dc's bad luck actually but what I can't private developers would get right places but yes there is that logic there is a problem with logic in it yes yes professional sport can I just respond something young is concerned that around the developed cut did the disease that in fact that would be a slow way of actually adding two million which over here at time years ago it so that's why I thought it didn't need to be included there yeah I think the fundamental one of the fundamental things that came out was that people think this is rates funded I'm very clear very keen to dispel that myth because it always places social housing at risk and among other things well and also because it's not true so I'm not keen that we I'm happy that it's not subsidized it's just tough for the cancer clean I won't just on that the flip side of this actually because people are happy to say this and I'm not debating but just pointing out that the flip side of this is selling off the s it got to be present yeah okay are we on questions of revisions or yep seven point two point one with a which is not subsidized by ratepayers could we just made it by rights because everything else you're saying rights yes so let's just keep it really simple and straightforward which is probably not now but later yes and I don't think needs necessary can it just can we take out the remains as a separate fund that remains unsubsidized by rights or remains not sort of Austin's not sort of all rights as like the sea okay leave it untouched that's me it's fine because we've gotta run defense fund I think that we should qualify as a community housing provider and I think to continue hammering that point time would only advantage a case right clear clear enough good point okay are we ready to actually debate this or what maybe even move it yep thank you just one final question if I may maybe with other staffers as well as Peter it's just over the ownership question I just of lease we are retaining one hundred percent ownership of their land and buildings and actually the 4951 split is in the operational part I just need to be this Accord so it's really least something you still own it is you do yes both we still own the house is it there is this understanding that if we go a hit with the operational sell down that represents a total so down so we're just talking about an operational yes but yes but in terms of broad ownership of the assets between really hain ownership and least the entity yeah okay except for any housing or land that you put into the entity yep obviously and it doesn't have to be 49 51 in terms of the entity it could be forty nine 20 31 PS or something effective okay okay this probably should be moved by somebody who was on the hair he's been off clin falling okay okay right you need to bait or we have at green fish I'll say a few words I'll try not to be too long stand up for this too
Pirata item 23 there's another three items and a bit in committee do you want to just keep going and knocking out before lunch you what it's like then you and what time do people have to go to way it's anybody got a lunchtime engagement keep going keep going well let's keep going for half an hour and see if we're going to make it okay and it's so item 23 are you desperate for a smoke it's really good for you not to smoke Jamie yeah okay we're going to see if we can finish by one right okay item 23 the earthquake mirror really fun okay move journey while he's here sika did yani yep ah ok it's a really quick question isn't it in terms of um I just note that we've just had him in my back about the Scott statue which I'm really came to make a priority and I I just wanted to check whether for council projects we could apply to this fun wish you makes to be excited Lee so the Scots ditch oh we could possibly seek funding for there no it's not a building well that the woman world yeah I've done a legal view that's probably not a family was opened the council but I would follow it up follow the real quick so I don't have a look at it and you'll get back to Jana here ok right thank you Andrew I'm just to add some comments that the banks peninsular war memorial is owned by advanced peninsular war memorial society rather than be known by the council so that's probably a point of difference between why this one would fit the criteria whereas the scott you wouldn't know it has it's got two criteria one is about physical building one's about social building that the I've just gone through them at some length it's actually got to be physical going on okay I put these was it moved anybody yep I put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried
Hill Road seawall yes you do the specter sphere for the require email and skirt did consider a local a chopper to replace me existing concrete retaining wall which was effectively a wall on top of the whole pile of rocks and basically they decided it was not an appropriate resilient structure to be rebuilt so they looked at a couple of other options and I think one of the ones and they're talking about me but a game development from an earthquake perspective bass boat at a very low Brazilians so the Oscar come up with there's a high resilience now what that half-witted Edmonton if you want the heat stone approve all those technical recommendation rock wall or the rocker foot and basically Lara to a galleon and that's an additional Diana Diana replace a very resilient all I sorry I expecting very resilient solutions and that's as far as your other patients 4.8 million and so it's an additional 500 so they're not going to move on that right so okay so can we just get clear that the more expensive there's quite a lot of information flow and a whole lot of emails on this some time ago that's right so we've spent almost a year trying to get resolution around I'm getting in a great design it doesn't it's not perfect in terms of I don't think anyone is now one hundred percent behind it but as the best of we can throw all these issues and coming up with a solution so my understanding is there um yeah people are are are agreed that this is the best solution in terms of meeting the community needs and restoring the levels of service that were previously there for the YogI's that actually used that area and the really the difference was the heights so that skirt initially proposed to take up quite a large percentage of the actual underwater space with the infrastructure repair and that was what's caused a lot of the lab so that has taken a year and I think the only difference really is around how funds it I still personally find it difficult to accept community said no that's not acceptable because it doesn't replace what we used to do there that it son fearful council to pick up the difference but since we don't have control over that the hug group I I don't see what other opportunities we have other than take it through this allowance Haley and I just want to clarify with Dave and staff in relation to that the models or the options are being supported now to do they infect a help sort of maximum it was run coming from it's awesome concern about what one of the that there was insufficient would be sufficient photo to as you called it to prevent scouring and interocean I just want to ensure that effect with the options that in fact that some being addressed that's why understanding the function pretty much the same from a resilience point of view from what you once obviously has got a long list it the other Glenn and he Mele yeah thank you I guess from big on Haven heathkit his free hit I trust it have been expressed from the original design how much had been taken on board by way of hydrological considerations for the life of the of the history just heard about resilience as well I mean it's been quite difficult going through this whole thing involving some exciting meetings but it sounds like if all the stakeholders are happy with what with who there that's good now the financial implications is another matter and we'll have to work through then yep it's tell me if there's already been discussed when I haven't been here but I'm 5.2 the additional total cost for the alternative design sorry go back 5.1 the total costs to construct option one is 4.8 now re 4.7 how does that cost relate to the splits that's outlining 4.7 does that make sense for am I speaking no no that's there so so that you're asking of the 4.8 would this be 40 60 is that the question Alec yeah but basically that's gone through that so let's see that's what the agreement is about cost sharing is that that 40 60 split goes up to the hall point eight million five hundred option on top of it things aren't that's what that same well we are providing a solution that's resilient for us it actually does all the functionality there are some additional community things that were raised about the council wants to who that they see that as so a hundred and eighty sorry a hundred percent of the 580,000 is the city council contribution if it goes with that option and then it gets forty percent or seventeen percent depending on who the partner is of the 4.8 yep does it make sense it actually depends whether it's in GTA or not is the split with key actually no it's not your equation long it's a huge amount of money I do think it needs to be good that we're voting on because he decides on the 4.8 million so and this is obviously one of the priority works that they've got to do yes oh yeah waiting to approve to proceed with option one so you want the 4.8 million option which is done through the heck and I don't you've had not yet doesn't see the little or the yeah and then or we add the go for the other option which seems to be more favored by the community groups who've had quite a process which adds 580,000 all right those two options of you know basically 6.1 is we just go with what the head Scott projects and so you know here subsidy audits so I was saying you the option wouldn't cost you actually 508 it would cost you 500 nine a 60-percent of it because basically things young hot money sounds ugly the third option is actually bringing it out of the disillusionment destructive path which isn't really a fund anyway its borrowing we know have you noticed that he's woken up wings quite animated now right okay I killeen thanks for letting me have another go right I think it's interesting what we pick up in these conversations debt for Princeton fig doing what is I would say I would pull pic frames it is betterment and I think yarn ER and I on the same page over so it's well you need an overall we're not going to change that today so you've really got a choice of if you want to go with the second one then your options are six point two or six point three page 202 the resolutions the staff advices that teach you with lose sixty percent of the 580 if we took it out of it across your agreement if we went with a 6.2 we'd lose sixty percent of the value of 580 because we'd be taking it away from other projects that would qualify for that subsidies thousands of money about yet it means that there's no potential the other side that's why my that money goes as far as I can for the government so rich that money from the government in from our perspective is but I think um so and we're choosing between option one and four on 202 we're not choosing both is it correct option for which can'm sorry if you just look on page to a 26.2 and 6.3 say approved to receive with both option one an option for what it should be saying as a probe to proceed with option for yeah I don't know what option one is included should this is it quite right okay and so right good spotting can I just ask one more question of staff is what was council's position at the head group in terms of their request for the funding for this when it went to the head grow the horizontal projection governance group did counts are put forward the position that there should be this was option for were seen as the preferred option that should qualify for a subsidy MV funded through the cost share okay no we can't also they're there anyway we've got we've got the situation where we either go with option minor option for and then we choose how we found option for if we go with that I'm happy to move six point three and six points respect to that three sir 6.3 yep um I just want my make the opening comment that this is this has been part of the problem particularly at a local level where the design around these projects and undertakings to do them have excluded working with people at the start so if we've managed to have a process a normal process like we'd have going through a community board we can actually see feedback from people before the commitments are made it actually speeds things up this projects been delayed almost a year and a half because of the inks that the original design cause the original design when it was presented at the Community Board my race concerns at the time that it was seen as being the cheap low-cost option rather than actually the option that would restore what was previously there and I think that's really at the heart of this debate now I feel really angry that we can't change the hague decision but I accept that you know we need to keep this project moving and really unless we take it out of 6.2 through the to do it which is through this facilities and infrastructure improvement fund although this is not actually improvement this is about restoring a Lisa level of service than what was previously there the techs you were sment but it's a high it's a lower evil of women than what the original option was and that and that's something that has taken a long time to get agreement with the community so I hope you'll support this today I'm sorry that my colleague isn't here because I know he's also been actively involved as advice spending a lot of time trying to get resolution on this and I do think you know fundamentally it's important to go ahead with 6.3 I personally would have liked to take it out 6.2 until I'd heard that that would actually cost a lot more than that than the money because of the the way the saturdays work so I just that this might go through if you just sit right yeah ok ok it was seconded by were seconded counts Licata it any further discussion right ok let's that cause
And so we're on to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole their council committees stuff on on page 181 and the worst couple of little typos are that we pointed out to us so 12 point 10 for example as changes the code of conduct to reflect the changes out later 12-point a date which was the littleton recovery plan and which is probably not with our outlined beast and was there any changes that people wanted and wanted to make yet where are we good clean I think I plot it's just just the sorry other workability of the two big committees on the same day at the moment the community and housing committees we have people on both on the same day the moment they do struggle to get from one to the other thing and I think that what we were looking at doing was just trying it and seeing it work and if it doesn't changing it is that is it ok feeling yeah that's covered for the 25th thanks Mary yep important that we are able if we choose to same day that I've print these meetings are propagated to go all day so we're going to decide this on the twenty-fifth anyway sit right Mary yep ok so you get to do that then anything else can I just ask there's another number of other working groups that we've got a service which aren't mentioned here do we need to raise that now is that something that can be refined as part of this process tubes of different so we really have bet on the 21st it was any that we identify cutting ended need to still be retained will be nice to you on the treatment as well and can I just understand the two of them ears powers they've got this power point the chair in the established the committee but not the member show but there's another week in groups that have been set up by the mirror as that kosher or was that at work okay so that comes 25th um and just sorry I just wanted to just note that we will get some financial information prior okay oh this other point is you assumed staff and ok and that is with whether some of the subcommittee's could be like working groups to make them kind of like task focused whether the tech called a task force or whatever but just some in terms of a network effect costs too because someone won't necessarily need to be like a committee or working group on an ongoing basis they could have been working for a specific period of time thank you ok can I put this thing okay it's moved y ou moves and seconded by to put that those in favor please say aye there's post carried and right item twin
And okay item two spits part police moved and seconded those in favor please set up jack not really yes yeah it's just a question I really support listen principal but public access to toilets and changing rooms is that guaranteed as part of this 3 development as far as I know we have had discussions with the life saving club that's a very strong community minded group the membership is going from strength to strength it's really growing they will have the toilets available for the public they hit they did want to actually partner with a couple of other organizations out there but and so they're welcoming anybody else into the building as well that will be used for functions too so I don't see any problem with that Jonnie so is it possible that I mean given we've given quarter of a million dollars towards this project and we were about to write off another 130 million is it possible to get some 30 million mother basically saving the money for demolishing it because it's not up to scratch a grand right right okay so just I mean I just think I'd really look feel more comfortable if we could get something and writing around what the public access will be enter the toilets and changing rooms because it does seem like if you've got a facility right on the beach it seems kind of crazy that you wouldn't have so can we just maybe that we can ask staff just to follow up so you would like stuff to follow up on ensuring that there is public access to the toilets and changing right the other issue was I mean there are safety issues with 24 7 lose and I don't think he's saying 24-7_._111.689 le well no I mean open to the public we sum the club we had toilet seat sumner we actually own the toilet so that's a secret so it's a it's attached to it but it's actually got super access which as-as-as good but you could be opening us up else I don't want to slow this project down I really like the idea community minded and going to take responsibility for building at but I do think in terms of this is about us effectively giving away a facility in a neighboring a community group to take responsibility for it with quite significant financial contribution I don't think they'd have a problem was that request of it was an informal requester just to ensure that the toilets would be very McCain so will you undetected to get that from the community board do you want to do it that way yeah I think that would be good okay thanks I'll put that those in those in favor please say aye I supposed carried and now Part B anything in Part B not that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried Patsy cookies that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried that reporters a whole be adopted moved by cattle across a second to capsular Joan what that those in favor please say aye those posts carried and we've done the Finance Committee
I just apart idea of the main lost road bus lane extinction which was discussed laborious sleep I'm sorry occasionally but for a long period of time so we have a proof that it was just a few traveling north on the main North's road and at some author Oconee saw his arms just keep the bus line to carry on over there under section was a safety measure so proved it isn't like unanimous okay so any discussion on that okay moved seeking to those in favor please say aye aye those opposed carry
Back to Shirley pepper knew that right BAM cheer mike davidson is unavailable so he's asked me to speak to this thought so we're on page 137 now goes yeah I think the party's already been dealt with yep note on page 138 3.2 the flooding issues been civil road so we still currently need an urgent update on that because it is life-threatening situation so just bring it to your attention again I ton point five on the same page notice of motion was submitted by myself just an update on that that we have held the community conversation this week on Tuesday night was very successful well attended and the community has loudly and clearly pointed us in the direction that they wish to have a combined multi-use facility siting in a combined multi-use facility a community center would you like to endorse the Delhi having they want I combined are you slowly lives at home haha yes I identified we're a community center was possibly a little outhouse cinema space in there a swimming pool a crash etc so the next step is community preps adopting the successful model that brightened used out there but the keg so I just I think it's really exciting times for the people of Christchurch when we getting these sorts of activities going in this engagement going with the community they they may wish to put a burden for the ltp but the community is really willing to get behind this and get some money organized there are options between to you have two sites that the council does own and send ovens there could be a way to rationalize those sites that the community board will take that forward with the community did Jordan me I'd all I want to do into that was as Pauline acknowledged at the meeting as knowledge publicly as well the priority list of facilities requiring the Piron rebuild did not feature a heck of a lot from sant albans in there and you know it's not about you got more than me because there are other areas that clearly means something more urgently Vincent Albans and we recognize that but what the community has done is said center is what we need long-term and so we need to start to look ahead so these aspirational ideas I saw you Vicki you when we see that theater or cinema I mean we asked them to be aspirational but there's a desire and a focus and the community to source the funding themselves as much as possible so we're just getting on with a place of them yeah be successful um now also page 139 6.1 and this part of the district plan with you the council engaged a coffees geotechnics to do a report on the land at Belfast and that reporter is not pretty that the land is very poor it's prone to lateral spread lip perfection in flooding so does anything else even wants to throw in but I'm just highlighting there in wonderingly that we should be looking at using these this type of land to residential so I think that's all on that part okay can we catch up with movie and pate we've already done that be it's right yeah like it that's pretty concerning is like we've got their report that says lands pretty bad I'm sort of having horrors of some of the subdivisions that were built and some of that the new subdivisions specific park was it so what's the outcome from 6.1 in terms of getting some progress on that because I don't want to be responsible for allowing people build on areas that are really bad made perhaps it could be that the community board makes that as part of this submission that might be the way forward just to highlight it I think it actually needs more more direct action than that I don't know if any staff member can comment or providing each way forward it could be made available to the district plan review team manager and then we can bring it into that process as part of the decision-making and I can form part of the 632 cost-benefit type analysis I happy to receive that information and I'm sure it fits into the DPR prices do you not have that information I made Brigitte may have it so identichip with that she knows it's there okay I think yeah I mean it's that would be good I think we do it can take some we can we just leave that with you that you will find that information yep it's it ok you're ok with it pulling ok thank you sunitha house and heartbeat not I'll put pat be those in favor please say aye those opposed tired and patsy those are all of these are moved fully and see them did Ellie put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried that the report is a whole be adopted again Pauline Nellie it's almost sounds like 11 named Pauline le Pauline le ok Pauline Elliot would you like to move the next one school right
Berwyn pics this community board of the 18th of august moved by Glenn seconded by Jimmy and there's no pet pad a items anything in the park be no we we will have the notes rightly it's something I can't all right okay I put the report as a whole those in favor please say aye as opposed to carried and then we go
Where entry is not here I've been asked to fill in a new place haha well you're already here very good of you very brief comments oh can I say thank you yes you can easily do to the council for meeting in the ward and I think for the big affirmation that was given to the community over the eastern reckon sport complex any Brighton just to say peps offer something real without being negative people have been pushing back over the state of the roads for some time and despite the fact that over 500 million of skirt covering 105 projects 195 projects has been invested in the ward to date and the fact that roads the last thing to be fixed know that that still is a hard thing for the residents oh I've had a check with our staff and with phil and I'll just see whether what we can delve a bit deeper into some of the issues the right ok so we're on page 27 ok first beer would pick us this community board and and glee and move pet a items and this anything in the rest of the report if not I'll put the report as a whole those in favor please say aye I was close Carrie
And at one point one here I'm not quite sure if this has been done I asked Carly earlier to see if there was any advice on there seeking agreement for the uber thing to go ahead with him with staff I think there had been a few hiccups and we're just checking to make sure that was all able to go ahead so understanding our property consultants have been working with this group to some time and in meeting with the group's planner so staff counsel Chris can come back with an update around the work that's happened hit me okay to the community pool and meet people yep do you want it to go to the community border of the council because they submitted to the council as well and timewise it doesn't just know that its name to go so soon as possible which means probably straight to counsel yeah as much as we might please come into the community board okay I'm important that everybody hears it yes but a but time wise for the community it's probably better that's coming up for you a bit later on page 199 be jeweled road seawall music board has had a briefing on this but hip has passed no resolutions we have some concerns as a board over the fact that while a like-for-like was costed for the beach for rachel's road seawall and the approved design initially was less than the cost which is fine the new design is more than the original prove design but still less than the like-for-like and yet the council are being asked to fund the difference and we think that that is a non we think that that should be covered with in the agreement because it's still least in the light for light cost so with it's the best outcome and provides the like-for-like with the immunity value for the community as opposed to the infrastructure value so your community borders in favor of the one that has the extra five hundred and eight thousand on it it is because it's the best outcome for community in the amenity gallery to the community is retained like four and like-for-like that was cost of initially right thank you for that because it's quite a confusing report actually it is even if it cost is actually not in there the original like-for-like car okay and are you I'm sorry are you on there just before we get on to that can we get rid of Mount Pleasant because it's sorted and should be right okay so can I just this is moved by yanni and obviously the 1.2 is dealt with and their urgent staff advice course to come back to the council right okay seconded by Tim you need yep so I just wondered if you could just um in terms of um it's from the board from the elected members exchange that concern has been raised around the laces and run hagley park do you want to just sorry no I just want to deal with and with the memorial yet with the map it isn't one first before we get on to beachfl and hagley park or whatever okay it's just it's not covered it was covered and it's familiar I just put this first and then you get on to the rest of it so can I put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and then you want to deal with heavy part because um I think it's just the chair chips as it's not really honest it's been raised in terms of the discussion at the community board and we've asked whether information about four times now to see things like the nipple courts have come to us because it's hagley park it's within our page the the Christ College lease has come to us and they had leoville didn't and as it was in the previous counsel to him but there was a question over why they didn't come to us because I should have is part of are they at least with an hour Ward and so we'd be asked for the information many times I've had phone calls clarifying our resolutions and we've still not received any information on it okay that's not going to be very helpful decision but just as a general rule in terms of any leases unhappy part that's within the ambit of your community borders that here but it's not just for this particular one but like the original work being done on higley over the lease stuff neva came to our community board and we've asked why that was and we still haven't found out right okay okay I'm not sure what you want us to do about it just now yeah okay so carlene's noted it and we'll look at it okay that's fine because it sounds to me as a thorough sort of delegations need clarification for us as councils to maybe there's a crossover hi okay anything else on there doesn't the beach feel stable now that being a decreased right but yeah sorry sorry yes because this this might save a bit of time later and thank you I'm glad you mentioned that just a check with all the stakeholder groups have seen the weather you know without heavy city under modified oh yeah so this came halt work while kimba community will read further and the new proposal is one that has been agreed to by the community stakeholder groups if people just want it done because there are people who are waiting to rebuild their houses on this area and they can't get it done until this you know some sort of seaborne those kind of things are sorted so yeah okay 10 I'm you mentioned before that the light for light was more expensive then the Harrison azle yeah yeah so then the option for which is again added option one an option for that the third one and the more expensive of these boys in their diet that both low cost and the original like like yes oh so you're so we've been told that because the original approved design is still releasing the now for food one but council has to pay the difference we don't get it so yeah so you were told originally that the like-for-like was more expensive than this preferred option yeah and so somewhere along the line something's changed and they councillors only one voice on a panel that decides how to costs it about yeah but just to clarify that originally the light for like was more expensive than option for and now summer it on the line some things have changed and now the same that light for like the original life life is less than option for okay you're right sorry there's two ways we can deal with this guy's because we're way outside really what's on the report from Peggy 30 there is a report on beach ball which if you want to we can take next but or we can just deal with the risk the community boards which won't take long and then do it okay which might be the easier way of doing it but there Dave Adams and more want to make some comments about in the clarification of those costs and things would be really useful because they're not currently in the report right okay I haven't got anything else on the hag ether in the community board does anybody else know awesome thank adopted them all but okay thank you can we go back to booooored piece
It was it was a it just seems to make seems there is this very little space on the road this cars parking lot needs to cover the board has already made a decision to put no stopping on one side of the road and put parking in switch need that one way approved by council so so the board recommendation is the staff recommendation it is I'd noticed last night when I was rereading us that the port recommendation is an itchy and okay so we'll just June be here yeah so we just put the board recommendation as the staff recommendation yeah okay move to Yanni and seeking to other it's right you want to speak to it I'm just a slight amendment I'm at the board one of the issues that was raised up was the whole this is really good from a traffic and parking point of view but what this doesn't always addressed the urban design in the wider area and there is still an outstanding issue your call the presentation we had from the tannery almost a year that were sought and so given that we've got possibly the cycleways but we still haven't seen the site web plans going along here seems to me that we do need to find additional resolution and the board actually did ask that there could be some consideration given to looking at how we could enable those other things to happen like a foot bridge over the river or bus stop so I just wanted to move an additional resolution that we approve 6.1 and the addition would be that um we asked for a report to come back from the and I think would be the urban design strategy and planning around the wider strategic and amenity improvements available in this area and that leaves it pretty wide open but I think it's important to signal that we want to support positive things happening in this area that we do need to have a bit more of a high-level look at it because this whole Road in corridor is really really critical and river corridor is really critical to okay can I just ask me and her and it is quite wide never you find out is that there's a if you've been over the bridge there on balance right but it's very very narrow there's no safe pedestrian access over it and it's a whole pile of issues there but it seems ETA and not just this what they're signaling to you jaani is that they wanted around this the tannery basically it's what you're talking about anyway isn't it well I see what we could do is just ask for a a possible landscape an amenity improvement report along the come the terrace river corridor and then that would be quite clear and I think Glenn would probably see condemned am I right yep ok so teletrac tilt against us know that the council resolved to request Owen portion that's right I precrease a report with a landscape in a minute II plan for the wider come the terrace River corridor landscape an amenity plan for the cam terrace for the common interest corridor and Laura door yanny for the whole of containers come the you'll see from um if if you look further through there's a party in the report with some other things are being done along how motorists further along and really I think the community was really keen that to look at if you've got cycleways if you've got immunity improvement that we do have a coordinated approach to it okay you're okay with it so we're talking mainly around the tannery which is there it would go from witherton areas you think about it going around to work in a way farmers that hole that that kind of wider river corridor I think there's already some good news they're both county and I work the open history eat I trust a gym st. castles has been voted on to the crust so in terms of that kind of interface with the community I think it's already off to see good okay can I put that without addition okay put it those in favor please say aye those opposed carried ok I'll Tessie compact here I just like to comment on made by counsel on the ballston community library and we had asked that it be added to the priority list and well we haven't had a meeting since then is aboard I'm pretty sure that folks briefs I think as appointment for this community group who have been operating in a cold small Scout Dean since the earthquakes and right yeah but obviously the council is not going to support this having just released its current you're already done there yeah but we're going to start planning our way forward for the society so that that's all fine and can I just suggest that we well obviously it's it's a ravine and gone it's been a goal yep so item 2 is not and what do we do just no no we know what the board's hoping for but this priority list has been and gone and being announced last week so it's this receipt relevant can I just suggest because the reason of having this resolution was to inform that report but it didn't get carried through to that report it seems to me that the way forward is if you look at the master plan for ferry road the action around the Walston community hub as a medium term priority I think we could possibly just change this resolution to say as part of the ferry road massively and we would ask the first become a priority can I seduce given how little is now lived in the betterment fund and that we actually will want to go through what else can possibly be done and that make sure that wilson is covered in that second thing I don't want us going through there who got who got up next and therefore they got her RT no but we're now looking forward to so can we do and so it's this the fury road master plan and there was some funding around me just right so the ferry road master plan has been approved and the only reason for raising it to bring it forward there's not to make council give a budget come up until it straight away but is to get of those priorities can be considered we've actually got that work done too and for it okay but this is a completely different resolution than what's here so it's not not what the board has passed can I suggest that you start that work come back to the council next month with us with a different resolution with the report that supports that resolution yeah because this one's a wee bit brief okay so we're not I didn't we haven't adopted item two I don't know whether we so know what we're supposed to do except out item to accept yeah thank you Smith so we're dr. pate items except with the exception of item two okay moved yeah nice ikan didn't fill those who favor please say aye those opposed to carried Part B that mean yannis already talked to some of those deal with the amateurs but issue we're moving now to page 105 this is all so um can I just pop up the first yeah okay this is a team she'll probably to we're at a community board level we get professional lawyers coming and making presentations around legal matters and if you look for this is on in terms of 16 we only had some great stuff there we didn't actually have legal people able to deal with her so I just wanted to although you know obviously we lost that in the community was happy to pass it anyway it does raise a question that where we do have professional reputations from lawyers that we have appropriate least immensities at the board to be able to deal with some of the concerns and I just wanted to draw your attention that this is actually over a private plane change and is actually around letting the developer not get a resource consent will not do the work that they were supposed to do as part of it by by approving these parking restrictions so you know it's a pretty big chunk of the contract so it's it's a point that Colleen's obviously good in relation to the legal ones okay thank you that that reporters a clothes carried and then you put around not quite sure why this is super it no I don't know how they live in mind but this is an Edison based on a deputation that came through some of those people have already been done my point to for example the funding he's been given is that one of the priority that while my judge is really good
It Sarah I know Andrea is not here so I'm leaving be with big assistant or right she and Sarah welcome thank you very much and there are xx items both Cyril have been dealt with yet another boards and ho the first one on page 71 as a proposed prohibited times on roads and Austin in bromley the board was heavy with these and then passed the staff recommendation should be adopted it's an area that's had had a lot of trouble and we can have any issues of that so okay thank you moved yani seconded Pauline the report do you want to speak to item 1 upon the point that spider hypocrite raise I do wonder whether there needs to be at some stage a review what these things are put in place just to check around how they're being enforced um counselors will be aware that there was a incident in the bromley area around quite a large number of cars congregating and the way in which it was handled I think was challenged and I think police were found to be so I'm okay to support these today but given the concerns that we've had previously on the other community board I do think as a council we need to think about maybe trying to meet with the place and just talked very how they're enforcing it to ensure that it's been done in a consistent manner where there's problems but not in a way that is impinging on people's basic rights because these are quite significant in terms of restrictions that could be put on people it's my work force do you want to just do that or do you want to move anything here um I think we can just do how many accurately Justine do that yeah I think when sprayed and he's get report comes back maybe that can be added to it okay Tim I know in the militants pray let him sit amiri where we put those restrictions and it has really changed the young burden on businesses with regards to costs of broken windows and soon he hasn't restricted that passage through there for many costs that some of them were occurring to the point of almost being breaking point for many of the businesses because a lot of those businesses are affected and large businesses are small panel beaters etc and they are no as a breath of fresh air for them in their survival so it's really important for not only to hear from the council staff and please but also those businesses that are affected that's essential okay so um I'll put item number one got it moved and seconded those in favor please say aye those opposed and carried item two with the board recommendation it's moved yani seconded Lynn no problem I'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried item three item three was I yet we've covered it yeah been there done that ok so there's also that particular entirely now we have more things in the next meeting yep so moved you only seeking to Pauline the part be that those in favor please say aye those opposed to carry that the report as a whole be favor please say aye those opposed to carry think so I'm from the twentieth of August we give a request to you that we would quite like a small section of camel road outside the tannery I'm tuned until one way the long-standing issues in
Me sticking to the le know any debate not I'll put the whole book report those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you very much indeed well thank you sorry to keep the set on fir
Very with it Sarah and Val had been sitting there very very patiently who wants to go first though so we're on page 41 Pendleton by Maori community board welcome though thanks morning I've got to that ace the first ones they prohibited time zone lives around the airport we've gone over this at the convention board I don't see any problem with it yep and the second one as the lens swap on page and 45 yep at McLane's Island Road we've looked at this at the community board and we were happy with us as well okay so any other issues you want to raise no okay okay in that case can I put pate item one moved by Jamie and seconded by Glen put bit the prohibitive time on roads in the airport area right those in favor please say aye those opposed carry item two road stopping Lynn swap for new roads complains Island Greg clone sites and Jamie and and glia moved everything and item till put that those in favor please say aye both post Part B items team is explained in the agenda I pushed in smoke utensils I'll put the whole Pat being closed in favor please say aye those opposed carried and that report as a whole we adopted which I think I forgot to move for all the other ones so for all the other ones if I have forgotten to move at the same people who moved the one above it move and so you didn't so big absol approves them all and the second one of Pendleton my mary FL knocking apparently it's not their own capitals okay okay move
Hey the risks of the rixton welcome community boards by some three here no problems where there is no longer need to speak if there's no problem we're good we're on your side bring it on it's good okay we were okay Jimmy wants to move put that those in favor please say oh sorry also you can get those in favor please any debate thankfully say aye those opposed Clary Part B and this notice of motion items see them this is great sorry can I just ask somebody does just notice of motion on page 129 and the middle end sub division create any problems don't give me a chance to me would you like to give me a back breaker me to give your background I'd really like the staff and put because we all read it and we understand the flooding issues but I just want to know if it creates any problems that are not apparent because there's no there's no report on it there's no background provided um I can't offer back Bri under fine are you guys aware of it you're not aware of it at all you only only aware of it now I I would like to defer it if I may about deferring it because it was complicit was contained in the resolution at council passed in relation to our flood task force yet and I think we need to be clear about that before we make a decision on this fat so so we have everything aligned so can we defer that to next month until we have some staff reports on it it's what I would suggest I'm not happy to vote on something that I just don't know the ramifications um madam mayor and councillors I'd become I'd be comfortable with that as the movie because it was just a way to actually bring an issue to the attention earlier in the stage rather than later so it's just being proactive met amiran counselors than reactive so that's that's what that's where it came from right so can I move that and Part B this is any an item 7b deferred for a month for staff reports are obtained seconded moved and seconded bowl okay what they're those in favor please say aye those opposed and I'll put the rest of the report they hold a cup be those in favor please say aye I suppose carried right thank you Mike thank you very much
Some part a is the 44 Canada Crescent easement for the fiber optic cable we didn't have any problem with that at all but when we actually went to look at the site it was very very difficult to identified with no street numbers and it's clearly been used as a business for quite a long time none of our board members were aware that there was actually a road designation through that area at all but other than that we're quite happy for the for the cable to go through so there's a business on this road is if you have a look at that is it worse there is his bit operating there okay okay can I put that can I put that one Jimmy moves Jamie seconds put that person physically sick I those eyes item 2 heskett's road and think you've met a mirror and counselors and as you're aware of the history of the site and it was purchased by the by the City Council to to remedy some aspects of noise that neighbors them and found to those properties and the rural zoning of those properties is quite interesting historically and it's rural 5 zoning which is the most sensitive rules own noise seats that the rule resigning that you could have and it happens to be right beside a motorsport park so that made it that made it a bit difficult work from right from the word go so I think the city plan process and met the mayor and councillors may be an opportunity to have that Landry zone and then if the City Council we're of a mind to sell it sometime in the future no doubt its value would be a lot higher if it never rule 5 zoning so come that's just to point the other the other point I'd like to make in relation to that too is and one of our previous submitters Sarah Hannah mentioned the the interest of fulton hogan and you can see on 4.5 for their report on page 117 that thought David interested in an ni extracting greville from from the site directly opposite these properties and would like to to for the same reason so I think there is some a reason to be concerned about that and 4.19 and relates to the sport and I believe there is still opportunities if that land isn't sold in the immediate future for a sporting activity not on may I say not motorsport and but I just don't want to say what it is yet because if a little bit commercially sensitive but there is interest in a block of land there in that location for 40 for sport so far and we did consider what's the best way to handle handle the seven and they agreed that the best thing to do would be to hold off see what comes out of the district plan review and then take it from there so thank you so we basically have your submission on net and both submitters just even though one of the semesters as part of your organization but she wasn't appearing in that role yep yes imagine me not to staff what sort of staff would you like if we sell these poverty however the French council have any legal liability is my first equation Ivan well he's generally is general all-rounder okay the issue with pc pc 52 is that it isn't mediation there's members have heard and these sites are not they're not part of the open space 3 zone which is this prime area affected by pc 52 but they are directly affected by that plan change because there are restrictions on what that land can be used for as a result of noise restrictions so I mean I I've come here in response to the original recommendation of the board to delay this sale until the district plenary review is over so there are two points you want to make one is that pc 52 1952 one sets operative doesn't go back in for any more hearings so it goes through the mediation and three and it's a doctor by the Environment Court and that is that it doesn't come back his face to the district plan review and the commissioners the hearings panel we have nothing more to do with it so that the the properties are of course rural five rule 5 is part of phase 2 that it is difficult to untangle the use of future use of these properties from PC 52 because they are affected by the the noise restrictions emanating from the car club facility I've got other comments to make that the answer to your question is that pc 52 is a mediation yes these properties aren't directly affected by that mediation but there is a risk that discussing these properties could yeah you we do run the risk of contaminating the media mediation by discussing them back okay but having said that and from a planning perspective I don't think you know selling the properties as necessarily or delaying that the sale is necessarily an issue provided that the future use of those properties is properly protected in respects pc 52 I mean whether the land the council owns that whether a private land owner owns it is probably not the point I mean that's not the point as far as the future use goes that is the future use of those't have houses on them and they can't you know kind of activities which generate more noise that's basically that they can't even have houses though no absolutely not no answers I mean Justin may walk point on this obviously but their houses will be taken away you mean that the reason the counts were bought them was to get the houses out of there because there are subject to an acceptable noise okay okay one Jimmy another person you a little bit confused you mentioned earlier pc 52 the mid asians result is absolutely direct affected by the plan change but after you explained is non business with the phase two of the dis dis swim plan the review yes what if it is a it is a quite a delicate distinction here plane change 52 mainly restricts activities on the rua pune car club site there are lots of rules that are also at fixed properties in the rural five zone because it requires sensitive noises of properties to be insulated so it is it does touch upon those rural properties but the point I isn't really a fit PC 52 and other than you know whether the council wants to conserve the rect control over the future use of them but if a future landowner acquire these properties they would be though they would be restricted as to what they could do with those properties okay so that have to be they couldn't be housing it couldn't be any other noise sensitive fuses and they certainly couldn't generate any more noise they have to be very benign as far as noise guys because that would completely contaminate other than all the plan changed 52 noise restraints so you've got very scientific noise calculations under pet and the pending plan change 52 so any other noise activities at go in there will completely blow plan change 52 apart and we'd have to be starting again so whatever here ever pc 50 of those properties are used cannot be used for any activities that will join generate significant amounts of noise and when does the decision expected on PC 52 well we are going back to mediation again in October settle then a consent order could be before the court you know well before Christmas if the parties do not settle then the Environment Court would need to sit down a hearing date which could be later this year or early next year and a decision would be perhaps you know six months away something like that and does is the key determinant in here the and the decision of the Environment Court or the settlement under plan change 52 rather than the district plan the the key decision really well as far as plan change 5023 goes that the key point I think is that once the plan change 52 is made operative by the council following the Environment Court then it then it doesn't go into our replacement plan what does it goes with the replacement but it cannot be subject to any more submissions that's the first point you know and a part of planche and part of that is the NOI those noise levels around rural pune in the rural five zone they they cannot be rican tested either right so the key determinant the district plan oh it is more relevant than the district play reviewing might be so in terms of and the rationale behind us and it should be there that given the that while we wait for plan change 52 or something rather than the second part of the district plan review well yes although again that the properties probably aren't with certain cabbie arts aren't really affected by yeah they can't_''_701.49 be affected by plan change 52 okay so it doesn't matter much but it's it's a real it's just a real question of balance if you know me okay I'm sorry Pauline it's a question for all cheer might we've got no time frame in the early de field will it be a good idea to look at putting such a time frame were how long to defer it and one of the things also I like to prom that submission was not only looking at constraints on any future use of lead should it be sold to stop producing one always but actually it could be used you consider looking at some kind of a guide for the time frame then well I think gum as we discussed at the time and that we would probably prefer to see what happens through the district plan review and what opportunities there are after that and as I mentioned earlier if the if the if the zone through the city plan review was to be altered from from rule 5 that could make that lend a lot more valuable and if they couldn't allow activities such as light engineering or something like that so people living in there anything this you know so that's just it's all of those questions that we just need that can we be clear from Ivan can it ever allow that if the zoning was changed well yeah what a submission would have to be accepted by the hearings panel to change the zoning and mmm that will be assessed of its merits but whatever zoning was put in place would have to provide for uses very similar to a rural zone or uses whitwer activities which would not generate any or affect the it will affect the amount of noise that the canopy card club can generate so an answer to paulines question to you over at this time to you Ivan what's a reasonable period of time for us to delay this decision to the food at this decision what makes most sense well I mean I don't see any reason why you need to delay it and planting grounds but if he were to be late probably the mediation the end of the environment court process would would be the sensible approach I don't think there is a need is suited waited for the district plan review which is April 2016 yeah I tend to agree so if if we looked at sort of April 2015 to revisit it ah that one would hope that the the camera court proceedings would be finish will be four billion years okay so maybe if we deferred it until after the current court proceedings are finished would that be sensible that would provide a little more clarity as to yes the outcome of that of the plane change I just want to clarify like that and tues odious processes that cell turns the best way forward would there be any advantages for the residents who consumed affected by the noise if in fact it was delayed longer until the district plan was was reviewed by the commissioners if the sale the land was delayed longer well it might might enable other options to be considered through various processes for example I know that the deputation mentioned planting of trees that's something which is outside that the plan change 52 process really that's so that's the capital expenditure pro-q no decision for the for the council based on noise evidence as to how effective that would be but it I mean I suppose as long as the status quo stays the same the longer it stays the same the bitter of the residents will be for that point of view this one other question don't just in terms of say for example the plant planting of trees would then have to wait until the until the district plan was reviewed what could it happen in beyond the scope of plan change of the plan changed 52 proceedings that is it is a separate it isn't it is a mitigation vision but I need to get noise advice on how effective that would be but that is something which is not part of the rules or policies objectives or plan change 52 that is a separate issue did you have another question no just just sends it in summary there could be some advantages in terms of getting the best results by a longer delay in terms of health of the eventual outcomes and the virtual virtual results is it is that what you well not necessarily from a the paint from a district planning perspective I don't think it's necessarily matters whether the ownership changes in air or in the future and it but as long as the activities that end up on the site don't do what I saying before either create a problem out there which is going to either upset the Canterbury car club or the resonance ok I've got Yanni next in Andrew I just think environment I'm really happy for that just to be what I just I just can't see any benefit given that it's currently in mediation and we don't know what the outcome of that plan change is going to be so once it's been resolved I think will be a lot better informed about what choices we make and what questions are not ever stuff right enter yeah I mean I'm happy to move what's being proposed right there's fine I'll just did Andrew asked his question the just just looking at this in in a wide context it would appear that the benefit to leaving this until after the district plan review has been completed would be two things it would give additional certainty around future use of the land which would quite possibly benefit a better coming to the sale but more importantly it gives the opportunity for community input into the future use of the land as well through the district plan review process so I don't know whether and we can get some staff comment on whether it would buy time to do that and the little but involve the community more the rural five of the rural zones would be would have been sealed I cannot comment on the on the outcome over these submissions that would be made to those rural zones in that area but yes that would that isn't that as a possibility that you're suggesting that good okay no tight you'd had more information and it's always easier decision the longer you leave it the more information you hear you know it's a matter of ok can I suggest it we reaching an agreement under fearing it we're just looking at a time line on where it goes and we'll just do that by a show of hands a minute it's kind of like that deferring it to the end of the environment process it could still be revisited after their into food to the district could what we want to so it doesn't preclude it's still waiting for the outcome so so can I seduced as a motion that yannis just we start with that the council defer any decision on the future of properties and heskett's road which the subject of this report until after the current environment court processes have been completed if you're a favor of that vote for that if you're not will then put the one about the notification of the district plan review and we'll have a go at that one said okay as a process yeah okay that's fine I'm Tim seconding yannis probably generally wanted to but it's okay it's absolutely fine it's not a problem okay so that the what you this is not actually the board recommendation this is a resolution from the council that the council that and it's the second part of what's in front of you let the council deferring decision until after their current environment court processes okay move dyani seconded Tim can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried right okay that's obviously the but that's courage we don't need to worry about the secret thank you very much thanks Ivan
Oh thanks John let's go to and Pat be no debates you need to bait I put that those in favor please say aye Jimmy oh you want to move you move the report as a whole oh sorry Jimmy sorry so so the board words so the so you haven't captured the last one right ok so the wording was that the rixton Wigram community board and the council's desire I suppose it should be possessive boards apostrophes in the council's desire for these to be notified be passed on to the commissioner and it probably should include for these two quarrying applications for sites and roberts road with a net for these to desire for these to the but that you just took out yep put it in there yep yeah take out the notified yet to be notified and we've already passed their ok Part B put the move Jimmy seconded and obviously can get those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the next rickett and more grim community board on page 111
Moved to the Rexton welcome community board because this people who made sarah car still here but mike might come to the table mate and also paul us here is who might want to give information on the roberts road resource consent application requiring that anybody has questions on that okay Mike would like to very briefly introduce this I just said to get mezclas hierarchy of needs sorting that's so what you needed shelter this might have been the smoking to coffee that Demeter thank you very much for they don't appear I'm SS happiest I've eat up all night so I need something and thanks very much for the opportunity to resume their board reports our first one is on page when I think when I seven and the board submissions we've dealt with that one just part a and we're happy with the outcome of that the Roberts raid resource can send applications require e in as you're aware that some to queries planned for roberts road our board in the local community of got some concerns about the proximity't like those some people shut out of the opportunity to be able to make submissions on this because it is quite a lengthy period of time that the quarrying will be going on there so I just think it's fair as advocates for our community to request that serious consideration be given to at being publicly notified okay thank you is there anything else you want to draw to that each and because I going to get a quarter come to the table I'm in relation to the Robert Rubin no no just the whole report whole report damn just let me flick through there's no other pates no that's it oh okay thank you and so in relation to part a obviously PAP 1.1 has been dealt with under the spray tan heathkit community board because it applies equally to all community boards obviously an item to in relation to Robert's rose there is a letter from Phil Rogers who's here didn't come forward ball and his advice have you will received this okay so his advice is that the council commissioners for these applications so that the desire of the community board to have these publicly notified is actually passed on to the commissioners yeah is there any questions and this is addressed to john higgins so John and Paul are there obviously it's an issue that may come up it actually arose originally in the field of my Mary community board and are there any questions of either John or who Jimmy Dean Yanni then film I read a list and report my asking you and because based on the RMA actor the weather to go to a notification or not this either the stapler planar older independent of Commissioner responsibility to detection so if the independent commissioner said no now go to the notification or whether all those affected the residence my head you know the impact apologies issue so how to remediate insist yes good morning counselors as I understand the question if the independent commissioner who is appointed makes the decision that this these applications will be notified then they are open for submission from parties who may or may not be affected by the Commissioner seems miss this should be notified then it's open for submission from all community members no I score a lot and you've seen not if the Commissioner see is no notification then obviously that's what follows the Commissioner before he or she made that decision would have caused taken to account the requirements of the Resource Management Act they'll be carefully considering the issue of effects that might arise from the application and they would need to make a decision and accord with the Resource Management Act about notification all or not if somebody's disappointed with that decision there's only one real root of challenge and that is to judicially review that independent commissioners decision okay I'm just getting copies for you because I appreciate that you haven't got the letter from for Rogers to John and so I'm just getting copies a bit made Yanni so im- thing of the RMA is that there's a provision to publicly notify or limit limited notification based on Sukup special circumstances in your view would with these quarries make that text unfortunately I don't have the detail on the actual applications themselves all I understand is that the applications are making their way through the resource management process so I haven't turned my mind to the issue of whether or not the I'm should or should not occur just just in terms of their ability for counsel to use special circumstances to notify applications is it any general advice that we can be given on there because I personally don't quite understand why we couldn't use that as the reason to support what the community board had requested so we have linked advice on special circumstances relating to other applications but we don't have any year relating to the specific application but at this stage is just going through the process and being assessed and we are looking at obtaining a legal advice around special circumstances specific particular application can I just clarify Paul and John so if if we pass today that the community board and councils desire for these notifications to it for these applications to be notified be passed on to the advice I've profitez at paragraph 16 of the liter yeah I'm just getting the little poppet and that's that's my advice and that's based on making sure that there is a a correct process for processing the resource consent application okay thank you I've got Phil nice then glean that was right ok clin thank you this may be covered in answering that previously floor rabbit it's not the notification I have trouble with that possible precedent setting so that be covered off in the legal advice thank John that um if we approve the board's recommendation so you mean in terms of the board's recommendation to notify this application I don't think that so much here it's more there each resiliency notification needs to be tested on us on a marital affair and on the information spawning up a precedent no for other boards to do this and yeah for they one of the other take a look exactly what it's doing yeah I did just the only difference between paragraph 16 of your leader and what the council's desire as well as the community boards no that's that's available because the Commissioner ultimately will be making the decision about notification or not again okay um thank you are there any further questions or do you want to take couple sets too jaani does this have to go to a commissioner could let's not go too you know I think we've got petals of elected members or kelsey style-wise it going to a commissioner the the reason why we thought it was appropriate to go for commissioner was it was one because of the joint application with Environment Canterbury in city council so these issues there because obviously environment they'll be jointly here and jointly considered and they have their own they use commissioners of course and they wouldn't usually the members of create issues in that respect also in relation to this recommendation from the board is obviously would be concerned from the applicant about getting a hit a fair hearing okay that's fair ok can I suggest a way forward then and that the wreckage immigrant community notified be passed on to the Commissioner which is basically your suggestion and malisha okay if I move that in Jimmy seconds and I put that in debate but that those in favor please say aye both Post Kari thank you thank you very much
Great guys maybe we'll get through three or four before we go to there is a cup of coffee coming eventually I wasn't supposed to move the resolution to include the supplementary report which has caused 34 and open meeting about the housing Accord add Jimmy second self up there those in favor please say aye those opposed carried I'm just wondering actually
There is not really there's no items that particularly need raising other than the the prohibited times on roads we let that lie on the table because it didn't feel we had enough information that emotional presented was incomplete and really really to in order to abrogate people's rights to travel along the road we needed to have more than anecdotal evidence and I've been out with the police and had look at the problem and so have more of an understanding of it now and that the police and stuff we're bringing more evidence to the community board at a later date okay guys any discussion questions can I put the report as a whole those in favor please say aye those opposed carriage and we have to be with Pegasus but brings a cup of coffee available can I seduce step we take its 1052 can you be back here just out just on a little said now yep it's good for you yep
Hmm do you wanna have a cup of coffee before you get done I will deal with you welcome Thank You counselors and so we attention to page 13 we've got to part 8 items but you've already dealt with the first one in deciding against is TV so my information is you can't go back on that as much as we'd like you to so to quite in 1.2 and the board receive legal advice that approval the council would be required for community boards to make submission on the draft district plan and the board decide to request the Council's approval so I just just a few points the RMA and the order in council and around the district p.m. if you provide for community was to submit on a proposed plan and nothing and the district plan review process prevents or raises any issues any such submission the local government act does not prevent community boards from submitting and considering that it can be performed by any person there is an argument to say that it doesn't actually require the consent think that would be the easiest way to go about it so I know I don't think the council is given any sufficient explanation as to how restricting community boards would enable us to perform our function under Clause duty to schedule 7 of the LGA so I mean it's simply current council policy that prevents us from doing it and finally the commuter boards were created by Parliament to careful careful the communities and council should not attempt to frustrate the function without very compelling overriding reasons so I urge you pleased to support community board as a whole all of us being able to make submissions on that district plan review to the government appointed commissioners so to approve community board making submissions on behalf of their communities to the district but to the district claim hearing review hearings panel so right was I right and getting that okay good is there any discussion on that not can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed to carry all right thank you for was that council excellent and I'm sure that my at the last year's meeting are that we could all be very it comes up a number of other reports yep and so you know this doesn't end this report is just part b items and do some issues I know you're pressed for time so I won't raise them here and a number of issues how would you like me to move on to the next report please and they know very well I'm for people to have questions and things like that I'm just assuming given that we're not going to change at the rest of a that that's the whole of Part A now dealt with that particular report yeah yes there's no other ok I'm here is a px item which I guess you hit a nail around and we rented it I don't need to move anything awesome partay yeah well we can't change that yeah so we've done that one okay okay Pat be so happy and I just draw your attention to 4.2 well the mere board would like to Centaurus road I know it's like it's the backup for brown street but we're currently having traps do things like drive over roundabouts and things like that so that the board is interested to know how we might be able to use heavy traffic restrictions okay and a 4.3 just council or note to the council's importance as a housing provider of last resort and continues to support and it counselors rolling then commence the staff and and also continued frustration around the lack of parking permit process and you know the last advice we had is that the decision around that process was some time away that is the next year like November next year or something and we've been asking for it quite an Abba bleah for a couple of years now so I would be great if there could be speed up and and finally I remember ten that we else just to know the assists of our off the ground fund which is like a matching fund which is just like seed funding for we've brought in a criteria is initiatives and things like that up to two hundred fifty dollars very easy application process yeah it's been really successful sir so that processes is what all the items from that report so how do you do that process now so that the staff have delegated authority to grant the funding but it'll it's ran past us as a board okay Thank You Pauline you know just had a question on page 14 items 33.1 the gallons road lead and what is it currently used for so currently it is it's sounds like outdoor one and it is it was scalped in and it's the older powers school site I mean it here she is an old pool underneath so currently it's a vacant site that the community would very much like to be it functions as a reserve effectively and the community would like it to be reserved and they would really like there to be a community center and stuff on it in the future they're happy to mow it themselves it's fantastic so you've the board's just hasn't been finished yet eddington action actually have a lease over that land adding two nations who have a lease over that land in this long for 33 years no this no and there's just a process to go through and order for them to be be freed from obligations at least right looks good thank you okay okay can I sorry moved turn ticketed Phil let the reporters he'll be adopted excluding 1.1 she's already been decided put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried we do the risk of spreading fear okay so that we can let Paul go to work

Thank you and we have one more alan Wilson Helen I'm assuming you're here it's an individual feels right these that's correct so there's a send I'm I'm not a great variance with the board I'm at some variants but it's come I've had some calls from from residents and I thought I'd like to come and sketch out some background and some of the legal issues here and I've been involved sorry just before Easter and you're just a wee bit concerned about purses and um abuses because I would have thought those concerns have been raised at the community board and that would be taken background and I just assume that this kind of gets relitigate add and takes up extra time I check this at least art and there is currently no discretion to say as I understand that to say no you can't because you're already a member of a community board because they had the same concern so sorry Helen ok.thank over yeah and I've been involved with this counselor at the full record Emma Graham so I've been this has been going on for 10 years in 2004 was the point that residents came to the board and said we must do something about this noise basically then council at a certain point commissioned the marshal day report which was a lengthy report by a consultant on to the acoustic noise and they came out out of the long report and you may or may not have read that this was the noisiest racetrack and AHS Australasia and it's not just the the race meetings there's a training school there and so you have a race meeting which is noisy and permitted in the next day you get a single-car training going around the race track from sort of nine o'clock so it's really noisy and racetrack tooth there was a plan change to address that noise plan change for 52 and that is still being worked through a judgment was made from a commissioner and it was appealed and the two parties quieter please and the motor sports groups are in currently while I haven't been part of it obviously I don't know where they are with that but it's still going on and I don't quite understand how you can have mediation and then come in with the sale of in fact properties I think I think there is an issue I know it's separate and one way but it seemed would seem to me better that at the very least we wait till the outcome of mediation before we do anything with those properties the mediation may be sorted before Christmas that may not if it's not it got the parties can't reach agreement it goes on to the the Environment Court our board at one stage was quite keen on a sports precinct and the reason that cap that it wasn't looked at more closely by staff is that our sporting people and council our staff said there wasn't a need I cannot see personally how there isn't a need for a sporting code who's not who's not going to be part of the main area at so it's really I think you need to work through the legal issues on this I spoke to Ivan Thompson yesterday and he'll be here today to brief you but you need to understand should it be deferred to mediation as concluded can you wait for a district plan review what happens in mediation if the parties reach an agreement does this become part of our new district clin I'm advised it does but I think you actually need to get advice on this from our staff because it's white it seems to me complex at the stage my own view would be that you don't proceed at this point was the sale of the properties you work out the legal issues in my personal view as I would like it as a sports area to be left for for sport and I'm quite happy to support the residents view as well but I think we need more discussion about what can we do with what there's a piece of land it's that thank you Tim thank you um you've got to its the noisiest racetrack in undulation australasian my understanding was that vehicles at older kid meant to be about 95 DBA is that correct I've just picked up something that the acoustic engineer said that he was very clear about that at that point so it's a simple statement of just is the statement from the acoustic engineer is currently at that point anyway it was the noise what's that point it's 2007 I'm right so the the beer mash was historic that the comment could be historical it may not be current may not be okay um and I think the issue is that as he said it's noisy as there's not so much in terms of the noise the level of noise but how much it's used it's the it's the training days and the speed in the speedway in the ordinary racing car days so it's not may not be the noises as in peak volume I see me the noisiest is a seven-day use and hours hours hours of operation is now I love's it is has been a a disturbance astrologer Stevenson um do you know in return was first open and used no it goes back prior to my being on the community board which is 1995 okay it is seen as a motor sports facility there's no question about that and seemingly and we never quite got to the bottom of this the residents had lived in harmony reasonable harmony with the racetrack till 2004 so something happened in 2004 my guess is it was the training school opened them and that are you don't let's do it open every day there's a trick right thing that's my that's my surmise but so you started off your presentation by saying that in some ways you agree with the community boards recommendation in other ways that you differ from what I've heard it sounds to me that you actually agree with the community boards recommendation and what you've done is to draw our attention to some of the points made in the previous submission than previous deputation and also obviously given us more future use for the site but am I right in thinking that you actually do support the recommendations we've got it in the agenda tonight yes I probably have a slight difference about time frame I think you need to wait at least till till mediation isn't back settled I but and I don't know if you need to wait till the district plan review so that's an issue I think the council to work through what staff that is I'm just want to remind counselors that we're currently in a court process through mediation so actually asking and raising issues that are dealt with in that process isn't actually something we should be doing today I think we do need to respect the fact that there is a process under way to resolve some of the issues and it's really not appropriate today to be dwelling into those specifics because we don't want to undermine anything that's happening there so I just wanted to just make out thank you that that is a live issue thank you
Sarah hat and work right on heskett's road welcome and I method somebody's name sorry I'm gonna go gin Ritchey thank you Thanks welcome guys you know what the Wolves out and you're speaking in relation to the recommendation algorithm elemental we're in your hands just take a look here that's right wait start the time oh this change it yeah what photo with a sec so good morning cancel ask its road dispositive council acquired properties my name is Sarah Harnett and I am representing quieter please quiet please as a residence group that was formed in response to increasing noise from rural pune resulting from new yrs rules permitted by the city plan in 1999 a brief history as a result of residents complaints about unreasonable noise from her Epona the council commissioned a report by marshal day acoustics in 2007 this report shows the extent of land sub subjected to unreasonable noise these hair scott road properties were identified as being the most affected in 2009 the council is part of the package passed a resolution to buy these affected properties noise issue it through a poner plan change 52 is currently under environment court jurisdiction quiet please has been channeling its time and resources into that process and is surprised to learn short notice that disposal processing of these noise pollution affected properties is proceeding before plan change 52 is completed what surprise is quite a please is the lack of communication with residents we have only just discovered these properties are up for disposal and understand that at a community board discussions on this matter the chair of the record and Wigram community board discussed moving the go paths to Rapinoe quieter please would like to see the land on heskett's road used to mitigate the noise from ramona planting a dense forest has been suggested by a number of submitters on plan change 52 it would soften and change the characteristic of motorsport noise planting of trees has a number of other benefits such as preventing noisy activities moving in providing a carbon sink to offset the burning of fossil fuels for from motorsport providing a reserve for residents and improving the immunity of the area quieter properties plotting a dense forest as mentioned would mitigate noise from row Epona soften the tone and change the characteristic of sound if this land were to be designated and remain as a forest this would also prevent noise generating activities from moving in the council's favored option is to use two properties as a greyhound track and sell the remain properties on the open market after my demolishing the houses this has the very real potential of being bought by fulton hogan and quarried the fact there is of housing new zealand property in the way is but a small obstacle in today's climate all it takes is a checkbook a quarry would only add to the noise cumulative noise people become sensitized to noise and the whole cycle of angry people is perpetuated on the face of it a training facility for greyhounds seems reasonably innocuous however I have seen a report that mentions a PA system and bar facilities the devil is in the detail providing a carbon sink to offset the burning of fossil fuels from motorsport the council's own climate change policy and adopts a precautionary approach when planning for future activities and works that the council when developing new policies and projects take into account the effects of climate change where this is appropriate policies that initiate or support activities that counter the causes and effects of those changes are to be preferred that the council supports ongoing monitoring of climate of cutting so that the council supports ongoing monitoring of climate change indicators such a sea level rise greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sinks providing a reserve and improving the amenity of the area ryona is of course a public reserve with the current activities the public's actual access to this reserve is questionable perhaps this is a trade off what the people of templeton your chest and the surrounding area would like to see is some permanent good something positive to come from councils owners of these Heskett road properties we are tired of being used as a dumping ground for such things as the presence sex offenders unit quarry's drug rehabilitation unit increasing industrialization and of course a motorsport facility with very liberal rules which has believes very little effort has been expended in determining the effectiveness of using these noise polluted properties for noise mitigation measures either as suggested with trees or by any other noise abatement method quieter please request that the disposal of these noise affected properties on heskett's road be suspended and noise mitigation possibilities be thoroughly investigated quieter please believe the proper right-thinking end use for these properties should not be about financial loss or gain but should be aimed primarily at alleviating noise from a community burdened with noise quieter pleases proposal of a forest park would go a long way to resolving noise pollution that has been a major issue for over 10 years thank you thanks Sarah I'm the report today from the community board suggests not selling them are you at the stage are you an agreement with that recommendation they're suggesting what not selling them at this stage well we're in agreement with that suggestion but I suppose that is just delaying what will actually happen to the properties about whether it's the only decision that we make young today so but what we would like to see is okay well we've got ya thank you are there questions guys Jimmy a moment council is undertaking a kind of this tree plan review I want them in your kind of the deputation weather is also to make summation to the counselor t3 plendil review the channel Marcus we can make a submission to the district plan review but of course the rural zones are stage 2 so that you're not looking so you're looking at maybe feebly or later you know I understand yeah because it did yeah for two different face but yeah this apartment in the safe another face said I guess they you know the council needs to be discussing what options there after the slander in looking at admitting acting the noise from Roper using that land in a positive way because we you have to remember that it was the council that changed the rules back in nineteen ninety nine and an effect created the problem I mean I've been living in the area for 25 years and you wouldn't have occurrence in the dose is the cracks of the problem so the noise needs to be mitigated thank you thank you are there any other questions if not thank you very much indeed for a very concise and submission thank you sir
Do you want to just tell us the opening date when you actually opening the pavilion um well this is official open on Monday and in fact I think we've still got to make draw down our last lot of payments 220 loader from the contractor thank you thank you and we now have hands off Hagley is coming hi ma'am and just mad I think you know how the scoops I think welcome right thank you uh I I don't have much to offer on the ins and outs of the cricket trust taking over from Canterbury Cricket Association on this because I not too sure on anything about that and anything I add would just be speculation is the item are militant or what I what I am keen to do to add to this is that this gives the council the opportunity to renegotiate parts of the lease and in my experience when you change a lease in any way that gives the other party chance to come back I mean indeed the council can renegotiate with the government over the earthquake funding so the same time because it seems to me that the the original lease is way out of kilter I mean we've just heard that the Canterbury cricket is a business organization and yet the lease know the cost of the lease for this building is twelve hundred dollars a year now I'd like to pay twelve hundred dollars a year rates that would really suit me that's its this can be reluctant because this original charge was put on as a voluntary sport organization the sort of thing that you'd have for you local Scout Hall or hockey club and this this is way beyond that this is a commercial building in in hagley park and should be charged for accordingly I think one thing you have to put in there is that all conditions imposed by the environment court must be adhered to there can't_''_154.78 be any slipping out of that we have the council maintaining the Oval at a cost of 300,000 dollars a year surely you can look at that where is the sense in the council maintaining an oval for professional the charge for the grounds that's that's never really been mentioned and the the council should have a good look at that if the cricket in close and charge admission into the Oval there should be a charge for that there's already been a charge indicated in the Cricket World Cup agreement where the council have put a value on that of thirty thousand dollars but there's no sign of any carryover after the World Cup that thirty thousand dollars will be charged for the use of the Oval now I know that any retailer in town will be more than happy with only paying fifteen percent rent on turnover but if you look at one game say I mean according to Canterbury cricket they can get a twenty-thousand-dollar 20,000 crowd if that's twenty dollars a head there's four hundred thousand dollars right there and thirty thousand dollars isn't even ten percent of that so there's room for manoeuvre there and I don't think it's the council's job or indeed the the job of the ratepayers to subsidize professional subsidies should be removed from social housing so how does that stand the gains subsidizing professional sport in hagley park so I think you know just changing the terms of the lease in any way affects everything as far as I'm aware so let's get in and put some decent conditions in there and actually make use of what's going on and not have it as a burden on the ratepayers I mean it it was sold to a lot of cricket people as hagley park was eglee over was the cheapest option and you know I'm not a financial genius but it seems to me that if somebody else is paying that is always the cheapest option and in this case the rate payers are paying way too much a net bill should go to cricket for the use of the oval thank you hi Martin just I wanted your analogy of a private business paying reduced rates and that would be great of course you run your own business is it less slightly different with other sports being invited in the community into the or cafe for people to come in and all this that's true in the environment for the architect was asked when you were given the brief for this building was community use on the agenda and he said no this is a cricket specific building built to comply with icc standards for international cricket as regards junior football is using the changing rooms I've coached junior football for 30 years and I can tell you that everybody turns up especially the younger they are the kina they are they turn up in their gear there's no changing rooms involved whatsoever and in fact half the devil's got to sleep in the stuff you know and they're that keen so this there's no use of of changing rooms involved there will just turn up play and go they're using the grass they're actually using the ground they're using the ground yeah yep so that's the grass in the Oval not the the building itself the building is cricket specific okay ya mean so you can thank you for your deputation it cricket building that was built for to be a cricket building but you've got the funders of that saying it needs to have wider community use and at least that restricts that use to certain things do you have any view around in terms of now that it's there whether it should be opened up to wider general use community use rather than just the exclusive to Maine for cricket or the exclusive sporting related things that opened the lease yeah I'm sure the the the top story the the function rooms will be hired out and you have to take that into account when you're deciding how much a lease payment should be made I think an indication of that is for the Cricket World Cup the horticultural hall and the netball Center are both being hired and paid for by the council the rate of twelve hundred dollars a day which would cover year's lease so that's the sort of money that will be asked for it regardless of any freebies that go on in I don't know pumpkin societies or a I mean it has to be said it's going to be a beautiful building but you know that's the terms of the the donation from the Canterbury Earthquake trust said it has to be used for community use and I think they're going to you know it's not going to be a huge amount of community use there's a public toilet and then there's the change rooms and as I say that they won't be used in the winter as far as I can see okay so you would be open to having it extended to wider yes by the community if the rental agreements were changed to reflect the commercial nature or the community nature of such provision yeah I think that's going to happen anyway so you might as well get the money ok any other questions thank you very much more thank you ok
So the first two separate ones that we were going to be appearing separately an hour coming jointly so that's the cricket once you guys like to come up to the table and am I right in assuming that you're appearing joint leaving yeah okay thanks thank you and so I'm assuming you guys know how this works from your recent experience but there's a ten-minute period and the chair is quite tough on that because there's four to get through before we serve on the agenda and so will what you want to say and if you want to allow time for questions needs to be incorporated within the 10 minutes okay so thank you both and thank you for combining I'll be a wee bit generous because you have combined we're in your hands thanks Lee also don't mean my name is pre and ball on tibbett can be critics paint perhaps I should start because at the moment can be cricket of course as the lessee of the oval it's the only part of the contract with the for the assignment you're aware of the completion of the facilities of a global and I can say that that's been a fairly large impost on camera crickets resources in time and of course the trust as well but we have got in my view our world-class facility and headley and as I said the Finance Committee last week you might ask why we are agreeing or the appliance assignment two reasons one of course is the trust themselves and so I'll explain have got condition after me with their funders but I think also should clarify what do an opinion scripts last week about this being rather complicated it's actually very simple as a brief issue this council applied to will cut hosting rights for next year that was conditional upon facilities being constructed by kelly recruited and that in turn was subject cause to ask resource consent and Alicia Muskaan cyl this council agreed for the considerable case you go direct to the environment court and deferred the lease issue as you know the descent was granted the lease Pacific can it be triggered the funds for us so they have raised all the funds from funders and we in organization delivers cricket only we believe we make a contribution of the community of course of providing facilities for youngsters on the plate trigger but we are cricket body and I don't think it's appropriate listen should going forward hold a facility like this which is a benefit to city of Christ unit secondly I need to say this that as a business organization we run risks I think we've done very well in life user made profits consist like the last sort of eight or nine years but there are risks among their business and the resource consent process of course obviously imposed you know a huge resource on our air azuz so we run risks well though we don't believe I ever be sort of fatal but it seems to me anti sensible that what is a city acid I will class s it should be owned by a separate body which does not was not subject to the risks of the business Lee run and I believe that reason it was finished also by saying that we need to be very clear what we're talking about today we still be talking about assigning an existing document not as many variations will change they were assigning an existing documents truck with the chemical already owns from the council's point of view is absolutely no downside camry cricket remains liable throughout the term of the lease the only change is the trust will become the occupier management facility the can be equipped will always be Leah if there was a default by the trust so effective now got two bodies you can look to if there's a default rather than just one and either if we believe that there is no downside in fact consumer up slightest council a group assignment thank you thank you crane does anybody else leave or yes yeah chair lee robinson I chair the canterbury cricket trust so John Henson sitting here is a trust member and the other trust members are set out on the document before you as crane has said we we were charged with the responsibility of that once the resource consent was granted on the 13th of august last year and in terms of the council's commitment in the agreement of july 2013 with cricket world cup we had until the 29th of november last year just over three months to raise the nine million dollars I've overly recall the last day of that requirement where we were waiting for a letter confirming the funding would be available so that the council could then confirm its commitments to cricket world cup to hold that tournament and Christchurch in the course of a new year we received the various funding documents from our funders and it became clear that they required more than just us to advance the monies to candidate cricket they required us to own the pavilion and run it and on that basis we seek the assignment of the lease because of the building sitting on the land owned by the council so it's as simple as that we we become a party to the existing lease can't_''_345.13 recruit it remain liable as we do there are no change of have wider uses and objectives in our trusty that contra cricket do so it's appropriate that we hold the lease for the wider uses of that facility thanks Lee do you want question sir okay preserving the questions thanks simply thank you and good morning good to see you again after the when this came up in the Finance Committee today I've just got a question of clarification over the terminology used on page 175 now our agendas which is that the first page of your letter in were right through you talk about the see see a but in the legislation change I just it's just for kept for clarification does it become the ICC which is a government formed or rather a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands so that that's in the amendment order 2014 so just are we talking about the the CWC or the ICC the ICC level that's international cricket naughty we get runs crooked shout the world the Queen world cup is a I guess subcommittee charge to run the world cup right so looking simply the ICC owns the world cup rights right and they have a corporate entity formed and in fact as to one for australia and new zealand and they have a joint board and they can come together so your contractors with cricket world cup cricket world cup and out of that and the ICC stands aside as a separate entity to from there they really appoint them to run for them right the host countries are always appointed yep okay okay so thank you for talking with us I'm just a little we hear from Salters Co attached to to our report is that some costs that have been ordered against going to cook it would it would be would be paid by the middle of August on this one a clarification of text we go have been told and full it means like thinking thank you any other questions you need thank you I appreciate that it's the funding agreements that have led to this request for a change have you provided those funding agreements to our council staff No and one of them is see a reason why they wouldn't be disclosed but there hasn't been a need to do that and or a quiz to do that I guess the question that roses in my mind is because we don't actually know what's in those funding agreements we're being asked to make a change without actually citing what the requirements are for those funders well you're a contract between the trust and the funding entity now I mean other than we giving a commitment to the council the family raised why would you need to look at those well you need to look at those keys because if the funding agreements are different to what we expectation is under the lace or the agreements we've signed under the lace that roses a slight issue for us well we're not different I mean that the point is that the funding when the public funding was applied for it became clear that this facility could and should be used for wider recreational purposes incredible so the obvious the obvious requirement of these funders was that a broader's just it's just a sensible way of particularly of public money so what I mean the list does not change at all right so what sort of events do you see happening at a volume between what the cricket the current cricket association could have and what you could do in winter for example is junior soccer aziem at for this facility the changing rooms were available for all recreational activities that happen on the on the old cricket is I think 70 days of the summer so there are all sorts of it I mean don't forget the council still owns the oval the council manages the oval it's the it's the discretion of the council subject of the cricket rights that that granted for what the overtime I must be within the terms the weights we can't change that purpose of use which has the reserves it so do you see that I should have oh you will be used as a kind of general function sentence well we're all restrained by the by virtue of the divisions of the reserves was put in the least very similar 2013 that can't change and won't change rule we're what those requirements are and better what's so what's your understanding of what those requirements are under the resume it's a recreational facility it's it's an Associated recreational sports facility and ancillary users okay we're all aware of what those requirements are and it's appropriate in our view that in our focus view that the trust is the entity that manages that thank you thank you are there any other very short questions if not thank you very much guys there is a another submission on that same subject and and again it's not until item much later on the agenda item 20 and I will take it a bit earlier because there's been to some two delegations on it but thank you very much indeed
Welcome everybody and a special welcome to members of the public who are here I'm going to declare the meeting open and the first item is apologies and obviously we have 14 million and one from ref and one from Paul and one from David and so good that the rest of you guys okay the first thing that we have is deputations by appointment we now have poor
Um the neck the next resolution that I'll move is that the the set separately circulated reports be accepted onto the agenda do I have a seconder for that term scandrett I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the updated reports here sorry yep
Right thank you very much just before we move on to the the committee structure I should say to the to the council that we've released the decisions I spoke of earlier on around the real rebuild and repair of council facilities and the amount that I was looking for earlier on and my comments was that we've announced a commitment to over 40 million dollars to fast-track the repair and rebuild of priority community and heritage facilities across the city and banks peninsula and the the totals and in terms of an explicit number 29 million 87,000 and fifty-nine dollars for the repair and rebuild of community facilities and a further 11 million 703 596 for heritage facilities and I know that that's certainly been received very well it's a shame that I didn't realize that it was going to be released before earlier otherwise I would have done that while everyone was still here because I think people would have been very pleased with the with the facilities that have been announced there are a number obviously in this area this work to a new brighton there's work to be done and clear clear park there's work to be done and cut Bert's green there's work to be done in a number of different parts of things but one of the things that I did want to announce and it was sort of a rose out of the discussion that we had on the weekend but it was confirmed by counsel before the weekend is that we wanted to show the people of New Brighton that the council is absolutely committed to the project the legacy project and that we wanted to and it's not all of the money that will be spent on the legacy project because we have got an expression of interest out to gain some you know gain an understanding of of what people would like to contribute to that and some of the ideas that people will have but we have set aside within our borrowing facility I hastened to add five million dollars for the new brighton legacy projects so that as an absolute commitment of the Christchurch City Council that we a result of the experience that we've had and I'm really pleased that I can announce this on the fourth of sep tember and I wish everyone was here to give a round of applause thank you Paul right so now we'll move on to the committee the report on the committee's and I've added in a couple of changes to some of the committee membership through the resolution and I will move the resolution and phil clearwater will sicken the resolution I know I'll just died identify that there are a couple of changes that have been quite explicitly made in relation to the timetable so the I mean the this this decision of where this carried today will go to the next council meeting which will formally appoint the chairs and and and the committee members that we've identified not all the committee members have been identified at the stage and certainly for some of the working groups different councillors have indicated an intention to get involved with with with ones but not the others and so we're working through constructive way and then once the chairs are actually officially appointed for both the committee's and the subcommittee's then we can develop terms of reference to sign off for the council meeting for the twenty-fifth of September so by the by the first of October we will have in place a new committee structure that I think will serve the city well as I said it absolutely ties on with the resilient cities framework but it also and enables council council laws to spend a lot more time with their communities around individual projects but also listening and working with those communities and engaging with them in a much more upfront way so I'm feeling that we've we've got things working pretty well and we're asking the chief executive to look at a proposed time table and schedule of meetings which I think people will find a lot more strategic than what we've been doing up until now so thanks very much for all of the work that's been done on that in terms of the change of membership the only significant committee through to the communities committee and to add him as a member of the strategy and Finance Committee the housing subcommittee will ask for a specific report back on whether it's more appropriately framed as a task force and I think that that might give it the impetus that it needs in terms of the priority that this council was placed on housing so that's something that will work through as well but I think everyone for the significant amount of time and effort that they've put onto this proposal and are there any questions and and if not I'll open it up for discussion no questions I'll open it up for discussion Phil comments I think all together the whole new shape of the committee's will as Lee n seed allow us as a council to be more strategic in a clear direction and focus and I think also though the new structure must allow us to continue to work collaboratively and and and also I believe it utilizes the skills and knowledge that people have and I think that in terms changes but I've got no doubt that if counselor here has as a leader and there are lots of areas in which all of us can lead out on there's lots there's so there's so much to do as I guess we have been saying so and I know that the whole thing needs to be added to by way of very clear terms of reference for each committee and that's yet to come and the same with the delegations for each for each committee to and all of those other parts are important for us to attend to at any X meeting yeah pull in and then Ali really but a question about the timetable for the meetings yes so I'm not happy with the the two meetings been on on one day I envisage these meetings would possibly go at least and to the other half of each day and I think it should still be possible for counselors to attend other meetings too if they wanted to so I'd be supportive of the infrastructure transfer environment being separated a separate what we what with what we're suggesting is that the chief executive come back with a report on the on the proposal I don't think that that is actually included in the resolution so we're not actually passing a resolution that supports the particular time table that we have there but I will you know just in response to that I'm trying to reduce the number of meetings that councillors go to so that they can focus on the you know particular areas that they are involved on it doesn't you know I mean if there is a preference for one over the other then I don't mind you know that we work that through but I don't want two people left on one committee and everyone else on the other the timing of the meetings not result yeah no no I know that but I'm trying to I'm trying to make it so that people don't have to have meetings every day of the way I'm trying to reduce the number of meetings and taking it off a create another day they people have to be in the council building rather than focused on the I know that could well be a trade-off that's probably through the discussion yeah but but it's going to be a point of discussion because we've asked the chief executive to come back or the timetable so we're not signing off on the timetable that's proposed we've asked the chief executive to do some more work on there in consultation with the cheers and committee members great good um thank you no I just wanted to endorse what you said about getting into the communities and I might have indicated that by my impromptu whoop but um I just think that when we started when we were elected something that was made very clear was opening up the council building and the council as a as a as a business as an operation to get you know bring people into the building as well well it's also just as important that we are back out in our wards and meeting with people face-to-face I know that with people on the phones and there's nothing better than actually sitting down and speaking to someone face-to-face so bring that on soon be great yeah and it's also on the issues as well not just in your wards so right across the community and you know that this proposal has the ability for us to set up ad hoc committees and subcommittees or other subordinate decision-making bodies as well and it may be that there are issues that come up you know I you know I know that I've talked to you about the eqc an insurance stuff and maybe that's something that we want to be driving in a different way and you'd want to take a leadership role in that so you know that's the sort of thing that we can do in a much more focus way rather than establishing something that's going to create a mechanism that sort of drives drives on and there are a couple of things that I just well one in particular that I just wanted to highlight because and I will probably do itself but this this mural quality regulation review task force when I was minister of commerce I undertook a quality regulation review and it's about looking not not internally within the council but is actually about going out to business and talking to them about what are the regulatory barriers that are stopping business growth and I see that as a really important committee so not just working with counselors but actually staff as well and I've already spoken to the chief executive about this there is a quality improvement process within the council itself and this will support the review and I think that we're going to make some pretty important changes to the way we operate as a council by getting to the heart of what's holding business bag so I just think that there are a number of these proposals and here so that's that's my special project the other one that's special for me is of course the the whole representation review because it's a whole new way of going out and and yannis going to be leading just I just think that we're on the cusp of seeing a whole new way of decision-making in the city in a whole new way of defining democracy so it's not just a vote every three years it's actually something meaningful that people can actively engage in as citizens of the city and not in residence and not just you know yeah like today I felt like people were really engaged and the decision that we ultimately made but we know that it was a decision made by the community so I'm feeling extremely positive about where we go forth of September was always going to be a difficult day certainly for me and others they're experienced what we experienced back then and everything since but I think what's helping me get through today is just this incredible sense of the opportunity that lies ahead I mean think you and I sounds a cliche to say I support that but something Yanni picked up in as well before I like this way of engaging here just by virtue of being here and I've cabinet and I would like this if we could kind of you know with local government but actually go around the wards I don't know how frequently but also our pucky the mud I there as well I think that's an agreement that's been long-standing but we haven't done so if we could look at that I'll forget it I think that's good all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much and I'll declare the meeting closed thank you
And now we move to item 5 on the agenda the Me's report on the long-term community engagement which is a is it that the resident yep that the information be that the report be received I'll move that Phil Clearwater will second that I've already made a number of my comments on this and well there's a lot of people who are leaving so I know so I'm just going to you know for the record really set out the process that we're undertaking here and in this document that we will be putting out for consideration by our communities it I say at the beginning of it that when we were elected last year we said we would be upfront about the decisions we were making and why I think there had been a lot of a feeling that decisions were made behind closed doors that people didn't feel engaged in the decision-making process of the council and that's why we decided to open the books so that we could all see the extent of the financial challenges we face at the outset of this meeting we have been I think all of us struck by the significance of the challenges that we do face from a financial point of view and we believe that it's really important that our communities are fully involved if we are going to make the right choices and we've called them the smart choices and the document that will be putting out today it is important that there that people understand that there are some decisions that we can make as a council but there are other decisions that we can only make with the agreement of our partner and the rebuild and that central government and those decisions we cannot unilaterally make but we can in fact work with central government to get resolution to them under the cost sharing agreement made between the council and the crown and jun 2013 the parties jointly committed four point eight billion dollars towards the rebuild of our city more than half of this was earmarked to repair our roads and pipes 1.8 billion the crown and one point 14 billion from the council we don't know how much higher and how they will be shared until a nun dependent review comes out and at the end of november so it has to be completed by the first of december and nor do we know how much our final insurance settlement will be so despite this uncertainty though and this is what I said it Iran we actually have to get on with the job we have to get the city back on its feet we have to make sure our communities have access to the critical services and facilities we need to help us recover in to thrive as a city so you know we don't have all of the resources to meet these financial challenges immediately but there is no bruss because we do we are financially well Resource Council and we have got time but as we have been told by quarter meant that end by Cameron partners there is no single solution no silver bullet no magic one-size-fits-all response that will get us through so that's why we need to be open to new ways of working to be open to new ways of attracting other funders and to the mix and we have to we have got the time to get that happening so we're not going out to consult on the long-term plan right now but we're starting an initial engagement to show the communities that we represent how we need to will help how we are going to be very open to engagement and how we are going to work through the long-term planning process and engage people and the decision-making process it is vital that we get input from all parts of our community and we know that a lot of people are still struggling and we've already heard people saying you know that they're overwhelmed with the amount of consultation and that they really don't want to see a lot more but we have to get their input and the reason we need that input is that the decisions that we make now will not just have an impact on everyone in Christchurch and the immediate sense they will have an impact in a generation you know be affected by the decisions we make so we want people to be engaged in a very open process and that we yeah so it is important that we get on with that so I'm just having advice that my resolution should repeat that the report be received and that the initial community engagement commenced today yep so happy with that all right so is there anyone else who would like to comment on that I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much and the final item on our agenda is our report on council committees council hearing panels and subcommittees and we've just had an updated version 8 I don't know whether people would like to take just five minutes to run through it because I know that there were a couple of other amendments that others had that they wanted to make to it as well so why don't we just a June we'll come back at half past eleven and and then all of the amendments can be well okay thank you very much you
And so we'll move on to the first item on our agenda thought that was later oh it's okay ya know the first one the first one is the location of the eastern recreation and sports center and that's sorry page three of the agenda and we have on the twenty eighth of august the council delegated authority to make decision on this matter to the committee of the whole and we have the report of the booooored pegasus community board in front of us as well and I'd like to and by Andrea Cummings to speak to that or would someone like to david s would like to move the recommendation of the report and that hang on so it doesn't yes sorry they're the stuff yet so would like to move the recommendation and Glenn Livingston would like to second the the recommendation and now will hand over to Andrea thank you very much Lynn thank you for coming out to to our playground today that's a very nice to have you all here it's been a long few years one issue that has captured the community the most both in United grief but also and hope for the future we have seen a huge community engagement and this protein this issue with Facebook pages petitions all sorts of things and we've had strong interest from the key community leaders to join the keg the keg was comprised of people throughout the ward and who represented a large range of demography and agendas yet the group created within themselves an amazing robust process to determine the preferred location for the Eastern Rican sportscenter it was amazing to watch the group come to terms with the duality of representing their own group but also having to represent the east as a whole and they dead extend that beyond barrel Pegasus they did brilliantly so I want to take this moment to thank the members of the keg and thus all the staff for their amazing hard work allowing the community to control the process allowed for great buying and each meeting was filled with knowledgeable thoughtful careful debate and so today I bring you the results of the seven plus criteria which is page 4 of your report we spent quite a bit of time defining and enhancing these criteria so that we knew we were getting a robust process we also gave them way things on how we perceive their importance in the local context within looked spent some time looking at slight possibilities I believe the the staff had found over a hundred possible sites that could have been chosen so we managed to narrow that down quite significantly we then measured those sites against the criteria that we had come up with until we finished not one of us in the room knew which location would come up in the top until the very last minute when all the data was entered in the button was pressed on the laptop and the answer popped up in the Excel spreadsheet that shows how robust the system was that we created the we could there was no predetermined knowledge of the answer of the outcome the group were very happy with the outcome of the process and we anonymous to recommend just one location and its recommendation today qe2 together was a quick brainstorm around the components the community wanted in the facility but this was too rushed and it didn't represent the real well of the group so the keg on their own decided to meet outside again outside the framework of the official keg structure and spend a couple of fruitful hours refining the list at the community board meeting on Monday the board decided to accept the notes and key messages in documents created solely by the keg but I take attention to page 10 you can see that this list differs from the one that was in the report when the keg would like to push that this be noted and received it as a much better recognition of what the community wants it defines things a lot better and yes just was a more robust process to come to the answers that we were looking for so hopefully you've got it and read I think mines in black and white so I was going to go through it but I can't tell now what's downtown so great we also added some things there that we thought perhaps were extras or would perhaps that other philanthropist organizations could come in and partner with so we separated the amount so I will take next to to page 13 the key messages that the group provided this is created by the group the system to staff report so this is the words from directly from the group so the group are really unanimous and wanting to use this process again they found a very very valuable and available and also note that some of our decisions were made on information that wasn't fully there yet we did have to make information around Kolob collocations and partnerships for example without knowing we are the even side boys and surely girls sorry Shirley boys and even side girls schools I've been waiting to get that wrong for a long time and it finally happened we didn't know we had that was going to be in that may influence decision-making in the future so the keg has asked that should and further information come to light that the group be reconvened to go or other other things that we don't know yet may play a decision and the outcome Alan Turing tonight interrupt you Andrea's you're actually saying that should further information comes come to light which may influence that that the community advisory group be reconvened in order to review the decision yes yes without without any or whatever see in the future and know what's going on but I think we need a wee Suffolk resolution well do there so we'll add that well we had that on 4.4 of the staff recommendations to inform the scope of the facility I don't think that so would you want to rear would you want to review I mean would you want to review the location as a group yeah yeah ever ever done pics on the site that we've chosen okay yeah well we had quite a debate about that on the board meeting and staff said that that 4.4 fully included any very any variables that we needed to reconvene but I think what I'm hearing you say is that if further information want to consider the actual selection the site selection and run that processes in then you would you would want to be reconvened for that piece which is actually broader than this I think yeah so I think we need to instruct staff to reengage to inform the scope of facilities so that's inform the scope of the facility and should any of the any year should in it yes should any further information come to light yep and maybe we use the community board as the trigger that the community board come to light that any further significant information come to light that the community board considers might might impair might among the location will make a decision that was made yep that the community advisory group be reconvened for that purpose yes yes yes so for example of qe2 comes back and geo technically that it completely cannot be built on and it's that the group does not necessarily just want to directly go straight to the second no that's right I salute leave you okay no that's good the mover and seconder happy but I just wanted to clarify was getting straight to that point in it whether it was my next point so I can't we've covered that there and at that that was really all I had to hit to say well thank you and can I personally thank you and the community board I know that the that the resolution itself thinks the community advisory group for the work that they've done but I know that you personally as part of the advisory group but also and your leadership role with the community board you know you've committed a lot of your personal attention and and and support to people to work through what is a challenging decision so I think you should be pretty proud of what you've done and I think the community board as a whole can take credit for for a process that's been incredibly inclusive so I really congratulate you for there so do we need stuff up at the table to for any quit are there any questions that people like to ask you so peps John is _''_645.33 to run each year okay so questions Jimmy to two questions first equation on page five the table to the eastern equations posts entered option assessment regarding to the last sentence the score for instant like you to part 66 what the haiti domains a 64 even you have explained this a kind of our criteria think bacteria in the weighting system but how to gather this figure a check for many times I don't know how to get it for instant like a cider risk QE 2 pi is the six equal so by the side risk is a 20 percentage e so if a six equal how many score sure Thank You counselor what we've attempted to show you their the table for four intuitive reasons it's just the relative rankings of hair each option wind so if you take right at the top there the criteria of sight risk in q2 park qe2 park compared to all the other options or sexed equal for that criteria and moving along row Ed was fourth equal and so on and so forth so it's a to each other there are some numbers that sit behind this when we did the assessment and when you carry out the waiting's that's here you get to your final score of out of 100 at the bottom of the year on page the are 10 as we got into the the community of the visor group recommendation and have some amendments regarding to this table can you please explain to us what's the region air and also this kind of amendment whether still within the party to 30 and a half million dogs the advisory group were given no figures to work on we were meant to but procurement issues mean that we couldn't get the people they had the biggest to meeting so we had to work blind so these are a really just a really quick brainstorm and indicative you know of what we have no idea as it compares a community advisory group of whether any or all of them are viable financially and councillor Chen the that's really the next stage of the project are the refining the scope and and working through the community advisory group so council can expect to see that the next iteration ref and then yani you're just a quick one following up on what Jimmy said about the waiting's and how you've calculated this I mean when I look to this I I immediately thought Wilbur wood park looks to be the top choice given the importance of those first three items and I I'd be quite interesting how you actually got to those numbers I can't quite work it out myself either but you're quite I mean I think this has been a great process but yeah I think obviously that site risk for me is probably the most important issue so I'd be interested to see a bit more detail on that the the final assessments are carried out and Colin sore the waiting's of each criteria and certainly those top three or four criteria had the highest ratings so just because in option did particularly well on one waiting or an option did particularly poorly on another waiting doesn't mean to say system takes account of all or all a possible criteria and how they do so one won't be skewed in in one particular direction so there are some as to say some numbers that sit behind that so the judgments that that the group arrived it so booooored park was first on site risk q2 park was first on participation those are the judgments that they made based on the best possible information that we provided with them around demography population city urban growth council facilities non council facilities social economic recovery room to grow those sorts of things yep hopefully that helps and I'll painted over to the feasibility for think John Reid second part of your question Raph I'd like to comment on the site risk I think it's fair to say that every single site on the list carry significant risk are and the difference between one and six equal in terms of the actual geotechnical properties of the land is probably small the first thing the feasibility study will do is have a look at that in detail and if there is yanny thank you can I think the community advisory group I know it won't have been an easy task and I think you've done a really amazing job coming up with an with a location makes a lot of scenes I'm just in terms of going forward really a question of staff given that this is a metro facility and that fact that it's serving more than just one ward have you thought about involving any of the other boards possibly the chili pepper nuit or the Hagley pyramid given the scale of the facility and the impact that this possibly has on those people and if you look at your second criteria our participation sorry um if you look at accessibility participation you talked about it being you know wider than obviously just just that local hero that the details haven't_''_1018.209 been completely ascertained at this stage we'd like to get sign off for the the first stage a short answer to your question is yes we we always do they particularly the neighboring up wards a the the precise nature of the determined in time but an answer your question in an absolutely yeah if you look at 4.3 you're saying it reports back to the council with the feasibility study yep and it goes to the community the build Pegasus community board yup along with the scope the cost procurement exit row yeah I just wondered whether there was any opportunity either to add one or two representatives from the other wards that are affected either onto the community advisory group or to have a report go back to the other wards that are affected in terms of the people that are likely to use that facility it's not it's quite explicit um here that at the moment they would be excluded the the boards would be the neighboring boards would be involved but this report has to follow a pathway and that the pathway prescribed in here is through the board Pegasus community board they preferred snipers in their ward if council wanted to make a change to that you know that they're very welcome to do so that's probably be on my decision-making scope ball around whether in terms of that community advisory group it was a chart you that chance to change it looking forward for the work that needs to be done now to add additional members from those other Ward's I think there would be some logistical challenges and that we've we've made a number of times and heads I've got a fairly good we did a lot of groundwork to get to where we've done and adding new people may sort of change the dynamics of how that works also the group did we're the mantle of a much bigger area than very Pegasus we did consider particularly and those things that you mentioned accessibility participation that the transport routes and those some things we did look we'd it's been quite a bit of time looking at the impact of the other Ward's so I don't think that you were disadvantaged in any way through the the decision that we met we came to you know I wasn't sorry maybe I'm not being clear enough okay I'm done a really good job I think was really important that that ward decided within itself where the location would be best best suited but going forward given that the scope of the facility is a metro facility and that it's serving more than just that local ward I don't see what process there is for anyone else to be involved in that from the other community boards that are affected have you got a catchment map of where you expect if it goes to qet people to come from I think this is probably a bit hard to put on the chair of the build Pegasus community board I think extending the community advisory group is not within the scope of what we're considering today but I think that allowing for the Buehrle Pegasus community board to have representatives from both surely papanui and higley ferry made at the meeting that they consider the report back to council because it will have gone through the community advisory group by then I think is perfectly acceptable when I don't think that that would be a difficult meeting of the would Pegasus community board and invite representatives from the other two community boards to come initially when the site selection process was first convened it was a joint meeting between burwood Pegasus and higley very much so the issue I have is 4.4 around the scope that there seems to be no opportunity for given the scope of the facility as as Metro not local because it's a bigger facility than just your local swing pool this seems to be no ability for anyone outside of the ward to feed into that project I think it's it's not meet ronan that it's citywide but I understand that the catchment is going to be bigger then then just bird Pegasus so it's not like the Metro sports facility and that that is definitely a facility that will be citywide and as qe2 was but this isn't this isn't going to be the same as carry two and the Metro sports facility is the replacement for qe2 this is going to be a standalone facility in its own right and it's what perhaps would have been there if qe2 hadn't been located there in the first place but it's not going to be the Metro sports facility more like a pioneer or a jelly Park which is gonna but there's who knows it's still got work to go through to what it's actually going to be but it is a nice turn aquatic facility that that's the one thing that's really clear but um yeah I think it's a bit difficult to put this on on Andrea at the moment I just think that if we report back to council by April 2015 as it says through the board Pegasus community board in conjunction with other boards as appropriate then I just think I just think that we can work out a process that makes it work without making it difficult you know yeah so so if we add in the woods in conjunction with other community boards as appropriate is that ok with the mover and seconder yep thank you I think it's good just to acknowledge that this is a that that change yeah Thank You Glenn not just that will check that please so that you're saying the primary decision-making obviously remains or considerations continue to be through the build Pegasus look it's through the board Pegasus community board and conjunction with other community boards as appropriate so let us work out how we as a council resolve that and and and and further discussion but I really don't want to hold up the decision today because there are a lot of people who are very keen for us to get on with the job and I wouldn't push it much further yeah Becky sorry just in relation to the April 2015 I appreciate this great deal of work to do but could that possibly come forward any this question was asked at the community board the the answer is are we we've done our homework and in order to procure and deliver geotechnical services we won't have idea our hope in doing it too much sooner we create expectations that we have to let people down on okay that you will try their backyard that they could leonitia yeah all right so I will put them out oh sorry yeah bulge abate the motion sorry David yes is anyone else going to jaani jaani sorry your verification special rehab the reference to the Scott the possibility of a school site that you referred to before what what do you want to clarify yeah I was going to empower the recommendations I just haven't seen seen here it is unless it simply as it in case somebody written that down and there should any further significant information come to light which the community board considers may impact on the location in the keg should be reconvened okay yeah so Yanni could you pick up the microphone because I mean sorry but it's we have to karaoke okay Oh Stacy we could sing happy birthday to Glenn it's pretty good birthday present doesn't it no I just wanted to UM just placed on record my thanks to the bird Pegasus board and the community advisor group for the work that they've done to determine a location I know it taken longer than then there many people would have would have liked but you know I do fundamentally think that this is a really good decision that has been based on a really good examination of the possibilities and I think the really important thing now is that we do commit to a site we do get something happening we get we get the work done to make sure that we can get this facility open as soon as possible and although it is located in the booooored Pegasus ward and I think it's really important that that ward in that community board and that community have just taken a leadership role in determining where it should be located I do want to just stress it this is an Eastern aquatic and facility and recreations into that does service the eastern suburbs and I know that it's not just the people and booooored Pegasus that are happy about this proceeding it's actually many people on the East to have missed their local facilities don't have local facilities or are looking forward to this facility being returned across the city they can travel a little less further and go and enjoy some of the recreational benefits that these types of facilities provide so I'm really excited about today I think this is a really positive step forward for our city it's great to see some work come to a conclusion and one sense in terms of the location and exciting to see the next stage moving forward so very supportive of these recommendations and thank you for allowing you know the other boards to be involved were appropriate I think that really seems a very good signal that this is more than just a local facility that is an important facility for the east thank you I'm just reminding counselors that we have to conclude the meeting by twelve-fifteen so if a we've got meetings back in the office so Pauline julienne for supporting this type of community engagement we've seen two models of it today in this ward and I think it's just fantastic that we're actually adopting this model we're empowering people in communities this is an for everyone to have a voice and have their voice heard and I just want to congratulate everyone involved today particularly uilleann thinking thank you um quickly Glen are you gonna yeah no no no I'm gonna I'm gonna let Dave wrap it up because this is what I'm yeah that yep I realized it things don't saying look just wish to say this has been a I think a very good process the minister and this is what I was going to say before over eastern vision in a press release used the phrase meaningful engagement and I actually think we need to hold not only him but us ourselves as a council to that and in our engagement going forward I think the process at the South New Brighton community center the other day was very good over there I think this has been very good as well you see all the compelling reasons but work through with data to arrive at the recommendation that it would be at qe2 today is also this compelling reason I went to a local government conference in legacy of events the games were a legacy not only for New Zealand and Christchurch Christchurch but for this community putting the facility here would build on that legacy it's a very powerful thing to do so I'm delighted we're doing this today and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself but I suspect I'm anticipate a unanimous decision David thank again look this has been a very long journey that started on the twenty-second of februari back in 2011 with the loss of qe2 and a huge loss to our community which has really perpetuated itself in a generation I believe of kids that have aren't getting Lynn to swim out the side of town and a huge craving for a return of an aquatic facility look I'm well on record as probably not favoring qe2 initially but with the Legacy Project and other things I've turned around and look I really would like to just wrap up this by saying as a council we engage the community to make a decision we had keg and I believe they were very thoroughly think as a community and certainly as a council we need to respect that process I certainly do and so I'm edging my fellow councillors to support the recommendation we have before us and let's get on with this project it's been a long time coming and also said earlier we have this void of aquatic facilities and these and suburbs it's really something that some had a huge impact on our community and I like to see the process actually get into gear and get going so let's make a vote now and begin the process excellent I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried unanimously thank you very much
And now oh yes oh and um if you come to the table but I'll just remind people that obviously we're not live streaming today because we're not at the council building but we are video recording the the meeting today and we will put it online afterwards so so you are being recorded and will be online at the end end of the day thank you gotta tato now how I found you via Tony Kent ago Toby no koto 10 Dakota Couture welcome to our part of the city and I mean I had had a kind of mistaken thought that when I arrived here the council's might arrive a little early Dave and stripped off and had a bit of a swim so that you're really feeling fresh and alive for this meeting but there you go Evan Smith many of you will know who's part of Eastern vision and doing extraordinary work around this part of the city indeed and on my left here is shorty Jardine who's been associated with this project and helping he's part of to begin our session please pura good to me Jack way LeAnn mihara hockey at

to not repeat I and well thank you I think we just need to move the the screen a little bit because she only got half the half the thing on there so correct it's like okay I'm we go we'll go so you have the papers in front of you but we'll follow through to I'm going to introduce us and then Evans going to take on a little bit you most of you are aware of Eastern vision you actually have a MoU with us which is it includes the mayor includes the two MPs it includes the the chairs of hagley Faramir and build Pegasus and a group of community leaders amongst us and we also have members of represented from cear√° and from ECAM who come along when we meet so we have no mandate to do what we're doing but what our job is not to make decisions make the decisions what we see our tasks are doing is enabling advocate for robust meaningful public participation in decision-making it's the process by making the decisions and we want to see that as a way in which enable what I call and we call collaborative conversations among community and recovery agencies there's been so much sort of talking past each other this is about actually getting collaborative conversations so overall we're seeking to facilitate an agreed integrated big picture rig recovery plan for the Eastern flatlands that's what we're about as a group we've been around for a couple years now to oh god forever we've been around a long time and this is a particular project our time and attention it's called evo space and it's our online public participation platform or evolutionary space and the purpose of it is to collate and map community proposals for the recovery of the east and then to harvest community feedback on each proposal to analyze this and report it back with a map of community aspirations to assist those who make the decisions to make the best decisions they can and to test this further through iterative community feedback processes always being fed back to the community you know I have to do a little plug for concern of course while I'm here is the pay of that with our tagline the wisdom of the local community always exceeds the knowledge of the experts so this is about a community-driven project which will then justify the investment and feasibility studies and business cases accordingly no point in doing feasibility studies whether this can be afforded or whatever else until you've actually got some commitment from people say hey this is something we think we should have a closer look out so there is no and so on because this is a preliminary stage until we get to the point where people might say yeah this is where we want to go now turn over to Evan now who's going to tell you a little bit more about ego space he's been working pretty much full time on this for the last month or two okay over that you'll be aware since the very first earthquake in September four years ago the community has been coming up with lots of ideas of how we could repair and recover communities in the eastern suburbs particularly certainly since the red zone in decisions a lot of ideas have come out from community about what could happen in the the lens that had to be vacated up to eight weeks ago we had 27 such proposals on the table with EVO space we invite people to put new proposals on the table since then we've had another 13 come on board that were loaded up onto evo space so that people can put their feedback on now we don't necessarily endorse all the mutually exclusive and we'll come on to that in a moment but we think it's important that everything that's come out of the community is laid on the table so that people can say what they support and what they don't support here's a rather extended met of the East with all the different proposals and their locations this maps available on the on the website and you can see it there more clarity essentially there is of the 40 proposals that are actually more than 40 now or just over half a red zone proposals proposals for that for the red zone 10 of them are in the Greater New Brighton area and nine outside both the red zone nu bright and so they cross the East eastern plains generally 21 on Cyril n 12 a proposed for cosmic City Council lens foreign ministry of education land and foreign private land whether those proceed will depend upon consent from landowners they arranged across a broad diverse range of categories from culture and heritage business community education transport natural environment and sport and recreation just of those proposals just very quickly if we look at the natural environment proposals these involve restoration of natural habitat restoration water quality restoration of a hangar Chi which is one of the key recovery outcomes that note ah who wish to achieve got proposals for an eco century in the Travis wit wetlands and the joining red zone area we've got a so I can't read it for me I using wetlands the opportunity to use the red zone lands to put in Whitley instead asleep storm water so that we've got a lot more capability now in the East particularly to clean up water before it gets discharged into the river who's got proposals for further enjoyment of the the June dunes along the coastal margins along that the Brighton kinda bright and coasts with a proposal there for a boardwalk we've got proposals for natural playgrounds dotted through the red zone along the proposed cycleways and walkways people don't like or don't want to have any more the plastic playgrounds they want natural playgrounds made of natural materials without much Eden proposal it's came through must was put to cancel a couple of weeks ago and also of course the avin a territory river park which is what an attacker Oh Nick work has been advocating for furs for several years now got over close to 20,000 signatures on a petition two years ago and we still have not yet seen that happen but we'd love to and making a chi we're starting off the main hangar Chi restoration it with one small part of the on council reserve land embedded in the red zone out and zip drive reserved if we look at what one of the largest number of proposals in sport and recreation and we think there's the potential here for to turn the whole of the eastern to the aquatic playground of the city this proposal says you'd be a well aware of for international flat water sports lakes that cater to roaring dragon boating kayaking waka ama wind surfing etc proposals for whitewater course which would be a capable of doing international kayaking what would a kayaking as well as wave garden at a New Brighton nick is a consistent surfing way for people to learn to surf on cable wakeboarding going around the various high schools talking to students about the various proposals and this is the one that has the biggest thumbs up from all the all the kids they're really into this in a big way if you combine that with the hot salt water pulls out at New Brighton and of course the eastern sport and recreation center then you've got coupled with the rivers the h3 and the beaches of turning the whole of the the Eastern flat lands into the the the the water playground of the city which should be really stunning and that'd be the envy of the world in terms of what's available right on an urban setting just quick look at some of the diversity of other projects riverside heritage garden part you've had a presentation on them before collocation of single-sex secondary education and in the east so you still retain single-sex schools open side and surely boys but co located on a dual potential there and in that will have enormous impact on the recovery of the east also revitalization of new brighton business district and the fall short and what that might look like doing a lot of work with with Paul's Alan and you brought in business and Leonard's Association and the new brighton communities about how that might look like in the master planning process also importance I think being recognised of wind schools go and we had a lot of schools going that community centers go with them so is a proposal for philipstown school to retain some buildings and retain it part of the school as a community center for the Phillipstown community and I think that's a really important concept that needs to be looked at elsewhere in the East as well community food growing network little please your Vicki and forage for us hurry to Georgians community gardens allotments accenture dotted throughout the east and or so of course the eastern cyclin work by Nicola not just the council's proposed cycle way going along the the length of the unitary but also is really important to the community when we asked them for suggestions I said before there is some proposals that we didn't necessarily endorse there also some proposals that aren't necessarily compatible with other proposals these two proposals have come out in the last couple of weeks that aren't necessarily compatible with other proposals but because they're being proposed we should we think that the community should have the right to put its feedback on them we spend a long time over the course the last two years making sure that all the different proposals are spatially compatible but these are two that aren't want us to turn the whole of the red zone into a lake so it's blowing the red zone rather than greening it that all the feasibility around that word still need to be tested and finally also is a proposal to turn the gelling t'en stretch which was going to was earmarked for a flat water lake into seeking deport we're all flying I'm not sure this is indication you probably can't see it very of the initial feedback that we've got in terms of what's the most popular it's a very crude broad brush stay at what's popular what's not popular you'll find at the top there the community is well behind the cycle walkways the open River Park international sporting lake whereas we also put a proposal for a truncated version of that which wouldn't meet international standards and they've got the big thumbs down so everybody says basically you're going to put a flat water sports lake in the East let's make it an international policy one so there's a lot of feedback there and we would hope to do a lot more work on that when people put their feedback in the system we asked them how often would they use the particular proposal how much fixture if anything they would pay on their rates or Texas to get an idea of how much they value in monetary terms what do they think the positives of the proposal are what are the negatives and should it be located where we on an app to show where they think it should be and give a reason why they think it should be relocated there so there's a lot of information we're collecting from people on this you'll be aware that Sierra's going out and after the prime minister's announcement and Easter that the government would consult on future users for the red zone lands and Syria has already gone out to the Waimakariri district was in the process of that right now their consultation process does differ quite significantly from evo space once in a number of ways firstly our process is led by the community not by government and I think that's important in terms of the degree or feed feedback we get from communities it also relates to the whole of the area not just the residual red zone so we're looking at an integrated package that's not just the red zone considered in isolation it has to fit in with whatever else is happening around it in the in the residential neighborhoods it acknowledges all the proposals and work that happen in in the red zone in elsewhere by going out with the blank canvas in 10 career e-series not actually acknowledging that work that's already there so instead of just saying what you want to see their we're saying here's what people have already said that I'd like to see there if you have any more ideas we just know those but tell us what you think of the ideas that are already on the table and finally we collect some basic demographic information by our registration process so we can ensure the data is validated it doesn't mean that someone person's put a thousand different comments on there each person only has one comment that they can make proposal it means it's a lot more robust and we can have some meaningful analysis in terms of age breakdowns and demographics it's not our job to endorse any particular project our job is to report it out there so the community and all this can make their comments on it and it can and provide stuff will do an analysis on in we've got just to let you know it's a very limited budget two-and-a-half k and that includes the salaries for people like Evan who's done an extrordinary mount of work it's included workshops with droppings in schools community groups social and news media email and on the online referral to we're now in week 8 we've got 1,250 online registrations today and we hope to have more we're going to do more of a push to do that the feedback received is really good quality so that's good it's good quality but it is challenging the engagement is challenging and difficult and this is similar to other people doing things whether its statutory authorities or volunteers people often feel like they've been consulted to death and they it they say sometime many of them soon feel they haven't been heard so far so why should they bother so there's some of that feeling around it but we do need to keep on keep on keeping on to encourage more people to come on and board and make September in a final push and we may even leave it up after that for comment though we'll take it you will do the work on it but any more analysis that might come in from there so and how could the council assist and well to acknowledge the need for an integrated overarching plan for the recovery of the east and we're thinking particularly the flatlands here an integrated overarching plan and we're not just talking about a vision for the next five years or the ten years eastern vision is looking for the next 50 to 100 years as to what might that be like it's going to take time but we've got a completely rethink and we have a huge opportunity to do that with the community leading it so it's really really important we'd like you to actively promote support and value this program evo space program on your desk there is the card which we distribute as far as we can for you to go up yourselves have a look and contribute it doesn't have to be be anyone around the city or indeed around the country who wants to make some suggestion on this stuff so encourage and enable real influence from the evo space outputs on decision-making we'd like you to take this on board see this as important and encourage and enable some real influence from this to be taken on board and explore by those people who ultimately make the decisions a community and state three agency collaborative working together so the community feels like it is being validated it is being listened to and and and so that we can all work together on that and people will then feel they'll they all just feel like great I think it's really reinforce been too much of the other stuff through this whole last four years where the communities felt disenfranchised this is one of those attempts to enfranchise the community and get you there's other attempts to them it's all good so take account of the potential uses the residential redzone land please before finalizing the infrastructure solutions you know it's going to be daft isn start putting in sewers and roads and God knows around the place when in fact we haven't really made the decisions about what we want to put there so parallel agile decision-making flexible being willing to take some risks yeah but at the same time not to be so tied down by the regulatory processes that it means you can't make good decisions for the future so there you go that's from us a new dawn for the East we like to think Eastern vision is all about and as I say it's not a group to make the decision it's a group to facilitate good decision-making led by the community thank you thank you take a tour like 10 minutes so which we've had our 15 minutes but but I'm happy for for a few questions it's I mean I think your last point as is very relevant I mean we can't make decisions around infrastructure until we know what the future uses but we can't determine the future use until we know what our you know to meet water protection and things like that so we have agreement with government to work with them and and now I think to engage the wider community and a little bit of a conversation about some of those immediate needs for the city to be met first as part of the initial conversation and then that bigger that bigger conversation I think one of the things that I think would be helpful and really as my question is that do you think it would be helpful if some of the some of the big picture ideas you know for example like the lake you know if some work could be done on on the analysis you know sort of this hydrology issues there's you know there's this direction eschews one direction the only are four different sports you know there's that the idea that if it's going to be an international lake then it has to meet certain requirements I mean the fact that we have an international airports a big plus on our on our side and we know would certainly make a huge difference and one of the as you look at the where it's got so far in terms of where people are putting support when that's become a bit clearer by the end of the month so far we get there and Evan and others will be doing analysis on that then we get a real sense of what are the key projects that people around the apartment if you look at it and then it names of the depth of analysis design with biology and things like there because I mean obviously eastern version doesn't_''_1242.03 hit the funds to do that and I'm just wondering whether that's something that you would at what point would you like some of the work to be done on some of those big projects a feasibility study about three years ago I would yeah yeah yeah but yeah I know the sooner the better but I think it's want to recognize that the proposals shouldn't be considered like they're in isolation it's much too package there I do agree with it but particularly the plate water lake wakeboard park and for the whitewater kayaking course they can all time together and also assist with possibly potentially flood management all of those concepts need to be thought through but getting good advice and particularly because a lot of staff had tied up with blood management issues elsewhere and in the city which is our priority but really it's not high enough in the network to be the savior of the area that could assist down the street but Sally getting that kind of advice and trying to bring those those different agencies together to talk about that there is some work being done by sport cannery on the Flint water late now but all the different parties need to become to get there was people working in different parts but just one of our roles in one that Christy Williams is very involved in as well as trying to bring all those different threads together together yep and fell when it comes to areas like for example the whitewater quiet and how that the Quakers are you consulting with in discussing that plane absolutely the spiritually proposed Fox from Cheers the zone committee he's very much involved in the kaikan community it was having some colleagues from lincoln university teacher that have put that proposal together so look thank you very much and I think that the concept that you've brought to the council table as a model for community engagement and I think we are looking for different ways of engaging we know that the the government's kind of put the christchurch side of the future use the residential red zone to one side but is now focused on that on the infrastructure needs for the city around flood management stormwater location of stop banks because that's all connected and some of the roading issues you know I do not mention New Brighton Road in this context but we have to have a conversation with our community about where that moves too because in terms of its proximity to the river that means that the stop banks have to be higher and so the opportunity to move it back away from the river as an enormous opportunity but you know so there think you're showing willing that you want to be and engage partner and help lead that community conversation that needs to happen that's absolutely right the end and in fact both in this and other areas I think there is beginning to be an interesting awareness within the community of the council's willingness to actually really engage and have these collaborative conversations and where the community can help lead those working with you as we did on saturday when we did something on the legacy project in New Brighton which got really good feedback from community feeling we the community needs fear we are being listened to and so as that can happen more and more than I think that the future looks really good for us or working on it together collaboratively thank you very much ok that's yeah so sorry time sorry yeah I don't know but we've asked last shorty to complete our presentation no more things we knew he knew here we knew here too new yo Tommy kiawah th e imam al carro de la tierra takata kwara a hui tired thank you
Um so I'll just go back to apologies and I have apologies from Paul lonsdale and would someone like to move that his apology accepted David East seconded for clearwater I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and the declaration of interest I haven't had anyone declare an interest no
Right good morning everyone I declare this meeting of the earthquake recovery committee of the whole open and I welcome all of the guests who have come to participate in this well I think quite historic meeting the last hopefully of the earthquake recovery Committee of the Whole meeting so um I thought I'd just start with a couple of comments when my husband worked me this morning he did so by accident but it was just after 4 30 I turned over to go back to sleep and tried to but then I suddenly realized the significance of being awake at that time today I remember vividly the shock of suddenly being awake for years ago and I remember being out of bed but I don't remember getting out of bed Robbie said I yelled earthquake but I don't remember doing that either I knew I wanted to get out of the house and every single civil defense lesson that I had learned completely escaped me gone and an instant I remember being tossed from side to side as we tried to run down the stairs stop shaking like so many others I had absolutely no idea what lay ahead it was the beginning of a sequence of events that changed my life and the lives of so many others forever I didn't give up going back to sleep this morning but my mind kept drifting through the past four years and what I was going to say this morning I actually drove through bixi on my way here there's a lot of symbolism about today's meeting obviously foremost as the location we have intentionally come as a council to the east given the impact the earthquakes of head-on communities surrounding great a new brighton from the north to the south it seemed fitting to hold this final earthquake recovery committee of the whole here the agenda is symbolic as well it starts with a deputation from a group eastern vision which didn't exist for years ago Eastern vision is an example of the emergent groups that have taken a leadership role in our city it has formed essentially as a catalyst for a conversation about the future of the east the the eastern recreation and sport center which is recommended to us by an advisory group and the booooored Pegasus community board the eastern recreation and sports center has attracted a major philanthropic donation which has signaled a new a new way for funding facilities which doesn't just commit to rate payer dollars the last is a paper that contains the the the seconders of paper that contains or the last as a paper that contains the rationale for and the makeup of a new committee structure that I'm proposing we adopt this is designed to commit our governance structure to the resilient City model which makes more sense as we seek to devolved decision-making to community boards in their communities and freeze-up council a time to work on the long-term planning and engage more directly with the communities that they represent the main reason though that we are here today is the second item the adoption of a public engagement plan which will mark the beginning of a conversation with the community about the council's priorities and funding options for the next ten years I know that us expected to see such a significant set of financial challenges when we open the box I'm aware that the People's Choice Labour councillors are putting out a statement clarifying their position I know there is considerable sympathy around the table for that position but we have agreed to put all the options on the table and work together with our communities to find the right solutions I felt really proud when you all agreed to allow me to speak for the council as a whole when we release the partners report and signal that all the options would be considered I think that what has set us apart as a council is how we are managing these challenging issues so let me say to all of my colleagues thank you I'm confident that we'll make the right choices and this initial engagement with our city will open the door to a much better understanding of the choices that we have and a real sense of ownership of the decisions that we ultimately have to make we're also taking the opportunity to give the green been left out of my my notes here that will see swimming pools and libraries and other facilities progressively restored to community communities over the coming months we have signed off on these facilities so council staff can get on with the job draw up the plans call for expressions of interest and look to the range of funding models that exist the important message today is something I learned from an informal meeting with local advisory groups last weekend here in Brighton and I want to thank them for for allowing me the opportunity to develop that understanding because the council has established a betterment fund people think that we have money allocated it is all borrowing it is nothing more than a borrowing facility my mistake around the capital endowment fund which is a fund set aside from the proceeds of business sold by Ryan a number of years ago is that we have borrowed from it ourselves as a council so my clever plan of spending some of the money set aside for that rainy day only committed us to more borrowing but what we announced our insurances to be settled or the horizontal infrastructure expenditure to be resolved appropriately all our council business today is focused on the future on getting back on our feet as a city and as communities and for the council the focus is on opening ourselves to new ways of doing things significantly these changes are also beginning to take shape at a governance level with the prime minister's announcement of changes to Sierra's structure and the beginning of a deliberate move towards transition which will eventually lead to the full restoration of democracy in the city I opened a conference for 400 people this morning before I came here ironically for project managers and I acknowledged how important that that message was that we were open for business as a city I thought I would conclude my opening comments today by repeating something I said to them I will never forget being shaken awake at 435 am not knowing what would lie ahead from liquefaction to lateral spread and from eq c to PMO's I was introduced to words and acronyms I knew nothing about before I was back then then I have been inspired by the ability of communities to come together in a time of crisis I have been humbled by the generosity of people be they neighbors or multi millionaire philanthropist living half a world away and I have been encouraged by people who have willingly shared their knowledge and expertise with Christ Church as we recover and rebuild encouraged humbled and inspired three words that describe how I feel about being here today thank you so I'd like to Naren by Eastern vision to come forward to make a deputation show a couple we do that certainly just on behalf of my colleague Glenn like to welcome everybody to to the Burwood Pegasus world ward and particularly to this venue we like to think it's our part of paradise and I'd like particularly some of the staff and others tonight there is no northeast early this morning there never is at this time of the day and most people come to this side of town at the wrong time of the day when there is a bit of a wind of our roads and didn't get lost either in potholes or misdirections and noted on the way what sort of potential there is for enormous potential or is the development out this side of town as the N has alluded to it's a very special day for the eastern suburbs a number of significant announcements and I believe significant steps forward for the side of the town for which we are looking forward to with great interest for me it's it's quite a historic personal thing my great-grandfather and grandfather were both members of the New Brighton Borough Council and to have a council meeting out here as something special for me so thank you for coming out here today my colleagues on the other side of the room have probably got the best view and I think it's a great idea that we have come out here and I think we should be doing it in other parts of the city as well and finally can I just acknowledge my colleague here today happy birthday Glenn oh yeah I thought I actually think that say a couple of weeks as well just do I mean it is it as well others both of you that represent the boo and Pegasus board at this table and I think it as appropriate to invite you to no one okay I think you'll en and thank you David my colleague for those birthday wishes it's good to be here today in the bill would pick as this horde and you know we're delighted that we're going to be making these decisions today obviously we've been through a lot and still going through a lot and I hope that you'll come away today with a sense of joy and a bit more hope that I really hope this will give the ward a big lift when we come to the pool decision especially today so great to be here and thank you for the birthday wishes thank you Brian
Victor local government x amendment x number three who would like to move that nobody gonna fail for the 12 I'll move it seeking the bubble lonsdale with any questions to staff cookie that's just being changed like what what sort of impact all we see here what I speak just of all these changes how will we sort of notice the changes most dramatically I think the most dramatic changes are probably in relation to developer contributions leaders but a lot of that will be behind the scenes work but these are the immediate things that need to be entered into that well this is the the main part of this report today is about including things that have to be included development constitutions policy within a month of the echoing pass then the future changes to be made to that policy but so this is about being incredibly cautious about making sure that we include everything that's going to come out of dc's into our plane because if we don't we have to get them back and making sure that we actually are going to happen in ten years and there's a new provisions for reconsideration process in an objections process that's been introduced by the government so this development project a shin objection commissioners who are appointed by the government through of some of your lodgers an objection restore point one of those to hear the objection though also there's also changes that will be coming through and you'll see those in the future in relation to the documents for the long-term plan and the way that's it up our feelings or anything else to say on there I guess the next visible but will be the significance and engagement policy we react we will be starting to engage with you I think we bring into a workshop of counselors on the 8th September we're going to start that that process and we have to have the policy in place by the first to December and then the second visible effect will be the consultation document to be prepared as part of a long-term plan process but that's quite a different approach to consultation with the demo but in terms of significance and engagement what changes in the act we're going to have one a significant oh we define policy by the first of December and if you look at attachment before but do we define our significance essex yes but we always solve it always we've always had to have a significance policy but now the government in its wisdom says that's to be a significance and engagement policy which actually is quite interesting because it it maybe take some of their consultation away from very hard prescriptive processes and to something that's more engaging in terms of communicating with our community ok so what we're approving today is the process and and attachment for as far as that goes and the process that we're going to begin next week in terms of talking to our communities about the long-term plan and the financial challenges that we face it will kind of more front of us and fit very well have to record my utter disappointment at the passage of the legislation in terms of the changes to and attended in person and and made a strong case a number of other councils also address the Select Committee on those changes and I know that they will also be very disappointed that the government decided to proceed with that no well Peter would like to make a comment and then I'll take other speakers about the the fact that development contributions can't_''_266.84 be used for libraries and swimming pools see you can build a community hall as soon as you put books on it suddenly you can't judge disease for them and I was just absolutely beyond comprehension that here in Christchurch we've got new communities that are having to be new community facilities that are going to have to be built in order to you know provide for growing communities over on the the southwestern particular and the people that are ultimately going to end up paying the people that have lost their facilities in the earthquake and I just think that that's wrong I think that really the development contributions were designed to enable community facilities and our library is not anyway that's my view and I expressed it at the time very very Kelly Kelly and I had Paul lonsdale with me at the time Peter council tension I think well the sleeper just only one councillor bucks questions one of the sleeper changes unless that's not a media certainly not this year and I reviewed place 399 and we'll see one two three four the 54 point down a new requirement the council's review this service delivery if council must review its governance funding and delivery of infrastructure services illegal affected by everything we do and I think one of the issues that's going to come up as the council will need to have a discussion that they do we continue to run in-house the service do we contract it out you well it's going to be I would participate contentious to put it mildly I think the the apartment because as parliament made us work with the government having from Oakland wishes to put councils in a position where to put it collectively the cages written and that councils have to go deliver them from that point we do they contract out services in that way because you know clearly you're we appreciate the history in terms of contract out New Zealand going back some 20 years now let's have a TAC team record but I think and of course you'll see there on the reference I think that the way it's worded is not clear-cut because they talk about well when you have significance change the service levels how does that judgment going to be made but the backstop is but by 2020 we can't have to go through at least one of these exercises I mean constantly after their to me when you read the legislation while the dcs and the significance engagement policy are the sheer issues I just draw the castle attention of watch this space in terms of service little reviews it's heavy feeling that it might be after I'm gone what was your thinking behind the change just if you were so minded I think I think well but potentially they at least wish council to to have a lead to changes which afford opportunities for contracting out rates for medicine bration with other councils so I'm part of that service delivery review process and because it's also an obligation look at collaborating with other councils so there may be an opportunity for services to be provided to councils jointly or thanks again so Yanni then I think it was here was second Glenn and then fall um I just had a really interesting in the financial implications that we don't really have any sense of what they will be have you done any high-level work obviously if we can no longer charge DC's on a number of our project that we were going to charge DC's what's the cost to us with what's the community facilities ones and we didn't actually have any anar 2013 DCP originally so looks at the Cielo trees exit for cemeteries we should have an indication of course I don't have it on me at the moment but that would be clear from what's in the policy it's gonna be really good't have them in every year plan I know as kind of this year's annual thing we did put some in I think it'd be really good for us they would head the ones that we've had him being able to attract these seas what is the cost that the government have basically and post on I think I think that was probably we can probably find it sorts I think it was in the previous or the report that brought the submission for council was the figures on how much cost difference and any kind of figures around the new compliance costs associated with this up with these changes about reviewing all the service delivery mechanisms etc light as there any work done around how much we're going to have two extra pay to get this work done um no bogeys years still some thinking to do about how the service delivery reviews will be done if they can be done in conjunction with other work then that may not be a costume for the development contribution policy and the reconsideration process most of those's own costs and terms leaving at case its case can't_''_611.31 I mean still be it doesn't need to consult on the significance of engagement policy but before to get something back that just says you know here's the anticipated cost here's the budgets that we need to approve to do this work and I think when we do get I think this reports really good so I really appreciate it I mean we should actually give them to have it when government changes legislation introduced legislation have a report like this that comes in front of us but I do think we need to also just have a few lines about the expected costs to counsel from this new government legislation because we often hear we're often criticized by government that we're an effective and that we're an efficient actually one of the concerns is being that they are imposing quite a lot of costs on us and this is a really good example where we're having to pick up additional costs imposed by government and yet they are putting pressure these I feel sorry it was Glenn was nixed but look I'm going to let glenn then Paul then yeah you go Glen sorry thank you just in 4.32 with the annual play in the I guess it would be the significance policy that would be used to judge what might be significant or material because if I read that correctly it's saying we wouldn't need to call councils don't have to consult my viewers they'd be unwise not to consult that is that what it say it's in if there's no significant or material variance from the ELT and we're in uncharted waters there in that we've got a new process we don't automatically now have to follow a special consultative procedure we determine the consultation and can it in accordance with section 82 and years we will have to make a call as to what significant or material and that may be a different assessment than what we have in our significance policy but that's something that we will have to address it's a true isn we don't consult and that's proven to be the case or consultants efficiently is it as I say we are in uncharted waters and at some point the high court may well determine what is significant and material in terms of differences required for an annual plan just reading through the report here this seems to me that there we are now going to be open to a lot more objections to a deal on contributions and we may find ourselves and permanent litigation with opponents which we will see enough happen to pick those costs up as well along with the loss of the ones we can t she now claim on it but can you want to comment on there and well the because with the if they is a two-stage process they can choose to bring a reconsideration serious and that's just dealt with by council offices and there's an informal office for process that that's done under sort of at the moment anyway but if they even decide that they're going to object or they go straight to an objection costs of them if they didn't take the extra litigation following that then that will be an additional measure but there's not a lot there hasn't been any proceedings brought in terms of the current development contributions policy or so I don't know there would be more litigation I think you know arguably with the objections process that to be a chance for a used to be aired so it's best if it was going to be the sketchy beliefs because there is that new process provided for do it so I just want to be quite clear that the staff costs their legal costs are all covered if we can claim all that back off the objectors our costs of presenting our side of the story at the objection and we have to pay for ourselves but the council's costs and terms of staffing provide a resource to the Commissioner to hear the objection in in the providing facilities or other things that they require that's all history or by the objector so essentially if we will be Pedro to start of nun quite an increasing cost yes in terms of staff of them to be there to appear at objections three thank you very much so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there's oppose then no that's carried thank you very much and thanks for such a big effort with respect to this work much appreciated what sons of our choosing no no this emotion great resolution to
Through the public so I'll move that we exclude the public for the reasons set out on page 4 17 of the agenda second up by Jimmy chin I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you so we'll just
Council as an executive leadership team interest I think there was was there an additional paper on that did they get moving did they get moved what are they if they weren't but seemingly previously yeah forgot to but they don't they don't need to be moved to sit what I'm no no no I don't like that right okay I'll move that we receive the registry gesture and does it receive the registrar or we going to sleep oh no no no reason no received the Registrar others registrar sorry I apologize I was not reading a property and Tim scandrett will second the motion there's there any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried item number 23
Sations loan fan item 21 and who would like to move this this is tim seconds of bill are there any questions on this one ref and I think this is a nice idea and community law is fantastic so I don't have a problem with this particular low but I do wonder whether we should have a look at the fact that council council is operating a community bank and it's clearly not a core function of council so I'd like to look at some other options perhaps putting this out somewhere else maybe community trust or somebody like that well then they should be doing it not us so um don't just lie just like to put that on the agenda that we should really look at getting out of that business I'd say well I think we could do that as part of the long-term plan process so would it be worthwhile to add another recommendation that we seek a report on on the on the community organizations loan scheme and what and and other facilities that are available whenever who actually Andrew I just want to proceed he's here doing work around a development agency maybe that's I mean I quite like council having control over this if you look at some of the projects but I'm open to looking at what the best mechanism is I just wonder whether the development agency should so be or CDC be considered as a possibility I don't think that'd other two completely different of shoes so but but if we seek a report on this then we can look at what what options we might want to be most of projects they mainly around development projects for local facilities right Andy I'm just a comment on the suggestion that ref is made in 6.5 up there maybe that report could come back to the funding working group we set up as a result of the metropolitan funding round oh yeah I might be an appropriate place for it to be considered in the context of other funding it could be there I'm getting a nod from staff at the side there so it sounds like a to the funding working group yep they're good all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie item number 22
System for elections and I'm happy to move this second up by Thomas Kendra so I'm moving that it that we are sorry decide what sorry I must read that I thought that a no wonder I got an email from a certain it's it in person I did very quickly I would like to move that we retain the current first-past-the-post electoral system for the 2016 and 2019 elections and councillor Scandrick you'd like to seek and there thank you are there any questions I mean this is on it and it on a deadline we have to resolve before the 12th or sep tember to change the electoral system if we decide to and and yeah and then it would be subject to a valid polled mind being made prior to the 2016 debri 2015 yes so regardless of the council's decision we still need to still have Apollo they still have to give notice that they can get a pole by debris yeah as to whether or not yes that's right so a Glen and then Andrew thank you we can in counting votes under NS TV system is opposed first-past-the-post although given you do count them and anticipation so that when we have their first resulted approximately 1 p.m. I think ninety percent or naughty private the only difference would be in terms of I know a number of electoral officers it's often not clear until the sunday or the monday under STV but there's really no time difference and counting it's just when when you would get the progress result but all things being equal it shouldn't make that much of a difference at all and the costs are exactly the same as to whether or not as if ppos TV there are six councils that currently is it so yep okay so we will still have to notify that people have a right to demand a pole and we have to do that by by the 12th suffrage day yes so dependent on after this decision that you made today I'll be giving a public notice in the paper and that within the next week yeah yeah okay Andrew to what extent has has what was their feedback I understand that it's been raised by one community board and I think you might be you'll see it through on your agenda on the eleventh of September I'm aware that there that's at least one board that would like to recommend to the council that they do go to STV but I haven't put this report to the community boards this is I have put it only to counsel but certainly one commuter board has recommended STV given the timeline is there time for a discussion with the community boards before council made a decision on it or do we need to make this decision today it would be very tight in terms of getting the notification and the paper because we I do need under the Act I do need to get the notification in the paper by the twelfth of September and given deadlines for getting public notices and that wouldn't leave very much time between the 11th of September which is the next council meeting and this but it's also in the positive because then the council would have to agree to that pole and time anyway so it's whether or not there's the five percent of electors and Christchurch would be interested in a poll for STV anyway and then we'd have to run the poem so hell I'm just a wee bit concerned in fact that hasn't had more discussion like for example look at the council's who use STV help how well there goes because my understanding is a in fact as a council if we if there was agreement in fact that we should change in fact the council can make the decision am I right in their care without the pole well you know it can be initiated by the council that the council council can decide so it could decide to retain or change it and then there is but if you decided to change then you wouldn't need the pole yes okay yeah the council can't decide to change the system but it would have to be used for both 2016 and 2019 so that it's not changing think the biggest concern so in Christchurch will be that we cut because the DHB who have a STV approach and there's a large number of candidates usually for their and it's a that comes across as quite a daunting task of the voter and I don't think anyone wants to add that in to that in relation say to err council or community board elections but on the other hand that they might you know there might be some reasons that we should we should consider others as an option fact measure was certainly raised by submitters to the recent inquiry into the running of the 2013 elections it was erased that was run by the Joseph electoral committee on balance the committee there was the talk of splitting the valid the ballot papers said that it didn't confuse people that on balance the cost and ease that was actually thought to keep it in the current system I think not just one thing that I would comment on this because they are in a way because I want us to do the representation review to to muddy the debate around this and this there was a ground swell of support from from from the community so the community itself can raise a pole and a five percent of the electors and crash each want a change to STV then that's fine but what I didn't want us to do was to ask driver change without having been out to consult with our community about how they felt about it and we're on a statutory deadline here so I didn't think it didn't he harm and US making a decision to retain the current first-past-the-post electoral system for these two elections it doesn't bind us forever but it is a requirement to make that decision now but we can certainly and all of the discussions that we're going to be having over the representation review make it very clear to people that they have the right to to call for a pole and a five percent of the population do want to go down that track then then that is the in that is the case so so receive a request with the required number of signatures by the 28th of februari yeah then that then we would have to have a pole in terms of the 2016 if it's after that then it wouldn't affect the 2016 variations yeah Jimmy we reviewed a 2.1 here your particular mention a moment and the 2013 action they have six council use STV it is near any laser City Council old district I'm dunedin city wellington city by the two major ones that I can recall the two the two largest councils that run is TV okay thank you okay so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you community
That we've dealt with item 18 so now we move to item 19 easement to the cdh be over recreation reserve who would like to move that how Paul lonsdale seconded it's going to pay off for one the second Airport there Phil Clearwater there any questions on this yeah knee which staff is dealing with us is this you might know Jane okay a little bit unclear to see exactly where the easements are but I presume these are just stormwater these months is it correct yeah so are we going to get another report in the future over things like roading easements and the whole issue of what land we now own and what lend the hospital owns because it still seems I'm our notice in an order on council but there's some questions have already been raised about the nurses Chapel Royal Chapel these questions around their access along by the rubber so are we going to get like a full report about the whole land swap at some stage look I'd like to come back to you on that about the jaani and are probably people and understand exactly the context of what you want to know and then we can take it from there but I think what you're seeing is just pull it all together it's at right yeah so I can't commit to a time and so I'll talk to you about the milestones along the way in so you can do it that way okay good all right I'll put the motion Oh Pauline so this storm water collected from the hospital itself from the grounds and going directly through the these men and then to the river like that it's a technical question I'll try and answer but storm water comes from different places yeah well does it contaminated because what else no the land the leg that this is just providing for easements for existing storm water pipes which have been caught up in the land swap that's all it does so nothing else changes that just to the existing situation except we now own land that has some of these pipes is it if you're in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you the next item is
Whole restrictions in public places amendment by law in 2014 because you've got cancer East would like to move there and second a photo if I could just make a couple yeah obviously canis Icahn let this one second goodbye term scandrett right that's race I think you look there were three areas here under consideration two of them were very straightforward the temporary alcohol bands at sumner and the addington trotting cup were went through without debate the contentious issue was the upper riccarton area and it basically sent it around the University and I first if I could just draw elected members attentions two paragraphs 4.4 through the 4.6 which probably outlined the the issues with the with this particular area here and it all centered around the university we had three very good deputations one from the university itself and one sorry to interpretations and one from the Student Union and I think it's very print to note under 4.5 that the university itself does take some very strong measures to monitor and address issues on campus and they have virtually have a 24-7 the hearings pinner we were quite impressed with the submissions that we did here and it made the recommendation that we approve the widening of the ban but exclude the Kent the University campus with the exception of university drive which would be part of the liquor ban it does appear and under 4.7 that there is a slight sort of grammatical interpretation there was a discussion with homestead lane whether whether that should or should not be included in the in the band and we went back to the University and and they saw no reason to have that particular thorough fear excluded but it does read rather funny in 4.7 so the maps the map on on page 3 56 that are clearly outlines the area of the liquor ban and you will see there the three University campus that's a B and C and in see the red line through the middle of that as university drive which is included in the liquor ban so I'm very happy to recommend that the hearings panel recommendation be approved I'll put the motion all those in in very detailed work well done
We don't have copies of the submissions so just wondering in the future if we could actually get copies I think it's really important counts as know what we're submitting on because this does sometimes have impacts on our policies central city living one for example we've made some quite strong comments to central government so you know I think it's really important that the full council gets a copy attached with these reports I'm also really concerned that the submissions panel when it was initially set up was supposed to be making recommendations to council when time permitted where time didn't permit it could make submissions ahead of council because sometimes these things are urgent but we tend to kind of have this pattern where things are not coming for ratification to the full council are being submitted and we're only getting them after the fact so can I please ask that these submissions and future are attached to the report and that the submissions panel actually makes recommendations to council when time permits as have I presume certainly the central but um yeah it hasn't happened oh cool oh look I agree with yanni and having these submissions attached but what I would like to say is it the boat's missions were exceptional submissions from it from an earth they managed to encapsulate exactly what we've been briefed on and the information we gave back to our staff to issue some it on so I just want to make that point they did a great job but it would be great to see reflected in here and sean to the rest of the council is what they did actually submit on so again um Jane change my call are you there am I in trouble cuz I get it when I hear my mother say James I know the only coming but I just want to make around that is probably just following on from what Paul said very often in most cases we have had a workshop around that and adjust and capture lates the feeling of the full council the only thing that I'd says I probably do beg to differ around having them be so long as it is in ninety-nine point nine percent of the time it's captured everything that the elected members wanted perfectly and I just wanted to say that if accounts that did want to really drill into it and make sure one thing more than welcome to a teen and actually be a part of that submissions panel and to you just ask for it and go through it and then you don't approve it Epis instance you know but I think that if we are going to actually have them reporting back to the I mean because I don't think the intention was to delegate the decision-making on submissions kennel unless the time required and I was under the impression to and if it's not the case of it make sense for it to be but perhaps after those were then approved by the submissions panel that perhaps simply an electronic link was circulated to everyone and if someone really wanted to drill into it then they can but otherwise you know there's no point in us having sort of three phone there's an element of truth in that so but let's leave it with the chief executive to establish a a good process for ensuring that people one know you know what's being discussed it submissions panels and maybe you know if people can look at the drafts before the meetings and as you say if they can attend if they can but you know I think maybe maybe the submissions could be could be available for people to pick up a hard copy if they want they can to you know either I chair them quite often or Paul does then all we want to do is capture the feeling of the elected members so if anyone would want to be there and couldn't just let me know and I'll make sure that it's articulated at their committee level yeah but but I think there's a general principle they should be reported back to the council for adoption priorities prior to being submitted all right so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried the report of the hearings panel on
This cause 15 minutes of the submissions panel meeting moved by Paul lonsdale who cheated on that occasion second about Jimmy chin I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye go to pro se no Carrie ok another submissions panel also moved by Paul lonsdale seconder by Jimmy chin of
Item number 14 reported the Housing Committee first item on the agenda is the facilities rebuild program social housing status update move clean clean Livingston seconded by pauline Cotter you like to extend thank you same thickness me like a quick overview I love steak you liked amen thank you I'm hoping at this point we may have a photograph on the screen just to give you a visual update of the Knightsbridge lane intensification with eight additional units and utter nuit this is the pages road I've just done several photographs for one yet you you popped out there for a taking some photos in your lunch break oh yeah stuffed yeah it's looking good hopefully it will appear at some point what a night say is that so that's proceeding we're putting on their priority of getting close units I know there we go I think the target day is pity for those so that's 8 units on existing council and there so that's eight additional later ditional right and how many were there originally neither is it 16 or 12 from 22 to 30 whether it's good that's good well done yeah excellent thank you pushing on getting our clothes units open we're looking at 75 is I think 59 that are kind of within a reach but the others I call a bit sticky they'll take a bit but more to get open the waiting list has decreased it's now the from June that is low its up from the July figure it's 288 of which we have 21 and character category a which is your most urgent immediate need that's the first part of that report before we get to the financial section okay okay take I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and the next bit is for those social housing financial status updates and yeah we're counselor Livingston moves in four lengths off of seconds it may be questions perhaps if I just highlight that a report is being prepared on the most effective use of the 15 million dollar interim payment from the earthquake commission so we were hoping but sooner but it's a big report so that it's coming October are there any other questions about natural yani my office staff 20 with the stuff like and come up to the table and um probably I'm bit of a broken record every month I ask this question but II to see global settlement just trying to understand how progress is going when we're likely to get resolution three close yeah it's not this group of staff that's a different discussions due to nuclear at a point where we are at the last bit of understanding who's got full information who has in the last bit of analysis so we're meeting with them again on the third of September so be able to give a better update after that meeting yeah and it's not a criticism of eq c eq c have limits and their legislation so they everything that they pay out they have to have legislative authority to pay out and in order to get their reinsurance that's exactly you know what they have is working very closely with EQC to make sure that our claim meets the alleged sort of obligations and I think we're getting much closer to a conclusion previous concerned that was expressed was that we've done all of our assessment we were waiting on a QC to finish their assessments but it sounds like evening lead of nearly got there and that's the meeting of it wasn't quite like that I think that there may have been how it was presented but I think that there were some some underlying issues about whether they felt that aspects of our claim meet the alleged set of obligations so we're working very closely an hour and very confident that we'll get there any other questions I'll put the motion for those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie well it would be the easiest off the hook presentation that staff of head today huh we've got two more items in them oh that report they're outside social housing so so that's okay all right yeah we can let the the the winds of winter sir yes development to buy the oral policy for residential rental register and you would like to move that is pleased if I am now is it the committee recommendation or the yes it is the committee recommendation and the item which is to adopt the staff I mean don't invite em be yeah right um be so can we move what 7.2 up to oh I see how does this work sorry page 380 so that that's alright that's fine no no movement and then seeking to bubble and kata yeah you know I thought it would be good if we could note that we remain open to the option of developing a local rental register I say that for two reasons one is that there's quite a bit of variance and the possible cost from half a million to 1.5 it could be that that's something we pursue and the activity management plan and the long-term plan there there isn't an allocation has pointed out in 5.1 so it has to be less right yep okay yeah to be some kind of national repository as it were for their information so that would serve to become a rental register so we think with the work that envy is doing it probably not make sense to double up we still think it would be useful and it ties in some way to the nice noise at the Ministry of business innovation employment or is it is at the Ministry of Housing that's located within the ministry of business innovation indeed it's air indeed that is that the overarching title for every department was enough is it yeah so Dave they seem to be doing it have a holiday house for the minister of housing today report to the minister of housing as even be okay hey yes I know they had multiple ministers but when I was one of those multiple ministers there was a secret it wasn't the Ministry of Economic Development it was the Ministry of comic it was oh no it was yes housing to build Rangers now mb yeah but like tourism store was its own set for it okay no is there any discussion on that I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed I know it scary thank you and the next item deputations by this is with regard to the evening fees if I could very quickly read out a short part of an email that's come through sometime back from the Me's Welfare Fund a woman has been in a home 12 months and a property manager is demanded of who the week's rent at four hundred fifty dollars just to re-sign the tenancy agreement called letting fees so this person has the woman has three children she's on her own the mb advice back on this is that for them this is the crux of the issue and the wizarding tenancies act that it's whether a current landlord may claim that they are an effect granting a new tenancy to existing tents so obviously we don't do this as a our selves nor do the good girls who made a diplomatic nor durs for instance David Lawrence real estate and Bill were so envious viewers have their own ethical conclusions to draw and I think I would like us to take we would like us to take a position in an environment where rents have gone up forty seven percent since the quakes you know is that reasonable to actually charge living fees so that could be a good debate if you weren't so you'd like to move that yes please and seconded by Paul encanta there any discussion Oh Yanni just to say um I really support this I just wanted to talk answers attention to the tenants Protection Association report that was done over a year ago into housing issues facing our city and this is one of the things that came up really strongly so encourage you to read that report to seek more information about why this is an important issue I think it's really important we approach government as soon as possible over it it is having a major impact on people is Glenn said we had a deputation from the good girls and they've maintained that their business is running perfectly viably without having to only a six month lease and then you have to renew it and then you charge the renewal fee again so you know I think that people do support this because it doesn't seem to have to be charged in order to have a viable management business yeah Tim I'm when you say some groups are doing so six month in renewal is there a management property management company or is that the owner so the owners of the property may not be aware that there is hit me with regards to the company okay the owner would see any if they have been called an administration fee yeah yeah talk right of reply thing we want it to be positive and a firm support of those who aren't doing this but we also wanted to ask the government you know what are you going to do because it could be it isn't normally in the act that needs to be sorted out because technically landlords can charge a fee but that's at the beginning of a tenancy it's this rolling over when the yep no that's good I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carried thank you if the report is a whole be adopted the in Livingston and calling Cotter I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the
Community committee here is its incentive grant approval for 25 mar streets moved by jana johansson seconded by paul lonsdale there any discussion about that one I put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that's carriage the next deals with the central city landmark heritage grant for Victoria mentions building and there was a request from the committee to leave the stone classroom of some Michael's school until after that had a meeting with the church property trustees but I understand it's taken place and that there might be wanting us to go back to the staff recommendation yeah thank you the the committee is actually had the opportunity meet have two meetings one with st. Michael's and one with the church property trustees I feel comfortable putting the full report today on the basis of those discussions really the point emphasizes that st. Michael's in terms of what they do is very much yeah at an individual trust so the decisions are not governed by the church property trustees in any way the church property trustees really just the trust that st. Michael's has I think the committee was a little bit concerned just to understand who had the government's role in terms of this facility it's really clear that as the st. michael's parish and there's a trusted up it does that I think on that basis I'm really happy to move that we do support this facility it is we were given a breakdown of just how important it was to the local area and in terms of its heritage significance and also the idea that we would support activity happening in the central city so Jen stuff but well with what our intent was I think is probably a bit of an ongoing discussion to have around improving community access if we can but certainly the school was very open to doing there which I think you know it's just part of having a good ongoing relationship in the final when I just makin terms if we had a really good meeting with the church property trustees just to understand what the work program was looking like they a an ongoing relationship where you know within a certain timeframe will will meet regulators to talk through how things are looking from from there and in terms of where their priorities are in relation to what we might be able to do to be in support of retaining some of the key heritage buildings so I feel like we've made some good progress happy to support these two landmark grunts both significant buildings I think it's great to see what the Victoria mentioned the idea that we would be getting apartments residential retained in the central city I think it's really important for the fantastic heritage building and a quite a nice area that has had a lot of heritage buildings retained rather than knockdown yeah I have to I have to say that I can't declare an interest this time for having lived at Victoria mansions building but I should say that I've always wanted to so does it can it's right it's right I might be able to buy one anyway so I'll put the motion all those in and Thank You counsel ago hence and I think that was an extremely positive you know resolution to the issue so there's great work the next item is creative industry support fund approval exchange christchurch moved yani johansson seconded Phil clearwater I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know carried in great outcome councillors 10-year investment and gulf of events hmm move it where councils receive the report and just to make cuts as aware we have received that information prior to the meeting today others up in the cancers lounge so if anyone wants to read the detailed information I think this is really good that with a full report into that the golf events we have considered invested a huge amount of money over the past decade and I think it's really good that we've finally got some really good understanding around the value of that investment obviously as we go through our long-term plan we're going to have a really good look at our events and festivals so I'd ask you not to pass too obligations for the event next year yeah but as anything we will work through what we do going forward to fit in with the LTP and the available funding so I just think it's really good that we've managed to get this information that councillors have been able to see you know the feedback around around these events thank you would you like to second that Paul yeah so just as I lonsdale second and the corner so a couple of reason to like if you're talking about the wider perspective 4runner crusher should canterbury when you've got 70 million people viewing your city that's a massive massive opportunity it at a time and we're actually wanting to bring people back into the city so opposed to earthquake we have suffered quite badly from tourism we need to get that back up and take us I think we need to look at other on a wider perspective than just actually and a golf event it is actually much bigger than that I can't do did it 100 no because I can't go the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carriage and then we could so far hey oh sorry no no no don't it's fine no no no it's a man it's a very detailed report and I think people were appreciative boulder coming yep we've got challenges going forward which we will take all of the information into account you could say Yanni again moving and somebody seconding paul lonsdale I put the motion so yes some of the puppy work particular round the disability Advisory Group we had the first report from that group I think it's really good again we've had a committee that got specific terms of reference to look at working with the disability sector and you'll start to see some results coming through from time to time we also heard from the symphony orchestra oh I think actually are doing a fantastic job with some quite exciting programs with some quite creative ways of providing music to our city so again we just wanted to really place on record as a lift the spirits of people and find out just say that the exchange christchurch trust which isn't Phillipstown really fantastic thing that with you know just proved funding for button hearing the collaboration and the enabling of young creative people to come together in an affordable space I think is really really critical for our city and the nice thing about this one of course it's going into philipstown which is an area that's lost it you know that the stadium is kind of sitting there not not a lot of use at the moment you've also got the school unfortunately facing closure it's really nice to have something positive going back into the wider Phillipstown area to just make that community have a sense of activity we're never lost so much so it's a really good initiative and maybe counselors can go on a visit it sometime great thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried so I'm going to enjoin for lunch now and we'll come back at one-thirty
That the report be received I'll move that the report they received seconded by Phil Clearwater I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the
Oh where is that sorry it's just such a short report that if I must it I turn the page too quickly item number 11 I'll move the report of the chief executive employment matters committee meeting seeking to both deputy mere 50 buck put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carried there is quite recovery committee of the whole
Um the resolution is is that that the council received this report move by ref mangie signature by Andrew tuna they're in the discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried next item of the earthquake claims update is it clear here for jun 2014 move breath mangie seeking to the android tuna that the report be received a promotion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the next item performance report for the 12 months for 34 jun 2014 ref mangie moved second of Andrew Turner journey discussion Johnny thank you just on page 205 I just wanted to draw council's attention to the under spend on the purple for the proposed character sources rebuild expenditure I think it's useful just to highlight this when it comes to the discussion later on at council that there is money here that we're carrying forward and I just also wanted to signal that in terms of the fury road master clean as well there is a 1.4 million dollar carry forward and that probably we deal with any issues regarding the Mount Pleasant main road which I was going to propose a swap as part of us but actually it's better we do that under the betterment discussion will have later on on today's meeting so I just wanted to bring counts as attention to the factors that we're carrying forward money for projects that we don't have any plans to do and we've got a demand from the community for projects that are we to go that we could possibly support so I just want to make that clear that we may have to revisit some of those resolutions later on I'd like I'd like to invite peter to say something because this was one that you gave man snow herself and I've read the reply and I don't necessarily agree with the way that you are interpreting up so Peter the reason for the carryforwards is because the work is expected to be done so so quite simply carry forwards put in place they've been adopted by council and in because the fury road master plan was only adopted in maize and a project spin was possible and I've provided this detail through to council Johansson but the point is probably more fundamental there the carry forwards are explicitly to manage a multi-year series of capex over a number of years and we because we have a year-end have to keep the projects going by picking on a particular element you need to be really clear that that's one that you've decided to not do anymore even though it has been decided to be done in the past yeah so that would have to be the subject of an explicit decision yes not just like I said although if you look at on page 210 again you see curve and channel underspend carry forward for better opportunity a determent opportunities with skirt projects so I really think the key thing to highlight two councillors and this report is that in our fortunate for Wilson's sake you know the committee would still hasn't seen the detailed plans the detailed projects so you know I you know of june next year to put them to something that could go now that's waiting for resourcing it might be a better approach and we haven't specifically identified you know the detailed design and and again there's money in here that has been carried forward there actually we're not picking up to get some of those yeah I think you missed the point the point is is that that has to be the subject of an explicit decision not to carry the Ford carry forward the money for that purpose or not to proceed with the work in fact there is it actually requires an explicit decision not to proceed with the work yeah so I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you how are we going we can do one more the reporters of whole be adopted moved by refugees seconded by Andrew tenor put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried I think we could probably do they have we not done the reporting sir
If if you want to say anything but I'll get a mover and a seconder so David East Anglian livin Livingston would you like to say something Andrea oh no it's just a very standard report just just pulling together a few bits and pieces to get this show on the road everything that we were aware of sorry but it cold yeah it's not good there's a lot of it going around oh there's been there done that and I called it the boomerang bug because it came back so is there any questions or comments that people like to make Yanni in this kind of ties into that whole Preston's being and what's happening there and I know we've asked for a memo to come back around the MOU I guess from a staff one of the only note that this is going to increase our operational expenditure at a time that we're trying to cut operational expenditure so I I'll cut it struggling to understand why would accept this becoming road reserved rather than point strip agreement 18 the league legislation legalization of land for road within Kristin's subdivision I'm really the Christians around 4.1 given our drive to reduce operational expenditure taking on extra operational expenditure in this purpose yeah I don't understand why we'd do that look this is one we we do have to take over these rods because of the self division and we talked about the prescence a more you wrong we have commitments to prestons and this would just be normal business so we're getting a circulation of a report on an update on the mou but I think the stands alone so it's the way that I read it but yeah phone clear we solved the mo either learn to do the school they are now wanting us to take back some of the land and make it a road and then pay for the upkeep of it sorry I said it again we sold them the land in school right what yeah we didn't sell the lien detail open this off your blog because I didn't anticipate the question yeah sorry um that's this fun I think just really if we could just get an understanding about I think they consume when we go forward if this becomes a common thing with new schools being built the increased operational expenditure you know given that we're trying to reduce a what is our kind of policy framework around it but the Ministry of Education have asked for this not at the data path the points of a point strip is largely simply effectively a physical mechanism between a subdivision and adjoining land owner yes we're talking about you know perhaps a meter of land at the end of the day so it's land that ultimately will become road and sometimes they are affected as as agreements between private land owners and developers although I think the ministry is signal in this report is it rather than relying on that having to negotiate with preston's they really want the council building frame so I think it's very much it's a very transactional item to allow that to happen it really has no significant bearing terms of mean I can't see that that's that that's a problem yani I really can't hurt it yes it's the future concern that if you look if you think of central city laneways wrote you know the more we take on to maintain when we've got pressure on our maintenance budgets then you know that there does it concern but I'm happy to support it today put it through but I think it would be good to get so understand and go forward around if we've got a policy on this yeah I do think this is a slightly different issue because it's about the Ministry of Education and the location of the school and not wanting to deal with the under vidual landowners but so I don't see that that will generate another report so anyway I'm going to put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried are we going for time we've got a time to do another one so we go back to I'm sorry did I finished up sorry I didn't mean to do that I apologize sorry I'm to a iphone 4 sorry about that
First item requiring a decision costs arising as a result of restructuring the building consents area after loss of accreditation that the report be received that's moved by ref mangie seconded by thomas kendra so any discussion comments questions no I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carried second item relates to the council staff accommodation costs and can I have a mover for the motion ref min ji seconded by Andrew tuna there any discussion yani yeah I just wanted to point seven given that we're out of that financial year were in a new financial year is that the correct place to be taking that money from that's a long walk to say yes I might be here for a while and that is the appropriate place and it refers to two last year it's just the way in which we have to work through the timing of it how much how much money is left on that kept it all under spend nothing at this point now we've gone through the year Zealand at the moment for last year so last year is effectively closed here but we're taking money out of it this was the the last transaction assuming that it goes through okay um Emma was it otherwise it will simply be a an overspeed I think they were just staff just going through one of the biggest cost was the relocation of staff and the foot out in the Civic building and I know it was concerning the committee about the level I think was three and a half thousand dollars per desk um can we just get and then I think it'd be mutual to understand what we're doing to address those high costs and I know the committee we did but I think probably good for councils to also hear that staff are aware of those issues in what they're doing to be proactive in that space maybe I could just respond today you correctly uh needed the cost of the fatty up who dis is about three and a half thousand dollars so that's made up of a variety of elements disc itself is 575 dollars in the whole range of other equipment it's required to enable someone to do the job those costs relatively standard for like it's not a disc who say it's that you need a monitor and estate and so forth so we've got a contract with SP furniture that was executed prior to us coming into this building that enabled the Fed out of this building going forward that contract expires next year going forward will be looking for the best price for the 30 out for staff the reality is that we've by and large maxed out the number of discs that we can put in this building so and there's not a requirement to install additional discs and historically and the old chum Street building the disks in the equipment used to go with people so there was a tune of about two million a year it was include in this area with the old model of tagging your desk a new equipment with you that's zeroed out now that the disc and equipment and assets that around the place okay there any other questions right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carried thank you and the next one relates to reassignment of delegations and director positions and other delegations move by ref mangi signifies cool lobster okay have that happen there any questions I'll put the motion oh you don't wish I just need to make one vehicle at a minimum yep on page 150 the paragraph which is a repeat of the earlier paragraph that reported services manager on the third line under qualified following qualified council employee we also just need to insert the word or external contractor which makes it consistent with the previous paragraph it was just a typo dat was mr. a method to appoint a suitably qualified council employee or outside cottage doodle convoy external contractor to assist in the execution so that's in the attachment to cause 3 on page 150 at the top so if we could just note that amendment oh we thought it is six point nine point three yeah good it so all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carried thank you oh right look I'm with the council's leave can I deal with item number 18 so that we can get it dealt with before and the lunch adjournment I note that the chair of the Burwood Pegasus community borders and attendance and pets you'd like to to join us I'm not sure
Number nine the minutes of the meeting of the audit and risk management committee moved by refugees seeking goodbye come on Jimmy chin I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried Finance Committee
Search destroy energy scheme progress report moved Phil Clearwater seconded by somebody Pauline kata during the discussion Paul yeah we received a report on on this through a civic building limited and just your sister I mean the idea is actually really really good just have some concerns around some of the things they have actually asked of us to do and that's around our own current infrastructure and how that has moved off so I think it healthy skepticism will be wanting to know a bit more information on how that's going to be called so we can be informed when we make our decision yeah well there won't be any decisions made until until we've got agreement Paul's meaning they're moving our infrastructure looking at a hub for this area here which will involve the potentially the this building the gallery the museum potentially what happens across over the road and we have a few million or many Williams olds with current infrastructure and was really young clear how that haven't got paid out or didn't get paid out or who the ownership of that asset when this new system comes in so we were a bit confused would be pretty the word that on how that was going to be rolled out though oh well do you want to come to the table because I mean it's obviously a significant as she do you want to speak full first or do you want yeah hi so thank you so this this is progressing along suppose the district energy scheme is sort of moving through that whole process of refining exactly what assets there how we utilize those assets what are the returns now we had a more detailed I suppose a further progress report at which counselor clear water and counts of a kata where at just the other day and we'll be bringing a report through the council on this matter but so yes I mean part of the whole value chain processes about what infrastructure is committed into the project versus what we take out in terms of savings and obviously becoming a keystone partnership the key a key piece of asset and keep P the gas supplies at the moment from the landfill and the Trojan part now that that is owned by the council not by the JV so we're a greater flexibility to play with that piece of kit as we like to contribute to this so very mindful of those costs but also looking at the both the short and long term savings we can get from anticipate participating just on top of that just we have a very large investment in this building obviously with another another party and and I'd be concerned if our assets were move to another entity that our energy s is removed another entity which affected the value of this building and a negative way over see ya Peter's got his fingerprint of the ability to tenant the building it's seen as a as a way in which any incoming tenant would get cheaper energy so it actually increases the value of the SEO it's one of the advantages so just I think that's the that's the part that was missing and the briefing we got so whilst in there so the good stuff for Lent void on on that cost benefit to to our own issue of this building and maybe others yeah l-look the environmental committee particularly wants the information to come back to us as elected members and it's going to happen in like the whole whole purpose of and the early briefings to showed that it is really about lower cost energy and different in different sources of energy so in fact we become more resilient and not not depend on just just one source in a day you know it it's it's critical though that we have a base for for all of us like an energy hub it has to go somewhere so that that information though will be brought back to us by staff but that is and it's not I mean the original staff recommendation was to delegate authority or enter into the agreement that is not going to be no see to it that the committee recommendation did not include that so yeah the committee recommendation is that it comes back to us as a _''_292.9 it comes back that's right yeah yani in a report probably the most depressing section is 4.6 which says the hospital has a substantial investment in coal-fired boilers and they'll continue because they're actually really bad for our environment and I would have thought one of the biggest cost advantages to this whole district energy skin would be based around the hospital then did you guys is anything that um like you because because if you read 4.91 you see Sarah basically are saying they're only a facilitator but could we talk to the government about the hospital because it just seems such a las tapas is the immediate future and it specifically says that the proposal for the health hubbers for a progressive move to a more renewable energy generation the introduction of wood chip Bureau on a new aquifer heat come so I don't think I think it's the immediate the IE they have the discharge rights at the moment they are continuing with that in the immediate future bit longer to him they want to move to a more sustainable source compared to answer that yes so the the development for the health hub at the hospital was subject to quite detailed negotiations this week and the hospital have have moved beyond where councilors it actually so that hub is going going ahead probably more quickly than ours and part of that negotiation does indeed include a ground source heat pump system so their new buildings and the extra energy for heating and cooling will be supplied by that and they also have plans convert one of their coal boilers to a wood-fired boiler and that's that will happen quite quickly then transition to much more renewable fuels over the next 20 to 30 years having said that it's true that they will continue with column short tune yep volume that's worth noting that the with the hub is where the well where the energy is produced and in its network doubt that it can be tapped into as time progresses by other people wanting to access it in benefit from it so that's that's really worth considering and also the fact that our landfill is and our ground source there's a great asset that we have the so but I think Paul you're right to waive those some those concerns and I think we'll get more information as it progresses yeah Tim just on four point nine point three council staff matter the main drivers for participating the DS which I facilitate energy efficiency alongside greater uptake of renewable energy so I think we should also be including cost savings yeah I mean there's this building is what that'd probably be most green efficient building and the area therefore so the district health board everyone else is playing catch-up but we're also looking at leasing that as Paul mentioned the some of the items in this building to the des or or selling one of the options so are we sacrifice in to be part of this I mean the situation we're in at the moment we've got to make sure that every penny that we save or we're looking at spinning has to be made sure that we're doing the best we can with right so yes so the the reality with our own energy assets is that we produce more energy than we can possibly use so by participating in the the years we also participate in the profit share from the use of that additional energy that at the moment I mean we're flaring landfill gas for example we're not getting the most lentil guess we could out of that landfill gas field so by improving those and by improving the operation of our capital assets here and being able to provide energy outside we we will actually share in the revenue stream so that's so no no so that that's measured per kilowatt or whatever so if we are producing more than our DS partners we get paid a big return the billows of how the financial arrangements work haven't_''_550.3 been worked through a bit so what we're doing at the moment we've got the technical specification so we know what's possible and then how that's packaged up in terms of the leasing or selling and then pricing arrangements for energy and for Peter gutter and and his Ellis take a look at sorry just I think I mean the figures that we're saying to see shows a direct operational saving to us starting from year one so I think that that's a positive take up for the council and we need to think about the assets that we own as being tools that actually util a greater energy utilization of which we can reap benefits beyond the current site and I think the key thing that we need to think about is balancing also the opportunity to not only make savings and be more efficient but also show leadership in the community because I think this is one of the key this is this along with the hospital as a key hub that can actually demonstrate how ideas could work and we need to graph that as well absolute Gris but not at the cost of the right path so I do think that there should be one of the you know the way we're looking at saving would should be included in those two with the third stack up it has to stack up for us and and it really has to stack up for the private market if they're going to be persuaded to invest in this as well so that's a big driver for all these guys and for those of you who have met I mean the people driving this our international experts who have run some very successful schemes internationally and delivered some fantastic benefit so you know we've got confidence in the groups that we were dealing with that they can deliver on this the 7.1 does pick that up satisfactory energy supply agreement and a reduction in operating costs so I think that it's pretty much covered off yep successful schemes go in there round and even they do yep so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed I know that's carried thank you very much and that the report is a whole bit dr. the game called clearwater thickened up by Jimmy chin I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that's Carrie thank you
This much was a technical matter as I recalled and Phil clear water will move seconded by Jimmy chin is there any questions or discussion I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you next item on the agenda
Whole move Jamie goths seconded David East I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that carried thank you item number H the Environment Committee part a report first in relation to a committee recommendation rising from a deputation and that would like to be moved by full clear water seconded by Pauline oh sorry thought in qatar sorry and would you like to speak to it look thank you and just it's started a minor correction just so we're clear this is this came from the clothes food resilience network that these people are here today dr. Matt Morris is too and just to clarify and 11 that it's like a typo but it's a crucial part it's about growing the best edible garden city in the world and we are expecting a report about this I understand that that report as being about food forests and edible gardens but that's being done in conjunction with our city council staff and the food resilience network people it's and so there are some clear ideas that had to support progressing this concept and I guess while the report should include some policy for us so in fact we can incorporate it or gardens as part of the way we do things and it's great that this has come from community groups but it's also helped wretch can we produce as soon as possible even potential you know to include some spring plantings perhaps Janeway like to comment on weather report yet but I understand it's not too far away the reports well in hand and I think it was requested for the next environmental committee and we'll make that dead right Pauline akela this was a really inspiring presentation and a great short film that that was shown to us and I just like to take this opportunity to reiterate bit ly surely papanui community board has run at second eatable garden awards which are not a competition there a recognition of people's edible gardens and it's going from strength to strength and I would really like to encourage other other boards other Ward's to pick this up because garden pride Awards because it's a different demographic and it's a different co popper if you like that that's not to say that you can't eat flowers so you could see a time when sacred Nugent some places but and I really believe that that our food you know long as there's a resilient City so I know that littleton Mount hoobat have run one as well and so the the models there it just needs to be picked up and run with so as I say it's really encouraging that people are extremely interested in their contributing and they're going from strength to strength we do want to move that to be coming eventually organic gardens or that perhaps a section to be organic but we're just taking it slowly to encourage people in schools and communities with your gardens it's also provides a great platform for networking for people great photographs coming out in the evening and people going I don't know you could grow that it's fantastic so it's a really positive project so I he saw with itchy what he planted a food forest up in the valley or thur summer I did it a better month deck and I'll help think some of the holes be sure it'd be hard to actually do here if they have to say but just at one small concern to start around them and that was speaking with the person who put the the planting plan together and it's around the nutrients and the soil and the watering and making sure the yeah the food forest is sustainable and actually had can actually look after it cell so in other words you know when the leaves drop off the SEL grow and put the nutrients back in the soil so right the only concern I have is around planting is on the boom and streets where you don't have watering and you don't have the nutrients and potentially she'll be in there so there needs to be a wee bit of thought put around that because we want to make these things if you start sustainable we want to make sure's a so big huge supporter but we need to make sure we do it right so they are easy sustainable I'm Andrew um yeah just following on from Pauline's comments we ran the edible garden Awards in the Middleton Mount Herbert Ward for the first time last year was well supported there was some amazing projects came out of that actually and a really lovely evening of giving the awards and learning about peoples and edible gardens which was great in the context of the recommendation just looking at the last line bring a further food resilience policy and action plan to council november I would urge staff in doing that to use all of the resources that are out there in our community so thinking of the the food resilience network thinking of groups like project littleton for argument's sake who've run a successful community garden and have advocated for edible plantings for a long time recently in littleton a type of food forest has been put forward and is being planted around planting fruit trees along our local children's main walk to as they walk from home to school and vice versa and so on so there's a lot of embedded knowledge out there in our communities that I would encourage staff to to use as a resource and engage with so that we're not duplicating any of the good work that's already been done okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no hey yep sorry so those opposed say no that's carried all right good thank you and the next one is the regional public transport plan public transport corridor priorities an overview and the motion before us have moved by Phil Clearwater sleeping too bad Jimmy chin so any discussion yeah did a question really appreciate the work that this committee is doing around public transport or not not not always easy but when I read through the report I couldn't see any reference to consultation with the community or the public so it just seems that we're being agreed to ask around investment priorities for infrastructure without any discussion with our community about what those or maybe staff could respond whether they felt that we should perhaps if we've talked to people and if not maybe what a process we could do to do that thank you well I'm happy to comment that like for example with the current inner-city Christchurch transport plan although that is Sarah plan the inner city part our council staff are busy engaging talking with people to get the views about that and that is it that are started I guess for example when it comes to some of the public transport hubs there's been already huge discussions with the communities and the community boards so you know there has been discussion I think as a council we need to keep in mind these are strategic issues and somehow we need to get them done but that doesn't mean that we not involve communities wherever we can but he Cain is going to go out to public consultation on the revised our PTP and september this year there right so so that we submit to it and then they go out for public consultation yeah all favor say aye as opposed say no that's Carrie thank you the next item is the cause of Alderman
It was my polite way of starting the meeting again thank you and now we move on to development contributions policy proposed areas of refinement and I suspect mr. Goff would like to move that and we would like to see it up mr. east council at East so is there any do we want staff up for questions yep who's who's assisting us on this hike to burn on fire water dude Chelsea Stuart's got to do it yeah a resident expert on develop with contributions rapidly becoming it excellent so Yanni um I think three years ago we agreed to set up a working party around development contribution that for whatever reason didn't happen we've agreed to set up a developer forum to review the dc's policy so I'm just really struggling to understand why this report is here now ahead of that working party or that developer forum actually looking at a DC's and reporting back elastically effectually the two things I saw happening in parallel I think the the first meeting of the development forum is next week I think what we were looking for here from the council was that was a steer so I guess we've identified the areas in the policy we felt that needed to be reviewed but we didn't want to get stuck into quite a lot of details number-crunching type work around that and without some sort of indication that council supported that general direction for us to explore you're not making any decisions about the endpoint you only make a decision about what we should be working on I'm sure that will be part of the conversation with with developers through that development format as we as we get those meetings going at Andrew um I look at the table on page or look at the list on page 15 and the thing that jumps out for me there is the big difference between big difference in dollar value between catchments so I lyttelton harbour 60,000 per fury and rural areas up to sixty three thousand and I mean I note the committee recommendation addresses the fact that there are maybe distinctions that we could be looking urban areas such as little from a corolla within those areas and I'm certainly keen to look at that but to what extent in approving this today are we removing the opportunity to look at any other options that wouldn't see that huge difference in dollar value per huey across the city ok you're not really removing those options I mean I'm only guess the other primary option is is to continue with sort of what we've got now which is where most of the catchments are citywide there are three catchments that a 332 to touch but pizza the DC where there are there are some location specific catchments for good reasons the rest of its citywide again you're not making the decision today to move away from a citywide approach to a more finer grained catchment approach all you doing it indicating you're happy for us to continue to explore that and for the for you that once we've done debt for the capital then to make a decision whether it wants to move that way or not all right yannick I had a second question which was um if we agree to this today what's the process within changing it based on the feedback we get from the developers forum but just to give you an example some of us were approached by a central city developer before we did our 10 million rebate saying that the costs were just astronomic for what some of the stuff around water supply etc and it did seem quite hard to understand why in a urban city environment which has had lots of density previously I've got very high rates of dc's so so how do we incorporate feedback from the forum into the dc's policy going forward and what I guess I'm just concerned that if we send a signal in a direction today that we're just continuing the status quo without looking at those other changes there's kind of two reasons why we went down a catchments route as far as analysis one is that the local government and many months now basically we require the council to avoid district-wide catchments where practicable we wouldn't have expected them previously was because the costs have been shared across the district regardless of what the actual cost of the infrastructure is for developing in different areas for your right in the central city normally you'd have some spare capacity and from existing infrastructure if you are doing an infield in phila brownfield site whereas in a greenfield site you've got basically a hundred percent of the infrastructure costs because we have to supply all of it so that's one of the reasons why we're looking at the catchments is to bring those costs down a bit lower as for your development forum question and anything that comes out of the development forum is going to be coming back through the strategy and planning committee for the decision on whether to action or pursuing your work around up there was a risk for us yani in just sits sitting and doing nothing waiting for that further for the forum take given that that these are clearly some directions from that the LGA we certainly being encouraged by the lip and by it was his prudence once the council were comfortable with it for us to explore it again you're not making any decisions at this point in terms of deciding to go down the sort of area fine attachments but we are I guess we wanted some some direction from you before we engaged a lot of work alright I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much and now we move to the
Item one the residential land availability which is also head through the district plan staff pull in that question about 4.7 please of stir ah sorry yeah I'm wondering how that problem was resolved the air overcome with the proposed Road excess anybody know the answer this might be you my Gazette got the broomfield common page 42 page 42 paragraph 4.7 it was the nation greenfield area it related to the hearings that Pauline intended about the broomfield common and they were just wondering how the Riviera and had been resolved so on there just this point I'm not quite sure that has been resolved it I mean there is a I gather a further scheme has been submitted by noble as a result of that I think this is I think that's the other the other end anyway yeah this is enterprise down enterprise yeah okay but but they're connected because of the connection but just season the report here that the constraint has been overcome an audience question is how has it been over time so sorry I arrived late the our resource I've always subject to a rule requiring that there was alternative access that alternative access hasn't formally been established yet I understand but there's an indication that there will be alternative access available by the time those sections are given title ah so they've been given resource consent anyway that's right but as as I understand it is subject to living in alternative access in place before the section 224 certificates issued which is when titles can be then formally issued okay seems to me that there was and I could be wrong but there was only the two options either the the road disagreement be solved the connection or a road put through broomfield common is that still the same two roading solutions that so admire the enterprise times land is accessed off entire drive and machine wrote the alternative access there were two options euros one was further reserve in other words through the noble subdivision but the likely outcome is that they'll be accessed through the noble subdivision to the main spine road that serves that runs through that block is noble subdivision that was coming back to us with a whole range of different applications don't go yet agreed upon in terms of it says of noble I can't comment on the current status of their consents I'm sorry that's my back goes back to the comment that I see the notice there is a revised plan has come back or nobody okay yeah but ultimately the connection is not the connect the connections are there in the scheme plan there is a there's a they have to then be given physical effect to that requires a relationship between noble and enterprise to be resolved I cant cannot force that outcome okay thank you Tim because the original plan was that the interface homes alternate fam exes was through the noble subdivision to the the better for the field at cetera so I mean we've spent quite a bit of time looking at the access point through the group view of common and both times it has come up it has definitely been viewed with reserved so I the next time it comes up be going through the noble subdivision is originally cleaned if it's not then I would certainly want to be knowing about it prior to any dispensable in concrete my understanding is it is to go through and and join the noble the spine road that runs further noble subdivision it's and that provides the alternative access rather than go free broomfield which was the original counter space that's right um yeah thank you I'm really interested I think I race this last time we had this report but we we just keep talking about residential land availability but well we're not talking about as how many sections are actually on the market and how many titles have been issued have you done any work around titles that have been issued and sections that are actually in the market rather than just sitting with the developer what a what this report relies on is a database an online database that got established post-earthquake to record how many sections were woman's own how many potential sections will within designed areas but also how many sections have certificate which is when the subdivision complete and then there was a ability for developers to log on and to enter into that same database the number of sections that are on the market how many sections have been sold now we're currently communicating with developers to try and encourage greater use of that system because it feeds into a page on the council website where people can go to see where there are sections available it was really intended as a tool to enable those looking to relocate to have a head start and finding out where to get where to look and and it's really that that's later into the process of how many sections have been sold and where their sections on the market is really dependent on that and put from the developers and there's been some input but it's not been comprehensive and we really need to get greater by on from the developers so so um the one that we do have control over is the one that we have an mou which is Preston's and they were there's all for at least 400 by april 2013 have we had 400 I've got the email you here we didn't email you that we provide infrastructure see reduce their power and in the developer would put the sections to market doing how many sections have been titled and Preston's not a fan no no as a reminder that there's been over 1200 consented and that would indicate there's been significant interest and I can confirm we served improves perhaps if you just circulate come on councillors with that information I know that they've sold beeps off the plane so right I'd like to get just a report on the mou that we've done with preston's because there's commitments up here for us to provide we not do that as a result of the report from the strategy and planning committee meeting and I think we'll just refer that bit to the strategy and planning to deal with next time that they report to us yeah that's fine I really don't want to take out the know sort of we generated the strategy is Ramiro but if you look at four point 10 it actually talks about Preston's but where it doesn't talk about is the titles in the emo you that we had an agreement that things would happen so I have no sense of what was in the mou whether accepted or not I'd love just to get a memo back about what's been done in terms of the MOU and how we're reviewing it which is what I've suggested that staff do but they we can raise it next time through the strategy and planning committee rather than as it possibly a council member rather than a refuge emo god yeah the only grow to councillors all those we don't need to bring it back thank the committee for so we can we can do that thank you just the other question given that we've got this database which I think is really good is if you need anything else we can do as a council to encourage developers through cotton this issue because you that it provides opportunity for people to buy sections to build houses if we're freeing up a lot of land and that's not happening that's probably something we want to understand a bit more I think one area in which we can encourage if there's a large number of views of this web page and a lot of people going on to look at where sections are available than this potential for greater by and developers so it's really trying to ensure that it's for the general public they're aware of this information and in the past we have had media releases and it's simply in a accessible location on the webpage it's really just ensuring awareness of it that can result in a greater demand greater interest from developers to update it but but then some of the developers may be unwilling to share information that they perceive perceivers compromises there thank you Paul we're gonna all the thought of being really easy to map from the building control group that actually understand what consents coming through we get planning so this metal mapping it knowing where it is where the sections coming online and then we'll give you a pretty clear understanding of kind of we wear it I think I think my consent sabine grant and font subdivisions have been approved that doesn't necessary be a lot of relationship to the timing of when developers choose to release them to the marketplace and and we know doesn't understand how lucky fierce a 4,000 sections of our urban Preston's we've actually consented 300 or 400 or thousand or whatever would would know heavenly eventually gone through the thought I will know well yes but but a few I mean I think I think if we then need to go and track individual building consents which actually don't necessary tell us the buildings will be actually built and it's a separate process again it's that's quite an additional piece of work for us to do that because at the moment as I said in terms of land supply our our knowledge is limited to we've got the land zoned buildings are we don't track that when titles are issued we don't capture that information only in in a gross way we do and all those individual titles may be consented that something that lens does it's a measure I I'd like to put the resolution if that's all right so we've had it moved and seconded that the report be received I put that motion all those in favor say aye there's a place they know that is carried
Very quickly I'm great to see goethe hall in a corolla going to start work in September 2014 do you have an indicative project completion date in my files which may be arson to this afternoon yeah we'll get that to work yep that's cool okay can we get past page thing tree cool page 34 yep pauline regarding the two poles while for the norman coupe do we have any idea when either of them will be an open for business I've got the start dates but not the finished it you got a question dope the second one I can give you a comment on wolf and we are targeting and we've just written contract with City here to actually get away we are targeting early January so to open yes so we open for a short period unfortunately only this year but we just couldn't get it open my Christmas so ok awesome say only do you guys think that's on the fifth of January off the top of my head with opening on the twelfth but those are just did you know Norman Cook I mean did you know the answer to the question about a little fall and I think that if ever no that's a possible delay that was the question android the original date for Norman Cook was twenty-second of december and we're hoping that there's still the case my request for staff is that bearing in mind the proximity of 22nd to December to Christmas and holidays and we know if we lose a few days chances are we will lose longer than a few days if there are likely to be any changes to that can that be communicated with the community board and the community as clearly as possible place what's that Oxford Street Christmas present right okay let's let fear and understood okay page 35 page 36 page 37 get the report is a whole be adopted those of every sat I those clothes carry strategy and planning Jamie moves and Jimmy seconds
So this is a petition that they want to present and we would like to welcome you and you are very welcome to speak to it thank you thank you very much for your time so I'm mural and Henderson and I have a petition from the bishop Bell community of 3356 signatures it's been a very interesting time sitting at a table right and them all and talking to everybody's needs and I've got quite a different picture from before I started so it was good and the people of Bushido and surrounding areas are really missing the busy complex and desperately need a big well the librarians are doing a marvelous job of the temporary and the temporary library it's not meeting our needs there's many people in the area with no means of transport who have relied on the library and community center for their social needs people in wheelchairs as well as parents with strollers don't have enough room to maneuver through the door in between the aisles so many are unable to use it it also has very before preschools used to bring groups into the library but there's not enough room to do this and the temporary one in storytime for babies and toddlers which was very well attended at the library is now unable to take place now the community center I must admit when I started this petition it was all for the library and you know not so much for the community center but when I started talking to the people it was the first thing was a Citizens Advice Bureau which was the end it was very well used and people are really missing it and they community police to very important to everybody and then there's a host of other activities what you saw on the green before in meeting weekly this rotary pottery group probus or bowls table tennis Weight Watchers ballet yoga jazz hip-hop old-time dancing karate and kiwi Anna's and a genealogy group and pee and the individual rooms weekly meetings legal advice every Thursday night that was arranged by the Community Law Center Northwest workers Education Association bridge group who were very keen to get any organizational club and night people who use the community center all booked and paid the council for hire of rooms at the bishop tail library and community center were to be reinstated it would put the heart back into the community I feel it's important that you know how the community feels and how much they need and want the best possible version of the complex back time has gone into collecting those at ages so yes thank you for that excellent feedback and I'm not sure the protocols about those questions but if you had them it's just he's it I just interested in understanding if the ymca had made any difference at all a number of those activities and yes very sorry many activities that it wouldn't take the place of it couldn't you know the Citizens Advice Bureau has that's really really important it's played an important part and the community and and the police presence being their toe in the own CA was there before when the library and community center with you although it's a together those two spaces all those three spaces you know which and partnership together so for the ones he has has taken some of the groups and has his some space as well but they haven't been able to fulfill their get that that community center that that top have you looked at the scale of what we're proposing which is you know a library and in a smaller community center and is this well I can't see all of those activities heaven ruin to be the I don't know the Citizens Advice Bureau was the monday to friday you know every day in the community police so yeah and I mean it was a meeting place for people it was just the heart of worship doe yeah thanks yeah knee injury my question he probably follows on from the question that counselor you're handsome just asked you've spoken to 3356 people did you get a sense from those conversations of whether the community would prefer a repair and reinstatement of the existing facility or the the new rebuilt all be the new or the main thing is they said we just want it back you know they want there were so many people I was just blown away because I started out just concentrating on the library so yes okay okay pointy signatures 3356 it's pretty amazing it really strong research normally someone would read out the career of the petitions do you want to read out what the petition agencies what the expression says help save our library and community center we the people of Bishop Dale and surrounding areas wish to petition the Christchurch City Council to reinstate Bishop Dahl library in community center from senior citizens to toddlers and everyone in between we miss the heart of Bishop Dahl and desperately need it back okay thank you very much indeed and thank you for all that's gone into making that petition it's a very good representation well it's very important to us all and we need it back as soon as we possibly can okay thank you listen to that message loud and clear thank you okay thank you very much indeed obviously those issues we excluded and the agenda thanks very much and so we'll move on through the public part of the agenda and the next item is item set
The next one sorry yonni you've got problem I just wanted to say that there is a memo coming from the community one would in relation to the deputation that we've just too and there is a possibility under the Finance Committee that we could possibly pass a resolution yeah but we can do it later yep okay and bell hendersonville Maori community board welcome on the trip down library no doubt welcome though we're in your hands you know the rules reputation yeah the speaker's run now thank you for hearing our deputation this is very brief but it's clear to show you that the rebuild of a small smaller purpose-built billed as a better option this is a council-owned facility and population so it's going to continue to rise and the median age the younger and the older people use the library in the community center that a higher users we held a community conversation in the bishop Dale area and the overwhelming feeling was that they wanted a new purpose-built smaller facility the older facility was lacking and heating and ventilation why the community wanted a smaller purpose-built building you can see the number of groups that use the buildin it was the busiest community center and the city before it closed and the forty percent bookings on a casual basis showed you how popular it was and if we had a new facility it would be even more popular I'm sure you can see the social housing in the area so these people also used the facilities and especially the library and then we get on to the benefits of the rebuilt and modern building designed to meet the needs of the community it would be a bigger space for the library and more functional because the old building was very old and the ventilation heating and access was very poor and as you can see the opportunity would be more to be more efficient building and it would contribute to the regeneration of Bishop Brown more which we always have problems about keeping the activity anthem more which is a council-owned facility again and it would be more financially prudent to build a new building at this stage 500,000 from the capital endowment fund this was the only facility that we really put substantial money into because we want this facility so much in our area and you can see that we only want from the council two million eight hundred and twenty four thousand which from compared to other facilities that people ask them for as lease basically that seemed of my deputation nope thank you thank you for the presentation now you mentioned prob ongoing problems or previous problems with Bishop tail mall could you expand on that a little bit please yes there is a new supermarket in there but the shops even way a bit they are full at the moment but the rumors of some of the big stakeholders leaving and we will have to keep the interest happen the more to keep the intro step in the whole area because it is an area that needs support thank you for thank you for your presentation yes very good but I'm concerned like you mentioned the review is the mall anything or pay tendon repair but I'm concerned a moment counselor by review is nice to him so harshly resume but repeal public Costa 44 mere four million dollars in my right but repairs or two point of three million dollars so they still have a 1.7 million dollar escape so I just want to know the elevation here this this was a very old building before the earthquakes and then there had been talked for about 10 years of replacing the building because it had leaks the heating was very bad in it the axis that left getting up getting up all the stairs were very difficult to get up for the older people even though it was still very highly used the council head and tagged as a building that actually needed to be rebuilt so the repair as as you can see on the last SAP slide over time is not really financially prudent thank you I'm just two questions one is um on page the feedback from the bishop Bell community conversation it says the overwhelming desire was this as I read it to fix the community into a library and get it open is that to understand that feedback a little bit more because you're asking for something different to what the community here last fall I don't think that's the case I think they would support us totally for a new building they just want something bad they even had anything as a community center since the earthquakes so it's been closed that long so that's what they're wandering back there wandering at the winter sea would say was the community conversation held before the temporary library was put on or after before before right okay and in the second question as in terms of the future of bishop down more I mean I say there's a real opportunity they have a really good look at bishop del mall through this process have you got any work identified as a community board to really look at what is the future long-term for Bishop Elmo um yes we're always sort of looking at what we can do up there that we have problems with the bus service up there with a cane people getting into town getting the ship down we cannot get the orbiter to go there that's one of the things we'd really like to do too when he's 30 ionia sorry to interrupt but do we own the land with which pressure down walks that's all or yes we own the land price people in the building yes and we own the library yes and thank you look I'm just preps interested in the floor area of this and as a general sort of comment that's probably directed more staff than a question to Pendleton why Mary board but it seems to me that we have a number of community facilities on the go around the city I'm not sure whether there's a huge disparity in the floor area but there seems to be a huge disparity in the amount of money that's being applied to each of them and I think we rerun the risk really of fitting communities against each other while I saying well this community getting x million dollars for a facility and this one's getting there and I don the price of the price per square meter of the bill we seem to be having a large disparity so I wonder really whether that's a question for staff as to how we're okay got it all I can say is we have very few community facilities and findell from my Mary compared to other words if you wanted if you want to weigh the map we have very few facilities we have this and we have a and findell from we have a vessel and we have a little hall in here what that's all we've got and the whole war ward of the area so it is very important thank you thank you I used to live the years you know the YMCA is quite a new build isn't it being well used by the community you know with oh yes it's absolutely it's it's used to the maximum so this is compliments of ymca very well because it sits adjacent I mean it right on the mall itself yes but you still feel you need and do absolutely as casual usage through the start they were previous quite was the community center those people are displaced in having to use other venues away from the community so it's about bringing those people back to their home um thank you well and in David so tell you the half a million dollars which your community board are putting through you know from the capital don't funny that indicates it's a top priority for you we understand that the remaining amount is about 2.8 million for a new building so I just wanted would they be potential safe from the work from your wider catchment area for the library to for us to sort of support you to look at how the might we might preps obtained some external funding for for for a library likeness of a community center is there a possibility personally I would like to see the go he'd first and then then maybe we could approach the community I don't think we could do it the other way around dealing with and public excluded so it's not helpful got very very much thank you very much indeed I'm there is also a petition from Maryland Henderson and turn Nesmith a Marilyn and Tony here right come on our and
Deputations by appointment I have three and I have the Sumner well a groups on some math that represents some of the library some of the residents association summer theater group and some of the museum and then I have linda and derek from the mouth isn't community center and then I have fell on from the record from the condition my marriage community board and for the team from sumner there are quite a lot of you are you all combining to make one deputation is that how it's written ok cool or could I be really kind and give you what 15 yeah ok ok come on forward and I think you guys probably know how it'll works but there's 15 cat up for you I've been reasonably fluid at the evening so can I you wanna do a whole 20 questions to it could be right yes you so just so you guys and the people who follow on from you realize that the amount of time actually includes the questions so if you want to allow time for questions don't you've got a number of groups here I'm giving you 15 minutes ok wonderful right we were in your hands feel free to use the time how you work ok so honorable deputy mayor and councillors good morning my name is Peter Hanson and my colleagues here Tanya jephson and her future and Manny Kent and jointly we're representing the Sumner community center the Sumner library rebuild support group Sumner museum and other local groups and individuals and we're here in support of the council's rebuild project for summoners community facilities and its full funding of 10.1 million dollars and as we're saying we're listed as three separate deputations but actually we won United deputation were all reading from the same page and we wish to thank the chameleon des el for highlighting community centers libraries and Paul's as council priority and we thank the mere two for acknowledging Sumner by name as a community facilities rebuilt and this was in her interview with Katherine Ryan on nine to noon on the fifth of August community centers libraries Paul's and museums stimulating places that bring people together and they contribute to their well-being they're providing places of recreation of lifelong learning and links to our cultural heritage and indeed and some that we enjoyed those facilities they were very much at the heart of our community activities and never in our lives did we imagine the loss of these facilities so dear to us but the 22nd the ferry 2011 earthquake changed all that the community center the library and the museum were damaged beyond repair fortunately our community pool survived sumner library the loss of our local library has been huge residents said that they felt that the heart of our community had been torn from it some has had a library since 1876 that's 138 years in the 1990s the summer volunteer library was absorbed into the Christchurch City Library System and the staff of home sense have provided a much valued and appreciated professional service to Sumner and red cliffs and the library it buzzed constantly with activity it was used by preschoolers youth family seniors visitors tourists from backpackers it was a social center it the village where it complemented other shops and businesses and it helped to create that dynamic of mutual benefit to each other the library figures for 2009 and 10 show that an average of over 2,100 people used the library weekly in transactions for their year were over 112,000 so what do we have now we have a mobile library it's a minivan that contains a thousand titles and allows up to three people inside at a time for Papa or for toddlers as you can see on the picture it's a temporary solution nearly three and a half years now yes we're really thankful to have the service but in reality in the long term it's not enough for the needs and expectations of Sumner and ricklefs queuing in the rain the wind the cold the heat and the dust is no fun for anyone children elderly disabled access for the disabled and elderly isn't easy either and we understand that library usage by this group has dropped and with the limited range of titles it's hard on users pockets too and they there's no direct bus to lynnwood library this gate and if people do drive there or elsewhere they also do their shopping and their coffees thus taking away much needed business away from sumner we desperately need a new library and the heart put back into the village I'm aware that the developers of the ray white building in the village have proposed to Council that the library least their ground floor this could be a short-term option I understand that the library fit-out would be very expensive and rent based on market rates would be well over two hundred thousand dollars annually so any money used for a temporary fit out and rent would be offset against the rebuilt project funding and on that basis we would oppose anything that would reduce the full funding earmarked for the summer facilities rebuilt we love the concept plans for the new library which would double the floor space we've been over and had a look at the new aranui library and we've seen how such a wonderful space could also work for Sumner the solar museum just this opened in 1979 and the former summoner borough council officers the community center that we've lost its run by volunteers from the seminary cliffs Historical Society don't if you remember but on 7th of march two thousand eleven it was the very highly publicized dramatic rescue of the museum's contents by the japanese urban search and rescue team and the sumner Volunteer Fire Brigade items for them photographed they were stored in containers and garages the museum's fortunate to have a temporary release of the former summoner police station is small it's cramped but at least we can have access to some of our archives and to our research but did you know that this is the second time that some of the records have been saved from destruction the Christchurch City Council disposed of the saamne Borough Council's records by dumping them in McCormick's Bay which was then a rubbish dump a concerned local resident where the sense of history the late stand rule of night ah who and his wife Topsy currently carita she's here today they salvaged what and these form the basis of the museum's collection and the irony is this that these records are used on occasion now to answer councils queries real wide range of important local issues especially since the earthquake with thumb underground services and reservoirs and all that sort of thing other records include Diaries local newspapers land records dating back to 1851 and these have been really useful post-earthquake as well for local residents air for council there been maps and photos newspaper clippings records and minute books of local organizations and also a Maori and a pocket Pakeha a Papa genealogy collection and they're all telling something of a summoner districts story the museum's archives there are a unique local record which can't_''_572.33 be replicated elsewhere and it's vital that the records stay in sumner we appreciate the space set aside for us in the concept plans for storage and research and we also appreciate the ability to have permanent and temporary display exhibition space telling someone is fascinating human history that stretches back almost 1,000 years thank you thank you very much indeed uh more okay yeah alright moving on to the next slide not only was the community center and museum and library lost but there were 12 other community meeting spaces and some lost losing the RSA the marine tavern Surf Club restaurants the club bizarre ruptured duck and the thirsty Mariner as well as the scalped in the van asch school hall and the All Saints Church and Paul and also the star of the sea Hall which is now being used as a church so it's been lost as a meeting place the loss of so many community meeting places has put real pressure on the temporary community center in the old school hall the theater group has worked hard to modify the old school hall for cabarets but it as a temporary venue and has many limitations the photograph is of the recent cabaret production that finished just two weeks ago and again very successful at fundraising and that is a key point that the theater group has raised forty thousand dollars each year for local communities as well as funding the community center operation to keep the the community center in the near future is essential to give all the above groups a proper home the former community center was well used in a vibrant place we need to replace these very successful facilities thank you I'll be very quick so I'm not sure what the time is we'll can see the clock how much time we got okay Humphrey and Peter touch on a very important type of subject and that being that we are only using temporary facilities so with regards to the police station where the hubby's and the museum we have been advised that if there's another disaster we have to be out of there in an instant and where do we go the same of the old school hall if for example the school needed that Hall back where do we go for community facility and if they ever happened between now and say a year or two years time is this council ready to at that point to rebuild a new facility that we need so desperately so now's the time to make that decision museum and community hall because now if we don't make that choice right now we may lose that opportunity later on and we don't want to see funding spent on a temporary fixture when what will happen is the funds out of the temporary will come out of the budget of a rebuild of the whole facility so we really want the money to be spent on this facility so we've been through a lot we really need your support today please consider the rebuild of what we need back it's not just for us here today it's for the young people it's for the older people a lot of older generation use libraries they use community facilities you can put on many courses cooking classes all that sort of stuff we need this facility built back the village green may have a to improve site to go to so it's a win-win for our community we're working collaboratively and we really need your support on this thank you that's it yeah that's okay open for questions much so it I'm very increased with the amount of fundraising that the theater group was raising every year for a zip for summoner groups or all around the city reckless you're all over the cities on to come every year and that's citywide we've had groups in the past few Brighton Lions and the year that generally from ferry me to Sumner but there are wider groups as well and so therefore as the ability to raise that money being hampered by your smaller facility now yes very much so and the the audience size is limited and also the number of shows we can perform as restricted as well right and the other question I had to was I'm surprised there's no direct bus to lynnwood you see so just been to buses it's part of the reviews it yeah so that's number 21 will stop very soon from Mount Pleasant and I've got it hit takes 29 minutes on a bus and go catch two buses or if you catch a bus into the city that's a 30 minute bus I'm here as a mom of a toddler and I've only just moved to summer from Auckland so I'm sort of looking with a you know a hit as a boy so I understand everything that's happened but logistically for somebody like me with you know indeed certainly somebody elderly in the community to get to eastgate which is where I'm currently taking here to the library you know this it's a long and bumpy road as we see it burn even public transport to get via as prohibited of energy and ce4 slides to the van it's great but when she visited act she was just like kind of where's the library Mahajan say it's not the same yeah yeah and I want you to be able to join frown brownies and do gymnastics and you know have a space it's actually functional for that for you to grow up and summer yes I and it's all my for my neighbors and friends with little kids as well thank you thank you for your presentation I just wondered and I just wanted is the potential for the land say that they have to be part of the larger community center in the future no their site has been red zone because of rockfall risk you told me at the money they got over I'm probably talking about the MSA as an organization to they have they have no land because it's been totally red zones but so they've been given a power so they have some money but so at the moment they're like separate though from from the other groups there has been talk between council staff and the RSA to look at possibly building combined building but I don't know where that conversations got to so Gary Watson's here he might be able to give you a bit of an update on where that conversation there too yep just mystic location you talked about actually the business of suffering because you have to go out of the area and I wonder if there's any indicative figures and I do know myself feel better I don't know if the because they aren't able to be supported enough and the last year and I know there's from memories about three but can you guys just give me a quick deal I can't give you any figures but we see the rebuilt community facility as being an anchor project right in the village that would be the glue that would really help to to help them drink ability to function and in to prosper because people used to go to the library the books for the community center for the exercise classes pop over the road to the pharmacy and pop into one on the caf azor into the bookshop which is now defunct and we're ready yep we're really of the mind that having this council facility would really just really help to generate some new life in the village because it's pretty dissipated but I can't give you any actual figures yeah it's very quick um you've asked for 10.1 million people on budget if we put up to 10.1 million would you be happy to look at applying and absolutely we'll even see what we can we can get our community to fundraise as well in fact we did lodge an application with the Lottery's three years ago but we were told that until the City Council makes a decision on the future that they just wouldn't consider it thank you guys and thank you for all that you're doing in the community as well it's one of the nicest things about being on the council is listening to what people come and tell us about their own communities and the passion with which they tell us so thank you very much indeed and obviously the issue that you're asking us to consider is in public excluded so I just want you to be aware that there will be along council meeting today may not want to sit fertile but you are of his most welcome if you want to thank you thanks for you know Oh
As will do the minutes of the previous meetings so that we've done some things in order the minutes of the meeting of the Wednesday 23rd of July moved 10 seconds of Jimmy put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the minutes of the meeting of the 31st of July move Phil seconded Glynn a problem I'll put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the minutes of the meeting of the 14th of august moved wrath and secretive yani that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the minutes of the extraordinary meeting of the City Council on the fifteenth of August moved gleam and seventy cool that those in favor please say aye carried so all the minutes and are done and we can
For the first part of the meeting welcome to the meeting dave is on and a very warm welcome to those of you in the public gallery many of you making submissions we have obviously the live stream working we have some media here and we also have Richard who's making a film on food forests and food resilience here with his camera so that's who all those people are and just in terms of starting the meeting there are apologies from Ellie and it's going to say Vicky that she's moved and the infill alien from for lateness loves jamie is Jamie around Jamie's around somewhere ok move to Ellie and moved Pauline sorry seeking to clean take those those in favor please say aye those opposed to carried that and just before we go into the ditch
And today is the last day that we've got to do this so we have got two or three more things that we need to do and we've got 15 minutes to do them and so I'm going to be incredibly tough on the speaking time right so what I'm going to do is move is have yannis I'm on page 151 and and is that recommend is that your one there Yanni yeah the compromise we got tears will leave the community will leave the deletion of the community housing mechanism and so will delete that role but we'll leave in the role that applies to the ATM which does see which one do you want to take out well I just need to advise some stuff and I think it would be 14.8 point 1.4 gets deleted is that right preciate so which one do you want to take out actually yeah so the for the community housing one we remove the expiry on that one from 2018 but we leave the expiry for the EDM at 2018 right okay everybody clear of that please say aye those opposed it's clear that carried right okay and then we have a separate one that I'm told about our 6.3 further down actually if we just go back up to 6.3 that Liam wanted to vote on that separately is that right this 6.3 approved recommendations table some people want to vote against that am I right well no let's let's do it now okay so here's the other way of doing it no keys stadia guys excluding appendix seven tempura if quake recovery activities and the officers reasons for recommendations 14 and 15 is that well can you work out what you want so that we can get both it on okay yep there's been some discussion around a compromised position of agreeing to the extension but 2018 rather than 2019 so just for a further two years rather than three right okay okay if you could do that that would be except what else have you guys got remembering that we've got 15 minutes before we lose a quorum unless the urban design which is third thing is something on sub-divisional I think it's important that you spin urban design spend some time on you been designed an assessment criteria it's in relation to the residential check okay so do you want to give us three minutes on urban design because you've seen and noticed very quickly around the urban design we've we've undertaken on the page services sorry at age 100 and initially at page 135 where we are in relation to recommendations six suggested some tweaks and changes to the standards very quickly I'll get a can to talk as quickly as you can about the relationship between the urban designed the general room design and the bottom location standards and and why we've elected to change some of the standards but but not change the urban design assessment hi it's akin it's the Nike backwards now basically the what I what I'd like to highlight here is that we've suggested mainly for small changes to the rule set and however the link here is what we haven't_''_259.05 changed so this design assessment and we haven't_''_265.29 changed the or we're not proposing to change the urban design design assessment trigger which is at three units so in context of this the changes are basically shall I go through them in Oh summary all the legal I just like to add 20 because what he can saying is that what we what we're suggesting changing in terms of the of the physical built form standards they're adequately addressed by the existing business in terms of the urban design so we feel that we are simplifying the rules without losing the without losing the endpoint without losing the bottom line that we're trying to address so currently we have about some braces approach where we have a rule and assessment measure and this proposal is basically to have just the belt but not remove it completely it's good design I'm yes right okay and simplification okay good designer simplification sounds good any questions guys Danny can you just the height and the residential area is it going to be covered or is that part of this at a moment there is a role there is a diagram associated with that what the role that really needs I think somebody with a PhD in maths to work out how it works we're essentially it advocates or it looks for different roof slopes depending on the height of height of the building we're simply saying that we can standard don't we can simply standardized that to a standard height limit of nine meters in the residential medium density zone but with a bonus of an extra two meters if there's a if there is a roof a pitched roof of at least 22 degrees at the top of it so instead of having to I think fight your way through this rather complicated diagram it's simply simply a blunt statement that says nine meters with an extra two meters if you if you have a pitched roof so great yes okay cool my meters is generally three I will change it actually there's no change for the height limits it's simply changing how we express it has always been the case meters allowance to the group the diagrams were I think they were initially put them to be helpful to show people what kind of pitch they would need to fit into that two meters but we find that it confuses people rather than have some so we're simply removing that part the standard remains dudes apartment how many stories the minister hasn't asked us to make any changes and specifically about height limits but the general direction and the comments were to review the review the rules to reduce the complexity is this we could giving particular regard the order and council it is about streamlining and complicity and those kinds of matters of look at the last page of other catchment one which is the minister's comments but even without noise making an understandable to people I think I desirable when that's right yep we're all happy users clear concise language and it's easy to use we're all happy ok cool next one very very quickly as well we're recommending Beck's rules that relate to tree and garden planting and be simplified and that page there's 135 and that's the impact of it because it's quite effectively some of the some of the finer grain rules have been removed the finer green 00 ikan speakers so gone sort of two main bits that are dropped from the rule that I posed to be dropped from the rule are the requirement of landscaped area minimum landscape area by entrances and requirement for number of trees who Siberia and they're both addressed and the urban design assessment measures so we actually address the entrances so the reason behind having requiring landscape by entrances we're to increase the definition of entrances especially in multi-unit developments thought so because we have the urban trigger that kicks in at three units we're actually able to assist with the entries are well defined or notch in multiple developments using the urban design assessment measures so this is what I was alluding ever before that keeping that assessment measures and the trigger allows our sexually addresses without needing and rule excellent and there is no distinction between the type of trees be a nut tree or any of those things could it it can be any sort of tree it can't there are very broad the Scriptures around trees so they have to be a certain height like this they can leave boot or not chance okay so there's nothing in here that stops any food forest development cool it's good excellent any other questions guys not watching next one pudgy yes sorry very very quickly very very quickly these there are two windows setback rules or three window setback roles each and different sections of the of the plan and I'm once again at page 136 and these rules have a very complicated set of angles and measurements and angle and the angle of the window to the boundary if it's more than 90 degrees or 45 or whatever then the new then the setback increases we've we've looked at it and just felt that the whole all of those rules can be vastly simplified by just requiring a for me to sit back for a window from a boundary and so the on adjacent properties so we figure or our assessment as for a for me to sit back on one side and perhaps a for me to sit back on the other than these assured distance between these windows to ensure because your privacy so it's the straight is the simplest Justin find of dealing with it this again just simplifies it so that a normal person can understand it is that's great no problem poster to each other no you can't open you internal isn't a neighbor well there's a good probably need like strangers all the properties in elie street we do it in okay so it's a new townhouses that get built right up against each other for still ready they would still don't still need to be before need a setback for a living there that that is for a living area so we're talking about a bedroom or a lounge or your kitchen okay so I'm not going in terms of window setbacks yes but there are other there are still other rules that rely relay to yep they were all work exactly the same way oh can we get to their resolutions now it's no are you finished okay I'm not sure where we stay there's one more there's one more subdivision sub-divisional in the woods subdivision 30 seconds hello I'll be quick write another one page 124 at top so the minister's comment was that there are no there's no policy direction in a subdivision chapter that is specific to recovery or rebuild so that was there is some in the strategic directions Chapin and some generic policy stuff in the subdivision check that would do the job but I've seen can you please put in some recovery Henryville specific policy so I've suggested some wording there in the third column fourth column to address that does this change very much not really no but it satisfies the minister it makes no difference to there's no negative consequence at doing that okay and you're having a particular regard to the minister's comments yes that's right what we're doing it's okay the resolutions now enter I just want to come back to the notification issue on page 197 yeah which we discussed and there was some debate at that time around removing no notification requirements and thereby removing one aspect of people to have some influence over what happens in their neighborhoods I'd like to propose that we don't remove the notification requirements as shown on page 197 okay okay so have you got an amendment that relates to that andrew I'm not sure where it comes in the resolution we probably need to put something that's an amendment to resolutions as I express them well just just word it so we can vote on it okay as outlined on page 197 198 and 199 and one it's quite a lot because that right quite far down for both commercial and industrial the pages 1972 202 16 22 18 right you guys already had that debate Avenue about we just go ahead a discussion I mean please okay but you but you know which way you want to vote on it already without going revisiting that up other yes yes but can we paint your lips done so shall we go through some of these and I assume 6.1 6.2 well would you yet which of these do we need to vote on just 6.3 and their other one on the notifications separately and then I'll just put the whole recommendations set fair 2018 for temporary activities okay so what number is that it's coming under 6.3 6.3 okay as is that what you want to excluding appendix even temporary earthquake repair activities you want to amend that don't you to 2018 as we scroll up because we're actually still putting some of the men so they're going all da take two minutes to get the mail for me to you want and then we'll both I wanted to raise one is the financial costs in the order and council with this collar significant financial burden placed on council we're paying for absolutely everything as far as I can tell but we're not going to be able to influence that and certainly we're not going to be I'd like to know how much we've got budget says and what the expected costs all right you can ask that what's like from don't over the time so it's Mike yeah and in the second thing is why don't people I really like the idea that we would actually do our own statement of expectation and it because I feel really uncomfortable the one that's in the order in council we've never approved that green but you know it's an legislation but I don't_''_1025.98 I don't know what stage we actually set clear what our expectations answered version angle statement at the front we here we're happy we've already agreed to the order in council well we gave our approval through to the review panel through the miRs later so we can't you can't change that we can't put in our own statement of expectations we do have our strategic direction chapter and the introduction chapter if we can't do it Jonnie I can't do it but I think there needs people who are making submissions actually know well as we had a meeting where we actually wrote what our vision was for the district plan it's em we changed it quite some time ago and then clearly there's a different one from the minister's but they won't surprise you so I I don't know where we where we need to change any of that what I would like to do is vote on these before people leave because we're about to lose a quorum while you go and say goodbye to mrs. Tanner what well yeah I do too yeah I think they're hanging I think thats hanging in so that we can vote on it we do just need to get this right so we have got several oh I appreciate it sorry that's right that's right well what what's your general feeling about the minister's comments we haven't really had much discussion in terms of the overall perspective in terms of did you see it as a kind of critical reply or was it that's another scale and also comment up there was nothing in there that surprised me and I think certainly it has added value some of their chapters with respect to clarity and ease of reading and I definitely think it has assisted the the chapters the matters that we have recommended to you not to make any changes on I think there is very clear and good reasoning about that and on the basis of good resource management argument I do wonder sometimes whether some of the paragraphs or recommendations were rushing through a lens of the Syria the Canterbury recovery eight can't resurrect Recovery Act rather than an hour in lienz but we have responded to those as we've talked with you today and I think the officers have been very open minded about what they can and can't change and on that basis I would have to say I'm very pleased with what's come through to you we have spent a lot of time having particular regard to the OIC so so no surprises and we have taken the opportunity where we can to on our response they'll be comfortable with that beg your pardon well that so in terms of the minister more in terms of having due regard to their comments will they be comfortable with our responses do it I can I can't respond to what they will think and they of course have every right to put submissions in when the plan is notified and I'm no doubt they will take have regard to the responses and the reasons why we have decided not to make changes and they will need to have their own legal advice as to our reasons whether they accept them or not further submission and then it will be up to the Hearing Panel an independent hearing panel to weigh those arguments no possesses please what was the reference to climatic effects are to include it beckon to one of the assessment criteria I think it was for industrial areas but okay are we good now got copyright on it didn't want to those succeed the other that we're just trying to work out the CH RM and the ATM that terminology has been there now for some months and it comes through the land use recovery plan yeah you know I just thought one succeeded the other one point or there was some change we had some other no scripture interiors I miss things and we will need to come back to you on what submissions were putting into our own plan part of the recommendation is to approve those are tables the one that the government of currently consulting on having served in the situation during that the submissions committee had the had the delegated authority to authorize their submission when we met I think it was two days ago so late last week and it was going to be subject to what happened today is that was that was going to be around the the height limits discussion that we've just had there was there are some rules in the central city living zones that around around Heights and as you know we had that we had the discussion where where officers received feedback that we that you weren't happy about the standardization of the we'd previously recommended with the resolution around heights today we just we going to tweak it to to ask for the heights that you've been seeking but with that but in relation to the 22 degree angle on roof patch just try and simplify there's a lot six point three point one needs to go up into 6.26 my two girls will about these minor changes sex porter sister who's a dissertation shizzle it's been on the dry freakum entitle the fugitive or not you'll be in touch 15 this month-long attachment under 6.2 these are wrong reference wrong attachment reference it should be referred to attachment five that's correct no there is a recommendation see 6.4 6.4 approved in minor errors to remain stage one chapters before notification it's gets to my knowledge E&O I see and the ordering cancer yes it's touching on your life is the draft axle that's remember it to be amended yes just six point two point seven should just so remove the inclusion of the non modification clauses yes yes it just a we need about community board should be just removes them on location forces okay can you just make that remove the non notification closes please yes was I thought we were doing it a different way we weren't changing the date we were actually setting up a separate process to look at the temporary ones that you could add in there according to attachment for if you wanted that's the table that's in there just then madam chair the B&D in that second to last line they all just need to get the right number reference and there for you there isn't a beginner d yeah yeah thank you you yes
And can I just make a Christian please is it just the last sentence about the Orion what you don't do you want some legal advice on that first that in terms of the designations the council is required to notify the designations where it has C received a notice from the requiring authorities seeking that its designation be rolled over either with or without modification the council doesn't have any choice in that it has to do it what the council does have as an ability to submit through the hearings process if it wants to would you like to put cheek can I quickly check it think would be really good tonight I'm getting a move I back around the financial loss yeah um the community would start if it's not recorded in here anyway so and then I think we need to get a memo back around the time frame from here and the process for appointment of commissioners terms of reference so I mean I can do that informally but you know yes is just like that backward motion to the manner you and I'm just asking our lawyers to check that for you and I'd like to thank you for your patience today it has been a lot of work to do in one day but it's critical for us to get these decisions today because in the next few days before the 27th will be frantically making all these strangers met getting them up online and getting ourselves ready for the 27th so thank you very much
How many more if we got to go one more after mark and that's got on the urban design and assessment criteria right hands hello again I have three matters to discuss first is non notification clauses the second is matters of discretion for urban design and the third is some amendments to the bill form standards for the commercial and industrial chapters I'll start with the non notification clauses and this this comes out of recommitted recommendation 6 which is on the state other than 30 the recommendation amongst other things seeks to reduce consenting and notification requirements and staffs recommendation staff responses at the bottom of page 131 and on the top of 132 I want to read it read out welfare but just to provide some context to these proposed amendments action 45 and the law requires that as a matter of urgency council reduces consenting and notification requirements and in the statement of expectations there's a one of the statements is that we reduce significantly the requirement for notification and written approval so and when we need to consider a change from what of non notification clauses under section 77 d of the results management h we've got the ability to include these clauses which effectively means for a non compliance with a rule that originally approvals are not required and the application is not to be limited or publicly notified the basis for these causes is where there's not considered to the affected persons and in the context of recovery it's finding that balance between still requiring resource consent for these developments to be assessed in terms of their effects and council achieving a improved outcome versus ensuring that we we enable development and it's not impeded with the recovery so we need to find a way to make the process smoother reduced consenting costs we're possible and this clause of the not require notification or written approvals as one means of achieving that so in in the appendix page 197 to 200 there's a number of rules that are referenced where we propose a clause similar to what I described or a variation of and the same for the industrial chapter from pages to 162 really over to you at this point on these clauses right you fell can you just tell me how this user roles how they will fit alongside the recent area may omit amendments which you know limit notification anyway well that's my understanding towards heaven just talking to Sarah the consistent with those RMA amendments the amendments were the section of the API readout allows us to include these clauses which and that amendment was made in 2009 I guess it just seems that there's been m and spraying asking weather's been a spate of lava um new facilities say going in which aren't notified in which has really raised the ire of a lot of residents there too and this just seems to add to that problem yeah as I explained this is going a step further than what the current city plan has in the way of these clauses but the existing city plant does have similar clauses at prison so some matters some rules we don't propose this clause to be applied and the obvious examples are setbacks from residential boundaries recession and building height so if there was a proposal that didn't comply with one of those rules then clearly there's going to be some impact on that residential neighbor of building an approaching into that set back from the residential boundary some other matters we've already got it causes included in the draft that went to the ministers not requiring notification such as the urban design trigger so an assessment of not just how the Dalton looks about how it fits into its context that won't require written approvals or notification and its really an assessment by council to ensure that a better outcomes achieved in the way of design another example where the current draft doesn't have a notification notification so he has an on notification clause is minimum minimum floor to ceiling heights so in a retail in a shop at ground floor level we require the height from floor to ceiling to the 3.5 meters and this clearly not going to be an impact on another person so that's where the clause applies what we're doing is a point to going off to the ministers and so when obvious one is the setback from road boundaries the setback from a road boundary is very much about retaining a level of visual amenity of the site as viewed from the road and there's people that may say there's an impact on people across the road from that site but the road provides that separation in terms of effects of shading or effects of bulb and so to some extent it's our position that that would be such a rule that wouldn't require notification or written approval and like I think most people haven't got a problem or something with those examples but like currently we are for example you have a street which which is DD industry and and a new activity like for example got a large childcare center goes into that small street and you know up to 50 cars come in and then coming you know there's four trips that the residents now it's quite a big impact on people's lives and so the current rules allow us that unknown seems to me that we're just adding to a geesee complications for residents lives through taking a taking away the notification even further to address that concern and these non notification clauses apply to built form standards so the standards concerned with the sighting and bulb and scale of the building for the activities that are specified as discretionary or non-complying we don't have such a clause so there is still that opening to notify or to seek written approvals for instance of our residential developments in a dustrial zone that's a discretionary activity and the proposed chapter and restore the opportunity to consider the effects on on those affected by that proposal and to notify them of that if the if they're identified as affected persons oh that decision about notification at the current time is and going forward under the proposed plan and still under a section of the resource management out around determining who is adversely affected Annie I don't support removing the notification requirements the the government really changed the RMA to reduce the need for people to be notified and layer or removing another layer of public participation I think it really goes to the core of people actually being involved in their communities and in their neighborhoods and you know I think you have to think about is that in the extreme case that any of these rules would trigger a non compliance that actually should be scary enough in itself you know if it's that extreme then you're probably talking about a pretty ugly building it probably talking about a pretty severe impact it's not something that's just going to be minor it is something that's going to be pretty major so I would have thought we shouldn't we should be resisting this change I don't support this I think actually we should be standing up for our citizens who want to be involved in planning and again without any you know assessment of how many times we've had non-compliance of these issues and it has been notified anyway because that's the other point a lot of non-compliance is at the moment in our current city plan are still mean that this Sara Lee isn't known as normal as not non-mo fight so I don't know if staff can give a view but research I've done previously shows that most non-complying consents go through not notified anyway so I can't see why we've removed this extra layer protection for our community are there any other questions so there wasn't really a question that was a statement but are there any questions oh no it's going to be the reasoning my my comment would be that there's not any non-compliant tivities where we propose this clause it's generally speaking with restricted discretionary activities where it doesn't come where there's non-compliance with a specific built form standard is that relevant to the of a relevant as this relevant to this cause I'm sorry but I'm just not going to hear I think we've got where to get through and we've got limited time I think it's probably two things meta mere one is that in the absence of a rule saying things will not be an assessment about the notification so what this does is it takes away that step that's required and most of the time they'll go through that process and say no ones affected don't need to notify what these rules do is take that step out so in terms of reducing resource consent costs and all of those matters that's good what it also does is where you don't put the non notification rule in makes it very clear that this particular matter is something you really are going to think about notification so I think it does two things makes it very clear where you looking to notify so for those reasons the rules are quite helpful okay all right sorry just a moving on to the second point the urban design matters of discretion so earlier on I spoke about the urban design fresh shelves and when a consent is triggered to assess urban design hey it's okay oh sorry its recommendation six but the response to that is on the bottom page 157 now just quoting a line from the minister's a lot a long list of assessment made a summit overly broad and subjective making them difficult to interpret there's an opportunity to streamline and remove overlap between provisions so what what is proposed which is set out on pages 204 215 is not a material change to the matters of discretion but rather consolidation and subside 204 to 215 yeah sorry I'll stop and let you find it now just by way of example of the table and the lower part of page 20 p what in the left-hand column has the existing text from the chapter that went to the minister the right-hand column has what proposed to be amended and as I said the substance of what's in the current version that went to the minister isn't is not changing it's really simplifying and consolidating the words to make it clearer what the intent is and so I've had we've had input from the urban design team to ensure that what is yep the outcome that we're seeking and what needs to be addressed in the application for his that necessarily understood so it's not a material change and so I won't take you through page by page but it's really a attempt to simplify those provisions and that's the staff recommendation to to really put forward a simplified version as opposed to changing it significantly so the intent remains the same that's just stay the most streamlined version better to the century what was asked for just turning my mind to the moods of the water and counsel has done that for a while but very good and just finally sir taking out the accentuating corner sides which I thought was quite an important principle what why would you do that just with reference to page 206 just remember a different way midway down the existing text reads accentuating corner sites through and then there's three points just looking at the right-hand column point if in that column aren't adding corner sites to each Street frontage providing a high level of glazing architectural detailing an opportunity for additional building height it's really just simplifying and reducing the text but has to any other meaning in any of these Android one that does seem to be missing there and it's just two words in so this is on page 207 d5 you've got climatic conditions in there presumably that would refer to the way that a building could cast shade across the street and that sort of thing and that lime attic conditions is missing from the amended version on page 206 and we've referred to in terms of the context of lens it's in the context of landscaping and just looking at page 206 in the right-hand column the last point Corsi refers to across the site to provide shade shelter and amenity and to mitigate fix so including noise and pollution but that's not exclusive so I'm touch touches on shade there but is still wrapped up in that clause here talks about providing shade rather than preventing shade whereas I would have thought climatic is recovered preventing shade as well wait look in there yep beckenham that would be good thank you and just finally just a some amendments to the built I'll turn you to page 130 so the provisions would sort to simplify relate to the recession planing requirement so at the moments in the characters that he plan if you're wanting to work out what angle you're building has to be within there's a complex series of diagrams which have to be and then used to determine a calculation of how many degrees your angles we're simplifying that rule and it's going to the proposed rule which I won't take you to essentially reflects what's in the banks peninsula operative plan which is to apply a consistent angle of 45 degrees except for the southern boundary where it's 35 degrees and there's been a benefits of that which our urban design team modeled around the developable area and also achieving greatest cemetery and built form it also achieved what the purpose of the rule was was just to avoid shading on adjoining properties of commercial or industrial development so that's just a brief brief explanation of that if I can take you to a page 201 one of has been the lack of provision for waste storage areas on sites an example that's been given as lone star and the central city where waste is left on the footpath and should be contained on site until collection and so we're introducing a rule that requires areas of waste storage and the previous version had a formula which is shown in the left hand column on page 201 and it required some multiplication and addition what we're proposing in the right-hand column is to sit out what the actual area is that you need depending on the size of your unit but just one point to note on the lower part of 201 we've got the floor area that the waist so you have to work out what the floor of your food and beverage out letters and then area required for waste storage in the left-hand column for floor area there should be arranged so it should be 0 to 100 101 to 250 2 512 500 so will I mean that to just be consistent with what's above that on page 201 say we're talking about the CBD area what type of waste wood big-league let's talk about your let's talk about ways does it put out in begs the in suburban locations with us would apply to there's different methods but I understand this bins for getting away guess I'm coming from the recycling angle and I don't think we have for recycling in the CBD but we will need to get there very soon so I think that's going to require a probably a bigger area than this to accommodate these figures proposed to suburban locations and the second phase we look at the central city but the figures have been based on advice from the collectors who have given them and an assessment of existing operational requirements in terms of waste and so this is very much reflecting on the ground what what is needed to support their currently recycling three three types of recycling or I can't tell your fans but I can come back to your nest I think it's bit sort of future proofing things a wee premises don't fully recycle it I don't separate leave food out and I think it needs to be addressed but if we can just do it yeah we I can speak with the operations side but this is very much about getting an area and place them on the site so there weren't you exercised when as opposed to help manage so I can manage my side of can be dealt with just as long as it's a big enough period it's like and see ya and that draws to a close the points I want to roaster thank you oh good clean Tod was just one back on page 130 in regard to recommendation 62 the intention to reduce prescriptive pneus under Roman numeral one proposed that rule seeking a range of housing sizes to provide choice removed and it this can be addressed later any kind of any material difference and they change vm sorry most of me to not bring this to your attention the the rule in a commercial zone where there's residential development above shop for instance the rule the whole development in one bedroom units there's been some discussion with the reason called check check the team about achieving that mix and the the mix of unit sizes will reflect what the demand is in those locations and arguably in a commune Center where this is proposed there's likely to be a great developments that are only one or two bedrooms and that that addresses the need arises in those locations as opposed to raising into areas where there may be a greater need for a mix so it's really not restricting development to say if you're proposing a development of a one-bedroom units you have to have at least two or three three business units we're not we're not saying that now what we're proposing is development can go in with just one bedroom units and if that meets demand then Soviet okay can I just be clear um what we've done in regards to the notification we've removed a whole bunch of rules in the residential area we're also doing in the commercial area so I for example we're basically making it even harder for people to have been notified of this changes we're non-compliances that their residential chapter deals with those residential subdivisions like on page 77 we've got compliance with odep very amazed compliant with adp to Belfast and north cools room and there's a whole bunch of other other ones are these basically making it like thinking of mobile subdivision and people really upset they weren't notified under existing rules is this making it even harder for us to notify local people around changes 20 DPS these are these provisions here would not require written approval or require a public notification or limited notification and instances where an OTP is complied with as well as if there's a measure on a development plan not compiled with so in those specific locations belfast's you've got a railway line down one side separating it from a joining rural zone you've got a retail park zone to the north you've got the state highway to the west and you've got reserved to the south I't know how much you know of the mobile subdivision but I certainly don't want to have it go through that ever again in my lifetime and I'm sure many of it I was dying and one of the main concerns that people had was the lack of notification so when it comes to vote and I just really have my vote strongly recorded against these changes and I just urge you all to really think about what you're doing here because we know how messy it can get when it goes wrong yeah I will ask Scott he's the next speaker to talk about notification any changes or no changes with respect to residential when when he's up okay all right hey Kiki top are you the lucky laughs no there is one more Andrew but
Vicky hasn't turned up yet so a better crack on no you might be cheering the meeting I wouldn't laugh afternoon I'm back again this time talking mainly about 10 free earth quake recovery activities which is which there is policy under these treaty directions chapter but the provisions that are now being proposed then responds to the minister's comments to go in the general rules remember the parameter now economics chapter success which will be a new chapter just to give you to lead you into it I'm basically dealing with the recommendations on page 154 and 155 recommendations 14 and 15 which raised the need to make provision in this review and in phase 1 of this review for temporary earthquake recovery activities particularly for business activities and particularly in residential areas now the intention originally was to deal with temporary recovery activities part of phase 2 but we're now recommending that we aired at least some provisions at the stage in phase 1 it might just be helpful to give you some history behind this because just to understand we were 2011 which allowed the council by way of public notice to allow certain temp reactivities s permitted activities or through site-specific approvals but all outside the normal resource management x-pro cease so no submission process no hearing process and those activities are allowed until 2016 what if you've had a chance to have a look at the proposals in the appendices those proposals are similar but not the same as the proposals that the council publicly notified in 2011 and they include provision for activity such as business activities storage facilities and temporary housing what was a mean what was permitted in let 2011 public notice was amended by a later public notice notably removing the provision for temporary business and service activities and community facilities at the moment under the order and council and public notice process there is no provision for temporary quite recovery activities of those that nature there was another set of temporary provisions added into the existing operative district plan for workers temporary accommodation they last until 2020 too but we're not proposing to deal with those at the stage the main reason under the water and council is that those provisions expire in 2016 and if a decision is released on phase two matters until end of 2015 2016 early 2016 those business and other activities are going to have very little time to plan for the future and so we we agree that there is a need there it's also clear that there is an ongoing need from the number of activities that are continuing to be applied or under those order on council processes there was something like a hundred business and community facility type activities applied for in the last 12 months and most of those were approved after going through that site specific approval process so there is certainly an ongoing demand as mentioned earlier the proposed poses we've got for the district plan review have similar provisions to those in 2011 and the public notice in 2011 but they do include some provisions now or business in community facilities subject to standards it is proposed that the period be extended to 2019 but the provisions continue one of the changes that was made earlier which so that's a bit of a summary of what is proposed you'll be whether there's quite a bit more in the appendix which is texting 229 any questions yeah so we're adding a whole new chapter we've had out of furniture we've had about had it for about three days the community haven't_''_362.22 been consulted I know some of us are getting increasing concerns from people in the community about some of these temporary consents that are being applied for what what I still struggle to understand given what we've heard previously that we can't add things in now we can add such a significant thing into this plan as part of this project and because the ministers have asked us we can only look at making changes that the ministers have highlighted in their comments and recommendations it is your decision as to having having particular regard to the OIC it is still your decision whether or not you think it should be included at this stage I person feel that we actually need to really give some consideration to our community and we need to weigh that up and looking at what rules were putting in place and what activities were allowing so I'm keen to look at it I preciate is timing issues coming up but actually I feel pretty uncomfortable doing this until about three days notice and I take it a slightly different view in the sense that if we don't put on a temporary use chapter that acknowledges what's been happening in our city then it would be perfectly within the power of the of the of the hearings panel to to consider chapter and I think that the advice that we've received on the type of chapter that should go on as one that I'm comfortable with but you know if councillors are not comfortable with the direction of this chapter then then we'll just take it out so it's over to you cool take county's point and it probably more applies to vacant land being used for temporary storage of gravel do epson and machinery activity really close to issue residential unison this has happened cause some discomfort so and there are other uses like you know Lamar operations with a fixing Lall Moses up like that writing the residential area so there are some applications of the temporary license to to carry out business activity that those cause some discomfort where is some other activities not so much but so I think we put may need to clarify little bit to give a bit of comfort to the residence I think which page is the concern I kept cell just responded we still on page 154 I did this like that this is 109 they've got all of the is it right this what is the list of all of it is professions that provisions yes we're aware of similar system seems and one of the changes we have made is that instead of the provision that allow for both storage and depots is that we've restricted it to storage facilities because one of the concerns that we were aware of and between a number particularly residential areas was that Depot's were being used for a variety of things more provisions here simply limited to storage facilities perhaps if you turn to page 243 as a specific provision and you'll noticed Peter said there it is storage facilities it's only too late for the 2019 assistant enedina Sounion commercial and industrial zones so it does exclude those residential zones specifically for those reasons and what which ones which one's of these go beyond April 2016 the proposal is for all of these provisions to be available until 2019 2019 so why wife explain to me again why for three years extra I don't think there's any black and white answer to their question I think the reality is that we know that 2016 isn't really that far away we know that the rebuild has not been as fast as everybody anticipated and we also know that people being people who were forced to move out of their premises because of the earthquakes are still having to find alternative accommodation because where they've moved to is no longer available because that's been repaired or whatever reason so we're still getting applications of permanent own also I think you worship that discussion we had with counselors when we were looking at this policy was very clear from you that you didn't want the temporary to become the permit and I think particularly the deputy meal was very clear on that yeah and hints I think we've got 2019 as signaling me this is not a permanent gives us enough time to review if things need an extension then we've got time to do a plan change before 2019 if some of these activities need an extended period so there was all those reasonings behind that mentira phone might also add is that of course when this goes out for submissions and further submissions are still being tested by the public and and was that the Penner will still need can to consider these submissions whether we wait for this stage or the second stage it's unlikely that we would make any particular suggested amendments to these rules we have gone through them thoroughly so it's whether or not you actually want to put it out for testing now section 32 analysis no just from a really basic RM a kind of good governance I thought we had to do section 32 s to justify putting fit not in relation to minister's comments we don't need to so because I go back to the commercial in the court I'm happy two modes that we put urban design in there I think we need it I think there's a real gap but I was kind of under the impression that that wasn't possible even though there was something the minister had asked for because we hadn't consultant with people and people didn't have any idea so I'm just I'm struggling to align kind of the earlier response versus this response and I guess it does seem rather yeah it does I don't know it just doesn't seem good governance do not have any robust analysis of what the actual issue is and what the best way of solving it is the difference between those two examples that you've just given us is that in the case where you center as the city suggesting changes the Intuit's plan host it going to the minister's which we can't do under the OIC the OIC at this point in time only allows us to make changes to the proposals on the basis of the minister's comments and it also allows us to do those changes without a section 32 now while peter hasn't done a section 32 we do have a lot of information regards complaints and we're all of these various activities temper activities are located and and what issues they're causing and all the rest of it and we also have a little handle on how fast the rebuilders going in the city centre and for those reasons we're bringing it to you we can write over section 32 but we don't have to do that before notification it's not necessary under the OAC Brigitte can I ask you if there's an if there's a third way which is is it possible for us to notify this particular chapter or part of a chapter supplementary to this next year could we in fact like send this out for public notification do a section 32 bring it back here confirm it send it off to the we can do that madam ji yes we can do that I'm just hoping we don't have to do that on too many things because it's becoming very complicated with officers working it variously oh no I understand this so I'm trying to I'm trying to find a solution which means that we're not here or love to lose debating these matters I mean if people if people want to people people were quite happy to to send it through we'll send it through if people are not happy about sending it through we'll take it out and I've just suggested a third way which is of course that would mean that we'd have to come back to you on that prenup notification and go through those types of meetings that we've had previously with you yeah for half a chapter where next time I meanit's just it'll take I think that would be really good I mean there are some issues if you think about the demand for residential versus the what we heard today we've got spare capacity and commercial industrial sectors so actually I think having an analysis of what these temporary rules are actually doing at the moment this is where we might want to shape them going forward is really important I'm I you know it is an important issue and I think addressing it sooner rather than later it makes a lot of sense but I do think we need to understand what the trade-offs are in terms of reducing housing this is putting TV activities in two different types of zones I don't have a great long about the debate about it so I mean can I just have a general sense with where people are out on us can I have some other views I mean I'm happy with that I question over the housing it's just I'm keen to know that the drivers behind this continual activity like one on one level it's different dynamic with tipperary activities in the residential red zone yeah just I'm really comfortable with the recommendation to send this off to the to the hearings panel the suggestion that from officers is that is likely to be an ongoing need to continue to provide for temporary recovery activities as have been promoted either under order and council or as we're inserted into the operative district plan that's workers temporary accommodation provisions the order and council will spur on April 2016 the question is do we want to put up a recommendation along the lines of the minister's request that's what it comes down to Andrew yeah I'm comfortable to send it through and the public will have the opportunity to comment once it's notified clearly there's a need which we can see in certain areas in which you've identified as well I think the simplest is just to send it through with this transition and go through the normal process oh yeah it's just one night that a dozen a CMP the rebuild so Terry activity that doesn if we could add to that old it doesn't impede these you have some commercial activities like retail and temporary sighs library sir but restart as that will be moved your over summer ECM there's a permanent permanent residential locations trading and that could you know complete some reboot that's right but they will expire on series of April 2019 yeah well I'm so when we get to the endpoint can we have a separate resolution because obviously it's not unit unanimous but I've ever feeling that they'll be sufficient support for it to go through sorry so I'm not clear currently there is a resolution and there that would allow this to go through as part of the notification your 27th us I just want to make sure that it can be voted for separately because some counselors will want to vote against to understand fashion so next item and
Been good if we'd had one at 25 22 so far away thank you madam chair I'll just introduce Jenna's carta and Ian Wright we'll be talking about the natural hazards chapter and the more significant changes that officers are proposing in response to minister's comments might have been some recommendations that we've got our response to recommendation 22 and that's the additional information should be included in the draft proposals and that's some page 171 I'll do documents in front of you and this this was the request that went and from us we requested the minister to direct us and certain measures in relation to the port hills mess movement and in love and in doing so they've also raised some other points as well it's correct I'm just just very briefly around the cliff hazard management area one which we talked about a few weeks ago the mass movement areas Genesis proposing to introduce to advise notes a definition in the policy yep I think if we start with the mass movement in front of ones that were attached to your documents and there's just some up further clarifications from the gns that we've incorporated into those mass movement reports but these maps also include the changes to the cliff collapse inhibited activity status and the the legends at the back of the maps that you can provider so if there's any questions about the mass movement or the prohibited activity status for the heads of militant area one and got in right with me to help you believe those questions that you might have so what colors are they end up cleaning map numbers the mass movement areas the mass movement one year is our core of vertical no slanting stripes and bright blue Dennis we've got met 48 up on the screen he wanted to use service Belknap up the earth in the center middle there's the mass movement areas the one in front of you actually has just recently changed this morning there's a bright blue mass movement area on the map you got up there but we just received information through genus which altered that right in the middle of the map that you've got there so this the stripes going diagonally if they're green its mass movement to if they're bright through aqua its mass movement one and the purple stripes is nice movement three and in terms of cliff claps and the black areas our clip clips at the stripes its cliff clips cliff management 0 1 is the cliff caps area too is stripes and the prohibited activity area has got lines dotting across in black pointer yep okay so on this one here if the ones just being changed to mass movement too yep and over here this is mass movement one its a bright bright aqua blue and can we scroll that map down a bunch towards the bottom of Sumner and in here is it that's another mask removal interior here and next to it adjacent to it is cliff claps hazard management area too it's the striped black pieces but then in the middle of that is the clasp and cliff as of major year one which is your prohibited activity stencils right as as prohibited and the other part is non-complying in that what I'm showing you up there is actually surrounded by cliffs claps heads management area one is surrounded by cliff claps head has amazement you enter so it's prohibited in the middle and the most but the source area and above it and the run-out area below it is cliff claps hazard management area to which is non-compliant on rather than I hope yet I know there's a lot of detail that you're trying to show um I can't help but look at these maps and think gosh it's just so confusing in terms of the public being able to understand you know you know you've got the key there but there is a second series of maps that only shows natural hazards as well which will bring out because of you're quite right it's very confusing what you've got what I made burns on it but that's why we have a series of maps yeah is it kind of a map that shows where prohibited activity is someone was looking at their property though because it's on a pen the be able to zoom right into their property and see the various layers and it will show which and crisp hazard management areas their properties with them so that's the toilet been developed you type your dress on and it will come up with the notations are on this site so if you've got liquefaction assistant near a while it will come up and then you can click on that and zoom into it so I called on Jim it's very poor on we'll show you how how that's done so that people can find with you that's not restful street week would be a good one for their just you want to run through what you can see there Ellen yes because I can't see them from you so this is showing the property search and what you'll see as you just type in an address that you're interested in and they're not showing here down the right-hand side is the key and Lloyds can and off as you want it so what's being shown here in the middle of the screen is nest movement theory one and two and from there you'll be able to find your prohibited and non-complying activity status from there and we're sending letters to the prohibitive we are going so that they are particularly aware of the notification that's going we're sending them letters first for information so they should go out today and then we are sending them notification leaders specifically as well yep great what you'll find the counselor Athena's you see if your example you find yourself you are in a mass movement area one let's click on here that tells you a little bit about it and it tells you to go to this rule here and there is the e plan rule which tells you exactly what your activity statuses slope instability discretionary 12 to click on the top one click on the top way you've got in okay and so you click the Chevron look even I can use it I think that's just think the other the other kind of question I have was um in terms of the land mass movements of litters are going up today and we still haven't had the peer reviews back from gnas the cliff types are going out today not a less movement is it's only the result of what we spoke about about two weeks ago where we change some of the non-complying areas to prohibited only those are information I thought we just hit on the met today that some of your ears are a mass movement had changed so there's two changes that we asked the minister to direct us to change and one set of changes was to the mass movement because we had updated information from here that's coming that we were we all agree on that but then there was the other issue on the future of July where we looked at those four areas where which dividing up the cliff heads of many people's into two areas and we've divided them up into cliff hazard management or one which was prohibited and latest are going out today are only in relation to those four areas that we identified could be split into prohibited activity and the changes that we're making in terms of the publicly notify plan do they include the mess movement area yes so that would mean that the information that's available well they will miss movement areas and what went to the ministers and what we went out and discussed it's just that 3gs they've been further refined and they've done through the investigation behind the scenes so in a sense we're not sending them an information later before notification they will get letters specifically with respect to their properties in mass movement yes at the same time as all the other leaders from just I think we're a little bit across purposes so basically now all the assessment that we need to do over the mess movement areas is complete because we couldn't put out a plane with the most movement areas if it wasn't sorry that's all been complete so today's a really good day now to the people as well that those results this information is now available and it does need to be a discreet communication to those people saying we're finished doing our assessment here's what the results have shown in it's going in the district right and I want to explain something about the process of those mass movement reports and obviously as of today we've received seven of the eight final reports the last one for clifton terrace it's sold on the peer review we've been assured by gns that we will get it latest wednesday next week but basically we have the map I so nothing's changed we've got the latest map information we just need to get the final report for one of the mass movement areas otherwise if after that we are complete so weird that's a fact the maps are correct on yeah the this the only significant change is that the clifton terrace mass movement was originally part of it was class one it's now been degraded to downgraded to a class two that's that so they've run at the top of their that's that one's actually incorrect the one in front of you that you were given today is the correct notation because that particular mess isn't you okay I'm just one point there I would like to make the point that we do recognize the maps are very busy and and that factually is the matter you know that is what's happening on the ground with respect to the geology so we are trying to see how we can further clarify those areas on the mems along with the mets and there's also a table that's going into the plan and that's the x tactility status for the cliff cups hazard management year one and cliff claps hazard management area to so in your documents and your appendix separately prefers there is an activity speakers that you've already seen in the previous discussion that you have oh okay so I'm talking about the alongside the cliffs claps areas there's also an activity status table that's been altered I'll just pieces at the end of the maps on page 228 and that should be stable that you've already seen because the minister's just reflected it all back to Isis a despertar dunno some just took it off it's what we in the information that we provided to the minister there's also a number of other corrections to the slope instability management areas which the Minister has said include data to and so we have also included those m and you can see those on page 172 after the recommendations turn put the mouse movement areas and the cliff hazard management areas there's also some further changes that have been endorsed and that the first one is can you hear me yeah so under see we've got an alteration to the definition of Hazard Mitigation works yeah and that's basically we left off the possibility that some geotechnical investigations we've had to be done on-site for any hazard mitigation where it's to be done so with included there in the definition and we've also clarified that retaining walls that are not definition so that they don't get caught up with the moon restrictive rules and those sorts of retaining walls we're talking about is where someone does a retaining wall for say a flat layer of lawn and we didn't want those very minor retaining walls to be caught up with us and I think that was brought up earlier on yep okay and in the other definitions are quite minor in relation to just making sure that has minification works include the earthworks so that's under F or under eat under e we're barely saying include the earth works as well because we don't want to caught up with resource consents when they don't need to be F is adding in a mitigation measure and take into account planting and I think that was one of the counselors suggested that themselves a number of months ago and and then the most important one at the end here is G for the policy five point five point five a and B where by using the word remainder of the portholes we inadvertently excluded rock about cliff claps and mass movement and avoidance policies and that be controlling Hazard Mitigation works for a rock troll and other areas of the port health recognizing that you can pick off the rocks and rock roll and do a lot more mitigation than some of the other areas that was just clarifying those policies and make sure that we hadn't been under Italy missed out rockfall nope okay so they're just very basic one thing that's that's the main areas that we have it included unique vine operations father's advice and nuts as well so I'm not involved in any particular recommendation but um there is some it's paragraph 19 in the minister's comments sorry limits on pay under any indications paragraph 90 page 18 for sure it's not page 24 let's do it no that one's about negative activity station bear with me a minute close advice notes on page 170 there was a general comment that some of our policies didn't have any rules and some of our some of the work was destined to link through that some of the policies will have rules later and also the issue of earthworks will also be dealt with them face to when they're outside of the flood management areas at the moment in the natural hazards chapter we just deal with them earthworks and the floor level and full management areas but in theater we will be looking at the issue of earthworks generally in the city it was just to advise nuts the waterfowl management areas and imprisoning the x-mas the the names being changed to floor level and full management is because the rules relating to those areas are about filling which is air for its and about the floor levels what what we used to know if you're nice of read French to grasp and there at all and the actual management area there's no reference to flood why as I understand it though there was lots of confusion about all the various flood maps that were circulating around the city there was the work of the flood task force and there was other maps showing flood vulnerability flood-prone more ref refer to the rules that applied rather than the actual hazard okay yeah when you read the minister's comments um I thought really clearly with a try no just flooding as soon as possible because it's pretty urgent that seems to suggest that we don't have rules and we going to do this later sorry I can't you there um I thought we were going to address flooding as part of us that if in my areas yeah but what they are saying is we don't seem to have rules there's a lot of questioning about the flood hazard policies knowing methods associated with them they'll be an effective etc etc I just I just think we need to be reassured what you've done around the flooding given the comments of ministers made which ministers have made which seemed I think what's or means that you're reading from our own relation to within the central city recovery plan area there is none of that that's coming through in stage two but we are doing all of that 89 90 yes that's some yeah maybe I that's where I put the advice on it's only because we've got these policies general policies are talking about flood pointing areas which will be in phase 2 and we've got some other policies about high hazard areas which also be in basically so what I've recommended that we do is that we actually under those policies five point three point one five point three point two five point three point three and five point three point four witches and I'm reading from page 117 that we basically identifying the plan that those issues will be covered newtons and Phase two there are some policies general policies that are part of the whole integrated natural hazards management framework so we've put them all down but some of them the rules won't come until phase two and I think that's what the minister was alluding to in that comment so we're just basically clarifying that those rules will come and face to what like I'm a little bit I don't which which words from from the AMAs to heaven if you may that there is actually different words I can't understand it because the flood management area at the moment is about floor levels so to have an FMA actually referring to fill management levels will actually be incredibly confusing to a lot of people it's the name of the management areas the floor level and soul and it just reflects that those both filling and floor level rules in that management area so the flood management areas always dealt with filling and floor levels and the name has been changed to reflect that how did the reasoning behind that was too so that doesn't give the sense that all of those areas are likely to be flooded all the time they may be on occasion on or what's that come to in a one and two hundred flood but indeed if you have got the floor levels in the air and all the fill to raise your property the actual land surface that much then you won't be flooded so we wanted to choose and put fear into all of these thousands of people who are receiving the notification litres about these new rules so that they understood actually how it worked that didn't focus on the flooding element it's a precautionary rule yeah but you crack that it's not something that has been discussed in this forum you know those big maps that we had um so what's happened to those but with the flood management areas the increased flood management risk well they're all still in here they stole the painting that's right and we've got rules so if you want to build in those yeah we've still got rules it's all the same as what was reported to you earlier in the year all those rules relating to men are on floor levels fill levels oh oh so why why is the minister saying that there's no method or rules or anything to get up I think that's not that I understood what they were saying it is a very general comment but I understood what they were saying was haven't got rules I didn't understand them to be saying that there's no rules but rather that the hazard and high hazard area rules that people get paragraph 88 from the minister they acknowledge that there's no rules on the high hazard flooding but we do have a policy on high hazard flooding and that in the rules up to come later so they do it knowledge that in phase 2 those things will come there's also the ponding areas based foods they will come so because we wanted to put out a comprehensive object of a policy framework for natural hazards we've put those in now so that people can see that they're coming but there is actually no holes at the stage to what's likely to change between what we've got now and what we're proposing and in terms of the flooding there's very little change that we've got as a result of the minister's recommendation in terms of the phase 2 stuff like what would actually be different for someone getting it can seem phase two doesn't have any effect on consents not until the plane not until the proposals become operative but what and what Janice is saying is there are still some rules to be developed and they will come into stage two yeah I understand that I'm trying to understand what the impact of those rules will be is it going to be like there's a hundred houses in a certain area that you can't build on because they're just too risky or is it going to be you have to raise your house another you see examine all of those management rules are about mitigating so there's no rules at the moment and the plan let's say that the option is to retreat or or do anything else all the rules at month to the flood hazard is about raising floor levels or being careful that way we fill then that was what that hasn't changed and the minister as she doesn't make any recommendations about any of that back to us to comment so as it was when it went city okay so we go to include high hazard areas so at the moment we've only got and policies on high hazard areas we're going to develop some rules perhaps for those or a response to those areas there's also open space serious conservation areas the central city and a few other areas zones particularly rural where there's no rules at the moment in phase one we need to carry those big maps that showed the flooding areas flood areas into the rural zones into the Oakland space science but we've got no rules at the moment the rules we've got in phase 1 are residential commercial and industrial so it will capture all the urban residential properties but probably is outside that and they'll have to wait till phase 2 for the rules to be developed have we changed the the if a maze I'll call no me amas have we changed the location of any of them know that we have we expanded areas from the existing plan yes this I think we've talked about this in the past an expanded FMA and one of them was the change of ground levels the other was modeling outside of men reverse games and another one was updated information from lida which showed the changes and I think there's a reason why we've got extended areas and are we notifying people in those areas as well yeah we've got letters ready to go that will go to the alias forms they're not ready but they are being drafted at the moment for notification took to a lot of households yeah yeah I'd like to see those before pull their finalized and but we haven't made any changes to the area's post and minister's comments no but no I've just I've dismissed the name change I just I thought that I can understand why this but it is going to be challenging for a lot of people but anyway we'll give you so there any other question from us these issues I'm still trying to understand the central city the minister keeps saying that we should be doing stuff in leading the central city planning how do we wait is there anything else we can kind of do I mean I'm really keen if you think of that avin river yeah open space no rules are on flood management and it's and one of the most critically important areas going through Central City so if there's anything that we can put an intestine existing flood management area yeah for the operatives I am flood management area of rules for one or two hundred year been so they can you say to this operate he set continues to operate now yes so it's not affected by this we're just not expanding it it right and over stage two will then run pace that day to do when we replace the ccrp with our own rules yep so we've got a tin of date women to be a draft for that so we can consider that as part of the second stage because it just is really that's very personal January yeah genuine okay yeah that's what yeah well might be februari yeah well drawing time to consider it chiefly oh yeah for Christmas a lot of prison from you its history you can have it before Christmas and read it on your holidays no anyway so are there any other so I can move on Linnea yeah thank you thank you
Not really she's not dealing with all the natural hisses at the moment most of its in the second lot it's just where we've Sid noticed something yeah so if you look at recommendation 20 page 168 and 169 you will see that I have recommended that we don't is with a definition of of intolerable process but I do recognize in that paragraph that we defined by proxies intolerable risk in terms of the mapping we are our boundaries are based on the one in 100 I want one in 10,000 a ir so basically we don't use the word and the policies we don't define it in the policies but we actually define it in terms of our mapping so let's just I've exceeded that there in the paragraph it's reasonably complex because it comes from the gns reports but what I've really said is that in terms of the definitions if we had a definition here it might not be flexible enough for lots of different circumstances and what intolerable is as a judgment call on a used it for our mech eng it's not appropriate to use it as a definition because then it won't be able to be used in different circumstances that's the main know that I've encoded the other the other node is on the issue of existing new stripes page 183 and 184 and there's two paragraphs that I think it's probably if I've got time took me two rivers two paragraphs that relate to the 79 which faces a specified policy direction clarifying extent to which rebuilding will be managed in Hazzard prone areas is suggested Sorry Sorry Sorry so tell me our Jersey and lots of Ministers cummins your paragraphs in nine minutes sorry that's paragraph 79 other ministers comment so that's a technology so page beauty of your agenda sorry yeah I was just going to read out the actual comments to give a context to while we've discussed at this news rights in that response and prepare about 79 and the other paragraph that this recommendation with flex as paragraph 93 the paragraph negative Green says and the clarity is needed in relation to existing use rights application of rescission planes rules for dwellings and other related issues and it ties back to paragraph 79 where it says specific policy directionally plier file exceeds which rebuild and will be managed and hazard point areas is suggested and it says this is particularly urgent in relation to existing new stripes so our response to there is a mixture of two things in one case we have suggested that we include a new policy which includes an encouragement of rebuilding back Peter and despite existing use rights which is on page 180 from 181 it turned 18 free in our response we have included our a new policy which suggests that we should encourage property owners to incorporate additional Regis into the rebuild of earthquake damaged buildings beyond existing use rights to avoid or mitigate natural hazards affecting their property but the other side to that responses that we've basically identified that we can affect existing news rights so the unlimited response that the council can make and in regard to these comments Valley Minister this was the point ministers had asked for something we couldn't give them was that assisting us rights governed by the RMA and we don't have the power in our district clean to over tune the provisions of the RMA it screen so we've tended to keep quite silent in the district plane about existence tracks because the plan is focused on new development and future development yeah and when people do have the existing use rights so by and large we have been quite silent in the plan with respect to it the recommendation we have here is that we've perhaps at a policy to encourage property owners to incorporate things that will deal with the natural hazards but not not if they don't want to basically we've got it we have one minute to go Khloe wouldn't build the building code and consent requirements Calif some of the I mean if there's a hazard or safety issue existing rights would still be covered surely by what's required under the building codon and consent yes that's right and the building code for example sure that people raise their flaws to that level and regardless of existing stress if someone's rebuilding completely rebuilding they will have to comply with that use your microphone I think somewhere else where if you use flooding as an example I'm thinking of and it's a bad example because there are a lot of rules around you know it falling you know cliff collects and things like that but in environments like that do you know whether what is required and the repair or rebuild addresses that through the building code but they'll be structural requirements right for example in the building code that require it to be withstand particular earthquake standard so it's prettier but the building's the building it doesn't have existing use rights it is the RMA that has existing user eyes yes but when you want to do something and you're doing it under your existing rights yeah that's where that's to prevent you from applying for resource consent you can use your existing use rights to not allow for a resource consent okay the ok most conception okay it took me a long time to get my head around ok anyway so those are all of the areas where we have drafted a recommendation to the extent that no we won't make a change and the reasons are given in the report yeah and I think that just paying particular regard to the order on council we have to have regard to constraints particularly with regards to natural hazards that we also have to look at the RMA and so with that regard with it you know in mind I think that the officials reasons that we have been given will will set us by the two ministers that we've you know paid particular regard to the water and council but have not been able to address their particular requests thank you madam ji so when we come back after lunch then we'll focus on where officers are suggesting that there be particular changes yes prioritize though so that we're dealing with the most important is just two speakers fear yeah because I will be leaving it through and Vicki meeting but I'd like to get it concluded by being a high possibly cuz what time would you like to come back after lunch we'll come back well it's good I've actually allowed you to go five minutes overtime so I was very no I haven't_''_476.76 up about three minutes so we'll be bit we will will I'm going to start the meeting at 135 thank you thank you
I think these next ones are fairly straightforward yeah but he doesn't say it won't take long so it was a good start I am Oh David put me here transport planner so I want to take you through some of the transport recommendations pad and responded to those start with page numbers post on this yep so there's three recommendations there's written five is on page where responses on page 128 yep there's also recommendation 28 which is on page 177 and then recommendation you know needs to don't know just page by page so once your rate yeah the reason why I mentioned all that is that they're all very similar yeah and that we won't remember what page turn to Nick say just short far away okay so I'll just highlight what it which is on page one or 28 that we need to clearly translate the very fractured transport statement and the crusher transport strategic plan and register plan and we need to respond to change conditions post-earthquake also support the freight network we have considered this district plan that we also consider those documents the rate equation tranches statement and a crush to transmit street plan as staff we feel that we have translated those especially in the district plan and hosing any through that changes some of the reasons for that is one we don't want to we're going to have a streamline plan so we don't want to repeat everything that was on this and those documents data they are available and people can read them for themselves we filled with summarize the key messages LS options and use a number of methods and rules we've put them to the plan to give a fit to those no no whether we the horizontal infrastructure government's group goods direction to scoot scoot don't make decisions independently yes that's right but that is where a member of their remember that so but let me just pay particular regard to the order and counsel so states that provides for the effective functioning of the urban environment of the clash each district reflecting the changes resulting from the Canterbury earthquakes including course when referring to transport we've had a clear indication from ministers that that is the the whole of the transport system it's not just about people it's about Freight as well right Yanni quick yeah let's add cyclists in here as well I mean it should because this is the real tension with the community you've got Freight routes that have an impact you've got other needs that pedestrian and cyclist so I think if we're going to add one so people won't cyclist yes sure that should I go freight as well I need to pull us back here what you're asking counselor is outside what the Minister has asked for so we can't make those changes no the proposal needs two more clearly translate the greater Christchurch transport statement and a Christchurch transport strategic plan and the objectives policies and rules to provide clear direction poor decision-making particular to respond to the changed conditions post-earthquake in particular support the freight network I'm ed and fray what I also think we should be doing is elegance recycle because we didn't do that I mean the ministers have responded with the ticular or quizzes which we are responding to if you read the wreck transportation of I mean the alternative is not to change the words and a refer to people and freight or or change the weeds so we have got quite a lot of provisions in the transportation carriage cyclin I know cycle parking and so forth we also wanted to have a streamlined objectives SOI we used with people capture all people the middle hair the travel and if we start including tapas then we've all had to include a whole little other I know and the water pedal so what does this actually mean in real terms house but there's somebody goes to to a hearing or a proposal part of what I did affright designation through Brown Street and shut off the intersections what does this mean in real sims on the ground in terms of consenting it's an objective it gives a priority over fri Brown Street earth knows as the date highway actually so it will be people would include so I of course it does yeah we have it I'm sorry we haven't put any party that freighter more important people there they are equal and that's an objective anyway look I'm not going to have a lengthy discussion about this issue we either include people and freight and a or we don't l well our proposal is that we do in this case we can make it more clear that we can add in those words it doesn't change what the rest of the chapter is about just makes it more clear it doesn't say that we take out all a reference on our site cuz they're already under chapter yep alright moving there was one specific sort of requests we're with the Comets thought that we could provide more surprise in the frigid roni Twitter busy arterial roads and it risk is on page so it's paragraph 22 and I refer to it on page 177 so the Pacific carrier offers some is mentioned on the next page 178 of that that whole recommendation that we should discourage access to arterial road so that's the busy roads where there's alternative excess so for example property that's what there's a corner property rights to roads or it has a henway exists another Road we should encourage that excess onto the road with lesser traffic volumes as opposed to the arterial road we've considered that and we considered that in some cases that worry of the appropriate in some cases of won't_''_467.669 be so the most appropriate way is to deal with it through the integrated transport assessments which is what we did from a draft proposal because we don't want situations where and by giving a couple the pier Street new world in Ireland was in situation of this we're affronted and that hero Road pierce street but also fronted Brody Street which is a residential local street some people saying we should have all the supermarket perfect tom off Brody street so that people don't call that the arterial road to get to the supermarket yes from from current efficiency point of view that's people that in Brody straight here that would be curable so we're saying that we need to balance the community's needs with the need to move traffic and this on a case-by-case basis will do that through sit-ins yep yes how how is this resolution doing that the chance that you're proposing it so we just made once again some minor clarification changes just to make it clear that people need to hit with amazing heavy a particular regard to the as tragic transport network which is defined in the planets that the major roads but we haven't taken out any reference to the resident or needs to the community so all it does is change the words through shared access to in particular the strategic transport network it's just the boulder and it's got opportunities for sharing access with other activities it's very explicit that we if there's an alternative road then the environmental effects especially with respect to residential amenity has to be taken into account so we've got a good result on pierce street with a supermarket is all the strategic transport network because I'm your text in your office of reasons you refer to the strategic freight network and the changing that you're suggesting it's a strategic transport network yes the street edmonton it does cover the the freight network and also the cycling we were competing it work and also it does include those so so it's more pensive cleaners thank you very yep please what access controls are at the top of page 178 which has the highest protection of access control and the proposal sure yes in the draft plan and this we didn't really change from what's in the current operative plan there are some controls so if you if you put a property on them on arterial road you must design it so that you can't back out directly onto the road yeah the place occurs around street go get a book on premises I tell you what a traffic lights not fun thanks to all right the next one you don't well yes you've got five minutes five minutes cute event so neither one single
It's Martha no jungle okay now we have mark stevenson regarding any changes to the industrial sorry no changes to industrial or commercial that will sort by the ministers get the pages good morning I'd like to begin on page 155 at bottom that relates to recommendation 16 and recommendation 16 was to further reduce the triggers for a resource consents particular incall commercial areas where a range of Victor that he should be permitted in line with the zoning there's I should note that this point is very similar to recommendation 17 on page 158 and so a response to the Bofors recommendation was just wrapped up together and the particular aspect of these recommendations that I want to comment on is the thresholds for women urban design assessment is required and having considered the comments raised and also considered the statutory context of the Len use recovery plan and the RPS amongst other matters is proposed that there's no change to the thresholds that we have in the proposed plan that has gone to the ministers the as you may recall we put forward the draft that winter the ministers and we feel that there's a need to have that assessment of urban design for larger scale developments where there can be significant impacts on the design and amenity of the commercial center and by having council input to the design of new development we can achieve much greater higher quality outcomes not just for the community but for the business owners and occupiers buildings that are more attractive potentially yielded greater rental buildings that are more attractive potentially attract greater customers so hence we're not proposing to change those thresholds that's the first point and later on I'll come on to talk about some minor amendments were proposing to the masses of assessment for any resource consent subject to urban design thresholds the second point I just wanted to touch on that we're not proposing changes to is recommendation 18 18 and that's on page 161 at the recommendation is to provide further analysis in the section 32 report to illustrate the theoretical land supply will once you're suitable and sufficient commercial and industrial sufficient and they shun them you will note on page 162 there's a table that sets out the amount of land that is currently zoned or we're proposing to rezone in the proposed district plan to provide for future commercial growth and this in total 120,000 square meters of floor space that will be provided for across fifty nine hectares and that's considered having regard to the forecast growth in commercial activity that is considered sufficient to meet that future demand what's not in this table is of a capacity that exists which exists at present as well so there's been vacant sites created for demolition in the existing commercial areas there's also greater potential for intensification within existing commercial centers through changes to the rules that were in the version that went to the minister's now in terms of industrial capacity just referring to page 164 and 165 is a summary provided there of the greenfield areas identified in the land use recovery plan and that identifies that in the recovery plan there's over 400 hectares of industrial lands identified of that 400 and the structure upgrades and any of the structure improvements required can be undertaken as part of the subdivision process that green field capacity is an addition to the existing industrial areas of the city that we've got so the existing industrial areas of the city such as woolston Bromley Blenheim road Mendelson they having regard to councils data on vacant land there's in the order of 350 hectares of vacant land so combining those figures of 250 and 350 hectares you can clearly see there's more than sufficient land and we've undertaken an assessment determined that that land is suitable into the greenfield areas and we've shot we've shown in these tables that there is the ability to service 250 hectares in the short term so as an officer rick in but recommendation we're not proposing a change in terms of adding to the supply and the tables here demonstrate that there is that supply available so this will form part of the documents that go forward just so that you understand that's in a bit more of a framework perhaps take up of industrial land has been posters quake and I don't know if we're not sorry Priya the quake and they're closed ethically council has for a number of years collected data on buildings and building concepts I should in industrial areas and assuming that all building consents are implemented the take-up of industrial Landers in the order of 15 to 20 hectares per annum so if you then extrapolate that out to consider in relation to the supply of land the vacant land of 350 hectares are now existing industrious plus the 250 in greenfield areas we're talking about in the order of from memory three years of supply if not more and generally councils a required to review their plans every 10 years so I'm just can can you talk about the loop requirement that that we sort of basically prefer the central city for commercial and the the language recovery plan has actions around giving primacy to the central city as as the destination for a large range of activities the chapter 6 of the regional policy statement and the land a larger retail centers key activity centers of record and surely Linwood and also references made to neighborhood centers as the focal point foot those activities and so in the commercial chapter with established a hierarchy of centers so the central city at the top and then district centres followed by neighborhoods neighborhood centers and the strategy would take proposing in the commercial chapters to directs larger scale retail and office development to the central city but also to Key activities senses and the future growth that's expected particularly growth in the southwest where there's a lot of residential subdivisions occurring that's proposed to be met by a new key activity center in north hall as well but also women existing capacity of centers and including on the central city so in that respect we're addressing the lurk requirement to ensure there's primacy given to the central city and two key activity centers but also providing for growth in the smaller centres so that's something that the council can't not do we're directed by government to do that by the loop that would the government then say that they were concerned about us not addressing the land supply issue round commercial industrial and residential I mean I mean that's the way I read recommendation 18 and I got that wrong but my reading of it is that that concerned as to whether that take up of that land will occur and we're encouraging that take up by taking a centers based approach at the moment the current study plan provides for and really opens the door for retail and office activity and I'm riv industrial zones now if we focus those activities and commercial centers then there should be a greater take-up of land in those centers the question around what is whether it's suitable or not that analysis of industrial land supply has shown that there's infrastructure there to accommodate that growth and it's really dependent on the landowners like residential to then deliver on that in the case of industrial land supply we we have potentially a oversupply in the short term yeah in terms of commercial activity our evidence points to us a in the new census that we've identified around the city and this district plan review which enables the rezoning of civil new centers including their floors well will provide that capacity and and that's as far as as as a council we can go are we monitoring that just a min for our own you know sort of concern you know I mean because I wonder you keep reading stuff in the paper and hearing you know people commenting about you know potential oversupply of office space and you know the floor floor rates you know in different areas leading to sort of different decisions being made I'm just worried about you know that the sort of kind of boomerang effect that you hear about the the council unlike industrial land doesn't maintain a register as such of office floor space budgets for the purpose of a briefing in April May when we provided a memo to you with a summary of the floor space approved in terms of officers in the central city and also suburban areas we were able to obtain that data very data is part of their everyday business and that market interface is obviously critical to understanding what's available and we're confident in the figures we're using to inform how much land we razon and how much floorset floor space that provides for that there is sufficient capacity be good to have a map of that at some point I mean not for this now but I personally be very interested in seeing a meth around the commercial development and pause you touched on a point X exactly what I was going to ask is as a ramit floor space and the take-up of that floor space you obviously like them for making rally industrial we take up and obviously got 30 years of supply be really good to understand the commercial sector because the key concern probably for me is that we the central city takes precedent over all other areas is look at pre youthquake eighty-five percent of the redevelopment of commercial area commercial space was actually outside the 4x so we need to figure out how we can move that back and to actually ensure tenants to go into that reboot otherwise it won't happen so that is my concern the allows of expansion of commercial space and retail space into these suburban the key activity centers will lessen the chance of actually getting a yet how we build in the central city mmm certainly we can the other source that I didn't refer to as our consents data and larger developments particularly our commercial centers will require resource consents figure with the urban design triggers going forward there'll be ability to capture the majority of development in terms of monitoring floor space and that would be a source that we could effectively start monitoring now to have a better picture of where where the consent of floor space is going I'll fill um look I'm we've on this face that it's clear and we decided that that mail site is in the next phase just asking about that sort of description of commercial activity being within that general industrial designation like it's kind of confusing it seems are here there is a way of restricting well of the rules to commercial but in fact the designations industrial page 163 there's a bullet points on the upper part of that page and and in that context of that paragraph is describing where there's also capacity outside of commercial centers and in industrial zones going forward the policy direction is to only provide for to provide for primarily industrial activity and industrial zones but there's recognition that there's obviously existing office and retail activity and a number of industrial zones but the land the industrial park zone was is a proposed own and we discussed the tapes campus and providing for a quantum of office floor space up to what we decided almost 5,000 square metres and so that's that adds to that supply of where office activity can occur and subject to discussions about male the male site at a future days that is also a potential source orca can contribute to the capacity for commercial activities but because it's a greenfield priority area like other green foot priority areas we have to put in place restrictions on the quantum of they do primarily remain as industrial activities but this statement about male is on assumption of provisions that need to be revisited as part of phase 2 so this isn't by any means putting forward something to go into faith what phase one is really a response to acknowledge that green filter out here is do also provide some capacity so just for clarity for me are you reciting to that this plan is restricted by our councils policies there are we hear that the policies in the RPS and then the signal that we should only provide provide for primarily industrial activities and industrial zones and there's clear policy direction for greenfield areas that that approach is taken so it's not something we've come up with our selves it's really reflecting the higher order documents okay jaani thank you um thank you I'm just on page 29 there's quite a lot of comment from the government over extending this to the Central City play and I 29 and attachment 1 I'm an attachment 1 so I just wanted to understand I include the central city in in this because the residual stuff and they said no we don't want you to do it we're gonna do it no no no no no no what we did was we asked the government whether we could do the consultation on the residential chapter because we were doing our presidential chapter at the same time so that was what we asked them yeah okay yeah so in terms of but in terms of like the district plan Riviera does it did it include the central city or was that supposed to maclee exclude it no it's excluded until stage 2 right so why is the government then saying and I mean I don't know who made that call to exclude it was that the government's call what our call no it was our cool oh okay so yeah okay so what can you just help me understand why we did that it's mainly for legal reasons to be honest and that there's a few reasons and one of the reasons as the amount of work that needs in terms in terms of the section 32 assessments etc or the output so that the officers are in a position where they are uncomfortable to speak and the proposed plan provisions from a more legal perspective the top there were issues issues with timing has just mentioned the sara is pushing through a review of the living provisions within the central city in terms of the hierarchy and of the relevant provisions the council cannot do anything that's been consistent with the central city recovery plan it's currently being reviewed so we're essentially waiting for the outcome of that review because we need the provisions that come through that review before we can notify the chapter so that the timing is not ideal but we are working to the beach that we can with that timing and then then essentially made a mint sorry a recommendation that the central city moves back into phase 2 is there any benefit what they'd be any benefit to making any changes now to the central city stuff in light of what the ministers have seeds which I mean of comments on that really which cause you thinking there's a whole box so in 71 driving prices are clear at hierarchy and type of development this is supporting this effect to the regional land use crush essential plan goes on council needs to think carefully about the transition period how the market will respond in the short term there's the property groups review which I'm I presume is not the government someone else saying that we should endorse changes to objective one and policy one to explain the role ccrp and its relationship to the city plan is reference to the mixed-use signs introduced in the reco plane not included in our draft commercial plan and I guess the telling statement is a view draft commercial provides cover the entire district include commercial zones within the central silly one of the key reasons why I would advise against doing that as the council hasn't consulted on proposed provisions to go through the review and that essentially hasn't done the work that it needs to do under the RMA to justify those provisions I wanted what is it that we would be doing um the central city recovery plan doesn't cover everything on the central city and it only covers some provisions and yet for example open space address some for a designation but it doesn't it didn't take a full review of the operative provisions that apply within the four evah news so when when that when we get to phase 2 and the council looks to do it well it's already underway reviewing the provisions that apply within the central city it is restricted in terms of what it can recommend because of what's in the seat or City recovery plan but there is not the full picture so this things like natural the natural hazards so some of the wider chapters contaminated land those kind of things they we need to the council needs to consider whether they are the most appropriate for within the four evah news and that exercise hasn't been completed yet the government's letter says the the property groups review of the proposed commercial chapter includes a number of recommended changes and have they have their submission been copied to us the the property group were our planning consultant see and they were commissioned to undertake an independent review of the commercial and the industrial chapters and their advice to give advice from economists informed changes to the urban design fresher that we bought to you on the fifth of June and a where a proof for sending to the ministers that's it so we hired them to do an independent review thank you that's good yep I'm so Jimmy unique issues regarding to the industrial area on page 1 64 65 the eastern can park what is the status of infrastructure concentrate so the infrastructure status of yes constraint in here is lame-o Islington park yes is under development now the first stages have been consented but by way of subdivision concerns and so the there's no immediate infrastructure constraints and the rolling improvements and the upgrades can be undertaken in conjunction with the subdivision which is well underway ok 6 second question there are the surgeons the way to drive you here your particular mention implemented by developer so what's the criteria some facility you know or you four charges by councils and facility or infrastructure by the developer whether develop a new subdivision a shoot is solar DC achi as a difference some in some cases infrastructure upgrades can be directly linked with the developments and in this case the proposed the rezoning of land office James wotty drive which is already zoned in the city plan for industrial activities that has a direct impact on the intersection of sands road and so James what he drove and in any in a lot of greenfield areas like that both residential and industrial there's cost sharing agreements in some cases Council and the developers share cough in some cases developer take full all responsibility for the costs and then this case the developer because of the impact of their subdivision the costs are borne by the developer for charger is within the part of the extension of the length in my right because here you measure 13 a haircut so he's within its directly adjacent to the 39 it is yes and watt I Drive Thank You Ellie I'd like to ask the same question with regards to the industrial areas and the expansion mirrors was asked about the residential earlier because I note that there is quite a lot again in the Shirley area Belfast those sorts of areas again and press truck sure was badly hit and with I see it as noted around the Northwest River I don't know whether the area as that's on page 164 sorry anticipated that upgrades are required to wastewater infrastructure again I'd like to know whether that is something that might change as a result of the optimization so it's just bringing together what was asked before was residential now as regards to this good thank you um yeah I'm really intrigued about commercial chapter and I just wondered um if we could get these elements of the commercial chapter that we could put in place in the central city as I Drive down by beta street and see the side of some of the new buildings going up doesn't_''_1529.919 seem that urban designers played much we've got quite a strong focus from our community that urban design would it be possible to put in place something sort of in the short term around you know some some requirements of a commercial chapter to apply across the city so that we you know interim time we actually get a nice built environment rather than a pretty average none of that has been through any of the process that every other of the chapters that's to be notified on the twenty-seventh so that would mean it's going and without in and without coming to you first it would be going in without any community consultation it won't across to the ministers just at a general level I thought we've done quite a lot of work around urban design and commercial zoning so what's late waiting every but but the issue is we haven't looked at it in conjunction with the ccrp we just can't_''_1585.82 put the urban design rules for various other commercial centres and to the city centre there needs to be a process it has to go the central see there is there's an urban design requirement for any developments were within the core of the sink of city business zone and there's proposed to be an urban design requirement in the central city mix you zone which has been subject to draft amendments consulted on recently so there is already some urban design requirements but they're not across the whole of the central city so maybe one of our responses to the minister's we need to speed up that process then the mix you soon but they're saying we haven't acted quick enough but you're saying they've already got going on that the Chrysler at central development unit has recently consulted on draft amendments to the central city mxu zone or a part of that should I say which introduced proposes an urban design requirement now that will be subject to a process under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act so the minister could decide to approve those amendments but that storm a process being worked for it I don't think a text quite the right where your often response where we actually make a comment about that so so no authority is recorded and officers recommendation we still have three more speakers talk about no modification areas yep no only me you get to take over them you get to take over at three o'clock so it sees a review of the provisions that apply to the central city in the proposed plan is underway as part of stage two and council officers of engaging with Cyril officials on this process all right so so there any other questions around the commercial commercial chapter I just I think that there are quite detailed reasons why with we're responding in the way that we are and I think just paying particular regard to the statement of expectations I think that I think that they have yeah I mean it it's ironic really because it's a there's a conflict between some of the boulder focus on the supporting the central city so if the way that it's the way that it's talked in terms of the central city it makes it it's given to the central city in terms of commercial yeah so but that is something that we are required to have regard to because it would be unconcerned to the loop if we didn't give that a piece yeah in the app years right so I think that you've described all of the reasons why that would be why we would be in order to to to respond to the minister and the way as proposed and you also help you with the industrial chapter heck let's discussed max gone through the commercial and industrial chapter yeah I think that there's a little bit of nervousness around the reference to the north west northwest review so it's but but because it looks as a Fetzer a done deal but it's it's still a proposal that's right and the mail site was likely to come through in stage two well it would be from our point of view and we will come back with regards to outcomes further investigation regarding infrastructure in that area and also on the residential yeah if the go through would that change the proposals that the mail site would like to do the effect of a designation is that it gives the right to the use of that land and it really gives the requiring authority the airport they believed to veto or decline the use of land from what the zoning may permit so effectively a flan is designated than the requiring authority has the first request has to be made to the requiring authority to get approval and so effectively it trumps the zoning for want of a better term so even if the zoning let's say permitted in office and the airport felt the office would compromise the purpose of that designation then that request would be turned out potentially and then
I just had a sort of a chat over the break and what it seems to me is is that the the particular the particular recommendations that the government has well the two ministers have sent through that require our our sort of special attention and actually they pop up the main issues that we are concerned about as a council other ones that are being declined so I actually suggest that we go through them and at each each step of the way we take particular regard of the order and council and then and then you know sort of at the end will resolve to to accept those so let's go through the ones that we're going to not modify our plan before it's notified so I highlighted the area so I'm really going to let you Brigitte choose the order that we do the man because you're going you've got the team lined up so we do I'll introduce scott blair again as scott will speak to the recommendations and minister's comments that he has given a draft recommendation so Scott I'll ask you to focus on intensification lifestar life mark homestar even design and that's why John scelan is here also and those other matters great okay starting it a page 125 yep I've been looking at recommendation 3 this came from a paragraph from paragraph 23 whether with a the comments suggested that the council had not gone far enough to enable non-residential type activities than there is in the residential area there was no specific recommendation arising from it although it could be linked back to recommendation 3 but we've responded to the specifically to the paragraph anyway and we've seen effectively that we are providing for community facilities by way of listed activities and the residential zones that that some such as education health care and spirit of what we call in spiritual facilities will be enabled on some properties with them and the residential within the residential suburban zone and other zones where they sit with them set on the corners of collector roads and and and other roads so we're making some provision for them at that facilities such as shall we say community halls or libraries or even larger facilities like that we're probably better directed to the commercial zones at least the commercial local zone and that's that's a very brief summary of our rationale there so we're so we're recommending no no modification that point and the next no modification that we've recommended is at recommendation seven where they've asked us through oh and that's at page 142 where the ministers have asked us to review the sustainability of the extreme standards this relates specifically the home star and and life mark and we have gone back and and reviewed them we've noticed that there there seems to be an error and the ministers assumptions and that they are assuming that the external home star and life mark standards are compulsory for mandatory they're not we're recommending that they be a voluntary alternative to the stand that we've that we're recommending in the plan we've also added a bit more material here we're about the costs and about the officers we feel that we can maintain that while there would be a there would definitely be a short-term increase in building costs I think one of my associates associates us estimated at about two percent but that would once again pay itself back in a very short period of three or four years so we are we're comfortable that the that the standards and should remain for public notification and go out for public discussion I think you should highlight the recovery strategy directive because I think that's highly relevant to what we have to consider though and we are having particular regard to the order and council but we also have to have regard to the recovery strategy and that we can't have anything unconcern tan our district plane with the recovery strategy and I'm actually surprised that ministers would ask us to consider something that was unconcerned with their own recovery strategy that's um that's absolutely correct I think preciate inner opening and your opening comments noted that the officers have taken a much shall week a wider view on on management and and completely and being consistent with the rear with the regional policy statement and various other drivers and once we take those into account we wait and we weigh those it's once again the costs of the costs and benefits we are still confident that these are appropriate that these are appropriate mechanisms in the city clean certainly you're quite right that there are state there are definitely higher order strategic documents that that require us to look into these matters well it's specifically rotary rebuilding the structure and buildings and a resilient cost of active end energy efficient manner it's correct well it seems to me that it would be an appropriate to remove what are in fact guidelines from our document when we here are required really to think about that when we in the recovery strategy I think that's fair summary do you want to comment also about the mandate under the resource management edge oh is part two of the RMA I think it was a recent would have been written I think it's a recent amendment requires the use of resources as well I think that's in section 76 section 32 and certainly we have we've taken that into account in terms of the overall to reach a purpose of the Act we feel that we feel that health and efficiency particularly mandated and part till the act in terms of the the purpose of the Act and sustainable management of natural and physical resources and there's also direct there is the reg mention and section 7 of having particular regard to the efficiency in induce of energy we feel that we are as officers we feel that we have a mandate if not if not an obligation to explore these mirrors so can we go through the affordability issue as well because I mean that's obviously and the government's mind they want to make sure that buildings that we build our affordable but I mean the information that you've given us to look at talks about banks and lenders now take into account running costs when assessing homebuyers ability to service loans for mortgage applications and the misperception that building basis that the payback period is actually quite and if you look at the what does it call the you know the lifelong cost that whole of life costs then you're actually looking not just at the upfront costs of building the building but actually those running costs and then how quickly you can repay the additional costs that you've got up front yep you're correct probably what we haven't touched on here is as what we see is quite significant benefits to up to the arm to the economy and the community in general over the lifetime as well they are harder to quantify now but in terms of certainly in terms of payback we feel that we in terms of immediate economic payback we feel that we've um we have sufficiently defined those I mean that the example that's given here is that a Christchurch house that was build five square meters short smaller then perhaps what it was originally going to be would actually not have any additional cost of all that's great it's a scene I would have already underway in our social housing for instance I mean total life costs we've been doing this for some time the water's cold can I just ask me that these are disconnect with loop action 49 I'm not sure what happened do you think there's been a disconnect with between what's proposed in in dilute action here maybe someone to been given okay show me Murray on the affection 49 what that is it mode is promoting quality with an environment a meeting Council obligations under RMA sustainable management England air and water I think ricktum it's basically I can really only speculate about that that disconnection I think that there's probably a there's a stronger emphasis within Syria or the ccd you thank you there's probably a stronger emphasis in terms of driving lower costs then there is then the emphasis that they put on action 49 I mean that's I think that's pure speculation on my part but I suspected that's the case creasing there's an assumption that it's kind of an argument between here is excellent that it actually it's not an or no I help you there they are they can be the same you can I just add something in terms of the hierarchy of decision-making the council cannot make a decision or recommendation that is inconsistent with the land use recovery plan that's right and we can't make a decision that's inconsistent with the recovery strategy either correct both of them require us to turn our attention to this matter and I actually believe the way that has been proposed by staff jonnie2 check on that because I thought this was going through an order in council process with RMA considerations are you saying that we now have to think about recovery strategy as well we always have here as soon as soon as the recovery strategy came on it effectively provided an umbrella against which no plans of the council so this is we're notifying our district plan no plane can be uncontained for the Selwyn District Council in the waimakariri District Council right but the recovery strategy is pretty high level the loan correct so so we're the council is preparing and notifying a plan under the RMA but there are some extra considerations that it has to deal with and the main ones are the lair nice recovery plan the central city recovery plan and a recovery strategy and was that put them through the order in council know this that comes through this through the emergency legislation so there's a section in there that gives those documents that status let's see wrecked in the regional policy statement does that include anything around energy efficiency or sustainability or accessibility the the order in council itself no no the app yes yes yes it does but I think there are our Pierce related policy they'll be quite the assault I think just highlight that in our response as well but I concur with my colleagues I think you've had a really good response to this I just think the more ammunition computers so that when that goes to the hearings panel into a public consultation you know that the more support we can show for this approach that is that this is something that we want to pursue and I think we should have a particular regard to the order and council so the order and council would require us to look specifically actually I'll just turn to the order and council so they can have particular ad foot and which enjoys it she'd your attachment 1 so it's no no no I haven't got I've got the order in council in front of me o.o schedule core yes thank you I think this here's a very particular I regard for technique age 38 so um so basically reliance on resource consent processes and this actually reduces resource consent processes because this is if they meet these standards then it's an automatic assumption that there over the standard required under the district plan so we've achieved that the number extent and prescriptive mass of development controls and design standards and the rules in order to encourage a novation and choice well we've done that within the framework that we are allowed to so we've got to have we recovery strategy this recovery strategy does have a provision so does the RPS so does the land is fertile and US recovery plan and so we have done that to the extent that we are able to and the requirements for notification and written approval and as I say we've we've we've resolved that and I think there was a question around affordability and we've certainly turned our attention to their as well so I think having particular regard to the to the order and council on this particular matter I think that staff have done an excellent job and drawing our attention to the whole range of issues that we need to look at there David I was just going to say whether it would be helpful in some respects to have a chart of all other plans policies and things that we have to have regard to when we're making out the strict plan well what we as officers do hit that but that's what staff have done they've actually given us all of this information and the reason so that of them in a charcoal yeah but for each I mean there's no point having the for example the recovery strategy in front of us the recovery strategy is relevant to this issue it may not be relevant to other I appreciate that but other people were community board members and the general public when they're actually trying to understand the plan yeah it may be sort of helpful to just be have that broad overview of the site that's lots of things that need to be taken into consideration when we I think that's a very good idea and I think that I mean apart from this process I think that drawing up and actually some people within the communication section of council have already drafted basically the hierarchy of of documents so we should do that but it probably needs the land use recovery plan and the RMA requirements edit or yeah happy to do that and we can just bring to you the presentation that we did to you very early on this year when we first took them the chapters all of but I think that the point that david's making is that the order and council wasn't known in and to put that alongside to assist the public as they go through their process of making submissions will be useful it's very good idea yeah alright so are there any other questions on on this one I think there's general acceptance around the table and this is one that we will want to make a submission on as well because we suspect that there will be submissions and the alternative and we will want to be in a position to make a counter submission is that generally agreed by councillors yep alright so moving on to the next one ok the next goal discuss and with the help of my friend John John scelan who's helped me put together some of these some of these comments I'll discuss recommendations 10 and 11 together they they are effectively seeking both both seeking the same thing at pages 147 and 148 the comments and general suggest that the that the council has not resigned sufficient or up areas around our character of dissenters and our suburban centers and some of our largest abivard centers you'll recall that we that we had quite a long discussion on this when we brought these matters to the council previously and we were asked to revisit these are revisit these areas I've got John here who can add to any specific questions around densities and with them within certain areas but we have in the last few days done what I call a very high level analysis of some of the yields that will be possible from the other mechanisms that were put in place in the city plan as well and these are these include the the remainder thank you these include the remainder of the unused let land bank in the living and what is it the existing living trees zone and using can very conservative conservative figures we feel that around about four thousand additional household units are available and this is based on only about twenty percent of the available land bank being being rebuilt within the living free in terms of the minor dwelling area that we're that we're proposing being enabled there may be as many as three and a half thousand additional monitoring units and this is at an uptake of only five percent of the available properties and then in the Greenfield area our calculations or our pre we previously reported to the strategy and planning committee that there are nineteen thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine residential sections available to 20 28 admittedly not all of those were available now but some of them are under infrastructure constraints but they will by 2028 them they will be available in terms of our up zoned areas we feel that there's around about three thousand residential units available with them and this is based on previous calculations that that we've made and present it to the council around those key activity centers and minor suburban sorry major suburban centers and that will come to a just over 30,000 residential units available by 2028 and then I'd also note that in terms of additional Central City additional households or residential units within the central city I think there we there would be an additional seven thousand is attend chill units in there so the loop the loop itself predicts that with that the Christchurch area will need twenty three thousand seven hundred residential units by by 2028 so and only in the offices of you I think that deal work that what we've allowed us is quite considerable in terms of what the projected demand us I'd also point out that there are a number of other big mechanisms within the draft plans such as the enhanced development mechanism and the community housing redevelopment mechanism high density within retirement villages the existing loop mechanism of replacement of 22 houses for one house where it's been damaged or destroyed by the earthquakes we've enabled the conversion of a residential unit and the residential suburban zone and to toe we've enabled comprehensive reason residential developments and living toe that's as a permitted activity up two of the three residential units over that a restricted discretionary activity based on urban design we've enabled comprehensive social housing developments and the what are now the equivalent of haven't been out the calculor do a quick quick calculation on as the yield from the living to set from the land bank lift than the living to zone so we add all of those together it's very hard for us to for us to conclude that we haven't provided sufficient supply well we have built or we don't have sufficient mechanisms within the city plan to enable intensity so but in terms of the numbers we are required just having particular regard to the order and councils the district plan has capacity to accommodate up to twenty-three thousand seven hundred additional dwellings by 2028 and that's true that's done so but when I ran through all of those everything that I've just ran through we have more than amply supplied in my opinion three madam chair we will include those numbers and these fonts yeah and the intensification of opportunities and line with the principal support and key activities centers in the central city well we don't have a say over the central city in terms of that measure that semeta ccrp that year the residential chapter earlier is the central city recovery plan and so we're not required to make any changes to the legislation to sorry to the district plan we're not we're not required to notify anything in that regard but we will notify and based in place ooh yes so and that will be already determined when we notify and but in terms of the key activity centers obviously there was some discussion and the media recently about Barrington and others so there's been no change to that and do you want to dispel out for us why so that we can have a toddler about Oliver I think John can touch on white why we excluded our bouncer and in riccarton yep I know the answer to the question I just want on the ring board so additionally we bent we took excuse me directions from the RPS and love to look at all the key activity centers and large labor hood centers across the city and we looked at each of those in turn to identify what would be an appropriate from there we then we looked at the detailed each Center whether there is capacity constraints or character constraints or all the range of issues that you may want to consider when when docking at a change in density in area factually a change in the in the environment in that area so for Barrington personal level to the other side Barrington when we looked at Barrington and we came across an infrastructure constraints in the wastewater system down there which we took the view was with a constraint which we couldn't ignore and and would be a limit on on servicing medium density develop in an area taking that factor into account and the enhanced event mechanism which falls quite comprehensively around perinton and within the enhanced event mechanism there is a requirement there to assess the infrastructure constraints as part of an individual consent for a hot stove and mechanism development and we thought that was a more appropriate approach to medium density in that area around Barrington yeah the area around riccarton in particular the area to the north of Richter road again there was a detailed investigation work by the engineers that came quite late in the day but we reacts and all that information and for that reason we said ok this there's actually not capacity both the written and road to accommodate meeting to see you this time just a minute yep one of the other considerations we took into account was community feedback as you know we went out to each each area and we presented to the plan City it's the area to the feedback from local residents it varied the feedback we got but some senses there was particularly strong feeling against increase in the dictionary Rixon was was one Center where there was particularly strong feeling against intensification barrington was also a bit more of a mix but there was also doing a strong feeling against intensification as well the day for residential medium PepsI's are but they tighten in particular and just having particular regard to the order and council at sears having regard to constraints on environmental and I'm construction capacity particularly with regard to natural hazard I mean this is a natural both barrington you feel that that can be resolved by the current enhanced development mechanism which in itself has provisions to protect against development that would put pressure where there are infrastructure constraints and in Brooklyn it's well it's it is purely the infrastructure constraints so if there was a decision sometime in the future to increase the infrastructure to support that area then that could be looked at in the future but I couldn't be looked at now just simply because of those constraints correct yeah I was just having particular regard to the order and council on that particular matter so thanks John so basically barrington it remains really like a medium density area and that the way around that for any residents would be to that council consider enhanced development measures it so there's a different way of she dealing with the issues that the reasons race is that what you're saying for Barrington the enhanced development mechanism album is all the operative in the current plan and that allows for medium density to effectively the equivalent of living three today that density to be built in what is currently a living to area around Barrington that is all living to area so through the consent process those issues concerning infrastructure and the impact environment can be essentially that person so I think and it's not sure how this is arisen because I wasn't at that meeting but I just would gather that there is the reason sort of understanding of us as it's not accurate done fig they but they believe that in fact there won't be further medium density I wasn't_''_1862.929 at the meeting so I can't leave a comment comment directly um I did however read the article in one of the local papers yes and I tried I got the gist of the the opinion there I think perhaps there may be a slight misunderstanding yes we are not proposing to move to a residential medium density zone around Barrington however the enhanced event mechanism does the other like largely across an area here thanks John yep Yanni thank you just on page the page where you talk about the eem will is intended to reconsider the residential side in this area's out of the review of the ADM provision I'm not aware of what review with signaled and certainly can you just try and clarify what what that actually means in terms of timing and in terms of process let's not talk about the idiom now the EDM was introduced through the land use recovery plan 6 December 2013 it is a mechanism that it is a mechanism that relates to what they call or what is called a floating zone it's based on a number of walkability criteria and distances and and and access to two services such as public transport or walk ability to commercial services and and and separation from industrial areas and they and those types of things now they can be they can be generally modeled in terms of our of where they are in terms of our geographic information systems but in terms of John did you in terms of lynnwood the EDM and the c.h are already exists in certain areas of love odd but what you seem to be the lynnwood area as well as the Barrington church corner area as some sort of review but I I don't know what I'm really interested no but are we doing a review what's the time frame for that room are we are so I think that comma probably needs to just be modified to actually say what it means which is what I presume it means is that you can still get intensification in these areas through the EDM process which is a separate process it was approved under the Lee nice recovery plan yeah except it was that yes right um and as part of this obviously because we can't_''_2054.409 be inconsistent with the land use recovery plan we can't change those areas we can't change those present in items missing the sums okay and they did include walkability to schools as well proc sales calls yes I'm Ellie I want to ask on page 189 188 and 189 there the tables I'm showing the transition as well is it still in the area that we're on it's talking I'm wrong then we'll know why it's great right okay so what bulleen I are aware of and you will obviously is where be aware of 2 is the amount of infrastructure damage and particularly the shirley area and some of the sun or burns area I'm not even talking about flopped and I'm talking up Shirley wrote and yet the majority of land is l1 to start off with their so there's quite a mess of change and what's going to happen in the land and that Julie area if I'm reading this correctly and in fact the shirley areas got the second highest total net increase for got moving into their intensification we've heard of the problems of infrastructure and the Riccarton area and the other barrington how much cognizance has been paid to the issue of infrastructure and surely when you look at the num the amount of intensification proposed so the same question that was put to the the engineer's regarding riccarton and any of the center's was the same question flips them garnet surely shirley was was not a constraint on move to medium density okay anecdotally and on a day to day living experience it's a nightmare I know that I can't see under the road but there are some major repairs proposed for that area particularly around the hills road and surely Road intersection for example would the submit so you're not consumed by this amount of intensification in an area that's severely damaged and will continue to be repaired for quite some we do we do depend on the engineers and various other people with the expertise to give us this information can I just ask though as is the feedback we've had from engineers before the skirt re optimization or after because there's been some quite major decisions made and I know our engineers have some quite strong concerns over what's currently happening so I think it's it would be interesting to hear whether how long ago this advice was sought and advice has been updated in light of the roads and the pipes that won't be fixed and what that wood where there's a lot of urban channeling which is just sitting there can't cope with the existing water and you know it does seem a bit odd that we would encourage intensification in areas that aren't going to be fixed or I'm going to have the capability in the near future all I can say is we can see if we can get one of the engineers down here this information wasn't updated in the last few days and responsive minister's comments it's information that head at the time that these chapters went over to the ministers and respect your staff I appreciate that because we've only just found out about this as well like two weeks ago so these are really new concerns but they're very strong concerns so don't to being on a bitless but I'm just going back to barrington lynnwood church corner I think you indicated in response to Yanni that you might make some change to the wood in there is that what you what you mean toward it on this understand do'm the attachment to the report recording the council council officers recommendations to you so as part of this process we have to see a copy of the council with reasons to the ministers so we will update that to reflect the clarification on that point so will you we probably won't see those though after today well I've just sent someone upstairs to try and track down the appropriate person to speak to this meter I don't think thank you that don't help um
Okay just reminder that the meeting is live stream so if people could speak clearly into the microphone and any declarations of interest we all own property and crash it city so we'll just take that as read
Good morning everyone um I'll just call for um apologies um I have an apology from tim scandret and um I don't think there's any other apologies oh jamie gough that's right sorry um how could I forget um sorry I shouldn't laugh so on that note ref will move that the apologies be accepted and and I actually deserve to second it myself but I won't_''_29.92 I'll t I'll accept david east as the second of the motion that the apologies be received um all those in favor say aye those opposed say no let's carry
Publicly that 45 minutes know calculus ok so I will move that the public be excluded from the following Pat's the proceedings so all of you have to go away ok I'm naming for the reasons listed below you guys okay to turn off and do whatever you do ok you're good I sorry we'll give you a couple of texts to leave in
The trans-tasman Pacific Partnership issue which I will leave in the hands of the deputy there and I do apologize but um I have another meeting hopefully not once a quorum does anyone know 73 just well if you do it will stop the meeting so would you like to so the TPPA we've got I think is the one thing remaining in the pepper set right and then we've got a couple of rats and mice and sorry little things in n committee Ritz yeah yeah we won't get onto ribs ok and I haven't got him so this is a kind of do nothing type when have I got anybody else who wants to speak have I got any amendment to this probably Yanni um I actually really am quite concerned about this trans-pacific partnership agreement I I really support a lot of the points that were made by the people that have made the deputation I think Christchurch has had a really proud tradition of being quite progressive as a city and raising concerns over issues like this this does have the ability things we want to do and so I think we should be really concerned about it I think we should be endorsing the principles that have been put forward by this group we should also be seeking raising this matter with LG and z and seeking LG indeed to adopt those same principles and take a national view but this is really scary that this has been done in secret it's the consequences for us not knowing what's in it but getting a general feel for some of the things that could happen I don't think this is something we should be supporting we should definitely be raising our concern so yeah any color suggests that are you seeking to move the as an amendment what's actually puts their as attachment 1 on page 47 3 so let's move Gianni is there a second death yep taking the pool which would be to adopt a similar position okay so it's all of what's on page 47 3 plus an additional 13 I guess that the City Council also request LG LG in zeid'm actually happy to vote with it I I cannot see that we wish to actually undermine something as useful as far mech I don't like the idea of national sovereignty being undermined I don't know whether that's going to happen in this case but my hunch is that this gives large businesses particularly in tobacco alcohol drug companies others a power that they don't deserve and that in some way may threaten count both councils and government's ability to take a stance on issues and be able to take that issue forward the concern I've had has been around far mec because I've heard from a number of the people in PHARMAC how worried they are about the risks associated with this from drug companies coming in and undermining the very excellent model that we have here I agree with the speaker in terms of would you sign something that you haven't seen I would also tell my kids not to sign something that even I think it's sound advice so I'm happy to support this amendment uni sorry be council adopt attachment 1 is its position yeah and request the algae NZ also adopt attachment 1 is a national position okay yes probably I think that's probably simple as you can get adopt attachment 1 as a as its position yeah Paul look I I agree with even the yarn he said but also it's a it could very well mean that the lock of less lock lack of democracy for our city yeah and any City and New Zealand and even for New Zealand itself so as of that much for concern I mean at a time where as I said we were trying to actually establish more of a grassroots approach will wear the community issue enables us to actually enact on what they want this will they she totally wanted out so I think we really gotta put a strong stand point to this here yep Glendon entry a better support the set and make the comment that in the line where it says you know the decision being sort of the council's largely political everything we do wedding Lee and I being political I mean week we've done things such as run housing summits and and actor on insurance and that's been interpreted political even though the starting point is that issues and needs of our constituents so you know week beaky easily find ourselves in even we try not to be political waiting into a political situations sure entry yeah absolutely agree that we shouldn't be afraid of politics in any way I am don't see anything in the attachment that I disagree with there's a lot of stuff in there there's some this is certainly quite sensible and quite positive I know many of the concerns are about the the unknown which is entirely the point in many ways and certainly the effect on you know giving a whole heap of power to international companies that may in fact erode our democracy and sovereignty or something that we should be very concerned about so yeah I believe it's a very positive position that we should adopt this today and therefore are we supporting it okay any further debate can I put it I think I'm now up to the resolution to it
And it certainly wasn't a task that the task force could could address when it came to the building act the response is there and the second question for me is a note in the table jump on a page shots and that's always easier um one five nine five point four point four which is ensuring that the skirt work program is fully lined blend range recovery program when I flip through to page 240 where it's got the kind of explanation it doesn't he you took it off as being complete but my reading from the response is that in fact we've got a long way to go towards being complete because of the optimization that skirt have done where it says it's become necessary of further optimized skirt repairs of stormwater infrastructure and the repair strategy has been amended in order to reduce the overall rebuild cost this may impact on what is being repaired by skirt so I I I'm just really concerned that instead of getting the alignment that we needed we've actually accepted that we're it's not going to happen so can anyone just in very simple terms reassure me that skirt design process as is actually addressing some of these flooding issues because I mean I've got resolutions about the central city because I'm getting every day I start week notice for a new project in areas that got flooded and I'm not seeing any difference from what you know they're just pulling back as well as rather than what we should be putting back skirts mandate is to repair broken infrastructure as we as you as you state we're going through an optimization process which means looking at if the damage is not critical do we need to do it can we stress those assets in order to save money and that is going on it doesn't mean to say that we're not collaborating where the land drainage recovery work overlaps of the skirt project those those collaborations do have and do continue to go on but there will be less investment by skirt and stormwater work than was originally envisaged because of the the at if the defects are not critical they will be left and that will that will be that as an issue for up for legacy for the city but it's something that we have to realistically contain the rebuild within the funding available it just seems to me that the request that we've made which we the recruits we made was to change the parameters of skirt so that it didn't take the short term narrow view and actually leave us with a huge costly expensive legacy so we we haven't got back the recommendations we need to make to change the parameters in fact we've had the worse what we've had come back is to say we'll skirt have changed for the worse not further for the direction that we want so you know I'd really like us to move a recommendation and I would seek guidance from the chief executive and Amir as to how we might be able to do this but when our engineers are saying that they're incredibly concerned about what's being done I don to address us turn it on Oh Jane would you like to UM yes there have been discussions about the technical standards but the city hasn't accepted reductions in standards for the very reasons that you have I think outlining that we don't want to be late with a legacy so they're ongoing discussions there well the release the optimization process as you know is going on at the moment and we all know that there are challenges and trying to resolve some of these issues and it isn't just straightforward you know we don't agree or and it isn't a straightforward this is the way it's going to be you know like it's it is still being discussed at the moment so but the land drainage program hasn't done the scare program it's it's kept within Council but there are things that skirt is doing that definitely has an impact on on our on our blood land drainage program and went to the community meetings one of the really scary pieces of feedback that people were saying there there streets were being raised and so the water was running off into people's houses worse than it was before the earthquake so there's a pretty fundamental phone so can I can I suggest on that page on 159 that rather than pop completa there's actually something else that that we need to pop the signal that we have to keep looking at the sochi we can we go back up can we go back up the list of recommendations because I'm going to be the one moving this now because Phil clear waters had to go so come down to keep going right so instead of notes that council working with other agencies can you put request that council staff working so take out the word are through the and so Eden at the for council Ciera flood steering group can you put horizontal infrastructure governance group comma and then down report to it so take out to ensure environment of resources and actions put report to the next council meeting on the alignment well what what's the phrase on the on the alignment're all involved in a different way but it's really important that all of them report under vidual e to us all right David I just like to speak to 7.3 particularly given our financial position and procurement methods here we can be forty percent out on a have a forty percent increase in a pumping station in a short period of time it does consume me somewhat that they are estimations aren't their flesh air costings are their flesh and which we were in private enterprise we'd probably be out of business very quick as I speak the lean wasn't that flesh either but I'll get John to answer yesterday at the at the pre concept design phase there was a four point three five million dollar estimate with a confidence I arrangement around that plus 30 minus twenty it wasn't_''_454.92 that I think is the sort of a concept I struggle with our sort and another report somewhere where there are a whole lot of options and and there were estimations minus five up to plus thirty how can we how can think we need to be a lot tighter on our costings and it's just I struggle really with it with this broadband of estimation and then we invariably end up with a lot more cost and I think we should be nailing out our estimations or our quotations on these projects a damn sight better than we're doing at the moment because we're just wasting money I'm not uncommon in the industry to have that sort of confidence to live around an estimate at at a pre fees at a feasibility stage and again with its a series of events from the resource consent conditions the soundproofing the geotech yes we accept your point to me it's the first one and particular consumer they were three effective poverty 948 what is the criteria English an heir to define those location in the boundary of those affected a properties for example kashmiri oh my understanding between the number 21 12 to 36 and also the other in finder of the Princess Margaret Hospital let's also heavily slit situation restrictive assess more than once as a'm wondering how to define and all these the pangaean location the level three vulnerability areas all the numbers of there were based on the number of surveys that came back and those were from the people who didn't have flooding through their floors didn't have flooding under the floors but did have excess flooding so that's the ponding on the lawn ponding on the road which meant they couldn't get their car out couldn't get their carrier so their access was denied so it was the inability to actually move from your home to your place of work horse little business whatever else so that's how those we define those 948 understanding regarding to a cash reward no needs the kind of areas still quite a few people make a complaint arrest this issue to the council so whether these you know is within this mayor task of fraud force or is outside this is my particular concern whether is part of the reason level three I just think that this is going to be part of the next area of work where you know there is there is a significant range of issues that we're going to have to address and the task force was really focused on those people that were affected in the immediate sense and and to make sure that they their needs were addressed I mean when when we pass the resolution to have the two big engineering options go out for consideration I mean I attended both of those meetings as did fellow councillors and and the feedback was was well we're really pleased that you're you know putting all the effort and to do this work in two years but two years is too long I can't wait two years and that's why I still want to get a sense of urgency and it's what the task force has brought to the task has been that sense of urgency and we've got a lot of work done and that is going to make a difference but not to everyone and I still want to you know kind of focus our attention on the needs of those whose whose houses've done even with the temporary flood defence mechanisms that further work will be done on as a result of this report the question then is as you know what happens to those that who won't be protected in the long term you know should we be including that and so what I'm hearing from you is that the next stage around flood management defense and retreat as the work that we're directing the chief planning officer to undertake and report back to us Paul if John is just around the tempering neyo Christmas road and egg of the power in sidley place three hundred and forty thousand dollars and two hundred sixty five thousand dollars it seems like a huge amount of money and the power Stevie places and to me seems like a much bigger job and the trust gets Rome this crucial wanting the cost of doing that and actually the cost of the comparing two different areas and why there's a large difference yeah I can't go into the detail of the cost but a large part of that cost is the silvers considered a hazardous material because it's contaminated generalists cantera with wastewater and so they say she includes all the desalting of those gel and the dewatering and the management of that and the disposal that a sanitary landfill is a class a landfill site so this is expensive operation though they it makes some cheesy thanks um yani think you sort of a few more questions but um just in terms of I think is quite encouraging you haven't touched on it but I think it's important point just to go over which was the sub the new subdivisions how they perform the systems that were put in place it seems like you've come back in the conclusion is that they're not wasting flooding on in the mitigation of class when fully implemented I think there were some subdivisions like Morgan's valley where there was a lot of concern in the community but that doesn't come through in the findings so I just want to maybe if you just briefly reflect on do we need to do more work at looking but others yeah just talking about the the new subdivision site so that's driven by the surface water strategy the 2009 the 30-year strategy was developed where we start when we were putting on to the the developers a 50-year requirement for the design for that return period so that means half side effects are no worse than pre-development so therefore there's detention damns there's this it does infrastructure put in place there to manage quantity and quality of that water Morgan's Valley you there was some occasions where there was defects and in some cases and can't_''_885.22 be too specific on which ones you're referring to but at large most of them perform very well during that the during those events through march and april and I think that the demonstrates that our planning standards and the policy objectives we have actually are working to a large extent but doesn't mean to say that we don't get asset fails at the asset defects inundation with debris and tree branches and all sorts of things that contributed to some of those effects the hill subdivision that acquire I think Morgan's belly was certainly they were they were pre-existing issues there with that subdivision so I think that there is part of the land drainage their overall perspective I think will raise that specifically with them with the chief planning officer all right so so that that the resolutions now are receiving the the task force final report noting the work completed to date and thinking that the task force team and council staff and contractors for working to produce record outcomes approving an increase in funding noting the concern their request that relevant council staff reviewed the floodplain management options for the lower head cut for inclusion and the ltp working with other agencies to identify potential funding mechanisms and that for the temporary flood defence requesting the chief operating officer to incorporate the balance of the task force recommendations relating to maintenance I've ever done there and advise council of any shortfall and funding so that this be considered during the LTP process request the chief planning officer to undertake the further policy development work and been request the with other agencies to produce these reports to us and then the Dudley Creek options to be reassessed and reported back by the end of October that council staff urgently prepare a report on Central City flooding issues that council staff contacts scoot to inform them of that particular work in the central city and their council support the establishment of community club defense plans linking local community groups and organizations with metropolitan and civil defense plan so I think that's pretty universal is that around so yep typically take two week you want us to name all the agencies there now that doubt thou group so it's the horizontal infrastructure governance group there is a council Sarah flood steering group and there's an e can counsel storm water issues management group and we want all three of them all three groups about three separate groups to report to the next council meeting all right x given Y Annie um had a conversation with the chief operating officer I am looking at all right I'm just there's some concern about what the implications of that is around current projects that are underway so just to kind of give you that fear I don't know if Joan if you want to add anything but my concern is that the money's being spent now and we're not addressing the flooding I think the concern from staff is that essentially if we hold up these projects it will also cost us money so m and could add to delays so I just want to be really clear I think it's probably good to get some staff advice over this oh I'm pretty adamant from my point of view that allowing skirt to do the work now without knowing what the issues are seems pretty silly and we simply cannot afford to go back later when the curb and channels put in when the drain and just put in I just don't think we'll be able to afford it but I think it's important we hear from stuff on this issue my only concern that I didn't want us to sign up sign up to something we couldn't do wonder whether if in the second line we could sick and I'm coming from the perspective of projects underway it's all designed and have done it's really hard to seek alignment and cost efficiencies with her a major stoppage which is what you're saying but if we could seek alignment and cost efficiencies where possible that would that would you could you live with that I mean I'm like that big picture stuff because minus things most of the central city starts already been designed so I don't want skirt I want to be a can-do Council not a cart dude Council and I think what we've seen was skirt with the whole flood thing has been quite negative really that's let's be honest it's going the other way rather than the right way but I been shouldn't how other counselors in the mirror I think she people you keep referring to scooters if it's a third party we are a third of the governance group so actually bringing it up with the horizontal infrastructure governance group is council staff contacting skirt to inform them of the work that we have asked them to do on reporting on central setting flooding issues because they may in fact be in a really good place to help inform that that work so and it may be that if we if we if they're looking at it from from a you know the contract on the ground point of view then often you can find alignment and cost efficiencies if you if you focus your mind on it rather than not so I've got no problem with that I don't know that we need we are possible in there as we're asking them to seek alignment we're not directing alignment all right so on that basis I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carrying thank you very very much a substantial amount of group and the next item on the edge
There are still haven't sort of finished with some wearing of some amendments that I want to make which are really focused on making sure that we get we get reports back you know well that what I'm looking for is that as a timeline and it's not not the task books because the task force has now wound up but a timeline for the decision-making that needs to happen from here on so and that there is quite a lot of work still to be done so I've got an amendment for a follow-up piece of work as well also a good okay well you might even have what I'm looking for so so so let's say that Phil's going to move this all year yeah but there's another matter that needs to be dealt with too but there's good yeah so can you send your amendment through its on here who wants to second us so we can get this underway at Andrew right okay John would you like to take us through the report the George speaker off a lot better thank you so I'll talk softer okay so it's been it's a huge collaborative effort to get input from all parts of this organization from from strategy policy operations and had and that several departments involved we've had it through reviewed through Sarah and we've had several reviews through the consultants that have been engaged on it so it has been a big effort to try and get here and we do apologize for the delay and the short notice that you've had to consider the material if I could take you through the report itself and the report talks about the council strategy this is the surface water management strategy that was developed in 2009 that was a 30-year strategy for managing the water surface water across the city and sent out a whole lot of objectives about how that was going to be managed it talks about the effects of the earthquake series in 2010-2011 and in response to that the land drainage recovery program that was developed started to be developed in 2012 and which was meant to capital program to recover the city from the effects of the earthquake that was interrupted by a series of significant storm events that we haven't seen the like side for 30 years that gave it the urgency of course to establish the task force so this updates task force to and then we'll walk through the recommendations and then on to the costs next line now the surface water strategy that set out goals and objectives across the city about how to maintain flood storage and flow capacities development of ponding areas and and wetlands to limit further developments and high flood risk areas and to manage the effects of developments on flooding as well as improving ecosystem health support recreation as well as the drainage of objectives that we're looking to achieve and there was nine of those goals ranging from you know improved storm water efficiency and water quality etc next slide so to develop that we need to have some standards so the standards we work to in the city for the flat land is a one and five year return period so that one and five year event we use a one and twenty year event in the Hills because of the increased time of concentration of storm events on the steep slope so you do get more aggressive flows and in Greenfield areas we look toward a one and fifty years standard for development excluding stop banks which we don't welcome into the new developments we have a level of service target of point two five percent of dwellings in the city being permitted to flood in any one year and and the irony of that level of services that that wasn't breached in the series of events that we've just experienced so either we accept that where we come back and we revisit the level of service target because I don't think it's actually that tolerable from the community's perspective next slide so one of the earthquake effects we've had significant substantial tectonic movement as a result of earthquakes in the East we've seen land settlement of up to half a metre in the hills and on the estuary we've seen uplift now that changes the dynamics of the hydraulics and the way that water runs off the land and that's what we're trying to address this is hundred years of drainage design that's out the window we have to start from scratch about how the system operates and that's no easy task so that was the reason for setting up the land drainage recovery program a series of 63 investigations across the city to look at the effects of the earthquake and how do we recover from that next slide you so as I said the 63 projects initially sitting out with almost 10 million dollars worth of investigations that are underway and summer and have been developed like Dudley Creek is quite well advanced a lot of hydraulic modeling to understand how the flows now work and that's computer modelling to simulate how water water runs off the land they'll develop issues and options that will feed into capital works programs about how that recovery is then delivered and next slide please so in the task force we you've probably seen from the one being those folk who have been flooded in their homes through the habitable floor on at least two or more occasions since the earthquakes now that eliminates the effect of the extreme event which is a greater than 50-year event on match fifth and so that means that they've been flooded through their homes and what would be a normal event and which is quite high vulnerability and the next slide just shows you the numbers in each of those categories if it just advanced one more please out that's so about 77 in category level one we have 427 and vulnerability to that's where your homes have been flooded beneath the floor or at least once through the habitable floor since the earthquakes and 948 properties that have had access denied because of flooding on the roads on on their section so they can't get to school they can't get to work and so that's about 1500 people in all that's probably only part of the problem because when we start looking at the eqc numbers they have identified over almost council and its private insurers have got a much greater number of people who have been making insurance claims because of flooding don't forget that these numbers have been either identified by the task force members or they have been self reported by the people themselves next slide thank you so what are we done to date we've done quite a bit of work out there with temporary stop banks and clearing waterways and ease and beans and taking trees out of rivers removing obstacles and doing some Civil Works and some stop banks for example the next slide shows the work that we've undertaken commenced in teh street or the pump stations at the end of patrick street now that takes two thousand liters per second when it's completed it will take two thousand liters a second north to the Dudley diversion and that will relieve a significant amount of the the routine flooding that we've been getting there in recent recent months it's on track for a November completion and we hope to be able to use part of the pipeline early use of the 900 diameter pipe that goes up to the Dudley a'dope version one of the things one of the recommendations in the report is a request for additional funding now when we landed the concept design and put that two counts laughs the task force one we had a concept estimate of 4.3 5 million and we express the fair amount of confidence in that number and and I have to take responsibility for that since we have done the detailed design consulted with the community lodge the resource consents and have taken some more geotechnical work we have come up with a firmed up estimate of 6.1 million for the completed work which includes quite a substantial contingency because they're still risk related to the geotechnical certain ground conditioners that we were in there but there's there's really good good confidence in that number so that that work is proceeding and as we speak today and of course quite a lot of work in the building all other costs were due to the soundproofing that we had to put around the generator and't_''_586.84 for the noise that are generated next slide things another initiative that we had running early in June was a temporary skid mounted pump flood pump system that takes flood waters out of there flocked and drain and pumps that across into the Dudley Creek and we put a knife gate in the in that confluence so that there wasn't any back flow from the Dudley creek flowing back into the flop tenaria and that was worked effectively in June and we can deploy that system within four or five hours should we get an advance warning of a rain event coming up and we now have an operating standard operating procedure for the deployment of those skid mounted pumps they can move quite a lot of water next slide in the head clip we've been doing a lot of work in the river there's a lot of people saying that the rail PO and the constrictions and the channel are slowing down the water there are some habitat benefits from having wrapper in there and we understand the environmental benefits of the ecology and we we are putting the drainage requirements ahead of the the ecological ones just for the time being till we restore the performance of the network next slide we have a temporary stop bank that's been constructed an ebb tide street on south shore and that protects a lot from that tidal flooding or the king tides that come through there and on the next slide we've got an example of a culvert in the Dudley stream at guild street and you can see just by the side of the diameter of the pipe there under that concrete structure it is a constriction and so during high flows that becomes a dam and holds back the water resulting and flooding to the properties behind it so on the next slide we've taken that away installed a little footbridge and restores the channel to full capacity a similar constructions planned for Chancellor street we were again we're removing a undersized calvert in that case we're cul-de-sac in the road putting in a 2.5 meter wide pedestrian cyclist footbridge and we've consulted with the neighbors there and project and and they're if they're happy to see that work proceeded on the next slide we talking with the just some shots there of some of the work we've done and the channel works at removing vegetation removing obstructions from the stream trees etc and on the next slide removing tons of silt from box drains in this particular case in transcripts drain 600 millimeters of silt and accumulated in that form from liquefaction sources in the next slide we talk about littleton where the flood is quite different this is property to property flooding honest on steep terrain there's 89 houses we consider us a high priority there's some extra work continuing on on the littleton issue 138 homes with medium risk or medium priority for investigation and remedy and we're worth with building control because some of these are private issues that drainage this is how they deal with the water off their roof how they deal with the water off their driveways etc as well as how we deal with water off the roads and the culverts there so the are coming one more advanced and of course we'll do a little study looking at the private drainage issues across littleton and we've met out there with the residents we've had a walk around there on a Saturday morning and they've pointed out to us all of their concerns firsthand and we've got a fairly good understanding of the triggers there on the next side we talk about costs and at the moment work in progress or completed amounts to something like 10.7 million dollars which is currently funded out of the earthquake optics and the what was a set aside for the land drainage recovery work littleton we have yet to come up with some therm costs and we'll also have to look at what the operating costs in the land drainage area are at the completion of this work once we've got new assets and new regimes in place for the ongoing future management on the next slide we've talked about the pricing options for the lower heat cut 4.6 potentially 444 temporary or stop banks at some location of the strategic map making room for the river project so we're moving the stop banks further away from the rivers to provide sort of title coastal title areas and of course house defense and we've identified 186 vulnerability to about 12 ulnar ability one where you might have to do some sort of defense to the building because an area scheme doesn't provide for it and so whether that's an insurance or an eq c or how thats funded is yet to be is yet to be determined so that's yet to be decided the next slide of course is just the retreat option we've done some early work on that and we're going to look at refining some of those costs that we're looking again at the the Dudley option that was in the land drainage recovery program to incorporate not only option one option two which was the channel widening and the pump option I'm also adding a retreat option to that mix and on the other side doing a do minimum option if you wanted to maintain that might be so we've got a full range from do minimum to do quite a lot and they will look at the benefits and the costs and we're sharing information with eq c and the insurance industry to get a better handle or what the economic value of doing this workers because some of the insurance recovery costs the private insurers we're talking in the tens and tens of billions of dollars in their costs as well as what eqc have for increased flood-prone ability the next slide just took just lists the the recommendations that are set out in the report and I won't go through those you'll have those in front of you just now and just the last slide is just about what's we're underway with many of the measures we believe that a lot of the work we've done already has has improved to be the situation for at least sixty-five percent of the vulnerability one people and but there's still decisions to be made across the city on the longer term permanent measures as well as the presentation ends happy to take questions thank you um we hit the resolution up and you were better than we're going to add in yannis sort of got part of our brush and low I want a bit editor 7.6 but if I could have a bit when it's done because I haven't finished that on right so equations Pauline when it was a real whirlwind tour for your not crack in a canoe just on all the work that we're doing to clean dudley in the dredging and pulling out the the the junk out of the creek what have we got left to do in the initial program that's not involving stage two which is the proposed widening of the whole song but and the remediation part is you much leaf to do in the temporary works for the Dudley a lot of that has already done so we've got the temporary the temporary pumps we've got the taste street under way we've pulled out of thousands of tons of liquefaction silt and we're looking at private Bridget getting the bridges out of like a some of those are compromised so those are still to be done some private bridge issues but we're not talking about this the option one which is the big channel we're talking major construction resource consents as what's in the back in my mind is there any chance that that the first stage of a media affirmation we can actually prevent the flooding that we've had see any chance of that it Karen tested yes it can't well it was tour tested in june that will not prevent the similar result that we got on the fifth of march which is a greater than one and fifty year event it won't be enough it won't be enough to do the one and fifty but the question the in comes back as what is the level of service that we're going to be happy to live with right then that's so that's the discussion I'll sorry Ali sorry I'm busy watching the amendments going up on the screen over here so you looking at so apologize don't a living a look on page 161 there's talk about the preferences for non engineer options four point eight point three missions repair once insurance approach and I just I've cooling I've been talking to several constituents who are in situations where their houses were damaged in the quakes but they've also got damaged from the flooding and there's some disconnect between those two things and with a couple of cases particularly we've found that the alignment between the insurance companies Android eqc and you know with regards to those repairs we've just come said the insurance companies dealing with the flooding and eq c is dealing with the room land end with the house that was under when what's your experience of front from work you've done with the community on that yeah the risk frustration about lining up all the various agencies the bank's the insurers eqc the building control and the flood response and that hasn't been resolved yet we are trying to work collaboratively with the eqc and the time is of the essence here because once CQC have the declaratory judgment they have an option a to go ahead and write checks for ife to affected ife customers and and once they start doing that the opportunity for collaboration was gone so we need to be very clear about how we can collaborate what area-wide schemes will benefit the community and bring benefit to the insurance but they want confidence that those measures are going to be effective because they don't want to give us the money put in a flood defence system that then fails and their back they have an exposure again so it needs to be a comprehensive agreed piece of work that we all have confidence and the outcome I'm wondering whether we should take the 5.3 1.2 and almost like tuna turn to a resolution so that there is some you know specific direction from the council essentially that the scope of the physical works for Dudley Creek options one and tours presented during the meeting this is the 27th could match 14 on page 165 is 5.3 1.2 so Dudley meeting where the two large you know large-scale engineering works were put up and it says that they need to be reassessed in light of the task force research in the short term a short medium term works ieva taste Street pump station and ungentle works and maybe what we need to do is actually pull that out as a resolution of the council to to basically say that the council wants to see this those two options now reassessed and light of task force research and the short term short medium term works either taste treat pumps and antenna works and report back to report back to the council with a timeline that specifically identifies when we are going to you know when different things are going to happen what we're trying to do is create some certainty for people who are living with uncertainty and it I felt that within the report there was part of what we were looking for but it wasn't reflected in the resolution and you know because requesting the chief planning officer to undertake the further policy work you know sort I just don't think that that's giving people the certainty about what we're going to do I think that having a specific resolution on flop turn Dudley as a good idea not because they are the only affected area but because they are the most affected area they represent fifty percent of those vulnerable or increase flood Vanar ability as if you see of defined er that they have an hour definition of increased flood vulnerability is different from eq sees they only look at the residential land and they are only measuring up from the lidar readings and I think that we measure from really the fact that they flood now and they didn't flood before the earthquakes and largely that dates back to when the Dudley division we in turn so it's kind of an irony that we've had to put in a pump to get to the Dudley diversion now as part of the response to the flood damage but the flood and the earthquake damage hasn't just been about damage to the land that's been damaged to the's been damaged with all of the you know structural impediments to flowing you know water flowing out of the area and it's gathered it's become you know they refer to it as a basin and that's truly become there and actually the report makes very clear that one of the very stressful things for people living in this area particularly is not only the flooding itself when it happens but the prospect or three should be flooding every time the sky does every time it rains yeah yeah and that was certainly the most powerful moment for me when I heard and this was before I became the mayor you know that when a mother said to me my child doesn't fear that youth quakes she fears the rain so yeah so can we get some wording well the council would like to see that the Dudley well why didn't just call them the Dudley Creek options would like to see the Dudley Creek options don't refer two options one and two referred to in paragraph 5.31 so take out the point to that sort of timelines would it be reasonable to ask for that report back to be by the end of sep tember because we're not asking you to make the final report back but in terms of giving us that sense of you know that when will you be in a position to give us a time frame around the decision-making it's it's not so much the decision making but the time frame around the decision making we need to set some timelines yeah my sound yeah well we have to get through a procurement hurdle it's a conversation I've actually had with Tom who was leading the the the land range recovery program today so to go back and reassess the options and put in the additional ones and come back with a comprehensive report in four weeks it's a tall as a tall task but what about what about coming back with a time frame for doing their work we did want to have this completed in the earliest possible time frame preferably for the end of October before each you see their option a okay October might be more realistic so if I said the end of October and reported back to council by the end of october I think that's achievable you okay le just one more question with regards to the declaratory judgment on the work that's going on before that can you just clarify for me John how the work that we're doing now will still be relevant and may not be affected too much or even at all following the ink you see declaratory judgment as far as funding goes for example options available to homeowners are you able to yeah well as far as eqc are concerned the balls in our Court the idea is that they will go ahead but their option to get the declaratory judgment on their assessment of how to distribute the funding for increased flood-prone durability and their preferred path is to simply write 9,000 checks and but they will change tack if we come up and say here is a comprehensive approach to how we kind of we can mitigate a large wide area of the community that's that's a sort of conference we need to give them that confidence fairly early and I would suggest october november as our window of opportunity otherwise that that that disappears your judgment won't necessarily allow for that well it's asking for a judgment on mechanisms by which they can be paid but doesn't eqc actress strict as far as area-wide mitigation for example guys I'm just wondering whether dubba dubba the difficult the difficulty is is that I mean I don't think that we should regard ourselves as restricted by the eqc payment I think that the government will be willing to talk to a council about you know some sort of cost sharing arrangement we have provisions and other legislation that enables us to do that so I wouldn't I wouldn't feel bound by it but I agree with John that it is a timing thing that we should aim to fall you know sort of before thee for the declaratory judgment the and very small cases I mean this is the trouble eqc wasn't set up for a government scheme and place and it has encouraged to high level of insurance that other areas hit by disaster just seven simply haven't had so although you know I respect the fact that people have had real challenges dealing with EQC better to be dealing with Ben then not dealing with them by not having that degree of coverage the but I think that one of the prob one of the issues in terms of the way they've dealt with us in the past has there been relatively small lens lips and they've got all of the owners to agree that the money be put into remediating the lens rather than pay out individually and I don't think people realize how little people get by way of payout when you think of the restrictions on the land cover the land cover is only the land under the house 8 meters around the land under the driveway you know we learned it all off by heart a few years ago and unfortunately or it's the minimum section size or it's the cost of repairing and that's the legislative restriction which is why I don't think we should think of ourselves as restricted by the eqc land damage or land repair requirements of their legislation yani it's one of it first okay thank you for the work that you've done I know you've done a huge amount of work and you'd almost known as the John Mackey task force but that's okay thank you for coming up with the idea to start with and I think it's it's been a really good approach I just want to get an understanding for the people that had their houses lowered into a flood risk area and the issue to do with not needing consensus with foundation work where we got to work that issue so that people who are looking at repairs going forward don't have their houses lowered have we made any produce around that we have been discussing that with Peter Sparrow and building control and of course the the building consent issue for for waving the building consent requirements was was done an order this unfortunate outcome that they don't need a consent so it doesn't trigger the requirement to raise the house to the 50-year floor level all that you're under the district plan so could I move like an amendment or an additional resolution that we require a consent for any foundation work for houses that are in the new flood management areas no because it's unenforceable if you move that amendment we kind of force them so how do we like how do we program I I'm just really concerned it's one of the reasons why we've joined as the as a as a party to the eqc declaratory judgment precisely for that reason and your example is precisely the example that sir now counts away for David which is great but I guess I mean I thought there was a joint kind of working great with eqc insurers bankers yeah government in B etc have they not come up with any short-term so immediate solutions to stop this kind of unquestionable thanghat now it just seems a really really strange that you know _''_1907.419 and surely mb would think that this would would be an issue and is it nothing we else we can do well we all share that concern and we've had a lot of discussions but the insured don't see it as irresponsibility that's not a lot of part of their insurance contract with it with their customers to do that work it's not a requirement over the building act the way that's work that was the reason we've tried to look at other options for house raising to us there's people but there is no easy solution or any quick solution
Ok the next item on the agenda is supplementary reports the resolution to include supplementary reports I know that some colleagues are not heavy with some of the some of them or all of them so I'm intend to take them separately so if we can have all of the all of the supplementary reports listed so so I'll deal with them as a b c and d D is the public excluded item of land acquisition so the first with this one is and I'll movers and I was looking for Bucky back the second death but she's left the room though just anyone want to support the supplementary reports Ellie Jones to second so a as Klaus 20 storm water and flood protection update be as report of the chairperson of the earthquake recovery Committee of the Whole meeting regarding the trans-pacific partnership agreement see as Clause thirty-two engaging with the community on the matters raised and the Cameron partners report and Klaus 33 as public excluded land acquisition so I'll deal with them separately so that's moved l0 verbum Mia seconded but so you can pop moved and seconded at the top so it'll be for all of them so and but I'll take each one of them separately and okay so I'll start off with Klaus 20 is there any comment about cause 20 David yeah I'm going to come in to bear claws 20 and and the other supplementary as well look we've gone through several meetings and luck in the last few months and on every occasion we've had a supplementary report that generally arrives the night before or the day of the meeting I think it's totally unacceptable and I even look on today's agenda where we have item 19 which has been withdrawn and it's next to me of stuff just making a provision and the agenda for something that they can know that was me that withdraw it so please don't well I mean it wasn't_''_165.04 a maybe it wasn't available either oh no it was it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't what it wasn't what it wasn't not in a position to bring to counsel well a point being I think that we just get far too many reports that arrived on the day or the night before the meeting and I'm going to vote against all the supplementary is today that's yeah I understand that and and I don't know if the chief executive would like to say a few words because I know that she feels well I know I can't make a notice of motion but I quite willing to put a notice of motion forward to the next meeting that that any item that doesn't meet the deadline for the dispersion of the agenda be not be deferred to the next meeting unless there is some absolute urgency there's financial implications of such for the council so unless that's sort of all do that at the next meeting of need be unless the staff advised me that this message would okay system MP if I could respond to that so I agree with you at some poor process and disrespectful to have late agenda items and for the way that happens they're not excuses so we've been talking with group around we will put in a process whereby we won't fit late agenda items that they will be deferred until the next meetings that may mean that at times we don't meet the requirements in a specific requests of the council meetings so we'll try wherever we can to make sure that we meet those but if they're not up to standard and if they're going to be late will we will I would defer those or by exception and when the exception is around the specific criteria exit closed so just speaking in favor of accepting this particular item on this particular occasion I admittedly I had seen the draft and I did think that others had received the draft so I'd already read the draft paper but all of the detail that's and the substantial appendices which probably was the thing that sort of annoyed councillors the most to receive the day before our items that councillors have had before what the what the first were raised in the actual document itself the storm water and flood protection update and and I'm very keen for us to deal with us today so that we can infect and struck staff to get on with the next iteration as it were which which incorporates not just the balance of the work to be done recommended by the task force but actually pulls out the you know actually increases that the focus or speeds up the focus on the longer term solution particularly for the flop turn area because they represent fifty percent of the of the flooding risk issues that have been affected by increased vulnerability to flooding so I recommend that we accept this paper even though I also agree with the chief executive unless there is an exceptional reason we should not accept late items for the agenda le the risk of sounding facetious I just want to reduce what you're saying because actually no but I want to add two things I want to add to that the reason that I've second alarm happy to on this occasion as I couldn yesterday afternoon and evening therefore I had the time to read through the stuff last night so actually was an exceptional circumstance that led me to be able to read the stuff normally I wouldn't have had a chance so I'm dead that we're doing something about it shut up all right so I'll no jaani yeah I just want to concur with the sentiments that counselor Easter's raised I just think the squatting is a really important piece of work and there's a number of questions that some of us may have and so to have it two days before the meeting makes it incredibly difficult to get answers to seek further information and here there's actually a number of things related to local community board areas that we've had no chance to discuss with our local community boards about whether or not it's something they agree with whether we've missed anything up now I don't want to take away from the work that the task force has been doing and I certainly think it as important that really uncomfortable you know if you look at the meeting tomorrow where I think we organization received the report on the first of August from the minister and we didn't get it until two days ago either it just there's something not right with our systems and we definitely need to improve so you know I'm happy to accept the flooding because I know how important is to go through that we may face you know at any time but you know I do think we need to get a lot smarter and sharper and I think information needs to come to us a lot sooner as elected members so I there's other ones in here that I will not support because I cannot see the urgency the flying task force I do see the urgency and I'm have to support today all right when I put the motion for Klaus 20 all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the second one is Klaus 31 which relates to sorry the the report of the chairperson of the earthquake recovery would like to accept responsibility for this one being laid when I asked for the meta to be dealt with at the council meeting I actually thought that I was referring it to the NIT to the council meeting that the aircar agenda would be on you know the minutes would be on and so I made the mistake of saying the next council meeting so it was Russian up as a the seventh of august so it was completely my mistake I thought that I forgot that the first council meeting of the month was the community board one so I made a mistake so if if councillors would just accept that the only way that that the council's resolution could be resolved was by a reporter a special report of the chairperson regarding the trans-pacific partnership agreement it's a it's a half page letter from local government New Zealand about what their position is which is all we asked to be referred here it is exactly the same report that went to the aircar meeting and it gave an opportunity for the proponents of the't do it the aircar meeting so if people would accept them the addition of clause 31 on that basis then I'd be very grateful so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's cari in Clause thirty-two engaging with the community on the measures raised on a parent partners report there are a number of amendments which we are going to make Tibet to address some of the concerns that have been raised the intention of this was simply to officially receive the Cameron partners report as we have had a public release of it and requests that we get a briefing on different options for releasing capital and from ccajoleas and requesting staff to prepare information for the purpose of engaging with the community on issues I've already announced that we commence the engagement process some on the fourth of September this was simply to to you know formerly receive the report and to request staff to get on with developing that engagement plan but I understand that people have you know different a different view on that I'll make to the reason to the recommendations when we get to them yeah but Yanni thank you um I think the intent of this is fine but actually I'd like to move that at least a foot we've got a special extrordinary council meeting tomorrow I can see no reason given that amendments are going to be made that we couldn't deal with us tomorrow and have a chance to have you know maybe some questions of staff look at the amendments and see whether we can be more satisfied but III can't see any reason why this needs to be dealt with today rather than tomorrow so I'd like to move that this you can't move something when it's already been moved and seconded so you're David can't_''_758.11 so vote against it and signal that if the vote against is carried I'd like to move I mean I thought I could move an amendment but yeah I'm afraid that it can't_''_770.079 be moved to the all tomorrow's agenda so it's only been't add items to the agenda and that way but this was all then how did this get 10 gingers a day I mean it wasn't advertised as part of this okay so my understanding of the local government and I appreciate the staff advice is that you can actually add things and I don't quite know with extraordinary meetings there just seems odd but ok well I'm happy to vote against us today I think that we need time to actually go with amendments I can see no urgency for this and I'm not happy to receive it at such short notice Andrew yeah I spent the whole day yesterday in a corolla on banks peninsula was out of mobile coverage for at least three or three and a half hours the day he saw this for the first time when I got home yesterday evening after seven o'clock it's the sort of thing that naturally I would wanted to discuss possibly at length with colleagues and certainly don't feel that I've had the opportunity to do this again I see see the value in getting things done but on this one in particular I think there's a need for more time to perhaps ask questions discuss with colleagues and so on before we can consider it today so unfortunately I can care with concur with counsel yawns not be voting against receiving strong okay of my one speech of the day I don't see any problem with this is it's very technical we've had the report we've communicated to the public what we're planning to do it all we're doing is actually asking see CHL to get on with their advice and come back to us so that we can actually have a public conversation in full for those who think they haven't had enough time to consider this we've been looking at the camera and report for six months and we've had numerous briefings and I can't see why people want to hold it up any further Jamie yeah just just briefly on that one you know out of all people you know I've been out of weeks the reason why I'm comfortable with us now coming back is that it it's it's nothing nothing earth-shattering for us you know we've been going through the chemin partners process for it so long you know I it's ingrained in me so this is really just saying we're progressing what we said that we would progress there's nothing earth-shattering there there's not a heck of a lot that needs to go into it so I see it more of a formality than anything else so I am comfortable with that and I've had probably as little time as anyone well I'm well I would ask counselors to support this paper being considered today all it does is received the camera and partners report essentially which is the one report that we haven't officially received yet although we've publicly launched it we I made a statement to the people of Christchurch with the full support of council not that everyone you know feels comfortable with with the different options that we have to now consider we haven't down and in fact my viewers is that the sooner we can engage with the general public with these issues because they're challenging issues and I think that people have actually really appreciated the fact that we've been really open about our financial situation we haven't tried to hide anything we're not trying to you know pretend that we're in an easy situation and the feedback that I've had from people and this is from the community and from the business sector so it's not a either or is that people have actually really appreciated the fact that we're treating them with with the degree of respect that I think they felt they haven't had before so you know but as I say it isn't it isn't a requirement for us to do this we don't have to sign off on this in order to proceed with a with what is a preliminary engagement but I would have thought that we would like to have official resolution on our books that we've received the report and that then generate a report from cch oh about what options they see for releasing capital that doesn't necessarily mean that they are going to come up with the conclusion that I referred to us one of the options that would definitely be on the table and I've only put it out there as an option on the table because you know some people think that that it is exactly the same to sell an individual asset as it is to sell down a shareholding within the holding company on the basis that you do so for the strategic benefit of the city as a whole and people want to have this conversation so it doesn't stop it from happening by holding up the debate on receiving the report this is not endorsing the report this is not determining what the outcome will be but asking see CHL to get on with some of the work on setting out the options they're already doing some of that work to be honest they don't actually need us to do so I would just like us to have you know it really is a two-page document I don't think that it it deserves to be held up but you know if people vote against that they vote against it and we'll have to deal with it on the twenty-eighth which is one week before we release the discussion document I don't know why Ellie can I just make a comment to write related to what you've just said and looking at what the document lien or rather the recommendation says it makes clear that it's recommended the council received department Cameron partners report I do wonder whether there is a little bit of undies maybe at what follows that which is why they're going to be changed but I can't I'm sorry for ya can't change no no no that's fine unless we're going to debate them yes I want to maybe if I tell people what I until needs today I intend to remove the reference to up to 400 million I intend to change the reference and 4.3 from Cameron partners report to financial challenges that it reads requests that the outcome of that engagement be used to inform the development of the draft 2015 25 long term plan so so I think we'll just go straight to a vote on there on the on the voting thing so all those in favor priest yes all those that pose press know that's carried so we will deal with that matter and then the last item as a public excluded metra on land acquisition so I'll just put that one straight I'll put that all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried
And thank you Michael for coming on much appreciated and for everything else will move back to item number 22 the application to 2014 15 metro and especially response fund which is a related matter and Thor would like to move that seconded by Andrew Turner are there any questions or Jimmy only the part under social worker the 32 thousand dollars plus there's how many hours a week is a yearly basis in my right this celery study 2030 you get it versus okay yes yes homecoming hours well we have to see the caliber of the person we get to fit in with the funding r we've got I guess so I can't give you a definitive answer about that we will also be utilizing some of our own existing staff yes we intend to take a holistic approach to the social worker also that if budget advice is needed for this family can't our existing counselor can do that if there's drug and alcohol issues our existing service which was quite considerable can do that so we haven't settled on exact staff supporting it yes part time position is because we we know that the city mission is very used to working with compass complex cases across a lot of agencies shall we know that though it's a part-time position there'll be a lot of collaboration with other social winters then other team and other agencies to make it all work so we feel reassured a bit okay thank you Yanni yeah I'm given that this is it for one part-time position made some operating cost is about the same amount that we fund the tenants protection association at work across the city how how have you come up with the justification for that quantum of 53,000 it seems like a huge amount of funding given our financial pressures and context of other groups that we fund to do similar work well in terms of other organizations we are only contributing Thunder for example the cleaners protection in other subgroups we not be only funding so the amount that we give the innocent all of these services and hence the visitors one hundred percent of the operating costs work and we and we know that about this organization and that it meets the outcomes of the strengthening community strategy as Pierce to start to be very good value for money their families that my understanding is that the families will not be able to be self-reliant and make a goal of a new home without the kind of professional support supplementary in terms of I would have thought that MSD or housing New Zealand should be contributing as well are they contributing nothing to this position and already course thing I was that we go to for ongoing support of this we're going to work with the city mission to work with MSD I think what staff we're trying to do in working with the city mission and the clear direction was to get this up and going as fast as humanly possible and set it up in a way that would succeed for really from this point of view it's about getting it off the ground getting it set up so and get that and put into and support those families and get them basically get on and try and set this up on a sustainable ongoing basis whether that's contribution from us or from other government departments or whatever but the urgency and why we probably we could probably take another six or eight months and go down that track but there's six or eight months with people not in three flats so the staffs drive was let's get this up and running and set it up for success and then continue to work to put it under the context the wider context that is so important for Christ you really want us just to announce it as he missed evening asked for funding and have they said no no not at this stage I'm Vicki hey that this initiative arose from the City Council seeing the issue of housing and particularly of kids living in places where they should never be living in our town and because we want to do something fast we actually came to the Housing Committee the Housing Committee looked at actually initially we were looking at 200,000 from the city council housing fund to make this happen the government then very quickly in the space of the phone call said we will contribute half of this which is great in terms of our grants I think it's fantastic that we are aligning grants money to the objectives of the City Council and one of our key objectives has to be getting kids particularly but everyone into a warm dry house and not having them live in circumstances that are just not okay I don't know if you do but I get a hell of a lot of phone calls from school principals and all sorts of people who have got families who are just breaking apart under the stress of housing and so the point of this was a tiny little move it doesn't solve very much at all but it gets something under way there was a building that was empty the city mission were incredibly responsive to doing something about that and I think the important signal that it sends is that if we all act together like the city mission the City Council the government and any we can make some gains in the current or full housing situation that we have so I'm delighted that our grants money is going into something that actually helps people with real needs to get out of the situation that they're in I'm delighted that our grants money actually aligns with the whole objectives of the council I think it should do a great deal more of that and I'm delighted that staff have been amazingly effective as has the city mission and making this happen so I don't have any concerns about what we're doing here at all totally in favor of it I fell then Paul look I want to endorse Vicky's comments just now to you and I want countless know there is a former social worker this it to me is a very good example of social work being joined up with the agencies and it's got in terms of social services it's never idea we know that however with this project is for people at for mothers and children particularly from all ethnicities who are among going to need some in social work and put there's no question there I applaud I applaud the project I think it's really good use of the metropolitan fund and I think it's a good part as a joined-up solution for thank you sir yeah Paul yeah I think a community that we want to live in the community that looks after each other and I think the council leading that says you're really good thing and I think the that the huge social cost to the issues we see in our city our offices around housing and for us to give a small contribution will get a social rebate back and having a better place to live for these people and I'm really really supported with us clean you think you're quite strong on this because I guess for me this is a real litmus test for our recovery if we actually don't house or make attempts to house those who are homes I just wonder how much meaning we have I've been quoted in some interviews saying you know this have all the flash projects you like which you can but actually this is about Maslow's hierarchy of needs you're not housing people what have we here for what's it all about so I'm sorry but this is not just another group oh yeah I totally endorsed the fact that housing excuse me as incredibly important I have said that that should be a top priority for our city for a long time pretty much since the earthquakes occurred so I totally endorse doing things in the housing space to deal with the chronic crisis that we have but housing there's just one part of it we just heard at the Housing Committee the other day the mental health statistics and we heard that they are constrained within the same services that they paid without any extra funding so you know it's just not a sustainable model to keep putting funding into a massive problem and I appreciate we have to try make a difference where we can so I will support this but I think we need to be really upfront that there like rent stabilization which hasn't happened yet their evolution of leading fees which create financial hardship for people would make it difficult for people to move or actually make it difficult for people to get housing I warrant a fitness I don't want people living and unhealthy houses and what are we seeing happening in our city with things like asbestos things like dust things like lack of insulation and energy efficiency measures there are a number of other things we also must do as a city and as a council I think we need to be advocating for those as well all of it together will help address the major problem that we have I do hope that this role that can actually make a difference I do hope that it can be extended to work with others who may not be able to be in this complex but maybe having issues around housing there are a number of groups that are actually working in the housing field within our city who are trying to find housing and supply there's really one of the chronic issues massive issue as the affordability so you know I'll support this but again I raised the point it's it's not sustainable for council just to keep funding new services new projects in our financial situation that we're in without getting supportive government without getting some regulations around some of the other critical factors that are contributing to this problem and so it has to be a joint up approach and we do need more work done I think to deal with it rather than just us being the funder that has to pick up the pieces time and time again that's okay there any other Queens I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie thank you very much and thank you for all of your hard efforts right across the board
I've got this in the right order item number 23 23 so and then we'll go back to item 22 right so we have a recommendation on on the table as there well it's this perhaps if you'd like to brief us first on the on the paper and then we'll ask questions and then we'll seek to consider the resolution and well good afternoon we come here today with this proposal after working with the city mission to see how the Christchurch City Council could support ended reform urgency housing needs in Christchurch and so the proposal today is to refit the old city mission building with two flex upstairs and one downstairs to provide emergency housing with approximately seven bedrooms so this is indeed a combined proposal because as you can see from the report the government through mb have indicated that they will contribute a hundred thousand dollars towards the proposal and thirty eight thousand nine hundred and seventy one from the social housing fund towards the configuration of the old city mission building additionally and the following report is a worker through the metropolitan descriptive discretionary fund and also we're looking we're recommending that we consider through the ongoing operational funding for this project through the next twenty fifteen twenty five LTP process to address housing emergency housing needs and sustainable way and we're also saying that staff continue to work with the city mission and we have our city mashallah michael bourn and here with us today to investigate the potential of additional ongoing contribution towards this project by the Ministry of Social Development so I think the project is fairly explanatory about what we're seeking to do and as I said it's been a delight to be working with the city mission ending be on this project well I mean I'll just add to that myself not with a question but simply to say that you know if we were looking for an example of the collaborative partnership that we've said is so vital for our city to recover then this would be a fantastic effort council city mission and government working hand-in-hand_''_182.659 so I'm absolutely thrilled about that Glen this this model this way of working and I'm also delighted that the government in the context of this which came from the Housing Committee has now come forward and said that they there's an RFP at the moment for 40 emergency accommodation units so I'd like us all pleased to see this in the context of that yeah it's all part of that it's like this is not only about three it's excavator yeah Phil and thank you for the report and in the idea certainly and working in a partnership appeals a lot I think to us as counselors but I just wanted to clarify around the ongoing nature of the program so that involves a support worker and is that funding and that's a clearly at a new different role for Cal for council and I'm support cover but I'm just clarifying about the funding for that is that sort of part of the operational costs which would be would go to the Metropolitan discretionary fund or is it quite presuming I'm presuming a separate application going a separate application counselor clean water and it's some of the next report that we can address and the immediate good like we're going to go backwards to know 22i on 22 yea yea big Gianni I think you I don't I don't think anyone would disagree that obviously emergency housing is really important what I can't understand those given that the government are going out for an hour to pay for 40 units why we're funding just like couldn't couldn't we actually have government maybe we could give a contribution that government should actually be reimbursing us bullet if they're going to go and pay private people for motel rooms as we heard the other day then why wouldn't they be paying for this as well and why should we be paying for it given a huge financial situation that we're in it just seems a bit strange to me so I just like to understand why or what works being done around actually government paying for the cost of this well I don't know that staff both want to respond to their and in David's got his hand up as well so I had two other questions but I'll kill that one first yeah so but he then they started from the crashed ship City Council asking City Mission what's happening with your old building that doesn't seem to be being used in the city mission being incredibly responsive today so actually this was going to be funded entirely by the crashed ship see council because we know their need for housing and just the issues that we face every day in their area the government came on board with half of it in the spirit of the housing accord and so actually this predates the the government's second announcement and I guess one of the things that would be really helpful to know because I need to tell them later this afternoon is a witness will be open and is it adaptable enough such that if the next tranche deals worth mostly women and children that this can be used for other groups I'm probably looking at Michael click have a really energy for this project and we would like to be open as soon as possible so we've already lined up contractors on the off chance and we think that possibly at about six weeks time it may not have it going certainly the people are waiting to get in in the other issue about using it if it wasn't used for so any in a year's time for example if or six months or whatever if we find another project that deals with women and children and that that area is say diminishes could this because they're just units I'm assuming that they could be used for guys for currently living on the street as well yeah we'd be reluctant to extend too much our mission to street people we feel that we have quite a history and to cover in quite an area with 30 men and the night shelter and we're looking at extending our women's night shelter and we are concerned it actually that the the community need isn't for those people quite as great choose the lifestyle they lead and most of the people that are being talked about being housed who are street people have in fact had numerous opportunities through us and other agencies like ours anyway okay so I certainly open to any variation that's been the mission strength that we are able to respond okay so I can tell them minister that you'll be open up toga the first yeah that we certainly hope we will you have an aspiration thank you thank you thank you very I'm Dean thank you just very quickly I think just in response to yannis questions there is Vicki said sequentially we'd already gone down this path before the government came forward with their RFP and the other part is is a sense in which I think we have to show out but our contribution and if we wait this up over and against the 40 that they're doing I think our contribution actually is you know quite small so that wouldn't be my yeah oh yeah knee thank you um okay I mean I don't probably understand the difference between the government paying private people to provide those and paying us who have got a huge financial problem but that's okay I just the second question I had was my understanding was too far or ematter we're having to move and this was one of the locations that they were going to move and I just wanted to know what was happening with Safari War II Marsha which is a I mean we're being asked to fund a service to deal with these families tafari as a service that deals worth a lot of people in this local community and I just wanted to understand where they if they fit into this play and if it impacts on them where things are at with their their premise which I understood they were possibly needing to leave at some point yeah the mission is running at quite a deficit when we're looking at trying to rationalize the building's we own so we are selling tafari Roy motor well over a year ago we signal this to them and offered them use of project they chose not to accept that they have applied for funding through various agencies and have actually made an offer on their house to us the fundings still very tricky we're trying to support them in met but we've supported them really substantially for well over 300,000 over the last 15 or so years we feel we can't_''_627.07 do that in your longer to the same level but they were offered the building some time ago and they show um you know in terms of this this project is in terms of them did the kind of emergency nature of the housing how long will these units be available for people to stay at nazeera kind of time Lamas or what's the plan for I guess having people be able to access it and then move move on the government the Ministry of Social development's project requires them to move on in eight weeks we think that's absolutely unrealistic given the availability of low-cost rental at the moment we are looking at perhaps three month with flexibility within that but the instruction that to constantly talk about this being transitional that is not their permanent home and to that end too while it will be warm safe environment it won't be a luxurious environment and I think from choice most families wouldn't want to live in that particular locality I'm David now thank you look I support the initiative I just really wanted to make a question of stuff really the housing fund a how much is in it and be what is the impact to other uses of their housing fund and our own housing stock by utilizing 38 thousand dollars of their funds all right so the current they wants of the housing fund is 21 million and we believe that the current housing strategy does include emergency housing provision and for the contribution from the housing fund of 38,000 971 dollars to how to provide seven bedrooms for emergency housing as good you for money thank you very good all right so would someone like to move that clean seconded by Vicki so any discussion clean our sorry yonni um I'll support this I do appreciate the city mission I think it's really important that we do get emergency housing put in place some of us have been saying that the housing crisis has been with us for a long time at least over almost two years so it's finally good to see some progress being made on what is a very important issue if I have one concern it's that as a council we can't continually just keep giving out money for projects and not getting an income back particularly around housing when you think about how much money has been put into housing how much money people are making from housing in our city at the moment and when we can't financially just keep throwing money into this purple that getting something back so I hope in future we can really look at these partnerships as a way of actually generating some revenue even if it doesn't cover fully the cost although ideally it should there would be really important that we you know we just can't keep running at a deficit particular with our current financial be well used I'm sure it's well needed and I wholeheartedly support the partnership approach that Phil and look I thoroughly support the hot the whole project there's no question there I guess I am concerned to do in about 24 Martin I clearly we want as counseling one of those discussions with them to be productive and I'm sure they we want a good outcome reason I'm concerned of course is that we know that temporary motto have been in the whole approach as a community development organization is to prevent people requiring emergency housing and they've done a lot of work in the in the housing housing area themselves so I'm very supportive and I certainly want to support to city mission in and finding way forward to I guess ensure that tafari matter also have a accommodation and I know that stuff that started I'm pleased with that that process already started Michael thank you all right I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know it scary thanks very much
Second I sonam the ginger and the first part a requesters for the gifting of landfill reserved person purposes at 160 bone fail Avenue and would you like to move that bill and seconded by Andrew so would you like to speak to that is I think it's a win-win for council and for the family and as notably we would like to write to the family to thank them for such a good offer that yeah that's a win for everybody there was some discussion around what would be the best process around purchasing it but it does look like there is money available when a fund for making strategic land purchases and it just helps to complete the provision of tracks in public access around barbell belly so you know it hurts you to support it and could we could we just comment the staff were most willing to encompass within their current and dropping budgets and the extra lean that was being in being bought and without causing the coin to counsel in the additional cost we appreciated the staffs commitment that's great all say aye don't push a no that's scary and now we move on to the item 2.1 the notice of motion and I did after the word disability be removed is that possible just to use the word accessible rather than disability yeah school yeah can we can we just put that out so who's going to move their fill second up by Andrew right so would you like to speak to their Nomad no there no yeah I'm if you were on the spade new community board to be bored witless by my frequent ranks rents about disability accessible and you can expect more resolutions along similar lines to be coming helene mountain ER and I on the spreading his keyboard 22 to the way through an assessment of all the dis ability card packs in our ward most of which one fault or another and one of which we can praise with a whole heart and that's Newworldson Matins but the rest of them including city council car packs so either obstructed have been recently painted over are in the wrong place but rebuild there are many two and three-story buildings that are inaccessible for people with disabilities they are inaccessible for both employment and for accessing services they include buildings that are familiar to you like the Red Cross where I did a workshop this morning that organization cannot employ disabled people nor can it have service disabled people because the premises are two story without access many of our streets are full of buildings that are inaccessible to disabled people and a lot of the minus and they include buildings all the way along morehouse Avenue and rights road where there are carpets being sold and electronic equipment being sold and upstairs there's lawyers and insurance brokers and a lot of other organizations that could be employing people and do employ people but cannot employ disabled people with a disability and we can't do anything about the building code at the City Council though we can make representations to government and that has been done but we could set a standard for the whole new zealand christchurch city council set an example on nuclear free and more recently received that from a date in the future say five years from now that those organizations that are not in disability accessible buildings for service for services provided or for employment will not receive income or be am partnered or subscribe to buy the christchurch city council in terms of donations to the organization that would give fair notice to organizations that the city council expects buildings to be accessible to all its citizens all of whom pay rates one way or another at the moment we were we partnered and supported epic epic ass requires that people with a disability go in the back door and it's a long time since we've said two sections of our community minority is Miss ities it's a long time since we said they should be using the back door it's it is now and from now on then that in the brand new city we should be setting an example nuclear fracking a nuclear-free and freaking was something that made us feel good and it was an exciting thing to do but this would be a substantial change in from now on buildings had to be accessible to all our citizens and it would be an example that we could sit and we could set it in a time frame and it doesn't even need to cost the city council very much many question hello Belle it's just really Caroline to let you know too that recently discovered days ago the disability visor II group came to talk to their community committee and they had some comments very much in line with what you are saying and I guess being quite specific to about us as a council so I'm assuming that and from what our discussions there in fact while we are asking the notice of motion ask for a policy to be set up in fact that would be to need to become very specific with some specific ways to achieve what you're asking for oh yes and I'd rather we had a can-do approach than a why we can't do approach to yeah interesting because some before I was asking about this the person that approached you about being carry was the door suspended off the ground and the wire netting fence and I understand that the community boards worked collaboratively with the owner of the premises in order to get a ramp put on which I think's a fantastic outcome I think I remember responsible his bit has been really diligent and doing that and that's the thing that this an example of what we can do as a proactive council as we can actually now and if we take this this stand we after getting the right information etc etc you know we that that's another we don't we won't have to do it piecemeal you know this will be a strategic dealer see the initial response to that was that when you're coming let us know and we will find the key and then someone can carry you in which is kindness itself but it's not accessibility and they pursued it so that it was something that would be for all but about a month ago I had I was in the second car in the two car car parks stadium and like the three at the front which in useless I was the second car and another person tried to back in to be the third car in the two car car park that person could not walk to the back door of the gym this was his only chance to access it he and I both ended up in tears when we saw the difficulty that he would have if he couldn't have backed in there and had to go and find a car park he would not have been able to access it these issues should not these issues a humiliating to the dignity of human beings yeah I think that often people don't think at all about about the consequences I mean this this building for people to work on as very accessible has special lift access from the car park below the building doors open automatically with of a finger or their swipe card again very aware of people who might be using a wheelchair but in the chief executive will will know this and I hadn't noticed it myself the citizenship a handrail even a handrail let alone a ring and that's something that will change but it's taken you know somebody in that situation for the sudden need for the light to switch on and sometimes it isn't just a question of people wanting to put put the thing off or make a deliberate decision it's just not thinking about it grunting can I just say one more thing which is really boring but I hadn't been able to get it into a disabled car background this building because hereford street was blocked off so I went looking at muster Boulevard the disability compact the accessible car park is the first car park in wool booster Boulevard straight off Durham so you have to back in to a parallel car park while cars are whooshing in of durham and you're the person with a disability it's frightening and that was the only car park almost a boulevard that I could access hmm that was forward to say people with a disability and miles away from here of course yeah yani I just want board speed proactive I just wanted to reassure you that the new councils being really proactive as well we've set up for the first time in a long time a committee with terms of reference that includes accessibility and disability so we are now getting regular reports we've formalized it with the disability Advisory Group and we are asking our castle staff to report wrigley to us over what the disability and accessibility issues are and I think you'll be pleased to see that some of the work we've identified very early honors around the issue of car parking and in particular blue the blue disability car parks how we can actually transform our existing car parks into being much more accessible so I just wanted to reassure you that um this new councillors really committed to doing what we can and I think it's really important to acknowledge that we have given a visibility that it hasn't other said in recent recent times and it would be good to change the title of accessible the exists no City toe well there's not stop for staff member over there rough so I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much Julian Thank you Thank You Justice and now we will move on to item number
Um the meeting is reopened I'm just we've just played around with the order on the agenda as I said before spread and head cut wanted to present now so we'll hear from them now I'm going to yeah there's a reason why I have to have 22 and 23 and reverse order because the city mission decision has to be made before the metropolitan discretionary fund decision so one leads off the other so I'm going to reverse the order of those but I'll deal with those and then I'll deal with the supplementary resolution on the three papers and and we'll proceed from there so so spreading his Curt thank you very much Paul and thank you for your patience and thank you caroline forbidding us know that this would be helpful to making the presentation so thank you well thank you many many counselors and thank you venom ear for accommodating us and and so the first report which is from the first of July meeting notes that that CEO Carlene came to our board and we really's pretty much unprecedented in terms of CI engagement but the community board so we're really grateful for that and enjoyed having you and I want to draw your attention to item 2.1 which is another community garden and we look forward to the outcome of the ongoing process to make that easy and simple I'm sure you're aware I've raised that before and and now we'll move to the report of that oh well let's deal with the first of July then so if Phil Clearwater and Andrew Turner moving second so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried juniper lee now we move
And then we've got by some number 18 which has a part a meter in relation to blakes road the committee board supports this partay yep so Paul and kasha would like to move this and Ally Jones would like to second journey discussion Jimmy chin because earlier you know Lee's reveal the extent we can communicate sir james the way to drive a business situation but total my understanding city why I have a kind of 50 no this candle or I'm wondering whether we should attack in order reveal the city while review whether have a similar the street also the police strong recommendation have this kind of the speed also prohibit attempts on the road this my concern whether you know review a whole city wife right okay I'm sorry I'm just getting some advice I understand that there was a paper that came to counsel and a while ago that has sparked off some work within the council which will go out for public consultation in the near future in relation to speed limits across the city all right so I those opposed say no that's carried always short short yeah yeah just with regards to the transitional community center we've discussed putting together an eoi for the operation there you're on the liaison is there an update on that your mind we haven't_''_125.02 we had that initial meeting with staff and we agreed with the COI which is obviously the game that all sorted to go out so they obviously got to extend the date slightly with us requesting to be kept informed with it so we haven't heard back from that last and unique Smeaton we haven't got a meeting scheduled for mine standard go to the public at some stage but we don't know those days okay no that's fine we just Texas um a lot for my next trick and I think probably just a suggestion and with all due respect to you because you know what you're doing but if we can put dates in it at least sort of keep some deadlines and focuses there should be some days sooner we just had to push it but because we requested to be part of that a part of the conversation about what was going in it else he pushed those dates out slightly so there are dates and I was just not too sure off top my he bought those dates and there may be staff better hear that aware of the dates but morning I think that in the light of this that that transitional centers only d 28 4 2016 it's probably going to prove quite challenging for a group to actually you know make it viable for them to run a center for one year only that will remain to be seen thing you want applies for it it's just these things take so long to to to keep organized because I think the board has been asking us several months now yes it's been an ongoing process and obviously people in the community inside to realize that the list does expire in April 2016 which may stop some people trying to have applied for this and if I could just need to that it's been made clear that't feel that the transitional community center long term as the best option for them so it's really a meeting room it's not actually Center so our borders initiating community conversation that we're hoping to have sooner rather than later about perhaps a long-term plan for the community and what they want what they need we're good so Council Jones would like to move and count to the cotton would like to second that the reporters a whole beer doctor I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much
I'm sure leap up annoyed community boards item 17 and 18 Mike David Schwimmer and welcome and we've got a parte motion and I think Pauline kata would like to move this and Ally James would like to second it would you like to talk to that oh yeah so then notice of motion was amended and was carried that we'd want the Environment Committee to prioritize a high-protein session against the cycleway the northern rail way corridor cycleway in our ward right I think that the Environment Committee is as due to report on priorities on cycleways soon look we are and like that prioritization process is being drawn up by now by the staff and I understand very clearly that there's going to be full opportunity for community boards to participate in that environment and sorry Annette put that prioritization process excellent so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried are there any other items that you'd like to I just wanted to touch on in item 8 on page 85 regain a reputation at our last board meeting where they gave us information on flooding issues one in particular is the road on principal road where the floating is obviously causing cast across the medium strip onto the other side the road on a blind corner some of our stuff to obviously have urgent action on this area yep so with someone like well I'm and I think we should get the serb a definite priority and we're going to be dealing with some of the flooding issues later but and I'm working up some changes to the recommendations but I think to have a recommendation come out of the council meeting today would be very useful for that community we can work on something I just want to reiterate what made that till early important and I'm really pleased you pick that up is the fact that it's actually life threatening with the traveling on to the other side of the road on a blind corner so that's why I absolute priority I know the area very well I used to be the MP second of July we're already into August and that is yes a live streaming so yeah so or would know that the report as a whole be adopted and that staff be asked to be requested to hold a public meeting as a matter of urgency to discuss issues around waterways flooding and land issues in that area so that picks that up yep okay and it's taffy requested to hold a public meeting as a matter of urgency to discuss that particularly roading yeah yep all right Chile spencerville road it says in the spencerville area I know but I know it does spencerville road but anyway particular a public meeting is just going to push the matter out though the issues there at the moment it don't have come to us with the deputation there's addressed these concerns that we've taken on board this particular core area where is actually quite dangerous and we don't really want every time it rains it floods you know I hate for a public meeting to actually prolong the process yeah okay principal road it has the middle yeah so ok that the reporters hold be adopted then that staff urgently address the the flooding issues and spin ssible particularly the local road or particularly speeds full road and report back to the community board enter Council yep so that's both yeah it may be that there's an engineering solution that they can address and report back to the community board and the council yeah alright and that's moved early drones and seconded Pauline cotta and I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's Carrie and then
The item 14 where there is a part a matter requiring a council decision and that's easement over old school reserve Paul would you like to move there and seconded by yanni Johansson sorry I bought it against the egg community board oh sorry gosh to move this all right okay so with someone else like it to move second the room yep second pro forma full clear water would you like to speak to that place this is a section a small piece of old school reserved at the very very top where there is a house that's had access in the driveway to the house for a few years and this will be formalizing that arrangement it's not a piece of the reserve that is used by the public at all it's right at very top mixed a very steep section of ground and there was a concern at the community board that there was no urgency over this and that it could in the future blemish the council's management of the reserve in some way but it was recommended by the board really wanted to ask a question of staff album sorry who which staff covers this easements prophet Jonah okay thank you in a general sense I can understand that you know we need to provide access but what I really want to understand is of like what's happened without board we've got my presence school now raising really serious safety issues for their pupils and us wanting to look at how we might put in a new footpath or change the writing to get you know less risk we constrained because some of the land as sold off or some of the land has permanent easement so what in the future if there's a need for us to use this land what rights do we have as a council to reacquire it to you know use it for some of the wider objectives that we would have and I still don't quite understand why the staff are recommending we go for a permanent easement which guarantees rights forever this is like a license to occupy or some sort of lace that if we needed to use doesn't this stuff from question for me I think it's a legal question that we can get the answer to and circulate everybody understand could be added to the contract that would enable us if we needed to use this land and future a way of actually being able to do so I just I know that there's a wider issue around lots of the hill land that we do have road reserve or old parks or recreation reserves and we probably do need to start thinking post it quick about a bit of a strategic response to just selling it off or groaning permanent parent rights to but you know the other concern I've got over this one is the precedent that the seeds for other people with retaining walls with a whole bunch of other access issues on the hill so we still don't know but yeah so the the states that the reserve will not be materially altered or permanently damaged and that the reason for this is because the road frontage at 176 major Hornbrook road is considerably higher than the wreak vehicle access to the property so the community board one member abstained they you voted against and everyone else supported us so I'm just wondering whether we need to you know refer for additional legal advice or whether we're happy to make a decision today Paul I totally hear orellana is coming from on that in the case of the Mount Pleasant school with the y-axis over current we're not sure this an easement or it's a permanent grin talk of use but this particular we look at all the aspects of the axis and here and the other part of the reserve and and there looks like they would be very limited ability to do anything with this piece of reserve in the future so that's why I think the board at the time voters in favor of allowing this easement to go across this piece of land so I here on one hand yep there are areas where in future we may need to have access but this one here in particular it does look like there's going to be no purpose so I'm just I'm just taking it some advice so that the community board has actually granted the easement we're being asked to confirm that with the delegated authority that the minister has given us so I mean we could refer it directly to the minister and not accept the delegation to make the decision but I would rather take legal advice on that matter before I would refer it back to the minister because he'll be wondering why the council hasn't made a decision on it so but you know I think that I mean the trouble was is that I have a sneaking feeling that this is quite a different issue from the issue they that counselor Johansson has raised this is not like the witch school mount pleasant's not like the Mount Pleasant school situation that's quite different that this road has always been used for access well this driveway has always been used as excess it does locate partially over the reserve the community board itself is heavy with the easement to be to be granted and it that the Minister of Conservation would normally give in a reserve matter as he has delegated that authority to the council if you look on page 68 what you can see quite clearly is this is very different to what was there before that you're talking about a proposed formed driveway so you're going to have a major driveway going through the reserve where you can see the existing one rent a lot closer to the road and I mean that's fine if the councillors want to go down the stuff but I guess the other question I would then raise from a legal point of views why not to sell this land to the guy anyway because for eight thousand dollars for a hundred and fifteen meters square so pretty good bye but if permanently it's going to be regarded as a driveway then why don't we just sell off this land if we don't have any use for it strategically then surely we should be getting more money than 8,000 for Paul I think there's an issue around the reserve and easy sell it would be in itself quite expensive and would deem itself sort of pointless so that's the reason I understand that we've gone down an easement rather than a sheer a solemn purchase it seems to me that might be better to defer the meter until the next get some advice so we'll just yeah I'll just I'll just defer the matter until the next meeting and will receive some legal advice all right so along those lines in enemy um if it did get granted at the next meeting the community board was hopeful that the 8600 25 compensation paid to the council could be tagged to the old school reserve now wondering if there was a process for being abstinent you well and well can we put a note here that we wish to seek advice as to whether we can take the compensation paid to that purpose you had an earlier one there that's right here good to make it heathkit domain I'm not sure whether we've ever provided you with advice in relation to that measure there's a secret measure but we we were remember when we looked at the head clip today and when was that maybe even late last year right Siri early this year so we do we looked at with a compensation paid in relation to a land division yes in relation to yeah heathkit domain but we haven't the community board hasn't heard back so yeah okay we can check that as well alright so with the exception of item one that the par-tay matter could be that the would somebody move that the reporters a whole be adopted poor lonsdale second does yani johansson I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed I know that's carried think you did arima I did have one other met on the plane sorry so it's not in our minutes at this stage but our community board in several others have in the in the last week passed motions asking the council for permission to have input into the district plan review it's something that hasn't hidden before but as this process able to have some input but we need counsel permission to do that so we will have them will be able to work out a process we're doing that we have a extraordinary meeting tomorrow to deal with the district plan review so peps if somebody could make a note of we would like advice to that meeting about community boards making submissions I mean I have not been involved in a district plan review before and the one thing that would concern me would be multiple community boards with different views perhaps over overriding each other whereas a combined workshop might produce some sort of standard views across the generic issues but can allow community boards to deal with specific issues in their area so without perhaps overriding those so if we could get some advice about their am tomorrow be great I mean I think that's enough time just to to get some machine advice in front of the council tomorrow thank you thank you do that thank you record on what Graham and community board course for
Yes hagley pyramid community for item 13 no no part a report so jana johansson would like to move that that report be received and for lawns they would like to second that there any items that you wanted to touch on and that one not for the Sun okay I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now we move on
Pendleton my my community board calls 11 valkhara are the first the first of these well both of these don't have them I from a reports so rest mangie will move that on Jamie golf ball cigarette welcome welcome back I mean given that there aren't any item a reports but you like to address the council Val and there's not much on it but inside high school in the traffic outside burnside high conflicts with Christ can and then we will always have to manage the traffic outside that school that will always be a problem of children outside there so we just kept keep doing the best we can and also again with the your to his queries there's a lot of pressure on those quarries because of the earthquakes and a conflicts for the local residents out there so we're going to have problems for a long time and I don't quite see the the total solution to that but they'll always be my problems for us thank you very much Oh Yanni Thank You Val thank you for your for staff to report back I actually think would be really good for that report to come back to Council as well given that other community boards of heads are similar issues with with contractors going over you know areas that we looked after by the community so is it possible just to ask that the chief executive to take that on board and just circulate that to the council and maybe it goes to the Environment Committee at some stage but I do something we need to get some really clear policies and places to try and stop this hit me well I think it should go directly to the environment Kamadeva because you know that way it comes on to the person we're gender for the confessional is it possible just to move a slight addition to your report yeah the reports of 30 June and fought until I believe received and they're 6.1 6.1 on the first of these there's a 30 at the June the item of food and yeah an item 11 yeah great thank you they refer to the environment muddy favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much and now Sarah
And counselor East seconded counselor Livingston that the reporters the whole beard doctors just what one called one week just like to make the deling tonry sins Association came to us at that meeting requesting right turning lights for the marshland New Brighton Road intersection there's right turning arrows going the other way but not in the east of east-west direction and that they're talking about increasing traffic volumes and things and especially being noticeable since they burned our bridges been opened to be in there and assume would will become even more noticeable once the Darlington bridges reopened hmm Pauline with that's come to joint community boards in the past about not sure might be few years back here it's we've had and staff have done lot of work on an intersection and unfortunately the data does not stack up from arrow yeah so whether you want to open it up again for a study it's a lot of resources to go in but maybe we need to pull up that data and have a look at it again we hit a numerous watching in the traffic seem to be going through okay I'm just needing you know that a lot of work is already being done there and it didn't stack up yeah yeah that's the advice that we've been received as well however the board required requested me to come and bring it up with you guys well is it is it worthwhile having another joint workshop between the two community boards or I mean having look at the results of the survey that was already done right I think it was fairly recent do you have regular meetings together when we need to any other shoes I love consumer but that that issue it probably was pre earthquake before we when we looked at at last and and it's been an ongoing festering issue for some time and it's not just this particular intersection and the city that that continually has a with the lack of right tuning signaling and I think the whole issue really it's not just this intersection it's a number of others as well and there seems to arrows and I don't know quite why the computer modeling seemed to suggest that traffic would back up for half a kilometer or more and my observations particularly with this one here I've never seen any great backup of traffic at all so IRA certainly would like a revisit of the situation and the whole right tuning arrow issue with the city it just seems to be a problem that crops up all around the place oh I tend to agree that you know the this research was done pre-earthquake and I just wonder whether we should have an update on the matter or is it something your committee would look at yes I think so because these right turning arrow issues are right across the city I think will be useful for that but it's also beans on right tunes you know that you know I noticed when you're going down Fitzgerald Avenue over that wonderful dipping bridge there you can't turn right into kill mode Street which turns into a one-way street I mean it just seems utterly bizarre given the you know the way traffic was being directed but with roadworks and things like that sometimes I wonder and I've also raised the question of the Barnes dance that ridiculously still exists in the center of town we're people everyone sits there waiting for nothing and then and then the light changes so it would be really good to have them taken off colombo street in the center of town and that's underway excellent can do you yeah so okay so we will refer the shoe to the transport committee Environment Committee and have that mentor address so and refer the issue of the issue referred to an item 4.1 refer that issue referred to an item 4.1 you don't need to write out what it is all about we can we know what it is refer the item referred to an 4.1 to the Environment Committee excellent so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those that oppose they know that's carried thank you very much
Perhaps Andrea the Burwood Pegasus community board we're going to go straight to you because the it's a bit unfair so but spread and Heath could have asked to be heard after lunch is one of their speakers to their to their report isn't available until after one o'clock so so the first booooored pegasus community board agenda as the as clause 9 and you've got a partay there in relation to rough it ii dumb domain which looks fine and I think that Glenn Livingston and David East would like to move and second that respectively and would you like to speak to it is it's really just a simple transaction really the community garden trust are functioning very well at the moment they've got a great service there for the community and would like to see that continue very good any comments on that I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and
See now there's the recommendation that the report is a whole bear doctors and I'll put Andrew tuna and and again Phil Clearwater and I'll put that moment I think the under was one of them a shooter Paula wanted to raise I don't think that I thought eight to take up more of your time but I'm item 1.3 the Littleton alleyways and David Street steps this is one of those small but significant festering sores in our community littleton has a number of these stairways that go between roads after the earthquake was some damage that was closed and you know council maintained it for years and years but went after it closed they said it's not our land so we are not going to repair them we were up to at the moment there's no owner or what the owner died years ago so we're the staff recommendation at a workshop that we had was that we asked for a ten or twelve thousand dollars in the long term plan to and track down the previous owner and then council owns it or buy it off somebody to enable that work to happen I think the borders a whole thinks that that probably isn't really necessary that there appears should just happen and a step should open and I'm sure there are other instances where the council spends money on Linda doesn't own okay so I just tie like that to you it's a bit of an intractable situation or who would who would investigate that matter because I mean it does seem like we need a quick decision but going through an extensive search for someone I mean it may indeed be and the sort of example we'd want to talk to the minister about his powers under the egg you know I mean it's the idea that this these steps weren't available to residents when they have been until the earthquake just seems really crazy to me yep so who would who would we refer that or just we'll just and that the reporters a whole be adopted and that we refer the item and 1.32 staff for a forward thank you to the ground so I put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much
Maradona and getting to the point here item a I think it's fair to say there is a level of frustration in the domain hop community about how long it is taken for anything to happen at the particular the godly house site you will see the board recommended to counsel to begin some full engagement I've had a conversation with Andrew and that the urgency appears to be getting some kind of some maybe some projects into the long-term plan and maybe one possibility will be for the community board to work with strengthening communities team to have a conversation about projects that might have come out of the report that Pete's just presented that should go into the long-term plan so I'm suggesting that maybe a way forward and I'm happy to take that on and take away so in terms of the recommendation here you'd prefer that that the words formal come out of that so that the council began engagement with the diamond harbour community about issues highlighted and or do you want the formal engagement and consultation linkdin what it probably isn't really that's fine leave it on there here all right so you'd like to move that Andrew seconded by Phil mm what I'm just assuming that in fact the QED board will be involved with it consultation too so what it means to council led it will be involved a committee board I would imagine so and the other thing I want to ask you is just give us a quick indication of the community facilities that are are available and diamond harbour for local people well the community diamond harbour is very well endowed with community facilities but what should not be lost is that the community raised money and built them all themselves so there are as a community hall there's a rugby club facility there's you know bowling and croquet and greens there is a library but I think that they have there has been some planning around the library strategy that looks at all the banks mature libraries because it's not ideal and one of the things that came out of the consultation that this spring godly house site might be a future site for a new community facility that might involve a new library but that's probably way down the track yes the motion is is that the council began formal engagement and consultation the board also request a confirmation from the council that a recovery case manager has been assigned to diamondharbour under the suburban recovery program I don't have any advice on that it's not something the board's understanding was that right at the beginning diamond harbour was one of the 63 suburban centers that was supposed to have a case management yet but right at the beginning I wasn't_''_180.7 the mirror of crochet yes I know that I've got no advice on it so I'm uncomfortable with moving a resolution that may have implications for how the council operates it's an operational issue so I'd rather refer the question of the recovery case manager under the suburban recovery program to staff to report back to the council so could they also report back to the board oh yeah of course they can but well this was two months ago and we still haven't got an ounce okay all right so so we'll have that why why are we amending the recommendation the recommendation is fine that the council began formal engagement and consultation so we're accepting their the second part of it though is that that is the son of you it's not them if we can just refer I think what council needs to do is pass a resolution about what you want to happen and then how we make it happen comes back to staff because it because it goes across different groups yeah but which who is responsible for gosh it's gone now where we that this demon that the suburban recovery program sorry the recommendations just suddenly changed in front of me I'll go have to go back to the paper one which my seventh wheel of time and energy is that we've got we had the briefing about the strategy and work program that seems to me that this is really part of that could we not just address us at because there's other community boards and other parts of work we need to do as a council that we have no visibility of and so I'm really supportive of doing this work but what I need to see us for the next 12 months what are going to be doing and we've already got a process we're right in the middle of acetone that so if we could feed this into that process I think that would be the best oh sorry I don't I don't sorry um I've now got the written one in front of me I don't want that back on the screen what I want is that the and I want to know which which which managers in charge of the suburban recovery program that one's make tilan but I think this will go across operations as well because a lot of puppet but busy then that might tellin well that the chief planning officer it's this right title provide advice to the community board at its next meeting whether the whether a recovery case manager that's what they've asked for so it's just a question of the council saying to staff we need the community board to be informed about that matter okay yep andrew is it yep go look in a sense I was sickening this Pope former but having having asked the community board chair and the committee which is description or of community facilities and diamond habits I just I do think that in terms of town center and they're in a place for people to be this clearly you know you've referred to a librarian I'm just wondering in fact if this is the right resolution for us as a council to support I'm particularly and I lean towards what yarny is suggesting that this be seen in conjunction with other community facilities that we as a council can afford to support yeah so sorry I just now have I'm happy to continue seeking that pro forma so we have the discussion and debate well I've got the way that the way that I from recasts us is that I don't that wasn't I mean I I know that that yeah I mean I'm not explaining this very well but I think that we haven't had sufficient advice as a council to make that decision but if we recommend that the council began formal engagement and consultation with the diamond harbour community about the issues highlighted on the report then I think that gets the thing moving and gets people to get all the issues on the table and is not directive the only other thing that the community board has asked for is for a report back on this particular role whether there's a recovery case manager has been assigned or will be assigned to Diamond Harbour under the suburban recovery program I don't_''_491.219 I mean I don't think the committee would need a formal report we need a no answer what's going on I mean ridging there a point appointed to support the order the economists eat the chili planning officer provide advice to the community board its next meeting on whether a recovery case manager has been or will be assigned yeah I mean here we've got a community which has had some good ideas for a long time which is engaged with its community has done everything that we would want a community association or a group to do clearly they've got some good ideas which have been worked up into a document in the presentation I mean I see this is something which is going to be led within the community led by the community board requiring some input from strengthening community staff who are there on the ground in the in the ward anyway and possibly with some advice from time to time from planning staff so that the community and the community board can work up some submissions to the the long term plan which of course is the way that anything will be funded in any case so I I think this gives enough bread for that work to happen for us to respect the work that the community's done already to allow the community in the community board to take a lead in this with appropriate staff support and add voices and provide some advice so that Thank You Carolyn it's very helpful so in terms of the suburban centers recovery program our resources are fully committed on on the week that we're doing around competing the master plans in in terms of case management we operate on a reactive basis across the city we have we the resources are prioritized to the master plans into when development comes in we provide a case manager is appropriate not every a new development actually needs that level so that's how we're operating within the program right now so there's there's obviously no no case manager assigned to dine at harbor and but there's no plan to have diamond harbour as part of the suburban recovery program no you know so was it ever originally no no I would um I had staff do a quick precis of the bottom they look at that the plan the community plan in I'd endorse what counselor tuna see deter from our professional perspective it's it's a really good plan these probably some some further small investigations start for that community to move forward but yeah so could we get a brief report and writing perhaps back to this community board just setting out you know that the parameters of the suburban recovery program and why that why they weren't included on and you know sort of way and I mean because that'll explain why there hasn't been a recovery case manager but it seems to be there's a that the community board had an expectation that they were included and and it turns out that they're not so can we just get a written report to the next community board meeting that sets out what you know what their issues are is that possible I'm wondering because there was quite a lot of analysis done when the severe incentive program was established and I could provide and that was reported to counsel in approved by council so I could provide that to the community board that the link to that report so there were there was analysis done of the damaging in the suburban centers and identifying where the priorities I'm saying is that I think what I'm hearing and maybe I'm not hearing it right but the community board seems to be under the under the expectation that they were going to be covered by the program and they're not so is there any way that we can provide clarity to the community board without them having to trawl through a document to find out why there why they don't qualify is that possible so um yes I'm peps I could just rephrase what I said before we don't have specific staff allocated to specific areas what we do is we we look at the demand in it's a reactive process that we operate in we're we're a private individual wants to undertake a development in one of the suburban centers if they need a case manager to help them through that we will identify how we can resource that but we're not doing it in a re in a proactive way and I I just I detect that the difference that the community and maybe I'm a more proactive approach for diamondharbour I wonder I mean I think I think it'll be fabulous if you went to the meeting Paulo have you got a yeah well my understanding was that that the what the suburban centers must recover what do you want the suburban case managers Hillary is that they you know if a business is struggling or needing support to establish in a suburban center but the thing is that's not the demand and diamond harbour in fact it's almost as if the community needs the kind of support that is provided to a business to enable them to make some progress on some of the things they might like to proceed with yeah but it may it may need a specific resource allocated to it as part of the long-term planning process so I'm agent the urgent thing is if there's things that need to happen quite soon without a massive master planning exercise which probably is going to happen now I don't know maybe I'm pre-empting it then some projects need to go into the long-term is to do a master clean we can take the second paragraph out completely and just leave this and yeah yeah and I think that that really covers it and I think you know Carolyn's explanation makes sense and I can understand where the difference he's alive because it's one's individual ones community so and I think that as part of this consultation we can work out what's needed yeah good Yanni and then Pauline so I'm just one about two points one is we have not given any indication that we will not replace godly house so other things really important we have not signaled our intention we're in the process of negotiating with our insurer for a global settlement and we're also in the process of going through statements or position on individual facilities and we will continue to do that but there has never been a call by this council as far as I'm aware that we will not replace godly house so just want to get that out of the way in the second point is we program and I really support the community board being able to engage with your local community find out what the projects are are what I'm concerned about is we're halfway through a process of that strategy and planning work program we haven't signed off on it it's council and it seems to me one of the key things we need to decide is whether we want to put this process into that mix and how do we engage with our community boards about what other planning processes that they want included and what are we prepared to do in terms of funding so you know I think that's a really interesting question about how we do future planning and I don't know whether this includes district planning whether it includes just capital works or operational issues I would have thought it's a bit like the Boston area you actually need to look at the holistic issues in the community so hmm I just think we need to put this into context with all the other stuff we're doing and have a process are for planning appalling well I could be on the wrong track but look I don't see why that doesn't read that the community board begin engagement in consultation we would assume that council supports community boards and its engagement in consultation any way through through the ax strengthening communities a team in other staff and others should be driven by the community board and it's supporting what you're saying yani that all community boards should have the ability to do this so I would don't know why that doesn't mean that the community board began engagement which I believe I already have done well we have and it would be our normal course of events to talk to our communities about what projects they want in the to clean anyway as we build up to it yep oh yeah I think that's the nub of it that's the other it's to talk with your communities about what sort of facilities you need it as a community and because earlier was reference to sort of like a town center and it bit concerned about raising expectations that in fact a new godly house will be built when in fact we're not sure about that as a council in terms of our position and especially compared with the need for other facilities it does not mean it does not mean it shouldn't be power long to implant but I'm just have some concerns and so yeah alright well I mean I think that the intention of the community board and don't get me wrong was that they wanted the support of you know the sort of staff of the council to to really you know undertake this consultation so I'm going to happy to add the words that the council along with the community board or supportable the the community board supported by the council staff or whatever I don't I don't really mind which way it goes yeah as I said earlier I see this as largely led by the community and the community board but there will be a need for some staff support yeah and I mean that's what I was engagement exactly what this is about all right so are you happy to second that on that basis so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye he's not councillors Kendra all those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much
And thank you very much for for your time thank you and we'll move on to well actually this I which we can we can deal with the additional items on the agenda later because they didn't_''_17.58 I think councillors want to deal with them separately so for up to ten thirty six so I think what we'll do is we'll move on to the occur or warrior community board meetings items five and six yeah but there's no pates and five so okay if we just deal with Pat five so Andrew would like to move there this is yet this is a crow war ii-era out clause alive we're going to deal with a poor sick sneaks but there are no parties and that first one and you'll move that that report would be received and they'll clear water as desperate to move that it be seconded are there any I we report ago no perm give Pam that's all right I'll sorry no no it's my fault I just said the wrong name sorry gosh yeah I didn't mean to do that no no that well sorry it was no parties so Pam could do her to know and be quite quick in the year that when that would keep on the Lord yeah so okay well would sorry I my apologies I thought there were two from Little John mount here but and I said a growl why really which is why I was confused when I looked down at the name so if there are no pates on your report but there is an item that you wanted to quickly address yep seems that the City Council is doing with the local eerie manga and there are a number of issues around access and a access across the canal down there and I just was looking for some support that we City Council really understands what the issues are that we've got the right people supporting that resource consent and that the community is actually part of that consent as well as a self-funding the the work that carries on down at buildings flat or some reserve land that some some laying closing of late reserves in other lands disposal act amendment 1995 1955 that provides the funding for that particular area to when that is when the axis has lost there's some funding there to to put it back to put that access back in again and to open and close the lake as part of them the management of the lake both for cultural reasons the Runanga have got a a the head of five-year consent on I'm a something that some a proposal that they thought would work so they've it has worked in their mind and they would like to now and now doing a joint proposal and is that with that general part of that application but I just really want to make sure that the council really understood that we all understood what the issues were was looking for an opportunity to work for a further or the I think the suggestion is that we that the recommendation becomes that the report be received and that the canal access bird legs flat issue be the subject of a joint workshop between the Environment that the mover and seconder yep no I'm very happy with that this has been a major concern so the communities on both sides of the the lake opening and we've heard from community board on a couple of occasions it's a good opportunity for us to explore through that joint workshop and the funding models the engineering solutions there are some cultural and environmental values that we need to consider here and it's a good opportunity to make sure we get the best outcome in terms of the relationship between council the the wire were Runanga and the local communities as well so I really support the capital awesome right I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much pen and apologize again and invite Paula to come back and item number 76 HD 10 as Clause 6 page 27
Sorry now put this down and it's going to say spring but just stuff I've moved it into paper Pete Sampson crumbs start at Point regeneration ideas great and then we'll move straight on to the this was about to hear but community boards good morning young boy named cloud some councils thank you very much I'm I'm picked up some 150 m chair of our diamond opportunity Association just to put that in context so with me as a Portsmouth chair of the little about Hibbert Mindy board please excuse my slightly nasal intonation that's the end of a cold sure you understand I'm not going around absolutely spring some sprig as stands for stato point regeneration ideas group and our main purpose has been to facilitate a community lead process providing the community with the opportunity to have this say and be involved in articulating a vision for the future regeneration and development of the godly house site and the diamond harbour locale and also how that will let planning for that regeneration will integrate into the wider planning for the has undertaken a great deal of community consultation to capture the community's views on the future potential for that site and how that regeneration might translate into a recovery planning process which the community can get in behind and support the combination of that consultation is has been captured within the getting to the point report which we presented to the community board and tuned and that brings together all of the all of the documentation and consultation that has taken place over those a years subsequent to the earthquakes obviously you'll be aware that the godly house was demolished following the earthquakes due to an uncomfortable position for that building and it is an important iconic historic building and remain serve as a site the key objective of the community vision was to undertake war to identify development that fits sympathetically with the natural and heritage context of snot on point and is fully integrated within the diamond harbour town center and forms the heart of a vibrant community and continues to be a visitor destination for both locals and visitors to our region I've realized next one so our deputation to the community board we asked for a number of resolutions and they were summarized that broadly as that the council staff would hopefully pick up the information and that the great consultation and I getting to the point report and use that as supporting information for planning for the diamond harbour town center and that secondly that the board and the council support formal engagement in consultation with it without community about the issues and opportunities highlighted in that report and to enable a number of projects to be planned and developed for submission to the council long-term plan next year and thirdly the community we're looking for a dedicated resource which was I think at an understanding of the recovery process for smaller regional centers so that we actually have someone we can take a positive and active consultation process with the council to take this planning forward and so today that the three resolutions are before the council let me quickly touch on the community objectives in some detail with we've lost a valuable facility and that served as a a planning mechanism and the fundamental requirements to regenerate that site and that regeneration can't_``_274.31 happen in isolation without a broader context of the wider southern Harbor Bay's regional development ik presented to the county to your predecessor Council in 2012 a similar information that I'm presenting today and and requested that the councillors indicate some support for our attention which was to develop some sort of planning mechanism first and foremost for the godly house site regeneration particularly for the book for the broader region and I use the term quasi master plan there's something which the local community and the council could participate in developing and they're they're meeting the council where the counselors were supportive of that notion unfortunately that the key down for was that a mechanism for implementation wasn't established at following that that council meeting and also following the mayor's delegation out to diamondharbour to come see the site and talk to the people and be presented with the information and consultation and so that's what I'm hoping to achieve today on behalf of and to be able to take the planning process forward as I said we would like to we recognize that that although this building insight we're part of the facilities rebuild the program subsequent to the demolition of the building that that that site is formed out of their program and so therefore our avenue for for regeneration for the site now falls primarily under the long-term planning process and so we understand from Andrea that that that we have an opportunity to put a planning process in place and to submit an application into that long-term planning process for consideration for budget allocation and certainly not lost on us that the council faces significant challenges both in terms of regional recovery and also financial challenges and so we respect that that position I think it's fair to say that the community feel that doing nothing is really deemed to be unacceptable there's a great deal of community feedback certainly to myself and to others that the question of what is happening what is going on with with them with the site and the regeneration what are subjective there's a feeling I think locally that that there hasn't been a great deal of proactive on handing historically in our southern bays region but really that we have a right to really compete for development funding alongside other communities such as littleton someday as a growing regional area and I think I've taken a quote here from the community boards submission on Canterbury's draft regional public transport plan in 2012 so this was post new youth quakes and obviously the implications of that that the southern based communities population would growing significantly and there by 2040 the population would at least equal or be greater than the population littleton itself and the suspicion was that that was a conservative estimate and so if we look at the the population currently around eight a hundred people and the last census versus little terms of 2600 I'll be at littleton has a major port sitting on its doorstep but where I think it's fair to say that we've probably been seen as that as the poor cousin of of littleton within the harbor you know we can raise the fade a little for the area I think it's fair there is supporting their proximately 1800 consent of all sections on the southern harbor bays region and for example the diamond harbour school role has risen by approximately fifty percent over the last three years and continues to do so and there's new early childhood education center just being built now on the on the school grounds so that gives some indication of the sort of growth that's going on in that part of the the harbor I think that I talked before about the community feeling that there's an information vacuum and certainly there's been a lot of wild speculation around the insurance aspects relating to the godly house building I think it'd be honest or the expectation is that should be some piece of consultation around this issue to set out what what are the actual expectations for the community in that regard certainly it doesn't look like there are any guarantees of ring a fantasy a payout given the guarantee of a pair so that down mediate please no I just saying that flippantly but but you know the truth is is that we're not holding anything back from the community that we could share so we're we're we're in negotiations for a global settlement but it that it that's it while that is happening we are processing each individual claim as it go so I don't think that there's any any desire to keep that information from people so we can check what the godly house consideration is but you know Oh DNA right thousand and what's and but but he's not the arrival it was it exciting was it accepted from the insurance company that it was a demo job no that's not but that's what again what we believe should be paid out for it on indemnity weird my understanding is we're not in d need to rebuild it so that's what we think we should be due under that settlement of insurance yeah but if the decision was to rebuild a house there or a community facility not sure right so and that that's the that's the nub of the problem that we face as a council because obviously it would be and the council's best interest to get a global settlement that doesn't mean that we will get the indemnity or the rebuild value for each individual asset thank you for that I think I'd like to say I certainly respect that there's a desire there for information to be put out of the public forum but I think that that hasn't quite been matched by basai certainly haven't seen anything coming into my leader box summarizing the situation as it stands over the last few years in that regard for that site so I think that's something that people are looking for is a clear succinct summary of the situation and where that might lead to in terms of the planning process and so forth I don't know that what we could do that for each individual asset that is the subject of an insurance claim I was thinking more on a regional as type I've interrupted you and you let's actually complete the presentation I think I think another other communities expectations is that they can clearly be a collaboration between local community members and and that's that can be a supportive through the association's you know that the development of a project will management group for specific projects like the godly house site and I think it's fair to say the community has some good experience in that for example the diamond Harbor Medical Center was the product of a community leader initiative and project delivery and and that obviously count here we want to be part of the process working hand-in-hand_''_736.09 with council I think it's not easiest thing to see the collaboration that's what it's all about that the community would like to collaborate with council if that if that is just de planned for the godly house site or if it's a more broader regional because I masterplan them then there are quite a number of people in the community who are supportive of that approach and would make the effort the long-term planning process I've got on the presentation here just some of these schematics that I presented to the Community Association which capture the key components of actions timeline through to that long-term planning process the first obviously is around the Foundation's removal of the newer foundations and the retention and management of the older foundations appear the historic or the archaeological report the council have considered that we actually undertake some consultation around the planning process obviously we've been using that site successfully for summer music concerts and art festivals and that will continue until such time as planning and development are ready to take place development of some form of master plan for the community to consider and consultation on that planning process through to submission and was obviously a review process around what that plan might hope to achieve and realism around that both in terms of delivery and budgeting and finally a submission into the long-term planning process next year for consideration I've got a few pictures here just just from the site this is the view from down in the wharf looking back aunt Leigh godly house site and as you can see it is reasonably our encroached by the trees and there's a picture of the of the entry pathway past so the godly house foundations into the main area of the site it's a view back out towards the harbour through some rice agapanthus there but the bottom line is of the view is highly precluded by a lot of growth over the last 18 or 20 years a lot of that is as is non-indigenous species of pines and yeah there's a significant amount of maintenance their opportunity to to open that up and actually make full use of the site these are the old foundations which are opposed to be retained until a future decision is made about their their attention or removal and some of the rubbish that was on the site a few weeks back our that the o president's a visual and a health or safety risk to locals and visitors now that the fences have been removed so in conclusion I'd like to thank you for your were put forward by the community board on behalf of the council and hope we can be forward to to a successful collaborative planning process for for our region thank you thank you very much so that that's the ten minutes that's been allocated for your presentation so I propose now that we've moved straight launch with the community ball item on the agenda
So now we'll move on to the second excitation I've just asked for a change in an order is that all right yeah so could genevieve despair come forward to address the item on the agenda regarding the trans-pacific partnership of the berry Thanks thank you very much for allowing me to come and speak to you again on the TPP and I really appreciate your attention to this issue I'm really glad that you did change around the order because I think miss relates very directly to watch professor selman has just been talking about as well and I'll come back to that a bit later I understand that the Christchurch City Council has a huge amount on its place at the moment and probably would love to be able to push this over onto central government and not have to be concerned about it and to be honest I don't think that I should have to take day off work to come and talk about international trade agreements either I don't think it should be my concern I'm a paramedic by our communities what came out of your last meeting was that you really wanted to know how this is going to affect local government specifically and you don't want the whole load of new opinions about the TPP because you are aware of what they are so I've come I sent you a lot of information over the last week and I totally understand if you haven't had time to read it so I'm just going to go over those main points the TPP does affect local government in a lot of ways so the first things that we sent you was about historical submissions and recommendations that the Christchurch City Council has made on free trade agreements to the central government and if I can just read you a couple of points of that one in nineteen nineteen ninety-eight about the ma I was that the implications of the effects of the ma I on New Zealand and Christchurch City be further researched and that local government New Zealand and other major local authorities be apprised with the con tenth of this document and be I for presentation to central government I think that there is a very significant and as you know the ma I didn't go ahead I think the free trade agenda is finding public consultation vexatious as I said in my email and public consultation is has been deemed to be irrelevant and unhelpful and so now it is not being sought at all okay this is completely secret which does make it difficult to make a decision on because what is it that we're trying to make a decision on so the LG ins in position on the TPP is nothing they have chosen to ignore it altogether yet they've just bought out there Stephen seven-step manifesto many of the steps net would be constrained by the TPP it aims to strengthen communities and economies and it has environmental you know hopes and aspirations those things will be constrained by the TPP I'm the latest to come out on the TPP is about certification which has just come out yesterday actually there's new website then launched Jane Kelsey was talking about it on national radio to draft up other countries laws and if this is in adherence to the free trade agreement and if the laws don't suit what they how they see those agreements to be they can redraft them on this website which you have the link to and one of the emails that Greg sent you it shows let their documents that came out from the Official Information Act in the United States about peru and the united states and how the United States drafted their laws around forestry that wouldn't even be available in New Zealand because the Official Information Act doesn't allow government government information to come out into the public domain so we wouldn't even have any idea how much the US was involved in drafting our laws the thing to be really interested in that about as well as that the main reason we want to go into the TPP is for Fonterra to get more market share in the US where the u.s. dairy farmers are terrified of Fonterra they think that they are a multinational conglomerate with a monopoly and so they to be to be disbanded so the hoped-for outcomes of the TPP unlikely to come out anyway I was taught by my parents as I came into adulthood to never sign something that I hadn't read that and this is exactly what we're being asked to do so we need to have transparency about this because the secrecy is having the calculated effect of don't know don't care among the public and also among Council and local government you know how do we make a decision about something that we have no idea about well we can look and past and see what free trade agreements have done in the past and we know that these going to have effects on your procurement policies so local procurement that is designed to aid communities and and produce jobs will be regarded as a barrier to trade extend the copyright is going to have picked on libraries and universities and the actual cost to Council of accessing internet selling with public assets as going to become this is going to be pressure on commercializing public assets which even not in New Zealand's best interests and our whole I mean you saw my to let his documentary they said at the end of that that the push for this alcohol has been has been by the multinational conglomerate stat that control the alcohol industry and despite the fact that most New Zealanders didn't want these changes made in 1989 it went with the minority decision because there was so much multinational lobby influence on that so then yes the costs come down to us too ed departments to ambulance you know those effects and Geoffrey Palmer said that corporations are being given more power than people so that is what the TPP is about okay now we have chosen this strategy of asking local governments to act for us because we're not being listened to as people and because this is how New Zealand became nuclear-free it wasn't just that the Labour government suddenly decided be great idea to become nuclear-free know there was huge political pressure on the government and of the governments of the day and by 1988 seventy-two percent of the population had declared themselves nuclear-free well we would like to ask you to declare yourselves a free via trade council okay we are not anti trade at all we are pro Fair Trade and that is what this is about so if you have any questions I have tiny bit of time to answer them questions Paul then Yanni I suppose not really a question it sir it's a a loss of democracy right across country we actually have seen that a bit now where centralization of our democracy is taking place and at a time when this council we've come in here to xen even more grassroots approach we want to push back down to the local community boards with powers of delegation their responsibilities to the local area and I suppose the question would be this would be a big loss of democracy in your view yeah absolutely lots of sovereignty and and that we won't even know how much of that is happening yeah but definitely no jaani and then Vicky bill thanks um just to kind of put it into like three main points'd like us to demand that it be done in public and you'd like us to get LG NZ to take a position is that yeah so we'd like you to adopt our public interest resolution which is those 12 points which would relate to any free trade agreement so they put into you know sort of enshrine what the criteria are for fair trade and yet to encourage LG and Xia to take a stand and take that to central government okay one of the chief concerns I've heard voiced about the TPP is the potential threat to far mech and the way in which we do non labeled drugs and therefore much cheaper drugs in New Zealand for medical purposes and I wonder if you've got any views on that the pharmaceutical industry is actually aiming a lot of this at pharmac specifically pharmac is a best practice thing that is lauded throughout the international community as being a really really good thing that saves us tens of millions of dollars every year the pharmaceutical companies want to break it doesn't suit them giving up in order to get more market share in the US for Fonterra thank you very much I prayed the 10 minutes as up so look thank you very much for your time it's much appreciated I'm not going to propose that we go straight on to the subject right now because it's it's a supplementary agenda item which we'd have to bring onto the agenda and we have next deputation which then leads onto the agenda as we have so I propose that we received the next deputation
And it would seem odd that I would move it but I'm going to move that aside the the call for alcohol action do you like to second that is there any discussion Yanni I think it would be useful in the report and I don't_''_19.92 I haven't seen it but as part of the local alcohol plan or ball policy we we made a number of recommendations to government I thought around some of these issues and I also just I guess it would be timely just to give an update as to what's happening with the lap given that we've heard that accessibility is one of the key issues in terms of alcohol we as a council decided to cut the local alcohol plan on hold until there were the results of some of the court case or the not court cases but the authority cases that have been taken by the supermarket industry and the hospitality industry against local councils as a council in a recovery environment we decided that it wasn't we couldn't afford to invest the time and the notification of the plan so we are waiting to see what the authority determines in relation to the change of hours for super market trading and specifically the the hours for hospitality venues once we know how the authority will determine these cases then we will be in a position to make a decision as to whether we notify their leg and pull the guilt I know I support doing something both at the root of the problem really years supermarkets have normalized alcohol you got kids from the smaller stage the new trolleys going straight passes the alcohol lyles whereas previously they couldn't access at jumeirah and liquor store is zero an opportunity we can ask or try and legislative a like cigarettes have to put me there away somewhere else where they are not you know in the smoke people don't go past them at a young age and it becomes is quite normal to purchase it with their their their groceries I mean that said whole normalization that's actually taken the alcohol sales and supermarkets to the number one category it surpasses butter soot marks are the major problem it they lost leader it as far as sales go so we're going to think of some ways we can actually sort of hinder how they actually trade through the Super Max and I think that's really the core root of the problem hmm agree umm_._172.26 Ali Lynn Dave well I'd actually sound word of caution on what Paul is saying I don't have any problem with normalizing alcohol actually in fact I think it's really important to do so what I think we have to be very careful is normalizing the antisocial behavior and the excesses that go with alcohol and I don't know about you but getting bread milk and the week heat weekly groceries when everyone is incredibly busy being able to buy a bottle of wine and the super matic market is actually extremely helpful so I think we've got to be very careful that we don't penalize those who are sensible with alcohol but at the same time I agree and appreciate that there are things you have to do for those two things I'm also very I think it's really important that we acknowledge the extra pressure on people in christchurch particularly in the post-quake environment and the reasons why people self medicate or drink to excess and we need to be able to look at why that is happening and address that problem rather than slam them with a hammer and they're going to get the alcohol somewhere and maybe it's going to be the rent or the kids food or whatever that will go on that so this is a really big problem this is a good start I endorse us but I think that we have to be very careful that it's not the thin edge of the wedge and we don't end up being in any stage clean thank you I've had the opportunity to hear many of these issues such as the loss leading raised before when and yarn erased that in the previous two over the let just putting that to one side will hear those again if we come back to that and we're waiting best thing we could do and the interim is to support this although actually this stands alone is I think a powerful statement I'm actually hoping that I remember john black who is Peter Beck's predecessor and my training talked about that they're kind of New Zealand male psyche anyway you know that the rugby soldier model and we're still kind of working through that as New Zealanders and I think I'm looking forward to the day when we get past it I don't know maybe the centenary of that war celebrations next year could be a chance to say look it's you know let's start looking at a new New Zealand and get past this kind of embedded culture which we've had for so long but I support this and I think that that the the supermarket lobby is so powerful and we ran into this and the lek proceedings that this is the best thing we could do I think of the meantime Dave and thank you look I support the general thrust of the this call for action really we've seen instances before we're increase in the price of cigarettes really didn't do too much to stopping people smoking increasing the price of alcohols probably not going to do much more for me it's a change in culture and I see a couple of things being sort of influential if you like in the current problems that we face one is our td's and they so cheap and so readily available you can buy them cheaper than a bottle of coke basically and that to me is one of the one of the big issues and the other one probably is the supermarket's themselves I don't have a problem like le of the supermarket selling alcohol the thing I do objector I suppose as you walk into a supermarket any supermarket and the first thing you hit is the booze hmm and really I think if we're going to be effective in reducing alcohol dominance the supermarket's need to take a responsible lead for a starter and not a not have such a focus on alcohol and B I loss leaders really is diabolical and adds nothing to the effort to reduce alcohol problems in the country so I'll support the resolution today but just note my reservations about the direction that's being approached here and I would rather see more of a culture approach to the culture of alcohol and some of our marketing processes as being the focus fell and then I'm actually I see this the combination of interventions that call for our connection are asking for will help change the culture Edric and culture and I think there's a good opportunity for us as leaders to actually be part of that change and like I don't agree that this has actually got anything to do with in any state recently for example recently government passed legislation reducing the amount of alcohol we can drive with and generally that was accepted that wasn't any state this is about changing our culture for the good of our people and the cost social costs that Professor cell Selman referred to a five billion dollars a year as absolutely staggering so this is the turn this tide the border Pauline is look I support the the principle behind it and the addressing the culture but I also support what can't lonsdale into counselor east of said two I think the supermarkets are a big problem and that has not been addressed in this and also the the RT DS are a huge problem I'm just wondering when the full priority actions I think that's really the issue I have I don't support increasing the text on alcohol because I think it's already extremely highly text I worry about people who actually drink responsibly but do not have a budget to do so and they could well be you know vulnerable and excluded from the side do I am concerned about the tax on alcohol increase is there any scope to support this without supporting all the priority actions or do we have to support it in its entirety or vote completely against it the the these these four are four of five plus 1 which is around alcohol treatment availability and as doug Salman said the age has are evidence-based mechanisms for improving but will not it's producing reducing the availability or the the very low-cost availability of alcohol and I mean it's true what people are saying about the the supermarkets and in a way you know part of why we can't really notify our local alcohol plan at the moment is because we know that they are well resourced to take us on and we need to wait to see what their direction is so I think it's really it's a question of whether as the mayor of Christchurch the City Council will support me signing this letter on behalf of the on behalf of the council I think that's a bigger conversation that we have to have with our communities I feel personally that we have been left to deal with the hard end when the the government hasn't actually dealt with the the hardened you know the the end that would make the biggest difference and I'm not saying that about the current government I'm saying that about successive governments so in 1989 it was the 1999 changes were a conscience vote so individual parliamentarians voted so it wasn't government to government but it was in that case led by national minister who went on to become a minister of health you know so sometimes actions taken with one hair you don't see that the cost actually ends up and somebody else's budget although I have to say that if you want to look at the not just the emergency department but if you want to look at police work after midnight then I can tell you they're almost all of the work that they're doing after midnight in towns around New Zealand and an hour instance only because we haven't got a town around gratitude or in the middle of Christchurch at the moment but we have that that almost all of those cases are alcohol-related you know the assaults the you know the you know it's just it's just an it's constant and it's every weekend throughout the country so unless we take all the hardened and these are the hardened and we make a huge difference to smoking rates in this country you know we know that this work so yes it is it's the for em to me I support an air sign these the co for the Oklahoma action because the I think intention is very important you know with their the inner being because we heard of on the professor door talker he mention earlier this initial sickness cherry have kinda 37 special Easter community leaders ACH oh they consider this the country they concerned this community and also they have a kind of experience release a quite a few la comprehensive the report regarding to you we have excessive alcohol drink a jury is at a Magid Easter society and also hippity mention Eliza harm to our society not only individually but actually is the community your public family members your community you're the kind of organization etc and also you will review these the the reporter even the oxidation is quite a few actually you know is also reduced or portal for activity in the chi church another one spender a social costs a lot well as the text message all these are negative the impact so the I suggested because the base on Star Trek convention here only whether we agree or disagree I agree I supporter the mayor to sign the lease of action thank you okay well I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried but Pauline was that you yep Paul in common yep thank you very much
Just to remind people that the meetings live stream so we'll speak clearly and to the microphones so that that can be picked up the next item on the agenda is decoration of interest and I haven't_''_18.96 received any declarations of interest for today's agenda and
Um I'd like to make a special welcome today for students from um avenmore institute who are viewing the council I hope that you find that uh enjoyable so welcome to the meeting uh the first uh matter that we deal with is uh apologies um I have a late apology from councillor scandret for personal reasons and so would counsel a clearwater councillor east no no he's here he's he's his bag's here here um so um but um moved by a councillor clearwater seconded by councillor east that tim skandera's apology be accepted I'll put that motion no tim councillor scandal it's not coming to the meeting now um we don't know for sure so I'm just going to accept it as an apology I'll put that motion all those in favor say I those opposed say no that's carrie
And now we move on to an accessible city transport projects one Hospital corner and five more house Headley and I think for this one we have got Tim cheese borough Beck and Terry house thank you now just before I get well maybe if we get a mover and seconder for the resolution although I was going to ask first about the decision-making framework for this because one of the things that I still haven't got my head around as as as what what part our public engagement has on the in the decision-making tree and then you know what what we decide then as a council what then become then then what happens you know so does the minister make the final decision or is that a part of the chapter of the of the central city recovery plan I mean I still haven't quite got it in my head about the decision-making tree and I worry to that about the consultation process normally when we're undertaking a consultation we've got an obligation to put options out there you know what options have we know it looks as if there's one option for the that the bus interchange in one option yeah morehouse avenue hagley ave changes and because you know so you were not it wasn't clear to me whether we've engaged fully and the right process and then it seems to me that again that there are particular people that have an interest and the subject obviously the people who live on higley Avenue people who use the Hagley Avenue facilities there's a school there there's a netball courts you know so and then there are a number of community groups that use the netball courts for various meetings and things like there and at different time so yeah so I know I know I'm not putting this very well but what I'm trying to establish this what is the decision-making framework and is there room for us to be having a little bit more consideration of what the options are so time I'll try and cover back all those points for council so I suppose what we that there are two and I and throttle me at the point I depart from that's why I told him to stay over there I can see him coming before he gets to me I plan so fundamentally obviously we've got a series of responsibilities as the road controlling authority and normally when we would be doing any any significant roading works and particularly where we're talking about things such as the conversion of streets changing of parking we're required to consult them the particular responsibilities we have as the RCA overlying that at the moment is we have a recovery plan so an accessible city is part of the central city recovery plan so it's a overriding statutory document and the council's not allowed to be inconsistent with that and I think I recall that when we had this discussion back in in May I think we just commented that we were in this sort of strange position where we were expected to go out and consult with our community we wanted as counsel to go out and consult with our community but our ability to give effect to fact that we had to give we had to give a fit to the recovery plan so for example there every plan says that um Street is going to be one way east we could consult on that but we couldn't reach in a conclusion that was different to what the recovery plan outline so a lot of our work is more focused less on what the outcomes are going to be but more about the detail about how we give a fit to those outcomes and I think that's how staff particularly as we've thought about our consultation program that's how we've tried to explain it we're really dealing with the hell now that may feel a little disempowered in some respects but that's the nature of what the recovery plans sometimes do to us so we will be going out and we will be consulting but we will be consulting in the context of well actually this is this is the broadchurch of what is going to happen we do have to give effect to the slow streets we do ever to give effect to the super stops in term street and they are identified as being in that location and we have to give effect to the one weighing we have to go pick to a whole of other things in the central city but those are the ones which are relevant at this point so our consultation is basically formed about how we best work with our community to inform them of that take their feedback while still being able to recommend to council to give a thick too then so that's basically really what we have to do through this this program so we've also know that there's been discussion about you know would the minister use his powers to change some of the decision-making processes around some of those RCA responsibilities and that is specifically in respect to what he believes needs to be done to give help him give effect to the outcomes that the an accessible City recovery plan has outlined so that as really as we've said around the conversion to one way so the changing of two way to way back to two-way changing the speed zones in the central city and introducing the shared street model so those are things that he's particularly looking at but they're not the issues that we're addressing here no I know I know they're related but yeah the giving effect to the one way into the city through Chum street not that I agree with one ways but they're just we know that we have to do there but to have the bus coming the other way as something that you know that I know a number of us feel really uncomfortable with and the process of shutting down the entry to higley Avenue and essentially turning it into a one-way is not something that's been raised on the public arena before so this will be the first time a boy out for public consideration and it wasn't you know specified on the central city recovery plan or the accessible City chapter as being part of that whole network of transport but I understand why it's being proposed but it is the first time pressure point being further down the network that you're trying to resolve does make it look like the the total focus is on you know the nick bohr court set on a Saturday you know so for 46 days of week we get a change for seventh to the seventh day year for next tue 23 parks but it but I know that it's designed for impact further down in terms of relieving the pressure on on on on cars coming down that street but you know it's you know that all of us have just got memories of the of the buses coming the wrong way out of Litchfield street and I'm it's really hard to to psychologically and I know it was turning against the normal direction so it was on the right hand side of the road when you had expected to be on the left hand side of the road if it was a two-way so but that's the only thing about the about the change at charm street that that would be on the the correct side of the would be on left inside of the right but it just seems to me that there must be another model and I'm it just doesn't yeah so I mean we can't slow the process down thought for a lot of reasons but I just wonder whether we need to engage the Environment Committee in a way that again gets them consulting or engaged in this and this next part of the public process so that stakeholders have got the kind of Lincoln to the governance of the organization at the time that this is out for consultation so that we can we can really get that that the course stakeholder feedback and to enter the transport or the environment in transport committee early and the and the process if you see what I mean what I'm trying to do is to find a better way for us to be engaged in our governance roll right through out this next period but other people have got this Vicky and then term I just make some food coming yeah so I've talked Lettieri and turn around some to start community consultation that's they start on on saturday and I mean it is about actually beginning to have that conversation with the effective community and I think it's important that we do do that yes we do have a I suppose a very strongly preferred model because I think as you rightly pointed out none of these actions and none of these elements of the solution actually exist in isolation there are very integrated set of changes and it's not going to be easy to plug in pull different solutions because the whole the whole ball of wool starts to unravel quite quickly I think we'd be certainly may be an opportunity for us to say actually are their key stakeholders in there that we could get into the room with the Environment Committee through this process as well as starting that broader public process I think we could that could happen quite quickly because there are is you right right identified a handful of very key stakeholders in there and to get them sitting down with the key star and with the committee be doing so right that that's an action I think we could search take a password slightly disagree with you in terms of I think that I can understand councillors reactions to the buses in going the wrong way or the correct way in to Emma street if you're only image of the only other option that you see or your experience has been the old Litchfield Street solution because that was a that was a very poor solution I think this is I mean I think this is fundamentally different I mean they you are you're taking the buses around from antiguos treat that they're tuning they're not tuning across pedestrians and that sense the turning into a dedicated lane space with a solid median separating and remembering that the vehicles come in the other way will be traveling only at 30 kilometers now so you've actually got that fundamental change in the speeds but you mean the Lord will require them to travel at 30 cave is slightly different but actually because it's actually a nut look again I suppose it it's a point in tim may be able to comment that you would actually meant it or teri yeah I think I just pick it up much point the previous issue we had around the existing bus interchange with the bosses turning against the traffic actually that happened right in the middle of a one-way street along its length actually this is actually not in that situation the the far end of term street next to rick turn the rig 0 diz to way it will still feel sort of to weigh in that first section before it then goes to one way so it's a much more logical place to if you're going to do something like that to be able to do that yeah Vicki in the interim I'm struggling with this public consultation as well just in terms of what we're consulting on so we've kind of got locked and locked and loaded them one way to weigh the super stops and the speed limits what will people tell us that we can change well the consultation literature will will invite is a particular issue around Hospital corner and there are some parking effects both on a Glee Avenue and around the Litchfield around the the Morehouse Lincoln intersection the proposals to for instance rationalized that the Litchfield the the the Morehouse intersection with hagley Avenue again the proposals for how we might rationalize that intersection all matters where we will be welcoming the community's feedback on that and so one of the consequences perhaps of not making those changes at the Morehouse intersection with hagley Avenue there would be that perhaps we would be unable to reduce the level of traffic coming into the central city through hagley Avenue so there would be a balance there of the effects around that intersection versus the potential benefits further north into the central city so those are all matters where we expect the community and especially businesses around the the Morehouse hagley avenue intersection to have views on all of that we expect them to have views from for instance the cycling and pedestrian community over whether we've gone far enough in terms of the quality of the cycling the changes will affect businesses around the Hazeldine business park and so we expect to have detailed consultation with them we will attempt to explain to them as best were able what the wider benefits of this are for the city trouble networks as a whole and within the central city but we expect to be reporting back to the community board and the council in November on the full scope of that consultation people will comment on the one way two way streets as well we fully expect that to be the case but the legal advice we have here is that it is when council comes to make decisions about those matters as the road controlling authority that's the point as best I can summarize it where the the effects of the recovery plan then inform the council decision making at that stage yeah sorry I think I think the other thing that the consultation would do is look and feel of some of these things they'll barely prior to an input into that Tim I guess there's a couple of things when we go out saying is strongly got got this one in mind if the public is saying that that is that they're against the bus on term street going the wrong way I mean as une fixable but I look at this and I see arm our street between oxford terrace and term street as it did end that as a billion if you're traveling from and to your street towards the river you go in there there's no way you could have to you to know cat I know the hospital's got the outpatients design designed to go there but I don't see it being an issue on what on the Antigua if you put the buses the bus stop there and then go around I mean back into up so on Antigua and then go around ox40 respect condor to hospital corner I mean the Litchfield street was designed and endorsed by tread engineers in it was an absolute disaster there's no question about it in my mind and I just have those memories and I realized the buses on the correct side of the but I I'm not going to support the buses in that stop on chemistry and Lisa I saw some fatty a detail design but for me a vet history being dosed by Trek engineers sorry it's just not anything for me and the the detailed design of those measures around there will be independently safety audited some of their outline concept designs already have been I quite understand the concerns the councillors have expressed about that they would be the same concerns we have as traffic engineers designing those measures will people understand it will they know we're intuitively to cross there how will we ensure that the speed management there is more than just the speed limit and so the whole design of the scheme which we will be welcoming detailed input from the community over will enable us to address the very concerns that you've just expressed to us now you know we understand how the network works but how are we going to actually achieve that how are we going to satisfy people's understandable concerns of over how that might work that we welcome that feedback and we will actively engage with the community over any and every detailed point they raise because we're looking to achieve a perfect game for that location mark just follow him on from Tim and going back pets so the other terms more opening question is how flexible is this I think there is flexibility but there isn't a huge amount of flexibility I think I go back to my comment that these this has always even before we were contemplating this this was always a gnarly intersection and one that we had hoped to do some work on but because of the hospital concentration and I come back to that point that actually we will be seeing you know the works down hagley know basically 1.2 k down the road is fundamental to actually making this part of it work so we're going to be very careful that as we listen to people's concerns and look to modify we keep the network working in balance so that we don't end up making short-term decisions that actually then don't work so there is flexibility that's why there's some scope but I don't think it's open-ended that sense Yanni and then David so I just went back and read the cost share this project is actually the responsibility of the crown for delivery so why are we doing this well gasoline I mean I think it's the same time that I've made previously to break each other so maybe the road closet but but also we are trying to Prague matically deal with these projects we're dealing with them between ourselves and working out where the best allocation of our resources can be so I suppose it's the focuses behind trying to actually make an accessible City happen it's got delayed for a whole lot of reasons starting from the day that ccdu first published it so it's in a little bit of catch-up mode but it is really about trying to Prague matic they make the best solution happen as quickly as we can but we understand that but there's a whole bunch of probe I'd love for year but we don't do them because in the cost year it's really clear about whose responsibility it is what I struggle to understand is a huge duplication of resources going on with two different agencies working on the same project it just I don't think there's fear I think that what we hear you from staff right then was that they're working together in a collaborative way in order to make the best of the situation that we hear so if Sarah Sarah as building that interchange as I understand it seriously and that is the responsibility under the car share so if the chrome is as the delivery agency it's our role to do the consultation as a road control version right I'd said we do the public consultation we give that to the crown and then they go and do it is that nope we doing we're doing weird right we're doing the roads they're doing that interchange under the cost share no no actually the cost she is really clear project delivery responsibility is divided as cambridge terrace darren colombo armor enhancement of the manchester boulevard from bus interchange health precinct aven river oxford terrace Sean streets swap enhancement of surrounding area portions of st. SF in Tokyo Montreal eglee and salad straits si si si tu way of kilmore Fitzgerald killed more Fitzgerald more house than kindle house so it's really clear oh it just sounded to me like it was a collaborative I think the other question um there was also supposed to be a business case for the bus interchange have we seen that because what I what I'm struggling to understand is what how have we measure that this is the best spend of our financial resource given the financial constraints we have yani I'm going to room they're out of order we are dealing with an accessible city transport projects 1 in 5 I'm david specific business case I just wanted to sort of pick up on Mike's coming the term you know this limited room for or change and to me that's that's the issue you know we're hearing a lot and a lot of term street and a lot of potential objection to that plan and yet you know I mean you're basically telling us we're going we can put this out a consultation and even if we get a large volume of public opposition to it things may not change so I asked the question why are we bothering to go out to consultation because the plan is basically there and we're not going to change much of it I I get frustrated with us this is a concept of of coming up with a plan it's not going to change much there's a predetermined outcome really and we've had a little say in how it's going to go now and have little opportunity to change it basically I think that what what we've ended up with and I you know it is what it is that we have a responsibility to lead the consultation on this element of it we are the road control authority and so it's the appropriate thing for us to be doing I think that is that the counselors themselves have got you know concerns about the presentation of the of the options and they Elmore that year the presentation of the option and but I think that what we've heard from staff is that they are all connected and and taking a network approach is absolutely the right thing for the council to be doing and I think that enabling the community to see the nature of the you know that the challenge there is faced with trying to remove traffic from a particular area so that it has a flow-on effect to how things are managed further down means that you can't just look at how it impacts on your own local use of the road without seeing the bigger picture but that does mean that the community like us I mean we are all from the community ourselves the community might also have questions like the ones that we've had so the debate that we're having is there's actually quite useful because it enables staff to see the sort of questions that are likely to come up that we might go about answering those but at the end of the day the decision comes back to us and is what I've heard and it is only really a foul decision ultimately as unconference with the smooth operation of the accessible City chapter that there may be an intervention by the minister so I think that we have to wait until we get to that point I'm really comforted by the fact that we are going to now engage the Environment Committee and a direct discussion with the stakeholders during the consultation process I think that gives them a mechanism to ensure that they are speaking directly to governance at the same time that they're speaking to staff through the consultation process and I'm happy with that so yeah and so and that's why I said right at the very end that at the end of the day the decision comes back to the council but a council decision not to accept the particular proposal that is in front of us may have consequences that is beyond the council's control so I asked at the beginning what the decision-making process was because I wanted to have that clear in my mind and I think that that enables us to proceed in a way that for some counselors will not be ideal but it is the way we will proceed so on that basis I'm going to move the recommendations but I want to add on a provision that allows for the environment committee to be engaged with stakeholders during the consultation process yes I know that the environment committee will meet with interested parties yeah interested people our party no yep interested people during the course of the engagement hey they will necessarily don't necessarily be interesting anyone who lives in their areas untwisting anyway so do I have a seconder for that term scandrett is there any is there any debate Yanni I won't be supporting this today for several reasons the first is that actually given our financial situation I want to see the benefit analysis we've heard that all options are on the table to save money to reduce costs and this should be part why these projects are a priority for funding ahead of all the others that we have to do the other concern I have with this project because this is only one project and the accessible transport or several projects out of the accessible transport plan there is no commitment to funding any of the phase two projects you can't do one in isolation of the other in my view if you shut off interceptions on the previous that other things are going to happen that you have no funding committed towards I do not think that's a fair outcome for our community or for our city we should actually know what the big picture plan is and how it's going to be funded and a commitment to either fund that or not but doing bits and pieces with some funding without a robust analysis given a financial situation why this makes seems there's not something I can support today I don't believe it's good to go out for consultation on these on this one option the second reason is that this is actually a be doing the central city transport and I didn't support the cost year and I didn't support the blueprint this is actually something that the government have taken out of our hands and if they're going to use special powers around delivering this if there are going to be the ones that make the decisions then I think they are the ones that should be talking to the community in to the public for far too often in the last three years we having the ones that have to go and talk to our communities and do with the consequences of us actually not being the decision maker and I do not think that that is a fair situation for us to be and I do not think that it is right that we don't have a clear guaranteed process around who's making the final decision on this project so to go and talk to our community I just I'm not on that space to be able to do that at the moment there are important objectives that we need to achieve as a but look at the big picture and ask yourself is this the best use of our money hagley AF wasn't even badly damaged in the earthquake it's not a bride that needs to be repaired or upgraded right now we've got other parts of the city that we're told there's no money to fix no money to fix our water pressure mates that's been put on hold because there's no funding and this is somehow a priority you've got hagley park but already has a perfectly adequate pathway for cyclists pedestrians joggers and fact this is probably one of the most over-engineered parts of our city for cyclists pedestrians and whoever else wants to use it has a high level of amenity already and we're talking about making their even greater when other parts of the city we can't afford to fix the roads properly or can't afford to fix other things so I will not support this today I do think it's important that we look at the big picture and I do think of in our we need to see robust analysis of Weiss winning this money makes sense there's just a couple of things that I just want to say before we put this to a vote the first is is that the the challenge at morehouse Avenue is more than the flow-on effect to the to the entry to the city to the new one way system it's absolutely relevant but it isn't just that and to refer to the park in terms of over engineering for cyclists and and pedestrians I don't know that people you find themselves and conflict with each other would agree with that but it's not that that's not the issue the issue is the crossing of that intersection from Grove Road and for a cyclist actually trying to navigate one of the busiest corners from morehouse avenue lincoln road grove road and then threw into Headley Avenue with the cars traveling in both directions with right arrows left arrows and the conflicts that sit between the different forms of modes of traffic but particularly cyclists are the most at risk at that that there is an attempt to address that issue so it may not be the best solution but it is important that we have that discussion and I don't think that it's fair to say that this isn't earthquake-related because there isn't specific damage without referring to the wider Network and how we get people easily into and out of the city so I think we have to take the needs of cyclists very seriously and part of addressing their easy accessibility to the city is addressing the Hagley morehouse intersection I'm not I'm not an expert in terms of transport matters but and I'm very appreciative of the significant amount of work that's gone on to this but I think it will be enhanced by a community consultation and I believe the city council is the best to lead a consultation with their community and not to have a fixed position as we go into that consultation process and I'm really pleased that the Environment Committee with its responsibility for transport is able to now engage directly in that consultation favor say aye those opposed say no and just is there anyone else that wants to have their opposition recorded so jana johansson and david east recorded that motion has passed thank you um
The next item on the agenda is the resolution to exclude the public do I have a mover for that Phil Clearwater second up by Jimmy chin I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no let's carry
Meanwhile cool move on to item teen the trans-pacific partnership agreement and and I'm tabling the written report from Genevieve just far on behalf of the the renewables moderator group who were unable to make beer deputation today so that is now table there's a technical problem with the screen but the as you can see the staff recommendation something notes that the nature of the decision being sort of the council is largely political and the emphasis on small p not capital P I think that was the point made by genevieve am here written submission that she would have made if she'd been here and so so the council was as free to adopt whichever courts course of action but obviously we need to resolve to receive the report and the question as as do we then also take in one of the courses of action that have been proposed and I don't have a particular sphere from colleagues as to which way they would like to to handle this and we would be making a recommendation to the full council rather than rather one option is to receive the report and then refer the report to the council and if people want to do some talking about amongst themselves about what how they would like to you know resolve further than that then they could do so between now and the council meeting next week and that would be a good way of of moving things along quickly is that all right um just it would be really good to get a bit more extended view from LG MZ that possible I don't know if they ever view but clearly there's significant implications for local government and because it's not being done in public it's really hard to know what they are but I would just I think it's a really good idea to refer it to council can we try and just get a bit more from a nice standing for local government yeah he's dealer yes well and maybe I mean I don't know but people like Jane Kelsey or built there's other people that may have done some work around these sorts't you know we've got some information in the report but maybe just a little bit more around economic issues a may correct for us would be really important I think that we do need to focus our attention on on the local government implications I mean I have a serious you know concern around investor state dispute settlement and and always have had I don't mind government-to-government arbitration and settlements but I really object to private companies being able corporations being able to take on governments I think that that is fundamentally flawed as a model so but but you know that's that's that's with my former central government head-on rather than you know the mayor of Christchurch so I look I'd like us to certainly get the advice from local government New Zealand but I don't think that exploring views that are publicly well known and well documented and people can read for themselves as as of use to the decision that we need to make about how we constructively engage with central government about a decision that they ultimately will report be received and seconded by paul lonsdale but that does mean people you need to give it some thought between now and the council meeting so and if you could circulate that meeting result other information from local government New Zealand as soon as possible that would be great yep so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried
Too easy it's too late you should have seen something much more controversial exactly okay we'll move on to the littleton port recovery plan and I assume that mr. Turner would like to move that and that mr. Scandrick would like to second it so is there any sort of preliminary comment that the staff would like to make or maybe there any preliminary comments you'd like to make or you just just quickly I'd like to draw 18 technologies a couple of small errors in the report which oh that's bad I think we get to the questions going perhaps current just clear those up with four counts of eternity shot and so on page 73 yep in four point one point five in the table there the second box down and the final sentence says the hearing panel will decide on final draft recovery plan that the hearings panel should should read the hearings panel will make recommendations to e can Andy can must consider those but is not bound by them and also on page 76 at the very bottom of the preparing the recovery plan sets with e can it actually sits with LPC and Sierra and he can have a smaller portion of that and but once he came has those recommendations it then presents the draft to the minister who then goes through the public notification beresfield yep yep Andrew thank you um so the recovery plan working party has been formed and had a number of meetings we so far have met with representatives of the Littleton port company had a tour of the pork which was particularly interesting and at our recent meeting earlier this week met with Commissioner Peter Skelton which allowed us to discuss a number of issues with him I've got to say the the tone of that meeting was was very open and certainly II kind of very keen to include us as a stakeholder and include our input at all stages of the process we had some very good conversations around timelines so that we can effectively feed into the work that they're doing and in particular work around the correlation between the work in our own district plan review work on on the port zone and alignment without with the recovery plan as well so certainly that meeting was some was very constructive and I think it's fair to say the working group were quite comfortable with the the tone and the contents of that meeting as well our engagement with the port has also included some conversation with them about the port Littleton our future document which has been put out one of the early things that we identified was that that was quite light in detail on the cruise ship aspects of port operations and since then the port have put out a two pager which is on the website which details in a lot more detail their thinking and opportunities around cruise and since then of course we've had our own internal meeting separate from the working passing on on cruise which is is quite encouraging the other area that we felt the port's document was quite light on was the aspect of which key which we was pleased to see included in scope of the recovery plan and in regard to Norwich was particularly interesting our understanding is that even though Norwich key doesn't feature to any great extent in the port so an engagement document it is of course in the scope of the recovery plan and there have been a number of comments coming through the various engagement processes on Norwich key which the portal forward in the normal way despite it doesn't form too much of their document itself so yeah all in all the working party making good progress stakeholder meetings have been held with the port good level of engagement there and the port of course have been running their port talk operation in little term community engagements and I would again reiterate to all stakeholders and community members that haven't_''_300.41 as yet engaged with the process that this is the opportunity to do so in the first stage of engagement finishes on the twenty-second of August so really there's a limited opportunity for people to have their say in this first part of the process upcoming work of the recovery working with a working party at our next meeting will be receiving which are caused are particularly relevant to the dhampir Dampier Bay public waterfront access proposals so yeah just a brief snapshot of the sort of work that we've been doing all right I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's Carrie thank you all very much
Could people that aren't counselors move excuse me just called the meeting back to order with people who aren't counselors please leave the table and the people people who are count and people who are counselors please sit down thank you and we're going to start up with the item number seven that natural environment recovery program quarterly progress report and it's very good to see Chrissie Williams and Clive Appleton and oh that Mike tilan agin Thank You Chrissy do you want to set offer as at Clive going to and think he and the end so this is a regular quarterly report it was only two months ago that I was here last but that's because this this report has come sooner after a report to the recovery strategy Advisory Committee and on the 11th of july so hopefully we'll be able to keep their get between the two presentations and closer and for the next reports just before I start with another just the au ty trust that Eden Project were referring to as the EU tight a goofy Noah trust reserved that was anyhoo tie in our nine nine hundred that was taken by the public except for the wastewater in 1959 t56 so we knew they were talking about that a hoot I'd trust they're talking about that trust of landowners near the avian Heath could easily if you tell us so I just want to make a year no no we did understand that and I think that it was that particular claim that Rick tow me chand and has welcome to us when we were elected yes now what would be is okay so so back to the noob and I think Clyde's raised in the report raise the number of issues that more recent and have come up through this quarterly report I'll just mention two or three others you'll know very well that the Sarah have started the consultation on the residential red zone for one mechanic really just district council and I encourage you to have a look at that site and then how their consulting on that so and it is an interesting process where any any viewers view as any other way so that doesn't seem to be any recognition of where people come from or who they are so that may be something you want to think about when you're consulting with sarah about the engagement process on the residential red zone and christchurch and I just on that I've had a very clear director from the chief executive that II can from the chief executive advisory group that the nupe should not be seen as supporting any particular project involving residential reads only and so my role is there to be and support and to assess I just I just I want to really make make the kit as staff I think in all the organizations we've been given that directive so and it includes an additional inclusion of logos on various documents the other other wishin to what Clive has reported on as and with the flat water lake proposal sport Canterbury have picked up the mental on liaising with all the flat water sports and organizations to get some agreement about what the proposal or preferred option is and that needs to be done is still sitting it at the side of the work that their sport Canterbury start going in and it will probably come later on after visiting to a red zone discussion but there is a lot of technical feasibility we required of that Lake was to go would go ahead or to go through the through to feasibility and as far as the rest of the actions I think that the waist work on waste that has been reported to urine committee on the twenty-ninth of july an excellent report from an columbus and the rest of the team from that group and including report on asbestos and you're probably familiar with the work that environment canterbury are doing on the on the hail identification sites and the letters that have gone to to homeowners or property owners who may have some contamination and and the airplane has been had quite a lot of public and consultation and the discussion recently so though those are just just some projects the other thing I just I wanted to mention was I'm the second of stakeholders and we had 60 people and function center downstairs we had a series of presentations on and the central city work from ccd you from Clive on stormwater on community gardens and even forests from the soil and health association on the white a quarry sanctuary in the hangar k exemplar and all say Andrew cross and talked about the changes to bird populations and and that forum was really well received we've got excellent feedback on it for for that presentation we prepared a number where we prepared three information sheets and we had other information from other sources available to people who were at that and I've got a copy of the three nuclear and information sheets I've got those two to pass around to you and that our intention is to have similar information sheets on all the 17 projects front from the nerve and the feedback suggested that we should make more frequently than annually for that that ketchup forum so be planning something early in 2015 and one suggestion is that we may have a series of presentations perhaps at lunch we're thinking about that format and it will also making sure that there's good time for discussion in work shopping with the the people that our team before him so I think that was all I was going to go to raise but happy to answer questions Yanni alright Jimmy you can ask a question please simple question is where we could the repo thank you yeah I just wondering regarding to Lisa 17 project some of them have come please intake Assemblyman didn't have for instance like a project 15 my understanding phase one day already done in my life the managing contaminated sites already done per phase two is waiting for under development so whether we can separate in a different computing here we are fully understand this kind of job provision has been developed for interface white and there are 0 the first order pending under the webmethods to now give us overall the progress is possible now I mean the completion date the date here I'm 15 we haven't filled in the writing columns is that what you're saying yeah and the food column but we're happy to are happy to fill in the game when they obviously on second thank you um no thanks you see I just want to ask you you referred to the possibility of a recreational Lake my understanding of the water retention basins and in the southwest part of our city is that the model works pretty well and I just wondered but how how you think that model might say be adapted for the lower avin to and perhaps still allowing for some water sports as well but I'm talking about what a series of retention basins was best for the flood routing flood retention I think that's for you to ask your staff who are doing doing the modeling around the flood flooding I mean in my understanding is that those retention basins are bitter in the further up the catchment I'll leave it to your staff to answer that maybe today or another time it's pretty much the southwest area the the basins are at the headwaters other catchments and that's where it works best reaches the Avon or something that's this further investigation required in order to determine how effective they will be I think for any flat water sports like the discussion around how variable the deeps can be and still be a working make as probably could come into that is right probably if I just add to that also that with the model is it's two folders both about water management in terms of volume but also very much around water quality management and the cascading form of the small small retentions actually allow us to polish the water and take you out nutrients and sediments much more effectively than large single catchment Lakes so there's a whole variety of values that we're trying to address through the solutions that we're promoting he attem I'm just looking with regards to number 16 DM figured break if it's on an emissions and equality the obviously the rates have just gone up and powers got as any work with regards to people making economic decision to use fires more rather than heat pumps and others do clean air and warm houses what what the health effects what what overlays one over the other and that's been a discussion for many many years around the development of the airplane chapter and the in our RP and I mean again it's not an area that I'm intimately involved with it's been I know that an environment canterbury staff have found that incredibly difficult to get information about what people are using the heat source even before the earthquakes but afterwards in the word changes and when people had lost chimneys with different appliances were put on to replace those loss of chimneys and so it's the that information is hard to get but I think from the earthquake point of views as far as air quality goes it's what percentage of the current air emissions around dust emissions rather than the emissions from fires so and again that's quite hard to discern thank you I'm clean and if you want presentations on that your plan I can certainly arrange it with a counselor clean PQ thank you for this report of those would be good very intriguing to hear what happens when you know the birdlife where there once was residential but my question is about the a biodiversity proposal that's been floated and how this connects up whether you would see that as pep something that just this council would pursue or whether you would have a direct role and kind of not brokering but getting it till it too lenient with us do you see that which book which professor holland's column MOOCs you're talking about the white a Kirby century no just his overall concept of a biodiversity relationship with the council I think you need to the nupe is around earthquake response and quick recovery and many people including Colin are seeing opportunities and the recovery for advancing various projects and ideas and I mean Collins proposing the perimeter trail what noticed he's got a group and in the white a canary sanctuary columns involved with it with a gain quite a wide-ranging group of agencies and individuals as I see that the beginning my role is to sit beside those people to promote especially fits residential read zone in so I don't know whether they answers your question oh that's okay I think it's probably our role to miss you any kind of strategy or relationship over there which is not specific party and I think I mean by verse biodiversity is one out camel or 1s speak but there's a whole lot of other aspects of them again for the century that you here today about tourism and so does whole lot of other wider issues that you need to find that balance around yeah II thank you for the report um I just um under Section five where it says ccdu anchor project to Papa atacado open River precinct providing limited stormwater treatment some stormwater treatment and East frame now given the extent of the flooding impacts that we had in in these areas that really concerns me where are we at in terms of the avon river hundred-million-dollar precinct taking into account issues around stormwater because it it's if it's just a limited it it seems a bit of a lost opportunity you talking about storm water quality are you talking about water water quantity in flooding because that quite different issues in the central city right it was really still mother treatment so I mean I think one of the goals is to clean up a river and obviously the way storm what is treated as it goes into that aven rivers probably pretty important yeah I mean again I can't speak on behalf of CC to you in the work they're doing I am an observer on their project steering group and and aware of some tension between an River works and flood which is a probably a different question as your weave for stormwater treatment it's very difficult to do to retrofit stormwater treatment and but Clive has referred to this and his report so maybe something he can okay in the process of finalizing the apron stormwater management plan and looking at locations for stormwater treatment facilities and management of stormwater as a holistic approach right across the catchment and it's looking at a range of options and obviously the central city is is are working with ccd you in looking at streetscapes the design for stormwater treatment options in that area from tree pets through the rain gardens pervious surfaces pavers that sort of thing to try and maximize stormwater treatment options within that area so it's and it's also working with building owners as well to look at on slide stormwater treatment options so it's it's a partnership with ccd you and doing that like the chicken and the egg maybe but you know if you're designing an even river precinct and you wanted environmental values to be kind of you know as part one of the key reasons for doing that the plans that we see is putting a lot of hard surface down and we haven't had detailed design but that's what you can see from the images that are being produced should we not get the storm water management plan for the avon river sorted first so that they can design to it rather than had them spend all this money do the work ahead of us having actually a plan around invited to help with the design of the major street escapes through the power and main transport corridors and I haven't seen those those final plans but I know that they have our engineers have been working quite closely on what they see as is desirable so in terms of the avon river pressing that that's also being done they're working with them yes they have been working to some degree in the past so when can we get like a plan of what we're doing to get stormwater treatment around the auvergne of a press think you'd have to ask ccd you for that and remember that they are including quite a lot of repairing planting more on the true left bank the true right tends to be that I guess the more developed area or that does change a little bit as you go along the river so there is riparian planning but again upset tension between putting too much friction into the rubber channel and and impeding water flow for flooding so and get the group that group that incredibly aware of so they're on the site by site so they're not having some blanket think of something that you don't think it's an emerging issue like it's not recorded as an emerging issue we just watch it no sorry that our engineers are fully involved in the process they've been involved in of course EO psychology have been contracted along with other contractors to work on on the plan and implementation of of development of the Avon precinct thank you in Colin MOOCs advisor to that group as well I'm just on page 54 6 and 14 I know that you've got the waist and environmental management team and they said that there's been these collaborations of highlighted potential issues regarding asbestos demolition that in dust dust management I just don't know if someone could tell us what those issues were which season sorry I'm just in the third bullet point down land remediation and construction which them but justice and transport precincts it's these collaborations of highlighted potential issues regarding asbestosis demolition waste and dust management again that what I know CCD you are treating all of all of the east framers potentially contaminated and they will be doing site-by-site_:_1172.26 sampling and inspections and in mitigating appropriate depending on the disturbance to the soil and and each on each side so they are very very aware of that and spend a lot of time thinking about the contamination and and how they can mitigate and make sure they don't expose it for other health reasons or environmental impact but what this tends to imply is that people have been exposed to it in the justice and transport precincts where the works already started and that there hasn't been sufficient mitigation of the issues but I mean it could be wrong no that's a big conclusion to make from there but maybe we could get through the CA um some information back over what those issues were because I guess is increasing which you see you referring to um number number 14 14 these are quite new projects these are projects that have been done you know in recent time not not two or three years thats it something taken but we've got collaboration but if there's that have been raised in new projects I think that's pretty alarming and I think we need to just understand what those issues are and what we can do differently these aren't new projects these this is lee existing land it's had previous possible contamination from previous activities on it so and then make CC to you and making sure that they're not disturbing lean until they know what some of it until they know what something but things like dust management demolition waste I mean that is all directly related to the work on those specific sides so clearly that stuff has only just happened recently though so I think just getting a bit more understanding about what those issues were and what's been done to address and would be really good I thought the WIMP team had had reported to Environment Committee recently about their work they did and that report is yet to come to counsel but sauron environmental committee looked at those issues in made some additional recommendations a final question for me was on page 56 of our report which was the risks and opportunities for introducing more resilient systems not taken because of a focus on repairing infrastructure project three and five I know last time we had this report an emerging issue was skirt had a different view of what they should do in terms of standards and in terms of doing things differently that's been removed from an emerging issue your risk mitigation is strong and frequent engagement which means cirrus ccc and skirt but it seems still that that's not that's not actually going to address the problem and so I really want to know what has skirt done differently to address that emerging issue other than just being engaged with which I mean we've engaged with them as well but we haven't seen much change okay I think we've also got some previous resolutions around alignment with the land drainage men and the nerve so I think we do need to start getting feedback about what we're actually doing because I see it's been seen anything back as to why that's the case okay um Tim I'm there five six and 17 are all about the waterways are they so five what are they being a locked at all connected completely or because I mean we've talked a bit about the avon river and it just seems every now and then that the heath care ever seems a bit of an afterthought although there are different and I'm just wondering are these going to be looked at at the same same time so if we're going to come up with say treatment for storm water too would that suit both r of us but would we are going to storm water management plans for the rest of the city catchments and for the settlement areas where we had stormwater infrastructure on banks peninsula and we'll be looking at exactly the same matters for storm water treatments and also detaining storm water where we can so the work particular where as I say is full technical work for the storm water and the avon river has been completed and work for the remaining catchments so the heath queda is going to be looked at this financial year thank you good so who would like to move that the report we received Paul lonsdale seconded Thomas Kendra I put emotion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that's Carrie
Thank you very much move on to the land use recovery plan update and for that we have John and John okay is that right this and um just to get the motion on the chamber I'll move that in many recovery pain update staff recommendation and sick and die by Phil clearwater so would you like to give us a quick update on it thank you this is a quarterly report updating you on the five actions which have got time limited target's coming out to the land use recovery plan alert was gazetted by the minister back in December last year and there are five actions that that are reported on here supporting measures to encourage intensification exemple our projects and as a table giving an update of where they are progress on the house it has a new zealand master plan areas the enhancement of key activity centers and infrastructure alignment through that long-term plan process probably all I need to say the report is pretty self-explanatory all right any questions wishes all right I shall put the resolution all those in favor say aye it
Put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried out and the next item on the agenda I'm just is the Christchurch Central Parking plans and we have Mike tilan and we have Tim chesebrough and we have Ruth Hudson thank you would you like to would you like to take us through the the plan and the purpose of the crash at Central Parking pan is to provide a key source of information on the current and future availability of parking in the central city and it's mainly for council the crown and the private sector so it's a key source of information the parking plan is part of the accessible City work program it was one of the first priority and we brief and cancel less on it on 19th of May and then we were requested to come to our care and to endorse the parking plan that's why we're here today and the parking plan is a non-statutory document and it's a live document so that we really want to keep it updated monitor the parking supply and demand across the central city and the plan forecast the current and future parking demand and supplies so we're looking at both the short term so they're from now to the next three years we've got a model around that and then we've also got the long-term demand so in 20 41 what are we expecting to see in terms of parking and demand from the city the parking plans based on the recovery plan and the lime juice forecasts in that so that shows us the number of people living and working in the central city and visiting the city we've used this data to estimate roughly what this future supply and demand is for a range of activities through the central city from offices retail hospitality and residential and the parking plan identifies likely locations and quantity of parking facilities that are needed to support some of the key precincts and destinations around the central city I guess the the key priority and recommendation for us is that council should be focusing on the short stay visitor parking visit the city for that sort of three to four hour and period and rather than focusing on long stay commuter parking and which we hope to meet by and I guess more people walking cycling and traveling by other modes and so we by focusing on their short stay parking and can do that through the rebuild of our own parking facilities so we're working through the Litchfield and crossing decisions on that and by working with the private sector and to facilitate and the supply from the private sector so the parking plan is really an information tool too and so that everyone has got the same information on future demand supply to help with those conversations it's about information sharing and making sure that their needs are met across the city and then we want to work with the private sector to help make informed decisions that they can decide on their own and parking provisions and opportunities to be involved in parking and we've developed parking model and which will be using to monitor the changing situation in parking there's a short-term using that to identify temporary parking sites around cincy so as we see the rebuild sort of progress we can monitor that situation and keep looking for a temporary sites around the city to make sure that there is adequate supply around the city addressing some of the hot spots that we know there are now and then the long-term demand is about trying to inform where we might put future parking facilities and and having that information publicly available so that anybody has access to information so I guess if the plan is endorsed and would like to start communicating and sharing this information with the private sector and hold some information sessions and get the information up on the website so that everyone can start using the same so what and one of the questions that I have is that I wonder whether it might be better before we endorse the plan that the that the committee that Phil clearwater cheers the Environment Committee perhaps held a public workshop with interested parties to actually workshop the plan and then bring it back for endorsement and I know that that we endorse the plan the way it is today and then go out for sort of socialization but it seems to me that it might it might be elements of it that could that could be that could come up in a post endorsement environment that we would then have to review because it's a living breathing document as you've seed and I just wonder whether they're actually socializing at on that way through the Environment Committee with the you know people that will have a significant I mean people always have something to say about parking and and cycling and public transport on that interface and I just wondered it wouldn't hold things up because I think they've got a meeting on the twenty-sixth of August well how does that how would that feel oh yeah that would work well we could do that I mean I think the key thing is that this is a resource really for to keep people informed so more than happy to put in that extra loop and have that consultation through the Environment Committee before we well then I will move that the report be referred to the Environment Committee on the twenty-sixth of august and and that we I mean know that may not be the date for the public workshop but that it would be in order to in order to progress a public workshop particularly with with stakeholders I think would it be worth or just a workshop with stakeholders in order to yeah but yeah and then bring it back here for endorsement yeah yeah come back from the committee for endorsement me and then just reported through this all of it yeah the report it through yeah reported back through to council after if the Environment Committee will report it to us yeah after the public workshop yep yani thank you um we going on page no no I don't want to go through the pain and because this is the notice us because I think it's relevant to the financial situation that we're own that we're going out for a financial consultation on certain before and what I really want to understand is we've got feel for how that money's going to be speed I mean some of its already been committed but can we get a memo around their decisions that we're going to have to make as part of the long-term plane so this is a a framework for a parking plan which is a living breathing document so I don't want to sidetrack onto the onto the decision-making layers as part of us going to the environment to a committee that we do get an outline of the financial no no this is the parking plane there's a terminal or watch it below sighs well there's all this money being committed or beg mentioned without any specific amounts and I just find it really hard to embrace even when it goes to Environment Committee to endorse a plane without understanding in if we want to provide a building at Manchester straight or ledge field street or this is how much it's going to cost if this is not this is not the purpose of the plane it's a regular opportunity to make those decisions about going to come I mean it's not coming right now this is a framework for decision-making on budget for car parking this combines public car parking and private car parking if for the public car parking we spend the money on one we can't spend it on the other it's quite simple yeah Michael would you like to I think I mean you've hit it on here this is a resource document that informs decision making both for ourselves and for the the private sector when I think in some respects the decisions around how a win will invest in car parking that they're going to emerge over time we made some commitments around the overall capacity and obviously but but when and we and how we deliver I think that's going to evolve as the rebuild delivers as well and also what we also know is there's a lot more interest in provision of car parking by the private sector as well so we're trying to be I suppose this resource helps inform the whole discussion and helps us puts us occur around and rebuild starts with cure there will be a timely point of which we need to come back and say now's the time to focus on where we might go in that northeast quadrant of the central city or the southwest quadrant I don't see I don't see it's either front useful or we hadn't have enough information to say actually we know exactly we want to be in five or ten years time with multi-storey car parks what concerns me like today we've got another big announcement for an anchor project which we have no idea about what the car parking provision is so there's all these decisions that have been made in isolation an ad hoc basis is you know things come up or things get decided by the crown or by council but without an overall understanding of what our plan is so that's what concerns me because I don't actually think it's good just to leave it to an ad hoc basis because actually private car parking provision is quite different than public car to do is manage car parking and yes we've got a role to play and so does the private sector so it's actually in this document at the moment is about informing that by actually getting a clear picture of what the overall future demain is likely to be based on our best forecast as ruthless it will continually update those so that as the private sector potentially starts to provide more it may be that the council needs to make less investment or partner with that those providers in different ways equally if we can get some good modal shift going our long-term demand for car parking buildings may shift as well so yes it's important that would go forward plan and this provides the basis for that but but I think those conversations need to happen over time as a sense of where and the pace of development of oles Paul it okay there is a huge amount of interest from the private sector to actually partner up and do stuff with car parking and the biggest concern on hearing from that the the business a CEO who's in a deliberate then someone will deliver it but this capacity and I just want to make a point that we allow you know suburban shopping centers to put two and a half thousand car parks being in an area with very little thought to actually the traffic congestion and the business sector in the city also been a key activity center is looking at some of the capacities that are in this report here around the sort of 500 there's like a mount failure that is going to be acceptable with it for them it's probably not so I think the public workshop as you pointed out vehicle that would be a good idea to figure out and tease out some of those capacity issues and what I really like about it is the other guiding principles you know to establish them from the outset and I think you'll get a lot of public by and for the principles and then there'll be a debate about where the the public car parks will be allocated and a lot of that has be allocated because our primary focus is the Caesars to prioritize public short stay parking visitor to support businesses and I mean that's priority number two in that list I'm assuming they're not in any particular order but the first one is to provide parking to support economic vitality and it makes absolute sense so but weird private sector are delivering for their their long-term parks they may infect want to see some you know short-term parts made available as well so I think this is a really good place to start that that socializing this plan because you know if it goes out after we have endorsed it and then people say well actually this principle here actually conflicts with you know another one or something you know then we won't have had that discussion food so I think that having the public engagement with stakeholders through the relevant committee and then reporting back to us I think we'll get it will get a really good place good good result so um your second up Paul on style it counts the Jones would you motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried thank you
I think here take that the reporters read I just draw your attention to two parts one is the evidence that we have moved into really a joined-up process for communication and working with other agencies so quite committed to ensuring good information gets out but that we share information and that the various agencies work together in terms of making sure that we've got the same messages and not bombarded with different issues so lots of community meetings newsletters that are joined up air particularly around most recently the portholes in the flooding and the second part I'll just draw your attention to you would have seen was the response to the issue raised from the community higley pyramid community board and the issue of stopping streets so people mature he can answer any questions that you might have around there so has anyone got any questions Jimmy she's regard into the ANZ the 17 corrective actions council response whether before you'd apply to know whether we're you know bring to the council table give us fully understand how to respond to hear nine you'd like something brought to the council yeah just want to look we can certainly provide you with more detailed information most of them were around issues of our documentation and make sure that's consistent across a very serious of decisions and how those decisions have made and the issue of meeting our secretary time frames which in the face of exponentially increasing applications has been challenging yeah I think the reason I sort of corrected that is that that the nine corrective actions and eight strong recommendations that that's that's what we're dealing with now the 17 corrective actions was the last time that we had an assessment from ions that was the beginning of the process that led to the council losing its accreditation last year so we've gone from 17 corrective actions down to nine after a first principle review essentially because we're starting from scratch it's we're being assessed by ions as if we have never been a building consent authority before so actually I think that that the two things that I would just note from previous exit interview that again started the process that lead to losing accreditation there were no elected members there and the chief executive wasn't there either nor was the head of the department that was under review this time we had the lot where the chief executive the mere but the chair of the rig's consent and the deck with each year and we had the senior management leadership team author of the department itself so I think that and the message that we got from ions was even from the outset of their visit was that the cultural change was palpable you know they they were they went from being an organization that was placed in a room where people were sent to to a an opportunity to freely range throughout the department speak to anyone and and get a very favorable reaction in terms of the way people were so open and wanting to be able to be assist and I think they left with a very clear understanding that both from a governance and management point of view we understand why accreditation is so vital tick the boxes but we actually want to be delivering an excellent see us and I think that that was quite a significant change from last time tell me just follow on from that Jimmy that the nine corrective actions our staff were aware of ions I acknowledge that so it's just working together on the process and it's answered our staff have done an amazing amount of work and we've got to a great spot so yeah um then thank you I appreciate the bar is high and needs to be but zero sense in which there's an appreciation of the earthquake given the in a species you know that your comment coming about that exponential growth which we face and we notice being on the content committee his aliens really pretty and Christchurch unique differently it might be reasonable to to do that there's been an investment of 10 million dollars and a crown manager yeah I did raise it because in the governance role because in the response was was that they can't legally move outside the framework that they have with the minister and I've also raised it in the exit interview in order for MV to be aware that you know that although we we were improving our time frames there was this potential you know sort of tsunami of applications you know that could be unleashed at any time and so the the number of applications were going up but our our record was improving it is not perfect by any means they have to judge against the criteria that they have they can't make an exception for us as a building consent authority they don't have the power to do that but we are certainly engaging with mb and and ultimately the minister if we were to get that but I think that if ions are satisfied that we are on that trajectory and that we have the process of them place where we can you know sort of step up if we need to pull an additional resource if we need to use other building consent authorities if we need to then I think that will be enough to meet the test day ants comments probably the most difficult requirement to overcome will be that statutory one of meeting 20 days turnaround and I think the perdon thing to note it is that although our our volume is increasing and our ability to process within the statutory time frame is also increasing we are likely to probably peek at the the maximum sort of number early next year but April May next year and I think as long as we keep closing that gap as we reach our peak we will actually satisfy I ends on that matter and hopefully I think as we answered we have the capacity to utilize some external BCA's to a greater level and I think building on that we will get very close to if not exceeding that the time limits and only once we get over that hump next year will obviously be in a much better space to continue meeting on a continual basis that statutory regulation of complying the 20-day tune around so I'm very comfortable with the the work that's being done in the unit at the moment and reinforcing culture change within the unit and things are moving along very well so hopefully in the next few months will see a shortening up of that and and gradually gradually meeting those required times great I felt I'm just like that you're carrying for the financial information you've given us some of the earthquake recovery costs and and it's clearly significant that the year spin is 318 million dollars below the budget and I think I've indicated to you that I'd be interested in seeing our all of their capital projects yeah I guess out for several years taking it and looking at what I guess you what cost savings week or we may be able to make from Kiev you're looking at the carrot carry forward air speed or their budget so those cost savings a result of having in the budget projects which hadn't been started such as the metra sportscenter so they're not cost savings and offense but obviously committed in future years so that's the information you want and it's probably particular on our own's just interested in the oven side gasa straight intersection I think there's some rural areas have concerned that the horizontal infrastructure growth whoever's making these decisions is allocating funding to do amenity enhancements without a report coming to council as well so previously we had a report come to council I think there's about a million dollars extra funding that was requested and we were told that was because it was betterment now we're being told that actually that funding was a just through that internal growth without any call one council now given our financial pressures I think it does raise quite a serious concern over how we're control in what expenditures good and the partners are putting towards the horizontal infrastructure because if this is seen as a priority over fixing our else water pressure main which amping folks I have real concerns so thanks for the report on this one the other since so the first question is really what financial prudence are we over overlaying with a current financial situation and what skirt are actually doing where they are actually was in light of the fact that we now have to go up for consultation which is good why is the school project happening ahead of there where's the synergy between sorry which page is the schedule c 5 is there's no page or my own agenda but it's the even side gloucester street yeah most intersection changes what what do you what party referring to with the skirt stuff though um well we're sittin here yes it is no but weird I just want to see so I understand funding model home advice with regard to the funding model under clause afford this proposed intersection layout change the operations group with under proposed changes from within existing operational budgets or horizontal infrastructure so let's make about I think it was about three quarters of a million dollars and previously we had a report asking us to authorize that expenditure we didn't do that but now is to have been allocated and I just really want to understand what controls we have in place but I also wanted to understand given that we have do believe is the right thing to do why the skirt project that's part of it is already underway it seems like we should actually be going out for consultation at start rather than halfway through I think there's three things here one is that with what we have been talking about ensuring that when we repair a piece of road or something like a bridge that we make sure that we coordinate all the work that needs to happen instead of having you know a piece of road dug up three or four times so here's the reason that these sorts of things are considered together people respond to the issue about consultation and Jane around the Sun burning I think at the moment in terms of the concern that Sarah temple to express to you was of course the board have been advised clearly an energy or CD at the seminary Gina they were going to go to consultation in August as a result of the council resolution as I said in the report I ensured that in fact no further work was being done the information together and came back to the council I think at the moment mine stands and Jane will be able to comment further on this is the staff and now in effect assessing afresh in light of the advice around the need for the public process in terms of what is the best solution for that particular intersection in the bridge but clearly I think fundamentally as I say at the end they need to come to the community board and have that conversation with the board members at the very least in terms of the various options that are open to them become the bridge hasn't stopped has it sorry the word on the bridge is the work and the bridge has been repaired you correct and brilliant of the mid-2015 date yes which is which is kind of like you've got two projects the only reason the other project was happening because it was because of a bridge and now you got one project that's been put on hold and the other projects going ahead and we haven't done the community consultation I be raising this as we're at a stage now because we're so frustrated with the lack of synergy with the skirt repairs and what the community aspirations and what what the local board view may be that we actually want the detailed designs on every project that skirt are doing in our ward coming to our board before it's committed to so that we can actually approve it like we used to do with normal road reconstruction or appears so that we can actually at an early stage identify clearly what the issues are and actually have a conversation with local communities over what the impact of the repairs are going to be and what the final design is going to look like so I'm not sure that this I don't think it's possible for every single Scout project to go to community boards it's just not possible I mean in terms of the extent of the work that they have to do it's we're the direction of traffic and thanks though with weather actually doing Road renewal and construction that of the road when they're putting it back so they're either doing it back as it was or they're doing it in a different way but that was probably the area we usually have the most discretion around doing things that are not miss sue more expensive but in a different oh yeah I think with is where there's major change that there is I mean yeah I mean I'm sort of kind of reluctant to say that that's the best approach right across the board when I don't actually know the scale of what you're asking for I think I think the community board will as part of our delegation review which we need to do for our community boards this will be one of the issues that gets raised it really comes out of the frustration that by the time we get start week notice it's too late to have any meaningful influence over the design so if you think of places like peterborough street do you think of some of the other streets we needed an early stage so that we can give local feedback and advocate for our community and we not get been given that opportunity so some you might just put back as they work some you might want change but who's making that call at the moment is not the elected members not the local community it's this kind of growth that we don't have any visibility of so we have to look at a different way of doing it so that we don't get into these frustrating situations tell I'm okay understand we yarn is coming from but I think that for the skirt projects who to go to community boards that would really slow the whole process down so would could become quite unworkable I agree with yanni that needs to be a stronger governs from Council around knowledge about the skirt proteins and that this is perhaps where it should count but I would be very reluctant to and I don't think I'd be reluctant to support decision that in fact would change the process completely the secret process David pull young different day that particular Street what we may be able doing I'm not quite sure Sharon see what they get out 4a from G to be maybe or two year for programs that is the opportunity to have that timing conversation the issue is that the delegation scared through that the actual pool or city with Sarah and not with ourselves yeah well yeah let's have a further conversation about it because I'm that this was the experience very early on on the piece I mean you know brand new beard sitting there reading these papers and thinking why the hell are we making a decision about spending money on a bigger pipe you know blah blah and then it occurred to me part way through and largely off the issues that counselor Johansson has raised which is that when scoot are looking at the potential for betterment and they come to us with a proposal that there's a betterment allocation from the from the fund for that which is just a Boris burrowing facility I think people think there's money sitting there waiting to be spent the ground you know so that when they're looking under the ground they're very clear about what they want to propose by way of bitumen because it will improve the infrastructure of the city but they really look above the ground so when we're looking at roading when we're looking at neighboring facilities and this came up with the tannery you know that that you don't look around while you're doing for example one thing you might want to be looking at a parking plan you want to transport management planned around what is a really dangerous corner you might want to think about access to the river all of these other things which don't fit within the skirt budget but actually are exactly the sort of things that I would have thought that the betterment allocation was always designed for so you know so maybe Dexter that's what we should get out of this is that where we can see that there's a you know and and by looking forward that two years where we can see that there might there might be an allocation from the betterment fund the other things that we want to have in front of the council as well as the bigger pipe so does it does that make sense you are core I thank you you've actually brought up exactly what we're talking about as place local tannery there are groups out there that actually worked incredibly hard place to earthquake to think of how the street could be better and I think it's really interfacing with those groups and with the community board on some of the aspirations we have for certain areas doesn't_''_1331.83 if you're right across the board we don't need to know yes it means that scoots got to be part of that process and even though they have delegated authority to do various things and the chief executives delegated to make calls on various things it might be better to think like a little bit more outside the square for some of these projects and say well actually let's look at the betterment opportunities for the area rather than just looking at and see whether we can actually bring that conversation obviously it has to come back if there's a second come back yeah there's no money sitting out here and skiers is very good at briefing about what it's doing it's not set up to engage with the community boards or the community about whether to do it or not I mean that was the mistake that we made with the wastewater the pressure sewer system so yeah courage and has done an exceptionally good job at that yeah yeah but this is where I mean and what the court has reminded us is that our legal obligations to consult with our communities is not overridden by the creation of the scoot model yeah all right so so so Dave you'll come back to us with some ideas around there yep excellent it's really important but the cycleways the the master plans and we've got the natural environment rivara Graham so they're the three things that seem to be missing so what we get when we get a quality but we get a with just one line we don't get any detail of what the actual project is of how much is being spent of what the proposed design is going to be so because we don't get that we get a start with notice two days before the work starts that by that stage it's too late so you know if you look at humphreys drive along the coastal edge if you look at fury road through where we've got a main plan master plan for main road and you just see stuff going back as it is it just we've repeatedly raised us with skirt for the last two and a half years through the community and this is what I'm saying this is not some skirts business you know it is our business business no it's our business and conjunction with Sarah we've got a we've got three agencies involved as clients of the skirt the skirt does not have an independent decision-making role it delivers you know there was a really good Auditor General report into skirt and it was provided to it by ciara and by authority so I'd really like today's us what's we're the authorities yeah yes steps were taken to address that concern it's NZTA Christchurch City Council and Sarah and Sarah have the final sign-off on on projects you know in terms of the horizontal infrastructure cost share can we do to some sort of and I think this is our role provide leadership by way of overall coordination I take a case where we're at a midway street meeting the other day we would be good to have coordination overskirt in naval and our arborists so it's it to have a joint up approach with the residents so that you know you're not reading up streets skirts going in one way across the city and abel's go in the other we're trying to do trees so I think if we could take the lead and actually it's the coordination would you set up a whole lot of this yet and take communities with us I think the socio has enabled us to articulate so and would someone like to move that the chief executives report be received that's Paul lonsdale seconded Glenn Livingston and
Professor David Simmons to address us on the New Zealand even project mountains to the sea your worship councillors thank you for inviting us here this morning just going to digress just um so you're fine may your worship and just say I'm really in lien daylight I prefer to call you do that and that is just the same terms of that last presentation I think that's outstanding and you know that the government has our has 10 National Science challenges I'm on the interim governance group to resilience to nature's challenge and what they're looking for is not more science about when things are going to happen but about societal resilience here I think this can be socialized nationally I think that we can develop the templates on that and again Christchurch show leadership in that space so I'm just going to say that I think that is exactly how I understand resilient sim Bhullar I'll be doing it I'll respond to that so since we're sort of completely off the subject but already we could know because the independent review of the civil defense response to the februari earthquake was that the community groups that responded and I mean that included the student volunteer army and you know community groups they like act us and Littleton project and all of those that they were to be brought together so that they could design a range of community response templates themselves as community groups but an actual fact what happened was that they were brought together and asked to provide their ideas to the organization to take them away to develop and so the essence of the recommendation was lost but I don't think that we have lost the opportunity and we can see here one community group that has some pre-existing social capital which is it has translated into action and a post disaster environment and that is the learning we have to capture and not just for our city but for the nation as a whole so you know totally with you and if we're going to be part of that science challenge we would love to you know play a very proactive role here to show my name is David Simmons I am I have two jobs I am the drinkery research strategy at Lincoln University and I am um professor of tourism but the first job is so big that it makes me largely the professor of nocturnal tourism but um what I want to talk to you about today is the big idea and we mentioned this to the end yesterday is something we have been working on quietly for two and a half years and we are going public at ten thirty this morning immediately following this so this is the big idea for regenerating the red zone it's based on community event science education and experience and importantly redeveloping Christchurch as a global visitor destination and I've just come to some of those points as we go through but Eden there's a hard concept to get hold of so this was a clay pit in Cornwall formals got a population of 400,000 they moved it from this to this and it is England's number one tourist attraction it has a million visitors a year its space of a decade and it is big our question is or they started with can we take the world's most stare our place and turn it into something that tells us how to live sustainably that brings science and people and resilience and empowerment are together my question is can we go from this the answer is well to what but it obviously has to deal with water it has to deal with flat land and I think if you look at the roof on the top of the other building is limited only by our imagination and so we can harness the science and the communities of what we've got here are to turn this around so Eden UK at about same time as the earthquakes took a decision to in tonight internationalized at product in brand I'm just going to show you a few seconds into this clip because it's a it's on Evans wonderful site and I know after the meeting your rush out and have a look at it but this is ours the biggest building site in Europe at it's not about us this group of people here driving the change that we need to see in order to live in better balance it's about as being a catalyst it's about actually stimulating and inspiring people to say I could live differently or I could know my neighbors differently I could share things differently I could work differently and really unleashing their own individual power these are the great challenges of our time but life event challenges me as any and this is this is our generations chance to rise to the 21st century I believe in people I believe that almost everybody that walks the earth is actually good in inverted they want to do the right thing may they feel pass it another sense of belonging if you can give a crate sense of belonging that's not religious but it's to do with a shared vision is something that we can all buy into I don't think you've even scratched the surface of the power that humans have God sake of tourists I'll just leave it but Evans got and in the space on the avon lake okaro network and the ego space so what's the big issue that we are pursuing for this big idea or one is poor tourism performance so ray and I both work in the tourism sector we wrote or technical advisors to the City Council's our original tourism and visitor strategy and Ray has done a lot of work in its space since the earthquake but fundamentally we are trekking about twenty-four percent below in visitor numbers and it looks like the demand course who has been dumped about 12 years so the government's official forecast for 2 20 19 put us 165,000 international visitors below where we were in 2010 now what the reboot needs is an iconic attraction at community and Convention Center both need feedin and just between that and the next step attractions are the original grain of sand around which the destination purl rows so look at the images on the right and most of us I would imagine recognize more than half of them the pyramids the Eiffel Tower the Statue of Liberty Grand garden on the bay and Singapore and modern destinations evolve around a strong iconic image that speaks to the heart of who they are so we'll hear certain say we shouldn't look past we should look to the future and look to the opportunity provided by the earthquakes we have formed over the last two and a half years a genuine partnership with a hoot I arbequina a trust and and night Harvey I had a wonderful story the other day a Maori told us that we there are original original farms were the rivers this is making a tide we looked after them and they fed us the party ha have come and done the same to the lane they've used that as the garden is their farm we need to step forward into place with our both farms for us so we won't be copying in the sense that they tell the story of plants in human life our story is qtpie from the mountains to the sea the role of water in human life and boy we got some scraps in this part surface of some other places like Africa or or parts of the tropics in other places and for those of you who watch the National Science Space as I must do in my other job the government released the paper last week sir peter Blackman's big idea about citizen science we can't as a nation continue to spend continue to spend 1.2 billion dollars a year on on research on the onset research and science unless we take the people with us we can't achieve our conservation goals and this we are all responsible we can't achieve our water goals and and this and this everybody is in there too in there Walker at the same time I was going to say it's a ginger shot but it might be a water shots I'll move on so we've been going through the initiation phase and we have been cautious under under the guidance we have received from Sarah because the red zone residential land where we want to put this we're where we are determined to put it has been highly contentious water for life trust we have formed a very strong relationship with a hoot a night ah whoo soo through to through Ricky who unfortunately recently passed Deluca rocco we have formed a partnership and an arrangement with Eden UK which gives us in a sense exclusive rights to develop this idea not just a museum but New Zealand and Australia the first time you mentioned this nationally someone suggested it would be good and opened we look that one dolphin that that very early on and we are working closely with the Avon otic our own it work this is so big but only the same size as a covered stadium or a convention center that we really want to do a preliminary project investigate we need to spend a certain percentage of the total budget making sure we understand demand because this will only get across the national threshold not just that we steal visitors from the needn't or do something locally we have to be such an icon that Australians and people across the world the new emerging markets come here to hear about our science brand one hundred percent pure actually has enough substance behind it so we're at the stage of preliminary project evaluation and then these things just other bits just trick long into the distance saima on the ideas guy we have people who do numbers and things later on the first big issue that we've been waiting on is land and we were given up holding our breath waiting for Sarah to show our hand on it but we're telling them we think this is a really good idea and we've got to take the community in the leaders of the community with us on this journey immediate objectives Eden a grunt they're going to come out here in November and we've been speaking to to Eric in particular for whom time and we're very grateful and the N and her team about how we just sponsored it low key in terms of Lincoln University elt has empowered me to be a sort of free agent in this regard they may regret that but meanwhile I've got the ball and I'm running so we want to develop strong community support for a new zealand Eden we want to gain allocation from the red zone and we're declaring our hand we want to build this on the Avon loop the anchor between what's happening in the city and the things that cascade magnificently through communities across ecosystem services the pilot making gift I site out to the sea to Eve you tie the nose of the history itself and of course immediate Objectivist its be robust about the business case we're not going to die in the ditch in it but I haven't heard anyone who's even seen maybe certainly not anyone who said no yet and so then I just want to pause it and go the other side for one moment I think it's our second or third to last slide and it is what is the risk of the opportunity that is not built but is not evaluated we miss the opportunity to provide an attraction of which the people of Christchurch will be proud we miss and where we get an undeveloped and all sorts of business reasons is now called itself the Gateway I grew up in and around farms and most go to be opened and step through but Christchurch is losing at the moment to Queenstown Queens down is growing gangbusters it's got direct flights and Christchurch is becoming sort of a wee bit marginalized and tourists flows but it is certainly not a hands up national destination nor hands up global destination so there is no there is no small earnest this is a think big project a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something really inspiring so we also show up any social and economic loss for the community and businesses so we're back to this does it take to go from that on the left to something really exciting designed with and for young people designed around the business community and designed around the communities on the right hand side of that page we did have one little media preaching about have you got any sketches no because we don't have all the answers but we are we do have the school of landscape architecture at and landscape architecture for project news via and they can design it the other people who live with us we just a Crump you a couple of grumpy old bugger's is being most women mostly our working lives here so we're thinking about what gets left behind when we turn to grains of sand okay so this is who we are ray here and myself on the noisy run and look Perico from yahoo yhoo tie up with finna a trust Jane George from Baker it would be an enormous supportiveness Fletcher's in Warren and Manny so we've got design-build construct science education in tourism all in there we are slowly reaching out to see how much dust we can can gather on this so here we are the mountains to the sea ray is the fall guy for this hello here we are any object in Cornwall a long way away from our friends in New Zealand and Christchurch and we've been hearing about the exciting project that you're planning on the river in Christchurch and we're really excited about what we a really important not only in tourism destination but a place that celebrates the culture of the native New Zealanders and the emerging environmental movement that is coming out of New Zealand right now and symbolically coming out if you like the ruins of the mid dreadful earthquake that you had There I think there is something symbolic be very powerful about a collaboration between two countries to in two individuals here who would feel passionately about creating things that have a narrative about a positive future rather than a negative past so I'm just here to say to anybody was watching this we are really really keen to work with you very excited about potential and the most important thing of all of it is that we don't work with people we don't like and we like this man anything that New Zealand is fabulous so we look forward to singing very rated I won't return another to being afraid man so this that's who we are are we going um welcome to the journey yes oh that he won't expect the I ago in the early stages when when thus was I think even before I was the Emir and so but it's interesting because you know part of the reason that the residential red zone you know public conversation hasn't happened yet and crash it city so it's been launched today out and Waimakariri for their residential red zone is because you know as a city we have some some urgent and pressing needs around stormwater and around man drainage system and and also around stop banks and and and roads so so there are some challenging issues for us and we didn't really want to commence the public engagement around the residential red zone before some of these other issues we're resolve Foo so that we actually knew which areas we were talking about but the community has kind of led the way in the Christchurch City side which of course we appreciate in value very much as a as a council as we heard from that previous submission you know not sitting around waiting for somebody to come and tell them how to organize community itself and then they come and briefed us about what they've done and so you know eastern vision and Haven I takato network you know they have roots quite collaboratively with their communities to start a public engagement and in a in a sort of a putting some of these ideas on the table and to know that that's been launched on their website at the evo space I thought that it was really important that you be given an opportunity to to tell us what what you were doing and how that was engaging with the community engagement so I'm really pleased that you are able to do it so we haven't really got time for for questions but huh I'll take to you I'll take them from the two councillors who represent the avin Luke puts a Yanni and then pool well thank you um it is really exciting it just dawned on me that um in the blueprint night ah who have a cultural center going into Victoria Square and yet what you're talking about is probably just as conversation with night ah who and where Sarah over maybe changing the blueprint and actually looking at what you could do in the oven look I didn't get a sense of we're not a fitter than or where Sarah was it but what will be meeting with Sarah pretty regularly probably every fortnight or or more month this is the the leaders for this in night are who you tie up in FINA what r us to have a who have an extent claim under the right training and the night Tahoe settlement from the Waitangi tribunal and and they are keen to you in a sense give to a partner with us on any land that they that they that may they may secure under the red zone designation the three poised and we believe there was an original par showing my age with a star and garter you deter and and so either I think those discussions are still not still not settled but night are who is aware of the strongest we're but we're speaking to tamer you know linnehan who spent two on who are still sort of thinking about the best ways of representing things I don't want to speak on the other half but they are now well well aware of this they're aware of the cultural sites in the river they're aware of the significance of my anger kind I think it's for them to work through the process and endorse which of a number of options they might have Paul I'd say thank you very much I think you what your very highlighted here is it Christchurch's can become have a future with the tourism sector we need something of scale and importance and as a counselor we own a huge amount of tourism infrastructure putting more than anyone else and and it's really important that we make that work and I think this project is actually brought to light we need to start thinking about these sort of things now so we can actually have a future for our city and that's what they thinks for us to bring a lot of kids highlighting you know because we will the beginning of a beginning of a conversation it's gonna it's going to go on but I mean the one word for me is just legacy you know it's just it's a legacy for the that effort is able to be realized in it will I think capture the imagination of of everyone so thank you very much for for coming brief I'm sorry but we've we really haven't got time so yep that thank you very much and I know that we're going to be seeing a lot more of you yes David yeah thanks cheers thank you thanks to the time right now would somebody like to move that the supplementary reports be included in the agenda for today that's Phil Clearwater and Andrew tuna
That motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now we move on to the chief executives report
And cool for apologies have the Jamie Gough and apology any other apologies I don't think there are any others so would someone like to move that that apology be accepted Andrew tuna seeking to term scandrett I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried really I
And now we move on to deputations but I've had a request that we have presentations first before the deputation so could I invite rachel volunteer Tim Baker and Steve hero from I don't know a community trust that only primary school board of trustees and the pastor of the christ church worship center who are going to present on the Illinois and surroundings district emergency community response plan and I'm absolutely delighted that the Illinois community have one developed an emergency response plan but also that you've decided to come and make a presentation to the council and in this way so congratulations and we're really looking forward to hearing from you thinking I good morning mere and the counselors I think of giving us this opportunity I'm my name is Steve hero and along with Kim Baker and Rachel quality and were brought to go to mentally Bailey who has contributed very much in the staff the proposal or the best opportunities got today so firstly I want to just talk how we actually came about and started but as we all that most of us would like to forget but on their particular day they were in our community we had numbers of ngos service providers agency churches normal thing in the area where we will do a separate things and I was person doing food and and and other agencies were doing other things and it wasn't_''_115.92 till after that that period of the major a period of the earthquake that we realized that maybe we should come together and join forces and so we did that time make a weeks after after the third b22 earthquake and so we started by appending all our agencies agency together and we we felt deal with a huge urgency to maybe it should this develop will grow any any if this happened again would we be ready and so we've put together a plan where we feel as I think it'll be you'll be impressed by the plan that we're putting together how we as the community have worked we're looking at four and a half thousand homes we were affecting the do times where we area that we feel we know that we would be prepared so this morning is that we want to bring that to you the Illinois hub was formed from the earthquake and with again the services of the providers and the NGO di agency churches to it group from the purpose was to and continue to to get together and we will do that today we get together every Tuesday so one need identified the need to be prepared for future emergency situation subcommittee decided to develop a plan here's our plan okay I'm so yeah once again thanks for having us and we're really serious about how we would respond to an emergency and I don't know again since the earthquake and februari not many people have been near our community to say this is what you would do again in a future disaster so we've decided together as a unit to do it for ourselves and lead something ourselves which won't be perfect and it won't took every box by civil defenses measures but at will we will be more prepared very quick to respond and their earthquake to our community purely because we a the Illinois community trust as a community development organization that had been going for 12 years so we already had a lot of networks and we were able to respond quickly to the community and we were able to form our hub group which was the youthquake hug group that met every week after februari and we were able to form a subgroup of that of interested people that want to work on an emergency plan with different people that were representative at the table the bill would Pyxis audits being very supportive and they supplied some funding for us to employ a coordinator that hit a little bit more Nelson us around preparedness and being really in getting through and a disaster so that was greatly appreciated and we were able to kick off a plane so we just wanted to know that a favor and again we were more prepared and when we talk about what's the word that everybody uses resilience resiliency it means a different thing for everybody and resilient can them and we want to make sure that we're more prepared so a min purpose is to guide the community's response to an emergency is enter be as well prepared as we can be so that's our plan the demographic area that we are working with as I don't know a wine only even though I'd incite and that that has four thousand six hundred plus households in it and that comprises of a bit around eleven and a half thousand people so it's a much bigger demographic area then we would normally work with but with its who we set up to doorknock to if we have another disaster again our plan is based on an earthquake in it will be a living document and different different measures will be put in four different disasters that might might happen in Christchurch and we are very very aware that we want to roll this plan out in when it's a very good being able to present the build Pegasus board to the city count so we want to meet with emergency services and the greatest kneaders and christchurch but we want to make him aware that we have a plan and I don't know and if they were to come in if people were door knocking in our area they would come to our HQ first and we would be able to give them a section of area we're different volunteers could go on door knock and they would report back to us and then it would be interred on a database so we could honestly say when people ask us harrods the community doing or within that population demographic that you you decided in those boundaries how are they doing we can honestly say well we've got these different sections that are covered we need more people to cover that area and that's their plan up there but just color-coded watched em we'll talk more about we can honestly say that our people have been doing we know how they're doing and emergency response will act accordingly and you know and they'll be governed by their rules and regs and that they will work with plan and we r sub in what we do have a plan and we will be more resilient of Evans again so Tim if you want to talk about the mapping who had nothing to do over Christmas over Christmas I spend a lot of time working on that big plan and we divided it into between sections have you got ten different areas in that whole area now Rachel's sit around 6,000 4,600 houses I met every single property not house because lot of houses are missing we can tell you their 4639 properties in their area and so what what we what we'll do if we hit another ruse scenario is the Southern Alps or just something up sweet we think we could door knock every house with 50 volunteers and two days and here we do that as we've divided up each section of those ten sections into smaller areas you go out with a partner take a side the road each start knocking on doors between 15 and 30 properties so you can keep an eye on each other and then you go't know a primary school at the stage and then there from there we have the prioritizing of jobs the agent that would go out and get things fixed or people helped from there and the other cool agencies we want to stay independent of Sarah and some of the fence and anybody else but we want to have a relationship with them so that we can keep keep it how we think it would work in our area and a bit less work too well the rest of Crow church is getting emergency response that we're scenario happens but the other thing is too though it's not just to have quake it could be a big huge wind and it could be trees down in the area and it could be rooms that need repairing so we could if we spoke to civil defense and said hey would it be helpful if we go and off on these doors and need to know who needs what doing doing fiber gay could be involved as well so could cover a lot of scenarios I've getting it slide the different interment controlling responsibilities on the day and what we're looking at doing very soon as having a meeting and asking different not individual people about organizations like a church group or a school group or whoever else if they'd like to take on one of those roles and that way of someone leads someone else can take over the role so it carries on that's what an organization taking care of those things forever because it might be 10 years before we need to use it could be next week could be 100 years so don't feel bitter Otto doesn't door knocking so we now we just got the funding that we see before bed a shipping container and it's going at I Doan a primary school we just got to organize what's going on it and it and some fencing and bits and pieces that will be able to soon we've received funding from council to purchase some containers that will be at their hub and it will have lots of bits and pieces and earning around response to buildings will be able to operate we just flip the doors open and we will have stuff in there that will enable us to work with the community to till it's nick stages so that would include a generator and things are there yep yep Nick's january-february the pigs are going in for the new community center and I don't know why naughty and that's also going to act as a civil offense hub sort of thing it's going to be a very resilient building like if a generator was tracked down what or in other then we could plug it in it'll be self-sufficient building so that's where never 18 months we should be operating from the other thing is to communication to the community we thought how do you a long long term how do you communicate to the community make sure people are prepared or let them know as much information that's practical so we're working on a calendar and we're going to put four and a half thousand calendars out in the area and on there preparedness to do water pits food all that sort of stuff and then on the back inside back pages would be a list of that information about the hub what they can do to help an emergency like talk to your neighbors first find out how they are they live as know how you and your neighbors are what needs there are things like that so there's going to be a very important couple of pages we've got a design shortly and we're looking for sponsorship we've got two sponsors so far looking for two more I think it's enough to talk about it I think we should just take questions now fell and Tim thank you very very much that is truly impressive what you've described to us and very timely I think in terms of like from the flood task force plan community sort of emergency response wasn't included as play as part of it it clearly needs to be and is currently going to be a further piece of work but I think you've got an outstanding model and be able to incorporate civil defense and emergency services with you so it's really just how I think you as a community board based and and community a play with your plan even come from the community hell in fact we can reinforce that with to really metropolitan services including civil defense I just made a comment to you really thank you yep I mean you mean chin sponsors I mean this is a chicken tasty what are you are you tagging targeting specific sponsors or are you just looking at June what what are they what are you looking for alphabet for the calendar it's about fourteen thousand dollars to put four and a half thousand up and it's in grayscale and so we've got two sponsorships one as the Lions foundation it's one line zinta nice Lions International sorry they prepare to pay three and a half thousand dollars we've got a real estate agent who's prepared to fight three and a half thousand dollars after selling your house key I wonder which one ampro Qing to others as well and just specifically for the calendar rather calendar the equipment going and now that's been provided by this community board okay I thank you you were granted twelve thousand dollars for the container and and bit of ever tising and things like that clean don't you think you obviously as a member of the board Dave knife known about this all along and very proud of all of you and I see this is a template for the city and I love the way you say you other agencies because that totally flips the pyramid of power there's just one outstanding curiosity I have immense over doing with these different chains of command that you get with and I hope this is it drilling down too much but at the time of emergency how you deal with you know that the armed services and then the emergency services because the chains of command don't match up and if you hear me who the thought on there um what what is in the next stages is around meeting with those the heads of those departments and forces and're aware and if they need to come into our area they'll be aware that with here and they'll come and see us first so they'll send whoever and they want that and we hope that amenable to help us as well I'm just recalling that frustration of the Corporal and lake with a truck full of chemical toilets and we're all ready to go and they said I know sorry I have to go back to Middleton to get the order to them distribute these so it's kind of cutting through all that stuff that we can get there I think the good news is too we're going to have brand new source systems of a year I mean like I mean for example it took 14 days to get at all it out I don't know and people thought we were crying on the meteor about that but that's the fact 14 days and we couldn't understand how logistics and somewhat defense couldn't sort that out now when we hit other people calling from other areas saying don't need them so it's just about making people aware of what's out there and and I hope it is something right and why we're here so we're making us aware to you that we have an organization or a team of people and agency churches and the like that are we come together should there be a dessert and we're hoping it you'll hear that and maybe give us a call so we can be part of it we could it be interesting for you to know if you don't know and they philippines as war there's roughly 26 worship based foundations churches and things but something like a teen of them are annoying I don't know you wont honey so we have a lot and we've got a lot of schools at the moment we're one big score soon got lots of schools so there's a lot of different agencies in there in the district so it makes it unique to the rest of the christchurch I think that the way that you've also sense too because obviously that's seeing you know that the center the of this kind of hub but then radiating out across a wider area and I really like the fact that I mean for you know was at four and a half thousand suns it sounds really manageable you know as a group but then I'm what I'm hearing is that you're not just a conduit for information into the community from the services the emergency services but actually you're a conjurer of information out and to those logistics coordinator so that they know where to get what to and when and how so and then you become an important part of that distribution mechanism I mean we've all got our our stories you know but my favorite one was driving down pages road and seeing the army truck with the chemical toilets as they were distributing them and so stopping to the sort of sale you know got on you guys you know blah blah and in these people from knightsbridge lane coming down the street and saying you've left us meals on our list so you know a lot of these things can be can be lost and translation if you don't take the lanes into account for example you've got to remember to Knightsbridge Elaine doesn't exist is actually 397 pages right right and that's probably why was you know that's right but but the point is is that all of these things can be resolved if the community is directly engaged and in the process and I think that out of our commitment to the resilient City concept we will see this develop but I'm also going to suggest that that we get our chief resilience officer to come and meet with you to also talk about how your model could then be made available to other communities because I mean some communities have already developed their own models you know little tournaments obviously done a lot of work there and you know Sumner and all these different communities and they've used different bases like the time bank and various things to develop that sense of community resilience but your model there an incredible resource base but it's not your traditional civil defense network it's your much more traditional community oriented groups that can come together and form that same network but a much stronger network is that we're because it's not one that just Springs to action at the time of need it sir it's actually a community resource that supports the community at all times and there's one player that we've been talking about the whole way through that really needs to come to the party and that's the DHB around their response plan to suburbs yeah not just not just the a na in this end you know the city stuff but you know we would really like to know are they going to use maybe their dental the dental trucks you know all worked up end you know with the new set of doctor or nurses it can prescribe different medications and are they do they have a plan to visit certain communities after a disaster so we can keep the people off the road and not having to and times and there so the DHB we think is is to have that in their plan and they might yep but we'll be inviting them to air leaks meeting as well because we want to know how they're going to respond to suburbs great great ah Sir Andrew did you I did and it was around exactly the point land that you made socializing this with other community groups and I guess a mechanism for first of all sharing the amazing work that you've been doing with with other groups that can could benefit from this and I guess research into the ways that other similar groups and LeAnn mentioned littleton think of project Littleton in little centers as one group that did respond well in a community a sense after the earthquakes what sort of contact you've had with those groups and ways and leon's obviously made the suggestion about using our and chief resilience officer is one method of doing that ways that you can socialize this or methods for sharing this with with other groups so that we can get the right the way across the city if there was a meeting about three or four weeks ago it canceled for those groups and each presented in a 10-minute time to present and was about seven I think presented and we did we learn information that they were doing that we thought great and the other way around to that will be ongoing I think annex funds in about three months yeah we've got links with them anyway we work with little turnin and Sumner and the other districts as well and we'll be inviting them into the meat special meeting that we have in a couple of weeks just to show them yeah we're running out of time yeah okay so look thank you very much yeah it was an incredibly impressive presentation and we look forward to seeing this you know as part of our you focus on resilient City so that's great thank you exist it's good that it's going to be part of that whole hub um okay deputations the renewables mud waker haven't_''_1382.22 been able to attend the meeting submission from them and deal with it when we get to their get to the specific item on the agenda I'm not sure we don't need to pass a resolution in relation to the debt presentation we just had to it just receive it okay so well okay so um glean Livingston in sicca david a state we received the presentation from the arden oi community yeah I just wondered how father push it I mean do we look at a recommendation over a template for other communities no but other communities of communities will work with them so I just think well maybe you want to say and we'll refer it to our chief resilience officer in order to include with them okay yeah and okay so refer to yeah the chief resilience officer and the community board chairs meeting alright so I'll put that resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now could I invite race
No where anyone would want to declare an interest haven't received any notification there are none
And we've dealt with nappeun away and we've got the resolution to exclude the public and I want to but it's the resolution there is merciful yeah sorry I'm just trying to make sure that I'd do the right thing thank you I have to make a statement about an additional supplementary report being adopted you so I just I just want to check with the two counselors that they're good with us that the resolution to exclude the public has set out on page three to nine and five on four three gender and that might more chairperson of the record and what Graham community board be permitted to remain in the meeting for the consideration of item 21 11 due to his knowledge of the meter approval is sought to submit the following report to the meeting of the Council on 30 festa July that's today commercial negotiations the reason in terms of 46 a seven of the local government official information and meetings act why the reports were not included on the main agenda is that they were not available appropriate that we receive the reports at the current meeting that the report be received and considered at the meeting and that the public be excluded the public excluded reason is that there is good reason to withhold existing under section 7 so are you good with that so yep that that will be the report they might be full commission in the boat oh yeah so so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carriage will move into public excluded now
Good regulations and consents committee item number 17 part aid decision resource consent delegations I could just speak briefly to that it's is really a requirement to bring councils delegations register in line with new titles and Council and there will be further piece of work that's looking at the delegations themselves so in the first instance we are merely just realigning the delegations to updated position to others with this paper yeah no that's great thank you so David ice moves second up by Thomas Kendra my name listed as an apology for that meeting that should have been pulled on was it I guess overall can regulations and consents just do that at the next meeting or shall we do it here you'll note it here okay what it'll be put online thank you put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now Thomas Kendra and seconded by David East will move that the report as a whole be adopted I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried
We move on now to the minutes of the submissions panel meeting of the seventh of june the seventeenth of june and the fourth of july and the would someone make to move that I think the chair of the submissions panel meeting may not be here today Paul lonsdale moved second up by David East I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye there's a pace they know that scary thank you and then we have we've already dealt with the master plan for booooored pegasus and then joint no we've done item number 615 as well and item number 16 additional council appointee to the christchurch agency for energy trust think Glynn wants to move it oh he nominate myself all day so I think Pauline would like to move it and Vicki would like to second dirt that the council appoint an additional member of the council to the crash at uni so why don't we just put that the council appoint blin Livingston is and is at no no Glenn Livingston is an additional member of the count exit Board of Trustees I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried Thank you Thank You councillor Livingston I think we have an e at the end of his name plate
Sorry for being late Beck so the next item on the agenda is the the second issue of the community committee which is the events and festivals funding allocation and it is recommended that the oh that that's actually that's not dealt with by resolution is that because it's going to be dealt with in periods all right well it says that the committee considered the matter in conjunction with item teen of the public needed agenda okay so we go but I thought that was all of them I thought so the substantive should be done either but what we actually approve it oh it's over and there's a mechanical screw that I think yeah but we're not approving them without debating it on publicly screwed our way not so to deal with it and so why would we deal with it here because that's how the reply through both from open and public extreme so because they dealt with it I apologize I'm not a hundred okay sorry just taking some advice on how to handle this matter so the the committee considered the matter and conjunction with item 10 at the public excluded agenda so we'll deal with us when we get to the public excluded item on the agenda rather than deal with that now and so I need somebody to move and second that the report is a whole be adopted this term scandrett pauline Kotter I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and thank you very much and then we've come to item 10 the Housing Committee thank you if I may highlight I know we're simply receiving this report for information but it does have in my view some good information in it Lucy to begin with the waiting list it's decreased so your reports is 332 on the waiting list because there's always a leg and reports we have an updated figure which is 275 so it's come down by 57 that's mainly with our single and couple people in the waiting list and also those in terms of a priority have come right down so closed units open this is something we obviously really want to target to make up those on the waiting list as you can see in the report there are 21 which we think are straightforward for reopening 38 have reasonable structural repairs and then there will be another 12 which will have to be assessed in terms of the economic viability but if we could get those open that would actually take us up to 71 which is really starting to make inroads there I'll come back to the issue of homelessness in a minute and invite our staff to give us a verbal update you'll see also in the meeting we requested clarification over our current position within the district plan in relation to energy rating and there was some discussion over that the six star rating as you can see there the word of fitness rental register report is coming back together in the August meeting just to let you know that they're both connected up with each other to so I'm sure we can take questions mere but we have also a verbal right so I'll just have that move by the part a sickness that the report be received moved by glean Livingston sick and appalling cotta and it would be great to invite stuff to give us an update on these meters thank you all right thank you we have meet a couple of times I with the city mission and they are still working through getting costings around specifications for offering the premises to provide emergency accommodation they have yet to go to the board and so we are meeting again with them tomorrow but we hope to have the information really within the next couple of days from them yeah what obviously the government and Isis it's made a commitment I need some okay yeah our committee is recommending a hundred thousand dollars this is all done publicly towards this it could be that that amount is different from that so we can't just no you didn't approve it yes we'd recommend that so this is just receiving the report though the recommendation here yeah yeah that's fine all right I'll put say no that's carried and now I think Pauline is going to move and then will second that the report as a whole be received I'll put that much Oh daddy yeah cool I just wanted to ask a question about the on page 194 point two point five have we had the evaluation tinder for Harmon Berwick in Smith's courts it was opposed to come on the sematech to july to council has being three counts were you not as it's it's coming through on the fifteenth of august and it was delayed due to one of my staff had a family bereavement I was negative I'm a cool I just think it's I mean I don't know if we can do it sooner than the enough of the reports being finalized it's been submitted now that's a shame we can't do it maybe later on this afternoon but it's just really important about every month that goes past as less housing that we have available also just on to ask in terms of four point two the global settlement claim obviously that's holding up our work so the sooner we get that resolved the better position will be and it has has has been seeming to take a long long time so can you just give us an idea about where things up how things are progressing with that claim so my understanding is that negotiations are proceeding that we have given our information and eqc are assessing the information that we had submitted like realistically a time frame for I'm sorry I I can't answer the attention yeah I think our chief financial officers kind of leading on that now so there's a meeting next week hopefully that will push things along oh it's I think that two meetings have been canceled recently and it's been quite disappointing so if we could encourage EQC to each know there is a meeting next week I think a chilling accounts all those amazing weeks away and are we good you know that there are that you know that eq c is under the situation where they have to make sure that they're not like a normal insurer it's not a question of interpretation of a policy it's a question of interpretation of a statute so you know there are many issues that have to be taken into account and so I'm pleased to know that there is a meeting next week and I personally would like to lock everyone in a room and say do not come out until it's resolved and I'm hoping that it's getting to that point what we heard last month was that we've done the work that we needed to talk and we were please I'm just I'm seriously not trying to lock shut things down there's no the issue between us is the statutory interpretation it's not the same as an insurance policy if you see cannot pay out on a claim that doesn't meet the requirements of the statute we are working to ensure that our claim is fully compliant we believe it is but that's where the difference lies and we are working very hard to get a resolution any more okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much
Then the next one is the facilities regal okay no that was a replacement was it was the only motion elispot so the next one is the facilities rebuild plan proposed demolition of Linwood library and we have the same team at the end of the table does someone want to move this recommendation Jana you you an amendment that um that basically delegates that the decisions are leasing to the community board and also establishes a working party to look at future use end plans of the limit library site and in the provision of library services so you want to move all of the recommendations that are there six point ones okay I think actually we should set up a working party to look at future future use with the community board and so you know delegating the corporate support manager to initiate managing finalized public to new processes that's fine I think that the lease should come back to the community board that's put that's pretty much normal I don't think it needs to be delegated away and I think 6.5 fine and around establishing a working party to look at future options for delivered library site and the library service provision so we're not resolving to make the land available for lease after completion of the demolition by way of public tender but until you have a working party that can look at what the options are it seems pretty silly to go up and come up with a solution except that how do we find out what the options are well obviously that's what the working party could work through with um I called for an ex british love interest in the land or something I mean I mean I can see resolving to make the land available for lease and then just delegating all authority on that takes it out of the community boards hands but I just wonder whether resolving to to set up this this well just when do you need a working party or do you just refer it to the community board you know people but what we want is actually action happening so we want people being product of working around I also provide some support around future thinking for forelimb would because there's issues around what do we do with an existing library and the mall and that's got a finite period of time so there needs to be some a process and I think a working party is as a better way forward than just going to the community board but if you don't call for an expression of interest how do you know what the options that I'm sorry I just don't understand ally but my comments around that would be the fact that there is an immediate use for this land that's been identified that's going to be revenue creating which is the lease of the land to the mall now surely we can do what yani suggesting but at the same time create a revenue stream and use the land in the short term I don't see why one would rule out the other no I see and I overlooked there based on you know talking to the mall talking on to other stakeholders maybe we could call for expressions be open and transparent around our process but given that the relationship with the mall and the existing library I think you know just to look at 4.5 yeah doesn't really do it there needs two we haven't received a proposal from the mall no one's a governance level is working through these options and I that's why I think it's better to have a governance level process working through what is actually their options I mean it I think it makes a lot of sense leasing out the land to raise revenue but you also need to think about who is actually going to Lisa going out for a public tender might not be the best thing but why would you go for a public tender if you've got a relationship with the mall that you're we're paying them all rent for the library and you know that and you might want to do a deal around there around the existing library site well I do get what yannis saying is that it might be a good idea for a smaller what you know what what the what the future use is going to be I mean it looks like there's a really exciting opportunity there Darren thank you just just to clarify guess the intention is demolish the building it then becomes available rapidly thereafter ie prior to this Christmas we go through a public process which would flush out all in any interested parties on that small piece of land for a short term lease whilst we get together via but some other working group to look at what are the long-term options so it's essentially bookmarking the land on a short-term opportunity with the potential source of revenue or some other public group may want to express through the tender use of that site it's an evaluation that gets in place a short term lease on the site while we work on what is the long-term option and mum would incorporating in any and all wet t was at the mall but wouldn't it be better to do an expression of interest rather than a public in durham public tender might be a hundred little bit of semantics and that perhaps a public tendering process may just be in a oh I hear that ends up becoming a lease or something but an eoi shortlist of them to a pepsin rft or attend the process it's really just stating that that's what we want to yeah it shouldn't be delegated to just after to make all of those decisions yeah boy were you actually as I what senator doesn't actually say that it says resolve to make demand available for lease after the completion of the demolition by way of poverty into it doesn't say a short term yeah Tim just following on from what Yanni see if it's a short term lease why don't we demolish the building get it up to a car park or whatever and then do a deal on a short term with the mall to offset the cost of the lease agreement with regards to the library while we look at moving for that works a win-win situation and whatever happens and for the long-term process but I mean it's ship is go through we could if we agree to demolish it we can actually come back to you with a proposal we will have a proposal from the mall we could actually see what other interests are we at me and we'll bring it back to you at the next round if you like we won't be knocked over in a month's time by the time we put that out to dinner so maybe we proceed with the knock down until we knock it down we've got nothing to lease anyway so that may then we can bring it bring it back to you we are just trying to maximize whatever revenue we can get in the short term but basically it's not going to delay us if we actually remove that resolving that at 60 knows let me think 6.2 26.5 you could take those out yep well but part of it as addressing 6.2 so resolve to make the land available on a short to medium tuam basis after the completion of the demolition by way of expression of interest followed by it may well be that the only expression of interest as the mall but there might be something that we've got no handle on at the moment and then d yeah and and then but we need to we need to I mean the beggar show as the long-term use you know and we don't want what's happening in the short to medium term to to impact negatively on the opportunity that the long-term position presents but that's where we need to get the community board involved so they've got to be involved in that long-term vision thing and also making sure that the short to medium term use is not in conflict with it so so rather than I mean do we want to delegate authority to the corporate support manager to initiate manage to initiate this process subject to the sign off of the community board or does that work Leanne if I can just I actually don't see any problem with what is up there at the moment was regards to the short to medium turn to amuse for the land year for the land so as I said I don't have any problem with what is up there at the moment but maybe you want to add a 6.6 along the lines of that following the demolition of the building discussions and a conversation with the community board and community commences with a view to identify in long-term use of the land I think it's the next step following what is up there at the moment this only relates to the short term to use of the land after the building is demolished except that it yeah I just I really like the idea of engaging the community board in this process really early that that's my view and what in the short term use of the land process they're connected and can't sort of see them as if it involves them all they're connected if the thing is it's quite right up I mean if if we're involved in that process we establish a better relationship with them all or whoever and that may as we pointed out mayor feet for we need to be engaged in their prices so subject to sign off by the Hagley faerymate community board the other thing is that community boards generally do local leases so this is a local lace so we're actually if we agree to this we're actually taking away a delegation from local community board and doing it giving it to staff which is not something I'm really happy worth yeah and and there are depending on what youse guys here like you know if you think about things on parks for example you know there could be activities that the community would really don't think of the best interest of the community head there that staff think can raise revenue so you might get that tension so that so I think it's important that it does go you know to the community board or final you know sign off and probably actually full consideration in the short to medium term so so that that requires a change to 6.4 does it so delegate its authority to the corporate support manager to negotiate and conclude at and the community board to do that all right well that's my understanding pretty much on might be able to confirm my head I think you made the call before sat one the mountain negotiate it reca means to the community board poor decision yep yep let's say so the the corporate the corporate service so take out delegated authority to okay so yeah yep and they're so you can take out 6.4 and set six point yep so and do we need another one I think so I think we should mr. we should establish a working party with the local community board to look at the future of the site so who goes on though we're pretty combination of staff councillors Oh establish of working party of elected members and staff yep two to consider the long-term long-term opportunities through this that this land provides lot of options around future use of the land yeah tens of library service provision and completely use for this land and library seven and will end and council services councils and council services and the lynnwood area sure don't know do we need to be more than mere can sign off on the membership with it what the chief executive mayor and chief executive to mayor and chief executive to sauna thank you I think that's a good result so is there any discussion on it yeah Jimmy Lang question because I'm concerned a moment or cancelled due to a party to constrain and also consider cause the seed saving v's review of point of 5.4 in a five point of five because these are built in nature is repairable and also your estimator if we repair as the new and also including the fire damage it's only two million dollars however if you demolish and rebuild a new wife Alicia 3.1 million dollars also forty five thousand dollars to 55,000 out that we have to follow from the instructure you know the fam osito what is the mission ale just to be clear the the cost of demolishing the building won't be another won't be a drawdown from the bitumen infrastructure allowance it's going to be paid for by's the cost of the militia building and make good we used I yoga demolish we're not be focusing on that though when I but we have got walking party or late will consider overall parties well we're going to establish a working party to look at the long-term options around future use of the land and council services in the lynnwood area so it's not we're not making a decision about replacing the building to the same gross floor level which is what that paragraph suggest that's the financial implications that would be indicated by rebuilding to their size but we've got a working party to look at what the options are we're not making a decision on replacing the building okay Jimmy says it sees its two million to repair and 3.1 to rebuild it's often the case that why not repair why not but but it's not I so what you're saying is is that why would you I questions of before the we make decision to demolish mr. facility what's rational compared to repair in welcome back I assume how we need to rebuild either ealer centralized or decentralized facility to many people's need in surrounding the area is my constant the trouble was is that for the insurance the I mean the loss adjusters have issued a statement of position around earthquake repairs 146,000 111 so that's all that I mean we're not accepting the insurance position but as I understand it the fire damage wasn't covered by insurance is that right we got the fire was at something like 350 in the afternoon and the insurance victim at four o'clock so we must out by a few minutes and certified to do a lot of damage but obviously the earthquake also did the damage but I think Jimmy races a valid point which is if you agree to demolish it you basically are you know there's 1.1 million that you're that you're probably having to spend more to build a new facility I guess all I can say is that and I wasn't_''_1124.79 on the council when they agreed to pop the library here if you look if you think of a sky and the mall in the way in which we're looking at things like public passenger transport combined services around service centers libraries etc it seems to me there's a real opportunity to look at doing so that's got a lot better outcome for the community not just similar to Bishop Dale and so I think you know that is a cool that we make but I personally do think it's the right thing to do is to look at how we can get some greater synergy with the existing development in that area learn what is actually suffered from really poor strategic thinking yeah we've got government departments on one corner private development on another corner the library on on another site and our service center on a different site so we need to get a holistic approach to it and I think you know we need to look at all those facilities and look at how we get some synergy so can we best get a response from staff from that question Thanks what's then cheaper than a rebuild my understanding is if you repeated it two million dollars you would have a building an older building that has repaired that may not meet all the needs and would you invest that and my decision is you've got two million dollars if you had to millions you could invest that in another building that would actually meet the community needs better and so basically at the end of the day we wouldn't come back to you with a two million recommendation to do up that building and that's my understanding that there are other opportunities to do that you're not going to replace like with like but you may be going to get a better facility if you were going to invest you two million dollars in that decision my understanding had already been made because basically by repairing an old building you've still got an old building repaired and it doesn't actually mean so you've got an opportunity to have four not well there is it if you were going to replace under the exactly the need but an actual fact you would actually design something totally different potentially so you wouldn't have via sets removing it is an extra 1.1 million if you were going to replace like with like but basically as council johansson said basically like with likes not going to be the replacement is going to be a number of options out there to get like for like to just replace where you were standing still would cost you two million dollars and so the recommendation is to demolished and we start we could build for two million dollars a facility that would better meet the needs of that community on that side if that's what was decided to do or you invest that two million dollars into another site somewhere you sell this block of land and you use some of the proceeds for that and you get a better community outcome from the whole process all right I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye there's a post they know that's carried oh do we have a mover and seconder I thought we apologies I'll put the motion again now that we probably are moved in second Adam all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried thank you so I propose that we adjourn now for for our meeting with because our guest has arrived so if people could be up in the lounge by twelve-thirty and that gives five minutes to get up there and if we and will recommence the meeting at two thirty this afternoon so thank you very much
The is there another night oh no but someone like to move that the report is a whole term scandrett Andrew Turner I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that's Carrie and now we move on to the item number 8 which is the Environmental Committee one part a report no no it was a the item was presented the chairperson report to the council oh no that's right so there isn't a partay why does it say party and the minute they just been happy all right Tommy Jesus I know that's right so that's okay yeah no that's fine this one you'll move it oh sorry Phil Phil Clearwater seconded Jimmy chin I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried now we move on to the community committee and part a report and relation to the repairs to the tenant gardens t kiosk who's some who's answering questions on this one you are Darren thank you can sit at the table we have questions or as oh no me llores like um additional amendment I think Ellie's just giving it to the council secretary okay so um I'm having to talk to this it's appropriate for all do you want to move some different recommendations year those sorry I shouldn't enter it on presumably you've got somebody who's willing to seek and because they know what you're going to move yeah yeah in yani so it that's moved Ellie's going this is very dry you're handsome need some advice I think perhaps on we want to change the word in the ER knee didn't we from steering group what did you suggest there another well you shouldn't vote on it I don't know that you have to leave just sit back from them and you don't you don't you don't have to leave it's not it's not a closed session I mean if it was and PX then yes I would say but just do not participate in the debate or the vote CEO hints and that the council will prove appearance drinking but added requested the cost of scope of works for this week to be made available to councillors allocate from the building and infrastructure improvement borrowing allowance and establish a steering group to begin discussions with fee-based board to ensure full on transparent consultation with the public on the future use of the tea kiosk ok so now do people want to direct questions to down other thing Darren um normally on these we would have something that says this does not indicate a full and final settlement in regards to our insurance position and one of the concerns that's come up is at thirty thousand dollars probably doesn't even pay for the cost of a concealed so clearly the insurance the amount that we're climbing from our insurers there's not adequate and probably needs to be revisited but normally we would have a statement here that says you know we agree we're going to get on and fix it but it's not limiting the claim that we put into our insurance so happy put that and I guess it's an oversight that and accepting this it's not money but whatever we proceed in the past year it doesn't come from they are the ability to articulate in how confident are you in the current assessment in terms of the the damage and costing like it seems really largest from Al a person's point of view probably one outside then at the moment if you don't mind just in terms of public meeting and insurance negotiations you've made the point in the report though that strengthening is not capable through insurance as it is not related to any weight damage yeah so there's some inherent it was an old building that yeah I guess the strengthening is like a lot of these buildings mere we take the Pandora's box take the little start investigating and find that a lot of the structures we're dealing with in Council we're just old buildings in the new code just needs strengthening and whether the earthquakes caused that or not in this case probably not yeah I think of scope of works as an excuse me with it being reinforced masonry abuse and I don't want to second-guess the experts who have looked at it but strengthening aside repairing water is currently there can I just ask who's done the assessment on the building for the damage so far we've had an engineering firm I believe met this is a builder reached a number the table says builders estimation and they're probably gonna we're going to have to go to the market now in an open tender process for this one because the cost of the works are now gone over a hundred thousand dollars we've taken procurement advice we're going to have to go and get three prices for this do it now to push on the prices are based on the identified damage it right so who's identified the damage an engineer yeah the an engineering Christchurch has identified the damage and come up with a strengthening solution and a builder that we've been using in facilities rebuild has scoped that work and priced it for us the damage grid great yeah could I just I think the team here it came to answer questions on the the repair of the kiosk but we've come up with a third resolution but in fact in two point 11 it talks about there's an obligation to negotiate with VBS and in 4.1 and management services agreement is currently in place so I just urged caution that you can actually was at 6.3 yeah discussion of afraid your discussions and consultation with the public I think you've got to be very careful with the resolution and that and perhaps mr. Mitchell from a legal perspective would reinforce the need to think that that I think that the point that the council is trying to make is there until we know what the V base board positions going to be we can't really have full and transparent consultation with the public on future use so it's it's a preliminary step to bolon transparent consultation with the public on future use it's not designed to it's not designed to be part of the consultation they exercise the position that they have under there under their agreement we on the best of establish the steering group to begin discussions and negotiations with be best board around the future use of the tea kiosk and then I think once we've done that then we know yeah we need to go out and so we can take out yeah but but but the the whole purpose of it is is that we don't want to go out to the public and say what would you like with the teacup kiosk and they come back and say we'd like cups of tea in a tea kiosk that would be God speaking and they would and then we don't have that option you know so yeah yeah right okay yep and I think that's during group the membership can be sorted up what's the mirror in the chief executive or yeah you know but I think there's a few cancers that came together all right there anything anything more leaving us to go ahead with the words once we've actually tended over the Nestor will provide that to you as counselors that obviously have to be confidential but it'll be and basically it'll come from the building infrastructure and then we'll do the others it's not you don't want all those other steps done prior to the work starting and see now my reading of then it so we're going to start with the window it's just that we're going to have to consult with the public on future use and we might as well know what we're our limitations are before we do that ok so you don't want any work to start yeah no we told me what you get on fixing things I make sure that we could go ahead with a physical yeah yeah yeah sorry actually landed fetters we need to clarify that because I think there's been a discussion whereby we whereas we do what the work to commence because we want stuff to get underway we don't want the work to commence the point is that there may be people who can will contribute to some of the fit-out and other work of it so we're just weary of going ahead with the works before we've established that this is just repair and strengthening us not that out or burn from the Mona Vale listen so that actually until you know what the future use of a building is you might do different things there to maximize its future for the next hundred years so if you can get synergy between the future use in the repair you actually say a lot of money and possibly find ways to fund it the issue with that is we are essentially returning the building to the condition and the state that it was in you know a sam layout goes we can't actually through betterment do thing that will affect it going forward so from what I've just said actually in our discussions earlier I don't see any problem of getting on with the strength and repair it's the foot out with regards to who's going in there that's the key this doesn't approve yeah so jump on everyone but but I mean we can put this on complete hold until we know the future use if you want I'm its that wasn't one of the solutions just to say extend 6.3 establish the steering human to go places and ms board on the future use of the tea kiosk and work with staff around the repairs and strengthening but why so that you can try and get the synergy if it's possible what's energy do you need you just need the things strengthened and repaired yeah but depending on the future use of it you might do can I start the questioning around there yeah if we decide it's going to be a florist and we decide we need an area that's dad has got nothing to do with what we are planning to do at the stage and repair and strengthening career to make it crystal clear we'll be putting it back for all intensive purposes just like it was before it closed so no just clarify that no jaani unless I'm misunderstanding it because we just get on with doing that and then get into the foot out and use and all the other stuff afterwards just putting back something that wasn't September forth without knowing what the future use of it seems are really um not a very sensible approach I mean it might be that you just put it back exactly as it is and that's cold just that's fine but you might actually want to make a few changes and again think of Mona Vale with all these little add-ons happen over over the years so you know it seems to me that actually I'm trying to get synergy if you can is a good idea if you can't that's no problem you get on and you get it done but it just seems a bit um silly to not know with fuji rose and make decisions about putting back something as it was rather than what it will be you've got a building that's got add-ons and as the size that Mona Bell was you might have a point but this is you're limited really and what you can do as far as any adjustments go I mean that would that would just be my position on earth Paul and then Phil I am on the V baseball but this is actually quite a different comp no way you're on the B baseboard no you cannot comment I'm sorry just you know I've kind of seen that so Phil and I think the recommendations including accessories at Stan's will work but we're simply strengthen your building in the summer appears going on the same time this discussion the rep with the v's baseboard I think that will get us there in terms of achieved achieving the future use we're getting bit tied up look at tell you the first thing is just simply to repair and strengthen it yeah David do you want to two things I'd say is that the work would beneath no matter what you actually going to use the building for that we were intending to do here secondly that basically if someone else came along and paid for there would be a trade-off whether your pay upfront or you pay later thirdly if we don't actually get home with the work now there'll be no use of for it over summer because basically we're getting tight for that so if we want to actually have any opportunity to use it this summer you know I would just say be nice to proceed but that's why I want a clarification I just want to make sure the staff didn't go away and do something in there wasn't quite what you intended my understanding was was that we get on with the with the repair and strengthening but what I'm taking from what you've said and I'm now looking to staff at the end of the table to nod their heads in agreement that that this work that is being done as regardless of the future use so you would have to do this repair and strengthening work for whatever use the Botanic Gardens to kiosk was to be unequivocally years great that's what we want no no we're weeks well we're allocating a certain sum of money so that's that's yep alright so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed then no that's carried thank you very much
Right now we move back to item number seven which is the strategy and planning committee part a report on policy on structures on road amendment to accommodate base isolation foundations on public road lame and have we got I don't know if we've got who's who's answering questions on on this assassination yeah Jamie this but I just hit up I just had a question I mean in some respects it's not it's not a huge issue but the way that I read the Working Party recommendation on 2.2 when we set up a working party of two of any of the mere or deputy mayor and the chair of strategy and counselor East I didn't expect that the chair of strategy and planning and council that East would be the subcommittee I thought that would include either the mere or the deep premier so I thought the location of the word or was there for a purpose I one of the one of the winner of dips near was to was just sittin on this working group but that's the at the time so I'm just checking to see whether that was what was intended yeah I mean as long as as long as some we're within the you know sort of authority to do this I mean it probably doesn't meet her to any large extent but I just just sound us a word of caution about following the specific recommendations of of council when setting up his work in groups I know that Becky and I had talked about it being a very you know nimble group which is fair enough but it was to include either here or me on it yeah and I'm relaxed about the outcome I'm just worried about you know people sort of anyway so so I don't think that's going to hold us up in terms of the actual recommendation because it as a recommendation that I support so on that basis I'll move the recommendation David II still sick in dirt since the chair of strategy and planning doesn't appear today there are any questions yawning yeah I didn't it's I was just wondering in terms of the seats York City have we got a different standard in the central city than we do in this in the neighboring areas and the suburbs and the concern I had was around damage to existing infrastructure particularly things like enable things like underground services what what liability are we putting on those who are doing the base isolating and those who are responsible for when the building's move to ensure that things are not disrupted and if they are then we get compensation well that the costs are all transferred to the applicant is the way I read it that oh well all the costs actually met by the owner and this they are different to the suburban areas the the city plan enables the buildings you thought they want the builders you build up to the edge of the road edge not sit back and of course obviously with base isolation it takes up about 700 ml of the of the road right now we're not expecting too many in the central city I think there's two right built down under armour street and the other is going to be the Grand Chancellor site they want to encroach on the the paving they have to shift all the services and I think we've found even through the earthquake when when the foundations and the pathways met the pathways is damaged anyway so this is more damaging but as it is the job of the property owner to reinstate so so don't think is going to be a large issue for the central city to be two or three sites and potty will use us this facility okay I guess what I'd really like to see is a really strict monitoring regime we used to have a policy I think we're people did developments and where they took away driveways and built buildings they were supposed to put the footpath back to a liberal surface and if you drive around the city you'll see a number of places where there's developments we've still got cut downs in the footpath that have never been done so actually there's a real risk that at least we're monitoring it and enforcing the conditions that many of these things don't get done and even after the earthquake a lot of demolitions that happened destroyed our footpaths and we had to pick up the cost of fixing them which seems inherently unfair and a burden that we shouldn't be having to take on as a council the other concern I have is that if they re sealing the pavement and we're upgrading streets in the central city for example if you just put a blob of asheville black asheville over a cobblestone or if you don't do it in the same way and you can see with telecoms just go around our streets and the suburbs and look at all the different pictures that have been put in so over time it really degrades the immunity so I would hope that this policy would have sufficient capability to ensure that it should be done to a reasonable standard like it was before and should actually blend in with the exists environment not just be on top of it can staff just about this and whether they've got any product of monitoring and enforcement gray James in place to deal with these issues good an hour Paul I did a bit of work around the other cat dancers because I actually thought myself was a major issue at a couple of residents that wanted their cutdowns replaced because I shift to the driveway it is the cost of the avocado is the cost of the property owner I thought there may be thousands is about 125 cut downs in heaven it should be in replace their about a couple thousand dollars to remedy many of them are you in a suburban areas more so than the central city and we're you know private owners have actually moved the driveway there has been demolished so forth so it's not as bigger issue that is an issue and I agree that we do need to and be sure that they do remedi eight back to a set level in the future but term not as big as you think I'm actually wondering whether as part of the resolution we should back to whichever council committee it is probably I mean I don't know whether its strategy and planning or whether it would be Briggs and concerns but a report back mechanism whereby you know the actual application is reported and then subsequently after the workers completed that there's kind of a sign-off from staff that it was returned to a standard that was acceptable and that way their governance would have an oversight of the of the of you know what has occurred but it would also require staff to report so that they would actually be talking directly to the to the people about the quality of the work that they does and I'm sorry I won't know the details in the streets now the incidents of people doing this is going to be so few and far between people the creatures and things that going through beer that basically I think what you need to do is we need to look at the bylaw and then have a look to make sure that we are enforcing it curriculum because it will talk about me to be 10 of them are plenty of them through our city where people are opening up parts your street left right and center I don't think you want to let reporter back and I think you need to order that strategic level are we enforcement what our priority down by presenting with a doctor the new zealand standard which is about weekend roads and reinstatement itself so I think well certainly we can refer back they will get and I think we're better to get gen- of it what does the Bible actually say and I'll be actually increasing episode I presume with properly operate and started will build up and sign on each churches they've done and unfortunately one of the risks that it means sometimes as some of our services to sleep cut the multiple water and wastewater you know it worries me that we've got no oversight as a governance body over something that meat is so so deeply to our to our residents so but maybe as a result of us we could we could talk about a reporting mechanism have to be every single little you know sort of cut on the footpath but here we are actually leasing the access to the land underneath an order for base isolation to occur if that's not then restored to a level that some acceptable it doesn't matter but there's only 10 of them I mean I think it's important that we have oversight that we can talk about now it's going to cost them 20 million 30 million the cost of reinstating that tech you're going to be very little it's the smaller jobs where you have more of the problems I would I would argue and that's certainly been the experience and other local authorities that I've worked and of getting them back up to grade and basically make sure the trenches are reinstated because it looks good day one six months later the whole thing sunk because they haven't put it in they haven't compacted it correctly all the opposite happens actually they voman compactum you've got a rise there and the rest of the ground issues around immediate reinstatement and then also making sure the reinstatements appropriate for six months or eight months down the track well maybe we need to be talking about whether there's an appropriate role for reporting on this but anyway I'm David look at someone who said on this working party for a number of occasions is quite an in-depth analysis that was presented to us and I think we are confusing at the moment restoration of setbacks and the need for base isolation in some buildings it's quite it was quite evident to me after a while that one all the services that are affected are the responsibility of the building owner to ensure that they are protected and secondly there is a mechanism in this whole base isolation process where there is a plate that slot sits in the in the void space and in the event of an earthquake the plate moves with the building and rather than the building pushing the footpath up or the pavers up the pipe plate actually lifts the flavors pavers and we come back as the buildings moving the building and the footpath is easily repairable so I think it's a pity actually that we don't have the author of the report here to talk to us to it through it but yeah I think we are confusing the actual base isolation process with the effect of trenching and other works and the footpaths that are associated with building construction this is a specialist process that is associated with base isolation and will only apply to a small number of buildings in the city and and I've really I'm very comfortable with the report I've seen it a dozen times now and it does get quite technical but essentially all we are doing is making provision within an existing Bible to have base isolation structures in the program so so when it says that the applicant will meet the cost of excavation the vault construction and maintenance and remaking the footpath surface there will be an ongoing event like an ongoing seismic events as well yeah current set at the table is fine in terms of the design of the base isolation so room yeah so it slides on myspace isolation under the subsoil and it's counselor e-cig we're just tweaking an existing policy on structures on streets so we're just making so the will be like a sliding plate arrangement because we didn't want anything that was going to damage the footpaths and leave them crumpled yeah so the building would sit up of the building would sit above the footpath and move above the footpath normally but the access into the building for doors and that type of thing would have a sliding plate arrangement so the the building would move slowly base isolation means that we'll move slower longer than the earthquake at themed so what we're doing is allowing in the central city with as a requirement to have billed to the property frontage so there's a continuous property frontage what we're doing is allowing the buildings to build to the property frontage so we have continuity as required in the city plan so the building will move slightly out over the footpath but then go back again and the only doors which will be on the sliding plate arrangement so if there's damage to the footpath in putting the base isolation and they're liable the daylight ordinary reinstate and do you do you inspect that is that to an inspection level they have to apply for a approval to do it so right but do you inspect it afterwards to send you to an approved level yes this yeah and if there's an earthquake and there's damage to the footpath they are liable for that they are liable if they if the building calls again it doesn't call no no way yeah okay no that's good that's very helpful so they have to apply to our transport operations people who and with this you way it's in the policy in here they have to to open up the street young and they would have to make good any any damage they cause but we we were worried that the reason why we put a sliding plate arrangement and we were worried there that could be a delay because the building won't didn't want excess delayed yeah well the footpath was repaired because often after a big event there's a lot of repairs going on so the whole thrust of this was to try and return back to normal as quickly as popular very change that so which is why we wanted a small nimble working party to get it done and dusted yeah so there's a lot of information here it just goes off and thought yeah but it's very much as I council Reese who was on the working party with Council of golf it's very much about improving building safety and allowing that to heaven all right thank you all right oh I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried thank you very much thank you
We sort of back on board and I'm sorry that I've got it a bit wrong in terms of the time so never mind there's been a request that we deal with the deal with the tourism nappeun away meta next so that's item number it's a supplementary paper and it's item number 24 and since which time some well since the report was prepared you would have received a message from staff and relation to an alternative set of recommendations which they would like to replace the original ones were I'm not sure as Simon here Simon if you'd like to come to the end of the table I'll just give people a couple of minutes to look at the look at the motion that we have in front of us so basically saying that they're recommending that we let staff or acquista to prepare a statement of proposal and summary of information for a special consultative procedure on the establishment of a recreation and sporting up the staff requested to engage opus to undertake an independent peer review practicable options not considered in that process and that the statement of proposal on summary of information including a proposed timeline for consultations certainly making we put on the agenda for a council meeting as soon as practicable about not more than three months from today so I'm lee and I just noticed though that memorandum we received today indicates us stronger proposal than 62 it refers to a special consultant procedure sorry p this I've a you read 5a and the new in the new your loan he's already 50 that's right yeah so hows it so that's stronger than sick than sex to prison yeah oh do we subsidy substitute no no we're replacing that that we're replacing the make the recommendations with these ones yeah so I mean I'm going to move them so that we've got a mover and a seconder term scandrett and now I'm going to invite staff to direct questions to god Simon bedrich did you have some questions thank you just I'm just a little bit concerned about the three-month time than three months but is that for the statement of proposed to come back to us we signed off to go out for consultation or is it for the consultation process to be concluded in reported back to us the salmon that's on no we have preparing the state of clothes well now and we believe that we can get their back to you within a month and for counsel to sign off the statement proposal the day after their statement proposal is quickly signed off then we will be going out the special consultative procedure which we estimated be around about 34 or 35 days in these right circus might I just think time frames are really critical on this project because of external sporting codes that also want some certainty so I'd really hope that we could you know I mean just let that see is there's a little bit confusing and I just think it needs to be kind of maybe tightened up a little bit that the statement of proposal will come back with on the next you know month and that the way it's worded at the moment is just slightly slightly confusing yeah well well maybe maybe to give some flexibility around the time but not more than six weeks from today's date that does it work for us do step be in between and so and that's going to be incorporated into step C so you know at the end of the day I think it's really important that we get that step the right so that when we come back to you otherwise you're going to go out with a proposal and it's going to get shot down legally so you do need to actually say we've looked at these options and we've done that so you need to incorporate that now I'm not sure and Simon may have talked to opus but I'd say that B is really important to get it right so you go through a proper process and that is going to get incorporated as it says in to your statement of proposal and but I do think in terms of giving some certainty around to sender a really clear signal so what are we trying to say that that the total process will take three months no we just picking up on mama seven sins comment we have prepared a brief with a MP we have both agree to and opus is in process of being engaged at the moment we used to make the work will only take two weeks to be completed that information we fit into the statement posle which means that we could do that within a six week period and then obviously the consultation period after that could take 34 35 days so I would hope the entire special quantitative procedure would take no more than three months other understanding is that the local government Amendment Act has gone bill has gone through today or yesterday which has changed the consultative requirements for councils but I don't know when that comes into a fish it won't and will be assigned offside jeje today or might be today the assets so I don't know if that's got any impact on this consultation I think it's legally and properly but I yeah we need to keep moving with this process so can we can we just make a note to confirm that the processes in line with the current statutory requirements as they may have changed so in that way we just were just signaling to you that you've got to make sure that that's that's been checked off absolutely I'm pretty sure it will be because all about other consultative processes that we're talking about us mentioning the the need to be alert to the statutory changes direct our legal team is looking at the moment yeah Tim sorry some just going on from your concerns you are in consultation or communication with these sporting bodies so they know exactly where we are at the moment and moving forward at citrus so the concerns with regards to them having certainty about time frames they'll be fully aware of that through your communication with them they are aware of the process we're going through this is I guess the first step in that process and from there as I around this but certainly I'm in conversation with all the stakeholders thank you they'll sort of thank you for all your work on this and it's exciting but I'm just in the reports on that pune why that there's no reference to it being like original sport and people outside christchurch and canterbury being involved is there any like em need for us to go wider than christchurch metropolitan area what should or could it be I think the the first and Tiant obviously is to service the people in christchurch city boundary and obviously a replacement for the extract Tennyson and hockey the nature of the facility means that a will service the greater Canterbury area in potential in South Island chilly I'm concerned OC g 00 can you please to confirm with us compared to your original recommendation and updated recommendation and because you need to take within the three months to prepare the statement of a proposed in a summary of information in the right so whether your original recommendation were reported to the council will have before a match or special conservative procedure and the feasibility study am I right so whether they target that they still remain so the the original recommendation by staff enabled staff to at the time that the report went up to us Council the statement proposal had not been prepared and so therefore was going to take a period of time to do that statement of proposal we have constantly been working on that statement posle and it's nearly finished which means the rate route to move their process along a lot quicker so you happy to change the three months to six weeks I can change the months full statement posle to six months six weeks but but not more than three min the resolution if we change their not more than three months to six weeks you're good with this we're having yeah okay so mover and second day be with that I am six weeks it comes the lawyer that's why we are we are alive we are alive despite we are yeah yeah just the six weeks forced a proposal watch that mirror you know it you here it gives me great comfort yani are we into the base or well are there any more questions for Simon okay so Yanni thank you um look I'm really happy to support this these resolutions I think it's really good already commenced staff for working with the A&P Association you recall we've had briefings and really the pointers if we can get things tied down at start of the process that easier will be as we go through it to be looking at what the different options are in consulting with our community so I really afford staff for doing the work in the last few weeks to get the ANP association understanding what we to do and certainly I think it makes a lot of sense to try and get as many people on board a start I think it's really important that we're going out for consultation so we still open minded about it but this is really a proposal which has a lot of Merit there's also some concerns that people have which we can explore through the consultation around traffic and parking and access all really important considerations but really important that we get this out because we do know that we need to start giving some certainty to the sporting codes as to whether this projects going ahead or not with who offers of external support in terms of those codes to provide funding towards some elements of this proposal so I think it's a real win-win for us if we can get the clarity and certainty around whether this happens or not and I think you've heard submissions through the annual plan that we haven't been doing anything that's not true actually staff have been doing a lot of work over the past 12 months following the three-year plane resolution to look at and develop this proposal so a lot of work has already gone into it let's keep the ball rolling let's keep things moving let's get it out as soon as possible for consultation okay Phil I also applaud the work staff have been doing am there's been a lot of negotiation done and we regret what assignment see we don't need to consult with the wider regional area but I think it is important that as council we keep in mind that this part will service you know our whole Canterbury region and fit into the sport and so at some stage we need to make the links and network what there are other rural areas and in the rural towns and enables that they they and fit can be part of us too so I think it's got fantastic potential yep David and then Jimmy I think you look I'm happy to support the resolution for the project to go out for consultation and I think that will sort of give the opportunity for other issues as Jonnie spoke a moment ago to be reviewed there are other issues of subdued of the spread and lodge development requiring a sewer system because rien up in a way to get to it there are a lot of issues and also of some longer-term manchester's is the talk of her large private investment and in sporting development in the West I'm go through this process and obviously look at other things that are being proposed as well so supportive of the this process is it's evolving now but there are a number of things that we need to consider going forward as well right Jimmy yes I suppose install the new revised recommendation because the staff take a positive proactive way to engage with the a and repeated the society spatially have this kind of the peer reviewer concerned you know we can have a further engage with name magnum KP so we review the email we can see that they are acceptable second is you we review the rest of the staff of the report actually this comprehensive protocol because start on the greater jobs who are open transparent the process for instant likely to engage you know to for the same investigation from original 40 a narrow down to 15 then to choose the four of them then to this fact finder that the base of one and also we are all aware the of the sports group are supported is kinda the proposed residual and also if conservative procedure this way we could give the community opportunity to have their say this fantastic so I supporter this way thank you okay I just want to say a huge thank you to staff honest I got I spoke to the ANP Association last night and they explained to me Simon that you had talked to them about the need for grazing for pregnant news at the time of the A&P Show and because he can't ship that you use in at that time apparently and they need lambs delivered to the show at various times so I was impressed at the depth of your knowledge about things related to this protein befriend and other things and the breadth of what you had actually sorted out in terms of the entire scheme I unlike the plane I want to get it out to the public for consultation we've heard from Tennessee athletics hockey and various other ones about how they want to put facilities on the site and how desperately they are searching for a site and I think this is that and I just am keen could but I get it you know tell me off the boat try to seduce something quicker so I'm cool with this one and and I just like to get on and get it and get get it sorted yeah thank you I think Simon just to close off the debate I'd like to thank you on behalf of the whole council we know how hard you've worked on this this is an exciting next week as we you know seek to find replacements for what we've lost in our study so you can take great pride and what you've achieved so far and I know that we're going to find a good result out of this and we're looking forward to you coming back within six weeks we think it'll be less than that with the proposal and summary of information including the proposed timeline but thank you very very much for all that you've done so far thank you so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you
I have a request from tim baker from a beer with Pegasus community board because you need to be away by 11 that you wanted to speak to the Builder pizzas community board tempers all right it's great okay it'll wear in your hands thank you what's most about this end happy they're set here before so how am I don't oh well you can come and try setting up here for the drafty bright and master plan is what I'm reporting on almost two years ago councillor east and produced will set to a community board how about a draft master a master plan for the Brighton and 18 months ago consultation was done and we the council came back with a really good plan to start off of it's a lot of community consultation was done at back at that time there are three hundred and seventeen submissions made and from them 87 submitters signal that they'd like to have a hearing but remember this is 18 months ago in the meantime a lot has happened in the east and and Mendoza landowners association there's near Brighton Community Advisory Group revitalized in the commuter center there's also the new brighton legacy project they knew the new eastern recreation sports facility project and I was turn the page and the new district plan review and so now 18 months on the community board at our meeting last last time it was recommended by staff that we have a hearing panel a hearing but we feel that we don't need to because in 18 months things have changed and a lot of people who with different people have spoken to who wanted to make those submissions now don't wish to and as a whole we believe the plan is a good plan now the other reason we won't don't want ever hearing is because we want to get on and get it done for the next for the next district plan and and there's two things that we particularly would like and one is four RM f to be extended and possibly looking at a bus shelter as well to penguins a weekend so what hearing and we just get on and get the draft plan and drafted any questions thanks Tim I'm normally to not have hearings the signal would be that most people are in agreement was what's going on is it for you to say that that's what your opinion is it as yep yep quite confident to be out late very confident okay but um I'm surprised the community would doesn't want to have hearings and it's quite unusual for our staff to recommend hearings although I know as a council where you agreed to do hearings into them the main road fury road master plan and that's been a really useful process just trying to work through some of the concerns that people have so I'm really surprised that you're not recommending to have hearings have there been any hearings and to any aspects of the draft plan because I'm just also mindful that nu award there's a lot of groups like Maori and Pacific oh that are much more oral cultures rather than written cultures so it just to engage with people I think you're right we Amerson opportunity but there's been a mess of consultation done already and people will be spoken tubes some people have spoken to individually who we're looking at making a submission 18 months ago now said I don't wish to so we're pretty confident and when you look at the percentage I think it was eighty-three percent of people 18 months ago we're very heavy with the draft plan yeah yeah be great okay so can we get on to the bill would Pegasus community board and David's going to move and clean seconds is that okay and then we'll get on to their first cause you bright and masculine the recommendations I was actually struggling with the recommendations and I'm assuming they're at the bottom of page 233 yeah that's what we're actually considering so the board consideration and recommendation at the bottom page 243 do you want to speak Dave thinking Thank You Vicki I'd like to speak in support of this motion and to comment on is that we accept the attachments and particularly attachment for which probably answers yarn is question and that to a degree that a lot of the answers to the submitters questions and public feeling in the district has put out and an attachment for and it does really sort of give the overall picture of where the community was sitting on this matter as I said I do support the adoption of this master plan and also support the decision to go forward without hearing having a hearings panel and I think it's probably pertinent to note that one of the major reasons for for not having hearings at this stage is to not delay the process of adopting this master plan indefinitely and it also allows the master plan or the community to actually submit and make applications to the long-term plan and if we delay the process by having submissions the opportunity to to have items included in the long-term plan does dissipate substantially in my team and and local government we have had potentially probably three master plans for New Brighton and it is quite pertinent's no budget attached to them so in my view it is important that we pass this plan today so that we can and get budget attached to items that are identified in the master plan the financial expectations of people in the new brighton area are quite high there is a strong feeling that other parts of christchurch seemingly are being funded for a lot of projects and and you brighten as not attracting a lot of money you know that the process that we've adopted with the legacy project hasn't endeared to many in that in the district as well and interestingly I do note as part of the master plan process one of the key parts is extending or am a of through to walk street and I have had a communication from from people in New Brighton that council are looking at buying the properties that would be associated and extending this the road and apparently appear at the stage to be reluctant to a pic 2 by one particular property and probably looking at putting a kink in the road which in my that they not prepared to invest and and purchase the road the properties and make the road as straight as possible so having said all that I think it's the opportunity is there now for the community and in the eastern suburbs to get in behind this plan make submissions to the long-term plan and get items on the budget to actually get some projects underway New Brighton so urge my fellow councillors to support the adoption of the new brighton master as recommended thank you and glean it will be the part without 7.14 is what you're suggesting is no that's why we've just struck lines through 7.14 so 7.1 one two and three it's what you're actually moving yes that's right yeah yeah okay so Glenn you were next if you wanted to amin yani ok just briefly thank you this took a lot to get to this point it took three attempts in the previous council just to get a plan master plan from New Brighton out for consultation so God there is a real sense that we need to community board feels that there definitely is the mood of community to do to do that many of you will know about you brightens history in the plan itself you see the proposal to shrink or two to make that the kind of cvd if you like more compact it expanded and its heyday when it had that monopoly with Saturday shopping then that was lost to everyone but it forgot to contract so we have to have some kind of intervention to make it work in my view we have a duty to our whole city to our coastal communities we can't have you your brightly looking as it is so we need to do our part to revitalize it and I whole heartily support okay thank you yani thank you um look I'm happy to support the local community board they're the ones that will have to deal with the community over having hearings are not having hearings and but I know that we're actually just enabling the consideration of these submissions to dinkum and formalize the draft plan so we're not actually go away and bring it back to us which is fine I do the only concern I have is that issue the road through the pedestrian mall where there were more people against it and it's it's a little bit unclear as to what's actually happening in the final master plan so I'm not sure whether we're making a call today on that but probably win them up the final thing comes back that's an issue that I think staff just need to highlight exactly what the proposal is so that we can be really clear because that is the one that most people more people were opposed then we're in support of and I think maybe we need to try and resolve that issue one way or another but happy to go along with the community board I do know there has been a lot of work done around this many different fringe groups as well or peripheral groups that also holding workshops talking to people having community conversations but I do think yeah that we do need to get this in our other master plans and we do need a prices to actually work out how we're going to fund these projects actually happening so heavy the support andrew and yeah I'm also happy to support the community boards recommendation my natural instinct would be to give the community every possible opportunity to participate and in particular noting that more than twenty five percent of the submitters did wish to be heard but I'm also aware of the amount of work that has gone into this the high level of community participation all together and also the need for new brighton to get on and for something positive to happen there we went to exactly this same issue in littleton with littleton master plan and initially the community ball view was that hearing should occur in the end they didn't that was the council's decision and we've ended up with a very successful set of outcomes from the master plan in middleton without hearings and people are very comfortable with that so certainly happy to trust the community board in their relationship with their community seen this work successfully already so I'll be supporting the community board recommendation today Paul yes I'll be supporting this today too I'm in la boca we've got some wonderful natural assets with it Metro acid here is that clothesline and looking at new brighton over the last 15 20 years that it certainly needs some help and it means some intervention as they think counselor livingston pointed out it's not just the final you buy them I think the issue occurs right across that coastline run through the summer and I think we need to give certainty do some to these communities that we are actually taking some care and we are wanting to assist them getting back on their feet and becoming a place that the whole city actually would like to get back to unless you enjoy so obviously it's supporting us today good through any other comments so we have a resolution in front is I do apologize for lateness getting back from Wellington but I'm also not very well today so apologize for that as well so the'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried thank you very much to me it's going through the result yes and now I'm told that we go back to item number six
Page 29 1 item 15.1 metal I street east part a of the joint report of the chairpersons of direction where Graham field ertel mullerian taking parameter community boards I'm do any of those two persons want to speak to it if not I'll just take it ok so you report for you on page 15 and and do I have a movie so yeah there's I guess you want some Christmas tits and stuff are there any oyster yep what do we have to pick on Mike no see ya Richard lettieri and the other one thank you yani did you have pissing I was just concerned that the energy it ation he pointed out that part of the proposal was on crown land or Ministry of Education land and I just think we need to be really clear about um their point so if you could maybe just explain if that's the case enough say of what consultation has occurred I can't_''_83.96 at this point in time confirm the crown land there was quite a a land exchange that occurred in the past Mona Vale and the tennis courts on the western end of Christchurch girls high on land that is to be all the courts are to be open for public use so I'd have to go back through the property files and just check the how all that land swap occurred in the past in terms of the current design that whipping us to approve today does any of that going over the crowds out the Sarah understanding that it's on legal road and part of that part of what may be referred to as Crown land as the legal rotunda mona vale no now it's on it's on road but we will check out if there's a wee bit of Kremlin we can't you that thank you any other questions jame and info one patient because based on deputation legitimately full you know this kind of decision making for this section until the end of november up to now popular formats even they can be a little bit earlier so based on staff your point of view have any kind of big impact give utilize the project again yeah yeah clean I'll sorry I throw you a next thing you and my question really is about safe future discussions with the skull and in connection with their proposals I'm assuming that it is a group that we we could confirm the cycleways today and that wouldn't preclude the school approaching council about clarifying any possible through the use of the street and I am aware that that was that included like a request for a partial street closure but I'm assuming in fact the council are open to further discussion with a school yeah I could confirm that you know I think our proposal is that we we continue with the plans for the cycleway as as we set out but we're quite happy to talk with the Ministry of Education in terms of the future use and how that sits against the street and they if they're does the automotive vacation and things like that required will work with the school to do that okay thank you clean was next thank you we will know it was were first built into the proposed roll out so I can you please tell me how long this if this would delay to roll out of this project in terms of months well it would delay it until that master plan was put in player put up on the grades no idea could be well I think they're suggesting November but reality is that the construction wouldn't really start until probably februari 2015 because my time you roll into Christmas so it was just a lay of thing sixteen delays of six months d cool okay um I knowledge somebody needs was that you pull in and um if we were to proceed was this project wynwood it commenced we know we Jesus tears knowing that means give the imeis to start construction in November hmm to be really considers we have the advantage of the summer construction season and also for the bulk of that to happen while schools are on holiday yeah absolutely okay um Paul did you have you end up no jaani I still put Siskin on the on the deputation that we receive met I street so a new element or abscess confident that we we've got the proposed foot part and going through there that that's not something that I mean it's it's not Crown land or it is grown man now we're probably we won't have to double check their here so if it says crown land where does that leave us in terms of the sporadic just wants to make a statement we can we can modify the design to sneak outside that crown land if that is the case without changing the principles of the alignment it's just a detail design adjustment the the circle way is on on that side is on them on the west on the southern side outside the crown lane that see the customer part there's an existing footpath there now which we'll use but that's just existing so yeah yeah yeah the next is all along your long Dean zev footpath well used down to phenoms and rode the school uses that everybody use that but the cycleway is outside the Crown land clear about the road closure do you I mean what I can't understand if that's going to be an option going forward that would obviously have a big impact on the cycleway so as well we we don't show you how we can have a road closure when you've actually got people and access yes so what's the process for resolving those requests from the school are we going to get a report to Council and what's the time frame for that I think we would as I said earlier we work with the school in terms of what they want to achieve in terms of their master plan and where if if that then impacts on the road in any way then we will bring bring that information by my understanding is that they've approached us with four options already and they're waiting to get feedback from us and they're presume it's because before they do the master plan they want to know what you know how far they can go in terms a road closure and so off by which that can be determined in short term because it seems like this I mean it's something we're here to died out of you heard the dictation it's soon to me that they'd said that they had approached us already and we're waiting for us to respond yeah sorry I haven't been privy to those discussions met Elise is a very important road to in terms of the it's already been terrific calmed and there's a lot of angle parking is you probably realize along there for the school and for the auditorium use in terms of us being comfortable about closing or partially closing met I street east I'd say we wouldn't be definitely it's an a strong access full of high school and it's also a strong access link through the Mona Vale so from our perspective it's a road that we would want definitely to keep open sorry there's a pronounced standing process that sorry I'm addressing a question or what's starting the debate not also just in terms of the process by which we make a call where's a council or a community board over the future Metro straight in terms of the school's proposals that they've put forward it would be our normal council processes that if if anything is to change on that road we would go through the normal process community board encounter okay thank you that concludes the questions phil has moved actually I'm happy to seek in the recommendation that's here I am absolutely adamant that we need to get on with these psycho ways if there was one thing that came through strongest in the annual plan it was the desire of the christchurch public to see these cycleways completed and even started would be good this is the circle way that also leads up to the University it will have huge use there is a large number of cyclists coming into that school and I think the air safety matters enormously as well I'm happy that we work with the school around alternatives but I'm not happy to lay these subtle ways now or later recommendations I think around this is vicki has indicated there was very strong requests larger requests from the community that we get on and do get these cycleways done if we delay this this would be slower than business as usual for psycho ways and and I think we've had a clear indication in fact part of the there's some submission today is really about a possible delay due to possible purchase a metallized straight and we've heard from the staff that in fact metro street is not a goer in terms of a possible closure there's huge traffic congestion problems on record and rode the site the cycleway here will take Matt will make traveling to school safer for cyclists and that's something that clearly the school acknowledged that they have concerned br2 so we cannot possibly delay this and I'm urging counselors to support the recommendations thank you I urge you all to support this as well well we have to act reasonably we've had a clarion call from the community to do this we received quite a pushback we did delay but we all know the response we've had from the community our usual let's just go for it I'm happy to support the recommendations but I do think we should really emphasize that we will work with the school around the redevelopment and I know previously with signal that we would set up a small group to work with minister of education because actually it isn't just girls high there's a number of other schools that are weary developing expanding closing and I do think we need to be proactive and working with the Ministry of Education around the future of our city but I think you know as as we go through this process we need to obviously be remind defects that have been made in the deputation and make sure that staff are working with the school around how we can optimize any any possible redevelopment but I do agree we need to get on into a cycle ways they're really important and I think this one makes a lot of sense the recommendation those are things they say I as as a whole so that we have dealt with that report and let's move to our new signature Jimmy I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed Carrie

We welcome to deputations we're going to do them in reverse order because the people from some cargo wanted to do their second so can I welcome the representatives from the Ministry of Education and girls hi regarding item 15.1 I'm just so you're aware of the rules surrounding deputations there is a ten minute time limit that will go on here and that includes your speaking time and any questions that people may ask so we have your reputation in written form in front of us and we are in your heads right good morning thank you for making the time available to see us today my name is Darrell Miller I'm a director of resource management group to my right is Pauline Duffy who is the principal for Christchurch girls high school and Peter Finnick from the ministry of education as you've said this morning we want to talk about the Met I Street cycle path which is an agenda item you have before you today the ministry and the Board of Trustees made a submission on the Psychopaths proposal during the consultation one key issue that they have so you all have a copy of the written statement I hope thank you so I'll read this and then we'll have an opportunity for you act to ask us questions so it's starting at introduction the Ministry of Education and the Christchurch Girls High School Board of Trustees provide a joint feedback on the proposed psychopath planned for net I street east in summary the m.o.e in the Board of Trustees support the proposal and principal and seek a delay in the proposal to enable an integrated land use planning approach that recognizes a master planning process that is about to commence on the school site buildings on the school site were damaged during the 2011 earthquake sequence the music suite attached to the auditorium was demolished in march two thousand eleven and the auditorium building at the east at the east end of the site has recently been demolished further assessment may result in additional building demolitions the current budget estimate for physical works on the site is around 23 million dollars the moa and the board of trustees exercise to develop a long-term blueprint for the development of the school the developed master plan will inform amongst other things the location and scale of new building work access arrangements and car parking locations and improved connectivity within and beyond the site the design and construction of a new auditorium for the school proceed as soon as the master plan has been completed within this context there is currently some uncertainty as to how the site will be developed and how will interact with your joining road network there is a significant body of work to be completed before the master plan can be developed consultant procurement for a master planner is currently underway and as anticipated that the plan will be locked down by the end of november in terms of sightings expansion of equal importance given the constrained nature of the site the master planning exercise will examine opportunities for expanding the site footprint given the constraints of the avon river nearby residential site access arrangements and the road network around the site expansion opportunities are most likely limited to met I street itself within this with have sought feedback from council officers on for road closure options that feedback is pending crown land a copy of the proposed psychopath plan is attached I have marked areas where it appears that physical works associated with the proposal are located on the school site the board of trustees and the moa seek confirmation from the council as to whether that is indeed the intention if it is the case of the board if that is the case the board of trustees and the mo ii would have expected the council would have consulted over the proposed use of its land so what is the outcome that we're seeking today the board of trustees and the moa acknowledged that seeking to delay the consideration of a design solution for the planned cycle path may sit uncomfortably with the council given that it is one small part of a wider Cycle Network that the council is endeavouring to develop both the psychopath and the school recovery exercise our public realm projects targeted directly at community interests there is no private pecuniary interest with either project there is an opportunity to embark on a collaborative design process with a council that considers both be on skype issues such as possible right closure of part of met I street within this context the MOA and the board of trustees are strongly of the view that it would be inappropriate to finalize a design solution for the proposed cycle path ahead of the school master plan moreover and integrated approach to land use planning will potentially deliver improved outcomes in the long term an example of this could be a seamless design and respect of the cycleway in school developments by the ministry master planners in the council's design team given the anticipated program for development of the school master plan the board of trustees in the MOA request that the council defer making a decision on this section of the cycle path until the end of november 2014 the board of trustees and MOA consider that it may be possible to reduce this time frame by an ailing dialogue between their design consultants and the council's design staff thank you thank you for your invitation and some of had the matter of whether the cycleway proposed local way might be on crown or school and that's something I have thought staff would have covered and that you would have known by now but we can ensure that in fact we get advice on that and that's a valid question if you clearly can I just point ask you to though like you'll be aware that we had a large number of deputation of deputations at the time very annual plan from people who wanted the cycleways put put in as fast as possible in the interest of safety so you're saying look have a delay in this area please but I'm not sure how that fits what could you do pets let us know how you see that fitting alongside safety for the students like any interim period that there might be a delay yeah look it's a very real issue that you've raised I think the argument around the annual plan process is a valid one but I suspect that if a question had been posed that had said can we received responses that support it that approach but the annual plan responses that you've received considered a single issue and that was around the provision of a psychopath it didn't consider the relationship between the cycle path and other projects can I just I just really wanted though like you'll be aware that riccarton road is deemed to be in transport safety reports is quite at what its current traffic is quite unsafe for cyclists so clearly this cycle way which we're proposing is to take cyclists off an unsafe road and will so relieved so people can and also yeah take cars off the road more people beside Lee so if there's a delay though you haven't really explained to me how in fact that would and we don't put the cycleway in this area how that would make it safe for the cyclists who will be going to school I think what we're doing counselor is that we're acknowledging the issue and what we're asking you to do is to balance that against the potential benefits that might the sky and the cycleway and the timeline that we're talking about yes it's it's around November in terms of when we expect the size of the master plan to be prepared but it may be shorter than that particularly if we can get the ministry of consultants to work alongside your design stuff so I guess the the issue is absolutely acknowledged we're not shying away from that what we're asking for you to do as a council is to consider the benefits that might come from that delay thank you thank you for your submission what I don't get a clear sense of is in terms of you've just briefly touched on the road closure a you suggesting that we closed met I straight enough so you can you just show me which areas and particularly you you want closed we've put four options to council staff to consider that involve full closure from dave l street east through to dean's full closure from a point approximately halfway between Darville and Dean's towards Dean's and then a you would so that access would be maintained through met I street from Darville to Dean's Avenue why do you want to close the road it's around the issue of trying to enlarge the footprint that's available to the school and enabling connections and possibly improve connections between the school and the road at the end of the day of course that what with the reason we've asked the council staff to respond to those four options is that we need to understand whether they could receive support in terms of some form of closure so that we can then and turn determine whether that's an issue that the master planning exercise needs to take into account I just think we need to be clear when you talk about road closure what you're talking about really as giving as selling off the road to the school for development as they're off yes is that really what is at the heart of it and and as Peters quite rightly pointed out to me all of those options naturally would include a side of the um thank you all what I would suggest that we do is that we have the song the crash shoot songpa-gu sister city committee students here what I'd like to do is take the deputation and then I'll take your claws which is much later in the paper but we will just we will do the other deputation before we do there okay thank you okay thank you very much

The extraordinary meeting open and I would call for apologies I haven't actually received any so I'm assuming that counselors that are not quite in the room were here oh ok ok apology for lateness from councillor johansson and that's moved by a full clear water and seconded by tongue scandrett I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried there any do
Chin demers area-wide litigation so I think that's you as well Stephen and if the others would like to join us I think you have a presentation that you'd like to make to us yep and and as per as per Monday and sheer I'll be told to take a back seat while mr. McFarland the Texas Rules presentation the experts he's right beside it felt like a painter mine for a minute I was gonna say look behind you you have the hot seat oh I was doing the cheap seats well there's an at least two tiers there that's so you can stay full of you and you'll be able to do the talking oh yeah right thank you so can I just before dawn star top emana so one of the things that we said that we would do was if you recall the last conversation at council head there was I think that one of the fundamental points I think you made Liam was the concept that actually when did potentially area-wide mitigation make the most sense and I was prior to the decision to actually use the red zone offer as the primary tool for managing their risk properties on the port hills and and since that time people have obviously engaged with the government and have sold down so the number of properties that potentially could make use of this has continued to diminish so what we had committed to do at the last meeting was actually go back through some of the work and take you through the work that was done in 2012 prior to the minister making his decision to go through the red zone offer which was a valuation of the potential for area-wide mitigation so that's really why we're here today it's what we're coming back to talk to you about and I'll pass over two to Don and in if on the end there to take you through that word right thank you Andy maybe we'll just start even a step further back and that was that the gifts in mid to late 2011 Sarah commissioned G over to have a look at possibilities of of ruffle fences basically fenced the city off from the hills and 23 kilometers of fences I believe in total for that that made 0 the nurse and so they then started talking to the portals to your technical group about what bringing their understanding and knowledge of what was out there into play as well and we had three workshops where we talked about concepts and possibilities and that's all we talked about there's never any design who have done it was just talking about what was appeared to be technically feasible as in later some preliminary costing work was done as well but initially it was just what could we do that we believe would be technically feasible and that didn't take into account a lot of the issues that came to light later such as property ownership and insurance issues and a number of the other factors that the minister used in his maintenance decision but what we did do and we'll show you just a few examples we looked at that what we thought would be technically viable so and so we there and what we came up with as a concept of that stage was a big long earth embankment structure a bunt so that's so it's color-coded and green to say that it was a bunt we didn't go into assessing how high it might be and those sorts of issues but was placed quite high on the slope because it meant that the property owners would still have access to most of their property we couldn't go any higher as we were getting up into the rocks and if we went way down behind the houses that meant that the property owners with a big structure could not get to the back of the property so technically feasible practically maybe not a very good idea at that stage of course all those properties were hidden castle click categorized as red zone since that time the red zoning has gone on and this one to four notices the whole the whole but when we did the area wide mitigation review that you guys asked for we made a point of looking for places where the wrote otherwise the individual property options are already available when we came to the avoca Valley there were only two properties side by side and so one location we could actually consider doing urea wide mitigation the advantage of just one or two properties is you can then optimize the location of the barrier and in this case you could bring a barrier and out of some sort down right behind the houses and so that's basically as far as we went with our review to say yes there's still two properties that we could do it it would still be a barrier of some sort and we believe it would be viable in other areas similar sort of story that Morgan's Valley again ignore the colors please but the big green thing is the portable groups idea of a barrier just above the residential properties everything it up to the right of that was farmland and getting progressively steeper as you got this moment where rocks had actually fallen to have you got we've got that layer you can see all the green dots so a have come further down slapped them without barriers being proposed so the idea is to protect all of the houses and all of the vacant sections up through the valley at that point in time at the very head of the valley which is the bottom of the screen that was consider come somewhat too difficult to protect some of those properties and the ones that are not shaded red were deemed to be safe and not to be protection anyway now when we came back and review that in January this year we were down to just two properties that was still there that were not owned by Sarah at the time and since then and these are the ones shaded and a creator owned by Sarah since then those two properties are also accepted the offer so in fact when we came to the Mormons Valley that wasn't very much at all it could be considered well also feel you choose here with an evony okay this is quite an interesting area this is some of Ireland of so hibbett an avenue to the right wakefield a zones areas where we thought that rock fall protection we're at source would be viable so you go and you do drop bolts Misha mish all sorts of things to stop the rocks and for it does not mean you would cover that whole area with with metallic things it just means that within that area there's a lot of rock that could potentially be stabilized but you need to remember that those are extremely steep slopes and Bluffs some of them are very unstable and very dangerous to have people working on so that's part of the solution then the light gray the line just above the hop the dark red is a suggestion for putting in rockville fences so this is where it's too steep to put in a band but you could put in rockville fences and the fences are designed to absorb a lot of energy so they deflect a lot but rocks at them they also only designed to sustain a few hits from rock sofa hold bluff collapses it'll just wipe it out the idea was we could protect when we came back to review it in January this year we were down to just two places where there were still more than one property together that had not accepted the offer on the other side of the valley sure take advantage of fun savvy play Steve had that Andrea burr can come in and talk about he's the pink one right in the middle of that blotted blob of red just in there his house is just about with the big stripey think of us in this case the blue stripes are actually indicating where we were suggesting earthworks to bench the slope don't form level surfaces so you get a series of level surfaces rocks generally would tend to stop on the level surfaces when they had a level surface that slowed down very quickly and on the outside edge of that you would put a barrier of some sort fact a rock fence so that anything that did get to the end would get stopped at that point the disadvantage of that of course is that it takes out large amounts of the property by getting up onto the captain thomas track and reserve land above that so we couldn't encroach on that so you have to then encroach on to the property owners owned land to protect them the current situation of course is that almost all of them have accepted the offer and if we look at area-wide mitigation is requiring two or more properties side by side there aren't any so and dear brother path row and hamilton lane area the solution and 2012 seemed quite quite easy here that you could put a barrier with a mixture of earthbound then drop fence along basically below the quarry and then along further behind ups type of houses would have protected quite a lot of properties but by now of course the ones in that reader will accept the crown office over we've got quite a lot less available still eligible properties putting 12 version is basically a mostly a slight modification so it's a redaction and the scale of what was being proposed before and the last site that we looked at that's all of them'd shade it just to talk about the sort of concepts for work as looked out in 2012 and what's actually left that would still meet our criteria to be particularly one of the things that we asked for was information on supporting calculations which underpinned the cost-benefit analysis including expanding to cover crown own property it was based on the 2007 figures have you got there food costs we we've given you the the figures previously on the on the areas that we've looked at when we've got come to look at Crown own land I suppose there are two issues here what one is as we explained the last time it's determining what crowler and land you think you want to include and and I suppose what we also alluded to was the minute you start to grow the number of properties the nature of the solution also changes so as we've previously discussed simply adding properties doesn't help but the issue that we have is with crown own land we actually think that the outcome actually remains relatively unchanged because we've already paid fifty percent of so we're in a mathematical game of actually buying potentially in theory buying the crown out so we've already paid for if I step back the concept of area wide negation would say that the cost of doing the area why mitigation is or the benefit of doing here awhile irrigation outweighs the cost that we would invest and that being the fifty percent of the properties being protected where we've got crown own land we've effectively already made that investment because we're already a part owner in general of that land so if we are to include that land we would have to effectively have the Crown's agreement to buy that land off we've already paid for it once we would then be in a position where either that cost would have to be added to the cost of the area wide mitigation or we would have to get into a slightly circus solution of selling that land back to the owners and then being prepared to put fifty percent back in to the solution ourselves no I realized that I think everyone understands that we're in a sort of catch-22 as far as that that process goes I think people wanted to know whether whether the economics of what the proposals would be would have been different had the you know based on the earlier figures because we thought that they had been earlier figures done but I think what you're saying is that if we have it would have been pretty rough and ready do you want to talk to these new things so the earlier figures that were the work that was done 2012 was based on the technical feasibility assessments that Donna's just shown you with very very preliminary calculations as to the financial viability of that which we did the council did and then feed through 20 so what they've just showing on the screen as to what could have been done 2012 reflects those calculations so it was it met the cost-benefit teeth but was that based on fifty percent or one hundred percent yeah that's what I thought ok so the fifty percent to me is that there that you couldn't you couldn't make that comparison because it isn't a question of just protecting the additional number of properties because with the same structure because you'd have to actually do this degree of work I thought yes and I think the Eroica Valley if I'm would go back to that one and show the two because I think again impact on we'll explain that as you protect more you're pushing back up the slope because of the bounce angle so that the nature of the solution becomes bigger each time as well and I understood to that that perhaps one of the one of the comments that was made the other day was that given that you could actually end up building a mess of structure in order to protect against every eventuality which it could never do can you go back to the big picture that was there before like the one with the long line you have both of them yeah that one so you say are you saying that you wouldn't actually you were protecting that number of properties given what you know now what do you have to yes and the short answer yes you're right we would not recommend that that would not be the optimum solution right and if you go down to the level of the individual properties the solution would be different almost for every property side by side say where it might be best to put a rock fence and minor or about London another or level on area behind another one but for a single house you can come up with a solution that will not necessarily work with finish about two or three or four houses involved maybe I can I think me you're alluding but I was possibly something I was alluding to in the last time we spoke as the the mitigation of the hazard or the risk reduction what the engineers are saying is that we can reduce the risk and these structures you'll never eliminate the risk unless you physically hall half the hell away take the the missiles away the engineering structure will always have a if we did one of these structures you had reduced the the Genesis annual individual fatality risk to a factor of ten so it was ten to the minus two it was only be 10 to the minus three which is still unacceptable so there is that select residual liability which again by its nature rockfall we can't_''_1038.089 say exactly what rocks do we know they're rough parameters so there's always that risk residual risk yeah yani hey um what I've heard is we don't have the information on 1.23 all right in terms of page 215 1.23 we don't have information on the supporting calculations which underpin the cost-benefit analysis including expanding to color car loan companies lookin so if you just refer me back to that what page do 15 it's right a lot of yelling purpose and origin of the report so we have got the original we've got the water underpins the cost-benefit analysis but not expanding it to cover crown own property because that's not possible to calculate it's not possible what's not possible work on what they would propose now given what the you know the last however long when did they first put this together 2012 so unless we ask them to go back and review the work they did in 2012 you will never get the figures for what it would cost to cover crown own property you couldn't do the cost-benefit analysis on that because why not well that's what they just explained I think I mean ultimately I suppose yes you could do it but but it's an exercise to go back to all to all of the land on the port hills that was red zone and work out and do a more detailed analysis of the solution so we go back and read all this solicitation we've just feed them say the solution wouldn't be what they put on so we have to recast the solution it's given what they know now as opposed to what they knew then yes yep so as Donna said if given our level of understanding the solutions would probably be modified so we would have solutions then we have to go back and work out an exercise of all of the land or part of the land or or what-have-you enough the paper that winter cabinet and said it was cost-effective to do area web mitigation you're saying you've got a new way of doing it now that no longer applies it means that it's not cost beneficial no it was based on a hundred percent Yanni what doesn't that point I mean no it was based on one hundred percent we've only ever been we know when the decisions were ultimately made it was only based on our ass contributing fifty percent right so you've got a very different basis for the calculation first time around and I guess that what the government was looking for right from the outset as they did on the flatland was what is a what is a well relatively rough-and-ready way of doing a cost-benefit analysis that's why they chose the 2007 ranging valuations yeah okay I'm second Krishna have is around vacant sections so in terms of our district we might face so someone you know border section currently has no offer we're changing a district plan to prohibit development effectively meaning that the lead becomes worthless what liability do we have in regards to compensation if any or I guess maybe there's a moral argument but you know what's what's the current thinking behind what we do in terms of vacant section owners if we're not going to provide area wide mitigation to an able development so I suppose personally we don't have any liability so people have people would be whatever their circumstances be entitled to rely on existing use rights if they got existing use rights but they haven't then we're not liable for rights that have never been exercised and those rights have changed also there's very few instances in the so the district pan of the way it's drafted now allows for both discretionary and non-complying activity so people could still if they really chose to test that but what we have to do as a council is that as the first principle we high-risk areas which is why may it non-complying and that someone chooses to do that they can seek to do that by way of a consent but they will obviously have a fairly high test to pass to get that last time we discussed this monster was we were still waiting for mb guidelines around rock rock fall protection structures I have those been received what do they say is it easier now for people to apply a common kind of standard to getting litigation for so so the council has its own set of technical guidelines for up for protection structures happen since December 2012 we there's a project that Ian and Don have been involved in recently where mb is working with us to review those guidelines with a view to issuing them I think victory as mb endorsed guideline yeah and I think where's the wider use and that becomes a complication I think take it nationwide they've got to think through a few other issues in the time frame that they are working to on that as a matter it's a matter applicant coming up of the design against those guidelines and coming in the seeking you can see and people are doing their numbers of people doing that right at the moment people can go to mb and get the s124 reviewed impossibly lifted based on some sort of criteria it just seems odd that there wouldn't be any guidelines around around what you know levels of risk and structures I think ultimately the end of the day while there while there a guideline there there that a guideline so ultimately council will still be responsible for issuing for consents and obviously a little bit like our discussion before we will rely on professional judgment by the the geotech engineers and the building control officers to do that so the guidelines will give some sense and I think we where I think we've drawn some comfort the fact that they've taken our guidelines as the basis for what they might do we could all perhaps suggest or argue that you know it'sit remiss of the government or MV not to have had guidelines for this in the of event in the past and in recent history so but you know we are responsible as the building control authority for issuing those consents and the guidelines that we've developed we're confident or robust and doing it final question was I understand we approached the minister he said no to a number of things as their leader that we've got back from home that we could attach or that we could make public I think there is a letter yes yes yeah I think a fairly brief but I think it's jesus I think I'd be useful to see what the request was and haven't recorded in the minutes I haven't got a copy so yeah I don't have a copy on me but I recall there was a formal response from officials shall we just circulate that yes certainly yeah all right can we do that can we attach it subsequently yeah all right so that'll be put on the website along with the report all right well I'll move the recommendation do we have a seconder Phil surprise but I won't_''_1547.539 I won't support the staff recommendation I I do think that as part of the cost year agreement that was signed with the government it was a clear way which we could have actually presented a case of course if it was cost effective to do here avoid litigation to enable people to stand their own communities in their own houses and I just think that we've got a huge issue with people with vacant sections and people that are living in the red zone with s 12 fours they'd have been removed what in some cases people having them put on so I think it's a real shame that we're basically wiping out communities through not enabling area-wide mitigation and I know that the government actually has been one that has pretty much made the call they've basically said that you know they won't support mitigation we're not allowed to use their land I think they may have given us some rights to access certain certain occasions but generally they've been pretty unsupportive of doing do the work and Schultz cost-effective and present the case to them to get areas razon so I can't support us not doing Erehwon mitigation I think it's been unfortunate that it's taken so long because obviously more people have been under pressure to Siddle the offer and that has meant that there's less and less people available to do the song but yeah I can't support the staff recommendation I do appreciate we've got the individual policy approach that we're trying to continue with but there again has been quite hard for people as well to go through puts a huge burden on individuals and it is quite a difficult and time-consuming process to go through so that's like beyond this well for me it's with heavy heart but I will be supporting it I mean we've got to see the meshes at some point that we're levels of risk are too high that we don't endorse people developing in those areas we've we've had a history of allowing development where it should never ever've had a tragic devastating earthquake which has brought a lot of issues out in our city and and I think the way forward is and we've got to start making some hard calls and that's why we're ready to make our calls this is a hard call I am pleased tonight there was still support and individual property protection so I think it's really important because there are some people as we know they're still living there and very dangerous circumstances and I think it's with some urgency we look to actually help those people remediate their properties so they're going to live there safely and we can actually rest easy at night that we've no we're doing all we can in those areas so I will be supporting because I just don't want to send out message to the community that we raising hoax where we know with new information going forward that the likelihood of a she iria won't mitigation has not been me that feasible or possible and in our current financial position and I it's a heavy heart I'll be supporting it fell um guess what's reluctance I support it too I think though we've covered all of the areas and end though you know if it the properties that where it doesn't the mitigation does work for that's been fully covered in it as some poor indicated it's still open for individuals to to apply to to have a their own property mitigated as well an individual basis and there's no question that what it's about is rock for risk and I think we the reserve there is a point in terms of people's safety we're in fact the recommendations do stack up and so it's because this affects individual people in individuals lives that's my reluctance but equally this is for by far the greater good so I'm supporting it Andrew thank you um yeah what we've seen this afternoon is that as at a certain time this could have been a workable process in some situations what we've also seen is that as time has it difficult to support committing further resources to this work and I also think we need to be very mindful of the need to provide certainty and in some cases we know that it'll be unpalatable but we need to provide certainty to people that are caught in these situations the opportunity for individual mitigation does still exist and by providing certainty around the area wide mitigation possibilities then we possibly drive some people into that opportunity instead so yeah again as with other speakers it's with some reluctance that I support this this afternoon but for the reasons outlined I will be supporting it okay so I just want to comment and put on record the actual paragraph of the cost share agreement that I think really does tie our hands and I want to thank staff for actually going to the effort that they have done to try and find every solution that that was possible but again restricted by what has been agreed the parties agree that if a cost-effective engineering solution can be identified and agreed by the parties which will reduce the life residential red zone is no longer applicable to their area the costs are giving effect to that agreed solution will be shared equally between them when the government said that it was no longer prepared to contribute it's hundred percent then that was their decision not to enter into an agreement with us and you know I do thank you for going to the extent of the trouble that you have but I think it's time that we stop the area wide mitigation policy that we continue to work with individuals who want individual rock full protection structures policy as per the December 2012 resolution and hope that in that context will be able to help those that want to remain but you know I believe that our hands were tied before we came along to this council table so you know and I do feel for the people who have been so badly affected by you know their dreams really been shattered by a series of decisions that were made with reference to them so so I'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye Henson's vote recorded I declare the motion carried thank you very much so the next item on
She knows with respect to that that we raised what thirty two thousand dollars for the disposal of the mural damla which will go into the earthquake come well being fund you know the yeah so so that's quite good it's certainly more than some of them some of the staff had suggested we might be getting so and and and and less than then people with the sentimentality attached to it thought we could obtain so um it was a good result the next item on the agenda oh what a mitad it it's no report there's no report sorry I was just that we were hiking bacon nice to pass this that's okay so he's yes so hopefully two weeks time I'll move that we now exclude the public do I have a seconder for that Phil Clearwater I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and
Of the meetings held Tuesday twenty-fourth of june and wednesday the 25th of june I'll move those all was idea yes I was just double check and david east to second I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried
As item 27 which is the simply confirming the minutes of the crash exit accounts or sitting as the hearings panel to hear submissions on the draft annual plan I'll move that second 2 by Andrew tuna I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and that's takes us through to item 28 which are
Then prepare provisions and I think that we have have we got staff to present on this then repair crew is anyone doing that one I'm just yeah okay maybe we'll move we move too quickly because because we feared one meter so well I'll move it we've done that yeah yeah I'll move that does anyone want to see commit term scandrett we've got someone to advise on the operative study plan lanruvia repair provision to set you appreciate its answer questions yep the reporters feely self-explanatory yeah now that it is a complex issue and as well and our recommendation is that that we've been briefed on the review provisions and and I know that council has been briefed so we've had an informal briefing and we've also yes oh we've hidden them formal briefing and so it was yeah but it's come straight to counsel without going through occur because we didn't have an earthquake recovery committee of the whole last week that's so Yanni I know that you were away so I was briefed but I know that you ever say was it at the briefing oh yeah okay I think you would um like I had a higher number of questions that were asked around issues to do with quality reassurance that work would be done if it doesn't need a concede the chicks and what checks and balances exist to ensure that it's done to an appropriate level and I just use the example of the houses that have been lowered into the flood zones in the flood zones that are now getting flooded as a result of not needing a conceit which seems pretty you know unsatisfactory then this particular report is about ensuring that the committee is reasonably accepting of the category eight rules that the briefing was about you're talking about category 9 land counts counselor issue is that um it's it's nice to have an ideology that says let's just speed up prices as a remove the need for consents and for the people that genuinely do the right thing that's that's really good and people really appreciate that thing for the contractors that cut corners or for the insurers that don't want to pay then you know they they can use the loopholes to get around doing what they should actually be doing as a result so you know what I don't want to happen in terms of the city is that in the next five years as a whole bunch of stuff with peers that have done that are create a new leaky building syndrome 10 20 years down the track because the quality is so poor what and it was no consenting and we now become liable because people say that was interfere so if I may I can answer that aunty aunty is recorded oppose role includes a number of standard set parts B&C and it is also a requirement for those works to be signed up both geotech engineer and that's that so gives our chips and balances to ensure that works done properly I know you reviews the work that the geotech engineer does and if people have complaints about their work or all that statement where do they go of reviewing that the certification we wouldn't do that we collect that information and click the certification now if there will be a private matter so that would be on the same basis of any other approving authority or ridges engineer signs or something we wouldn't necessarily be actively reviewing that we would accept those producer statements and they become that guarantee should something happen in the future so that engineer then becomes liable so if there's a you know issue that the work hasn't been done in appropriate appropriately that the person has to take that person to court and we're not liable as a council well we will always I suppose them and it's probably not my area of expertise but we will always be joined probably I suspect if there was ever a civil case against something like that because we are the local authority but principally where you do have some former producer statement the onus lies on the certifying engineer or specialist and paul I died so here exactly where yannis going so I just wonder if there's zone or a flood management zone or land that has actually rated less and TC to wear like you know he talked about with the lowering of foundations that before they get signed off they they all before they actually go to work that there is some work done around properties that rather than route lowering the the building to the lowest point of whether foundations of sunk that they are actually raised rather than a she lowered so on this one if there's a mechanism to trigger that so we ciara made aware that this is a potential risk I think I mean that's a question I don't think that's going to be answered or addressed by these particular all changes I mean what you're talking about is really it's an interface between the whole threshold between repair and rebuilding of foundations and then you've got the overlay of existing use right to enshrine section 10 of the Act so therefore those two mechanisms more than anything to do with these rules are going to drive the behavior about how high new then again this rule can't_''_421.88 I mean that I think in the report we point to the fact that you know if that's something that we want to look at that's something that we would need to investigate but we can't through this process what this meant anism resolve that particular problem I think that both counselors are raising a concern that's identified in the paper that our processes can't_''_444.83 be determined used to determine whether it's a rebuild or repair and a lot of people were looking at the council to sort of say help you know we need somebody on our side because we can't actually resolve the issue with our insurer or what they QC and it's one of the reasons why we've joined the court case for the declaratory judgment in relation to whether the damage to the floor levels in the exposure to increase risk of a nun deja or increased vulnerability to flooding as they described it is also something that there ought to be addressed by way of the floor levels mmm yeah ask how for example that with the new district planning other flood management areas might operate in the event say of council receiving new information so that for example councils to believe that in fact like areas like what is on the map now as flood awareness areas or management as if in fact they would have change in the future it would that mean that in fact the regulations would apply to a wider area that's correct and the current flood management areas are different from what is proposed see that you're right but we would need to go through a plan change to further them in the rules to reflect that new information yeah yes so they are dynamic but they're not automatically adjusting themselves there's also perhaps an irony and the fact that and 2.6 when you highlight the exemption from City plan requirements under Section 10 of the RMA that some insurance companies are actually using that to insist upon people building like-for-like so that so that people are required well that said that they can fall back on existing roof use even to the to the very minimum unfortunate but it yes unfortunately I mean we're never going to be able to the depth design a regulatory regime which which dictates the behavior of different insurance companies because clearly there are there's different practice throughout the industry in Christchurch yeah but I you know I just wonder whether this is something that we should perhaps feedback to central government given that they're addressing the sushi and to say that it would be incredibly helpful if they would assist you know to join with us essentially around addressing the the floor legal issue within the flood management areas yep yeah yani I just wanted to check um because the other issue we've got is contaminated land what my understanding is when the work that the soil that goes back lights if you take land repair there's no checking of the quality or the contamination of a lack of contaminate of the soil that's going back into the land so in terms of land repair what is the safeguard around the types of soils and materials they yeah there is the new zealand standards referenced in the role and again require certification that includes a section about soil and quality of clan film and what does that say what what is that other there's engineer just have to say that it is plain fell from sign it off but I don't remember the exact meaning of it it doesn't need to be tested for from a certain place now it's not that specific it's really one line in a lock box to sign on and if people had to get a consent what safeguard would exhaust if unique in terms of checking on that turns of chicken on deck ground what's in the Phil yep um but really that this the engineer signing it offers yeah is that safe got on that and the hail sites are excluded from this yeah other know the national environmental standard includes the rules that relate to contaminated land sophie

The recreation and sporting hub on pune way item number 23 since this matter was included on our councils agenda we've received a letter on behalf of the lawyers for the Canterbury agricultural and pastoral association with respect to this matter so I'm proposing that we defer well I'm determining that we will defer this matter for two weeks it will come back onto the agenda in two weeks time so that we are able to consider the letter which was received yesterday and and take the matter further in a couple of weeks time and I don't need to move it I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm determining that it will be moved to the to the agenda and two weeks time so we will now
Pretty much and thank you for working so hard over the over the last couple of hours right so now we move on to item 22 which is the report of the Finance Committee there is a part a question around receiving a report of this number of part a so the first one is that is that the report be received on the Theatre Royal charitable foundation analysis some who would like to move that Andrew tuna seconded by Tim scandrett so any discussion about that I'll put that resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the earthquake claims update that again that the report be received moved Andrew tuna seconded by David East yani sorry just like just to clarify three point one point four on page one four nine minus thing is that that amount of money has been paid and stuff have actually shown me the bank print out so just I just think it's important that we just acknowledge that this report is from a little bit out of date and you know the good news they've paid what they owed us so I don't I don't really want to think that you know they don't ever received it just a quick point actually I was an apology I was actually an attendance on the first of July you were there okay well we shall note those two things so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and at the report be as a whole adopted Andrew Turner second does Tim Scandrick I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried moving on
Vicky and Jimmy Mike do you want to comment briefly yeah just briefly on page 5 of that report part 7 board consideration we did have that matter lay on the table pending further information because we had had a meeting prior to that to the set speed limits on those roads but this we found out that this was an interim measure to adjust speed limits temporarily while the other items that you may remember we negotiated with staff at the table yeah they're going out for consultation so just just point to the fact that that what are we what we have passing here today is not going to be the speed limits that will inevitably end up in place right all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried the next is that the reporters
Up dead of june third of june there are no partes I'll just deal with that first so Jimmy Vicki I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried 17th of June part a recommendation
Represent what Graham community board so can I just move the reports oh sorry after we did no we did it all at one resolution I I spoke peace before Belfast in yeah but I've week I've just put the resolution as a whole resolution there are 50 yeah oh okay yeah I just I just very quickly just wanted to draw your attention to 2.1 on page one month's time with Phillips or maybe the philipstown neighborhood place team won an award and I'm not sure if our request to government or in fullerton school has been formally given but if you wanted information to support the reason why you wouldn't shut for that stealth school it is actually the very good work that the local place I've done in the community about making a difference thank you brica tomogram item item thank you madam here account solution
Clear the meeting open and call for apologies I have one apology from ref mangie are there any other apologies could someone move that the apology be accepted Andrew Turner seconded Phil Clearwater I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried I've also been advised that mike davidson from shirley papanui and val Carter from findel from I'm re cheer the cheers of those committees are not available to attend today but there's not I'm not going to receive them as an apology because they're not but I'm just noting that they won't in their respective counselors will take care of that there any items on the agenda
With God's I assume that we've got 22 with no powers so we'll have that Jonnie moved and Paul seconded so would you like to speak to it no parties today if we do have a method that has come up just this week of some urgency which I've I talked to it's not in those particular meetings though so it Johnny do with it now dr. straight away well it depends exam he says I don't know what it is yeah and I might all it out of order depending yeah I'm early this year we were briefed on on the potential closing or stopping of even side drive at gloucester street and at the time the board was concerned about the wake of over the timing of that being Mitch the future the Red John hasn't been decided and we wouldn't want to preclude anything and transport in waves people getting about before that decision was made and on monday this week we had a seminar which we were told but that was going hidden the consultation was ready about the process here while there's lots of other spending priorities they're looking at closing closing even side drive and stopping the flow of traffic Romans I Drive in retreat road through and to gloucester street to go over there gay who's bridge and get to the other side and there's also the potential they're saying that they're closing swans road bridge that hasn't been talked about they're saying that well we've stopped openside drive here that allows us to close this other bridge later on down the track which hasn't been consulted on and so we're really concerned about the process here even sear when they can briefly yesterday aunt stopping roads and the red zone yet they're putting some temporary vehicle restrictions on them until the decisions are being made around what's going to have it in the red zone and we really don't want this consultation to go ahead yet because we think it's a waste of money when there's no full information on what's going to be in the that's a peddling pole or a community volunteer library or you know so there's a huge cost that last time we were asked to approve this council we put it on hold and now they're doing the consultation ahead of us approving the extra funding yeah as it is a council um proposal is it it it it it scooter doing the work but I'm assuming it's council because scooter directed by counsel and what is not zero they're not just directed by council that's the problem yeah okay so so everybody's in roads like the moment in terms of stopping the road legally so cars can't_''_179.2 go down that thing yeah teacher that's why I haven't talked about those are historically always been done by the council and yeah in other words is elected member decision to start that process to either go out for a public consultation don't like a government there is an option under the Public Works and where there's no public consultation for the game council decision and you mentioned Sarah but's not too big for skirt doesn't_''_208.6 in the authority to stop roads in the city we afford must be a council decision and it sounds like no one has any idea no hold that it would come to us for decision once the consultation has been done well no no it has to be the other way around yeah can I said you yet that she would like to email me some emails and all follow up and came to find out what yeah yeah they're actually building a road up and and so the the other side of the road as you will be lower so you won't better access of the spend a lot of money on enhancement so it's going to be because an attachment to this was our briefing on Monday because they're raising a joint and bridge have you got have you got it by email the briefing it's actually on the council we bet we can go in there and download that from the seminar box oh right okay yeah not so much less write a really briefing from Sarah either the tempe road closures in the red zone where dey seem to have section 46 of the zurich where they can just come in and place restrictions without any sort of test or that can you know that so they tell us what they're doing and there's no public process but for a major road stopping like this I'm not sure the legal basis for skirt just being able to do it without going through the normal LGA processes so I think that's a really important piece of information to get better when I do this I also do an email counselors because road stopping is unlegal stopping the way let's never road again road closures are what you refer just the template closure so council does template closes please good this is a stopping go Sarah Sarah can also do road stopping thunderous legislation but this isn't sarah this is not this is that's really clear in the information that this is a skirt project as part of the replacement for the gatehouse road bridge and that the construction detail yeah you know the bridge is about the code is no such thing as a skirt project an isolation from who directs yeah neither directed by oh it's directed by one of the clients and the clients are the nzta Sarah and the Christchurch City Council the other three client we had no further information other than that it was a scoot ones who got real concerns over we wouldn't want anything anything major to heaven like this and stopping the road and making it a cul-de-sac before any decisions are made on no no we we need to make the decision to go out to consultation no so they can't avoid coming to the council first and consult with the community first and then come to us for a decision yeah that's right that's what that's why we do what we bring it up now there are two decision points one before the consultation and one after the consecration but the difference with this one for some of the new but if we went out on a reserve for example concept would give feedback staff and prepare the options and then that guard for consultation without a formal decision and then we'd make at the end of the process a decision based on feedback the difference with us is that there's LGA requirements quite public requirements around a road stopping process which has got lots of other legislation attached to it where it does need a formal decision of the public governance group but the other thing that we need to find out about this one is how is it being funded given that last time it came it was asking for about 700,000 this time we don't we have an approved funding and so we just need to understand what we're that money is coming from my assumption is actually that it's cheaper to put a piece of grass there and some trees and make the the road of cul-de-sac than it is to raise it up to the new road and bridge level ok there's a taking a trip I just I just think that we need to we need a recommendation that a consultation on the stopping of roads as I drive on yeah well the more the stopping of roads and the Burwood Pegasus I'm sorry in the Hagley fair maid ward and and that an urgent report be prepared well be prepared that covers the the process or the details of the proposal the process and the funding model for referral to the board and to the council and that requests and requests that an urgent and urgent report be prepared that covers the details of the proposal the process and the funding model for referral to the board and the council said is that enough to sort of kind of put the process on hold until we get yep call alright so so we'll just deal with that as a single resolution so I put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried so you were right to proceed so it and that's that's all for you so thank you very much thank you very much and
As a plat a Haitian on page 107 makes mention of who's attended the meeting and that there wasn't a quorum I'm just ref mangie isn't down on that has he just been left up for no I think they it's just a hidden received an apology it oh is that I wondered procedurally okay no no I just think that it is it's not go back over things that we've just already resolved so I was trying to get to the I know I'm just trying to move things along rights twelve o'clock so Pendleton y Mari community board item 17 Jamie would like to move this resolution and seconded by Paul do you mind our bearing in mind what you just said and tugging lose that but do you mind if I just took them to the rationale around yeah yeah yeah yeah it's um so all we're requesting is the council give consideration to a policy to allow carry Ford's the reason bang and look I'm going to be really blunt bit stop beating see contractors to a whole lot of roadworks prior to the into the financial year it's not entirely a fallacy the user or loser mentality I don't think always promotes the best decision making and I think it's really sad that when we need to make every dollar count you sometimes see committees boards whatever try to use up a budget for the sake of it and I our view really is that there are some really important legacy projects not just for feeling with my Mari we have some but I'm sure you all do too and instead of having that urgency just to try and spend it for the sake of it we really want to say you know what that's a perverse outcome and if there's something that we can identify that would really like to do that adds real value to the community we would like to have an ability to say let's not spend it for the sake that and carry their forward to really make a difference so I hope that you'd be receptive to that really this recommendation is asking well I'd certainly invite the member to have this raised as part of our long-term plan process but I support the resolution as it stands so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and that the reporters a whole Jamie moved Yanni seconded I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carriage and then hagley ferry made community
So we move on to item number 14 which is the singleton of 14 15 and 16 and Jamie's going to move there and somebody else is going to join him by second doing it Paul lonsdale there any matters that you want to raise so item 14 no parties takers read and happy to move yeah no I move them all three together well there is only one min of on their twitter I think is item oh sorry there is an item a yeah which I think is item 17 it's I don't we haven't got to 17 years so we'll do the other streaming I'll put what I just want to make a comment in relation to what's on page 105 with the record and federal way Murray board decided not to attend the understanding tower Maori course in the chair from the record from a corolla I really mentioned how good that course has been I also attend their course I'm just going about the comment in fact in my view it was very good value for money 105 I did read it somewhere but I can't see it alone in 50 so it's just under the community board advisors update items even I just want to make all right all right yeah yeah oh good to know yep there might be worthwhile just raising with your community board and elected members of information exchange that there was the feedback yeah and those that earned it yeah all right so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and now we'll move on to item 7
Tips community board meeting Paul McMahon we've got two reports that have no part a so Thomas Kandra phil claire border so would you like to speak to it yes sure Thank You million counselors I just wanted to point to we didn't actually have the deputation at 1.11 from the first report but what we have on our resolutions tree we have about seven resolutions regarding the power st. Martin's voluntary toy library at which was housed at 65 sandwich road which is a which is not a heritage-listed building with better hear this building and the N and also that the old st. Martin's voluntary library on the corner of way it's Wilson's and Wilson's road in st. Martin's and I want to point to the importance to our community and of puzzle to our community and to the community groups of rebuilding a facility to house that a person matters voluntary blanket to library as a full name have been through five moves and potentially looking at another one they're applying for funding to look for somewhere else best option by far is bit by rebuilding the facility and the corner of weight and wilson's by building a new facility that the community can use the meeting space and this is what's being was proposed in the community board recommended to committee in I was disappointing that it didn't go forward I just wanted to underline the importance of this to their area of our ward yeah I can't remember why it didn't proceed you know but we're doing a prioritization exercise but I had a feeling that there was something to do with the nature of the building that that led us to that would be sandwich road that you're talking about right and I'm meeting with the gentleman with some expertise tomorrow about that building but then my main item of consumers as the potentially the new community facility that would be quite a small project and I really just wanted to underline how important that is yeah well we are going through a privatization exercise originally there was a holdup with the Summerlands voluntary library on Wilsons a site for them to work from so that originally wasn't there are ones that got been a reason but you know there's a long way to go in the project and before that again the project could be progressing further than it has but I know that you have to prioritize and so in light of that we all wanted to underline the importance is your top priority yep and the possibility that very distinct possibility that the beckenham old beckenham library at 65 70 could be repaired a lot cheaper then that is being presented and it could be a really good thing to keep for community groups which as we know are struggling for accommodation and I'll just point out that that barrington barrington capitals and strippers on our agenda again but we are progressing those conversations so I'm very happy about that thanks for your help with that councillor Clearwater and in really there is the only new up those are the only issues that I really wanted to highlight very good all right I'll put the motion all those in thank you very much think of anybody else us and we've dealt with Pierre would
Apart a report and that will be moved by Ellie Jones and seconded by Pauline cotta I just wondered during the in the course of the background it talks about building 13 roots over eight years and we've changed that in the annual plan to five years so I just wondered if we could make sure that that was updated in terms of the report how do we write so well then then in the resolution can we put noting that at right the beginning is recommended that the council and then a bracket spot noting that the intention is to build the 13 roots over five years yeah the major cycle waiver Michael's major cycleways project over five years yeah is that Alright say that with this some the idea was this cycle way is to to take site to self cranford street in Papa million road and now you're going to get from basically Northlands if you like through to rutland street and then the extinction of that will be down trafalgar and in Colombo and into the CBD but this is the first part we had a deputation at the board meeting from a resident whose properly Beck's onto this reserve and he was upset about the lighting and the loss of privacy now staff has since worked very closely with this person I believe they've actually resolved those issues but these are the sorts of things that start for anticipating that can slow the whole thing down which is why it was originally aes 25 you are so this is an example of how these things will crop up and it's not the money it's these kind of users so I have to commune staff for working any closer with this particular man and God has concerns alleviated ya ali our application either from yourself LeAnn or from staff it's been some mention from one particular community board member that the project the cycleway project has been delayed now I just want to clarify this that originally when we looked at eight and I know that it was reduced to five what is being suggested by this community board member is that five years from this point now is a delay could you just clarify that place no all I don't have all the facts in front of me but are they may not be anyone to clarify it well I don't really want counselors to enter into a debate about a clarification request but we can provide that to you perhaps of culling you could take a notation report back at the next meeting with with a full picture on it because Pauline is absolutely right there was nothing to do with the money it was to do with the capacity and the fact that there is slippage always when there are you know you have to negotiate with property owners over property rights matters so but we've now put it onto the organization that that says maybe but we will deliver in the five years and we will deal with this as part of the long-term planning process but I think it would be unreasonable to suggest that you take into account the that the well I mean it was it was set out on the three-year plan which actually we're in would have the view that it's delayed it wasn't proposed on febri the 23rd no no yeah Danny let's be honest about their um two questions I've given what I've heard about lighting this morning given that I think we're going to have a number of concern people about lighting around our cycleways particularly they're close to residential are we have we given enough consideration to the types of lighting or is that something that we could maybe get some further advice on and the second question is why would you have a comment going past where the cycleway connects into the road like is it possible to maybe have the cycleway separate from the cobblestone so that you know it just seems quite silly I know what things like scooters and other things cobblestones are actually a hazard not not a kind of safety feature sorry we're setting the resolution um rutland street in terms road that's got proposed raised through sold and cobblestones and that whole area with a cycleway actually goes back into the road what's recommendation misunderstood because it says approve that the sealed path formed between grant straighten with combs Road be resolved as a sheared park have I got that wrong is it not a sealed path on page of 41 attachment to pause to I just poked back that's all designating creating that surface has been different identifies it as a slow road for a sheared road so that's why they have to link in with the road till it's a safety feature yeah I would have thought it's not the pathway is that the corner it's too slow but it's where a treat Jerry's got right is extremely acute corner with very poor visibility and has had cars parked what quite well into it it's a it's a dangerous corner that people need to slow down for our suspect this is a three-shot treatment to try and encourage cars to slow down into that space as the cycleway beers with it so like 10 the traffic engineer we can simply get advice from the traffic even if you like no from a sliding I have an issue with is putting the cyclists going straight into a cobblestone into the road and a blind corner it doesn't look like it is I believe it's going into the path the sealed path formed between grants rodin times right that's what it sees in the resolution it joins the pathway not the road is that not right the diagram doesn't show that if they could just be clarified us though yeah okay so can we just can we can we have a noting provision that just simply notes noting that to know yeah and then put note staff to provide advice on well no the way I've read it is that it doesn't join areas of this I think the diagram that Jonnie is looking at is tomes on to rutland so it is that really not it's a pretty nasty corner with the reserve off to the left in the writing of refer or in the text it refers to the sealed path formed between grants road and tones road so they are different areas and on the does in fact look to be the case I can't see that that cycle way does become anything other than part of the road once it comes off that reserve area but it will have a pathway it does have a pathway okay and I think that probably question is is there a shared yeah right yeah okay well let's clarify that okay so note that staff to provide advice on the safety aspects of the connection of the cycle way to and what road is that it that's on to rap on Street the cycleway is running down Rutland not times so it's what we talked about in that diagram is the cycleway crossing times and continuing on rutland yeah yeah yeah if you feel a diagram of a CA I give way sign for the cyclist without with a home rail so they if you pull up the hole under the rail and wait for the the roadway to clear before they she enter into it so it does if she enter off the cycleway straight up to the road yeah we've designed it the way they did it I'm sure there is a reason why they've done what they've done and it may be to slow the cyclists down as well so they don't emerge to quickly on to rockland street and click with the tricky bit cobblestones as an usher so your bicycle is there no question who would you like the advice back to in in terms of your decision how would you know just just just provide the advice we can do it through the chief executives report thank you great all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried on to these Braden
That and now counselor there is a part a yes so they've the lease has expired and although they've been leasing this for many years it's about 20 17 years I think they kind of missed that it was coming up for renewal and has expired and the staff have decided that because it needs earthquake repairs it's not in the least has to go out to the open market so what we're doing is extending recommending to extend the lease for three years so that we can get the work done and prepare it to be put out to the open market and during that time the rent will be altered from being based on the turnover to being a fixed rental for the each year which which the least these are happy with of course they will be able to apply for the lease as well as per the open market so that's recommending that the council agrees to that that that's not binding us to a position of going out to the market because I mean I mean there is an extended period lease but these have been the only Lee sees haven't they just we've given to believes that there is a compulsory to put it out to the open market yeah under our existing policy what else yeah but I mean exactly the same thing happen in South brightener I just I just think that we have to be open to a slightly more flexible approach around these matters but but but this doesn't bind us to their this extends the lease and and in later on and px will deal with the facts annual rent but it's not binding us to a particular position the currently sees would be extremely relieved to hear that they've put a considerable investment into this camp they've got it running extremely well of course at the moment then investments with zero to them so there's this the opportunity to address the entire or later no no no but we've got three years so thank you and and and at some point we will invite that policy to be reviewed yep news yani yeah Mona Vale so like we were told that the elites was terminated and it will go out for open tender so I'm just trying to understand from staff why this one is different my understanding is the difference with Mona Vale was that because of the extensive earthquake repairs that were required for Mona Vale that it was an opportunity to consult people in the industry to be able to work out how to configure things and runner than the future and that was a a line in the sand I think that was drawn as far as being able to start again but I might be wrong I don't see them as similar at all to be honest on Mona Vale was really clear that we had got for tinder and I just want us to be consistent we are all this is is an extension of the lease for three years these are people who have invested their life and to this place this is exactly the same as the South brighton one except the extent of the damages and Asia I think nothing terms of know that there's a fixed date and I mean I great the same case and Mona velvet been there for almost since nineteen sixty-five so it just I mean I welcome us looking at how we do things like this I think maybe there's some work we need to do you know the probably is but that this isn't the time to do it this is around extending this first sound sweeter than that given that um the certainty around the facilities rebuild I I do wonder whether we should actually be try to do it I question whether we need to wait for three years or whether we should actually be maybe doing it for two years or just rolling it over army it's just the staff recommendation is they'll need the three years to complete the earthquake repairs because they can't put the address the lease issue sister it seems silly that you would wait so if you if you're doing with quick repairs and this is again the Mona Vale thing is if you're looking at what your appear that should depend on the future use so you might do things in a different way based on what whoever is operating at but actually fixing stuff just as it is without understand what the future use is going to be doesn't save a very sensible approach madami could I just and you this is a cream background like a different the campground is continuing to operate not only edit in a better financial position than it was prior to the quakes the earthquake repairs my understanding do not require them to vacate Mona Vale has been empty and unusable since the earthquakes can we move on with us I don't see any Yanni that the future use of the camping ground will be the same so that's yeah I fully support reviewing this at a later date ya me anda to be great all right I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and then we have the Grasmere street rutland Street shared path
Are we up to run this one no no fourth of tune yeah there's nothing there so we'll leave it to the next one yeah okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried we'll move on to the 18th of june and we'll have Paul in Qatar ellijay
Porter's that of the Littleton mount Hobart community board and Andrew will move and Phil wall sticker this time that the report be received I don't know if you want to touch on any elements yeah Paula submit the chair and Jane brought and Deputy Chair are both away today so I'm both bring their apologies there's not a lot of note in this report no parties on page 16 the briefings they update on the Norman cope memorial pool the community are very pleased to see works happening on the normal coke memorial pool the demolition is fully completed the sites just about clear and the Littleton recreation center work is not too far away from starting there so in terms of positive things happening in the Littleton communities it's great to see both of those facilities been developed and both expected to be open all part of the recreation center at least expected to be open before the end of the year so there's certainly some good news from this report but some no parties in there so I'll keep it'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know it's carried and now surely pub no a community board meeting at the fourth of June and Pauline kata will move and Ally Jones will second the that the report be received Paul own did you want to thank you for your hip tea parties here first one is free Spencer Park Kemp now these people have been leasing this for sorry I'm reading
The report of the akaroa why our community board meeting of the fifteenth of May and we keep apart a message do what things that is a very well used area if you go down there on Sunday you will see that there are a lot of tourists down there walking along the beach it's a very special area ecologically and they've got a very private that although they are a very small community they are vibrant and there's no community facilities pull them down there and this this particular project is a result of some endowment funding that was allocated earlier on this community are very enthusiastic about it and with this is just the next steps moving forward with the community hall development and the reserve name change of purpose etc okay so would someone like move that Andrew Turner seconded they'll be able to is there any question comments discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's very could I say that that community have already got their landscaping ideas underway already they and hopefully we'll be working through that shortly with that with that issue but the other things out of our our meeting I could I just say in relation to that how important actually our community buildings that how important our community profiles are and mean they've been done with us as communities and that we need to raise the profile of them and if you go back and have a look on it you can you can see information about buildings flat and the issues that are affecting them down there and then for all of us we should be using these profiles and making sure they are living documents and using them but just moving on from there the storm issues are ongoing continuing issues and we've just had a recent meeting with Environment Canterbury to start the working party process involving the board the community the City Council and other parties NZTA and Department of Conservation now they're just a few steps that we need to get through there and we're just looking for what sort of support can the city council process and of course every time it rains people are very nervous you know what is going to happen but it needs to be a considerable rainfall that will cook little cause watch them so I think we can still risk easy and look we're delighted with the on page 11 yep Aram unit this is an advisory committee to the echo museum but we are delighted with the funding allocation from the ministry of culture and heritage and that gives us a huge boost for the township of a Carrara and that we're starting to see now the museum's coming back online the gaieties look as though it might be in the pipeline the rebuild of our integrated family health center including some hospital beds in decorah as they're called flexi beads now is on the way so and the War Memorial also looks as if so it might be in the pipeline for appear to so there are a lot of exciting things happening about a Corral 9.2 there on page 11 look we have some board members who are very reluctant to attend a course where we had two of our members went along and were very appreciative of those opportunities to to join those training sessions came back with new feelings inspiration and understood the issues more clearly so it's important that pets we give to be given those opportunities so this is there's just a few things out of that we're getting we're gearing up the the new Cruiser season of which we're looking at a lower number of boats this year because of boats ships have taken out of service and are being maintained with them quite a considerable increase the following year and it looks as though a corral will be a port of destination for a number of those cruise ships down the track we do have some issues around the information syndrome what's happening and with the Information Center in a Corral and we look forward to the outcomes of of what might either hit them with that so there's just a little snapshot of what the board is involved with just these round these meeting notes very good so adopted and Tim scandrett will second that certainly discussion with emotion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no thank you use again p.m. and thank you for making the journey then over the next
Doing back open and invite Pam Richardson to come and oh sorry I'll just address another couple of meters but you sit down Pam so there are no petitions and would someone care to move that the supplementary reports be included in the meeting both open and public excluded Tom scandrett seconded Andrew Turner I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed to say no that's carried
Thank You Metta mirror on the support of this motion that and really the notion of hot salt water pools for this area has been mooted first in 1928 has been going off for 86 years in my opinion the eastern suburbs and at its communities have been underrated as a major asset to the city underappreciated underfunded and it's an under realized potential at least three master plans have recognized the significance of the coastline and have suggested starting at the beach and working inland very few of the recommendations have been embraced this coastline and and the eastern suburbs could be like Ponsonby was to auckland south bank and the Docklands to Melbourne what end the Wellington waterfront to that city the whole saltwater pools has got a small vital catalyst in the reinvention of the coastal window to the city we commissioned a Community Advisory Panel they've met and made a recommendation significantly it's a single recommendation embracing the notion that's been mooted 1928 the community has spoken with one voice and to quote the report the sum of 20 million was arrived be a significant draw cab for the visit for visitors to New Brighton 20,000 signatories petitioners identified with an aquatic attraction and add to the community advisory panels decision to have a signal recommendation importantly there is no budget attached to any feasibility study or to the project however the notion of a legacy project has wide support of the men with regards to feasibility studies although I know we're not going to proceed proceed they do drawn and look at costs associated with building architecture quantity surveying size range of facilities type and nature of pulse the coastal environment geomorphology hazard areas piping heating of water proportion of salt chlorinated pools just with the you know the concern about heating the water I think a lot of people have overlooked the fact that qe2 was heated by methane from our from our landfill and it could very easily be erected to Brighton to to eat anything they're eating this building also looks at the potential demand of for local and residential usage of it and parking requires considerable attraction has obviously been a accorded to the 90k I acknowledge we need to have research into a special project this nature but I think there's a lot of work being done around both New Zealand and around the city in terms of projects of this nature the Mount Maunganui Paul is a classic example of a great operation that's a council Control Council controlled and operated Paul under the control of the Terrano City Council it attracts 200 to 250 thousand visitors and makes a hundred K surplus the hand my Paul says about a 10 million dollar turnover and returns two million dollars to the urinary district for reinvestment in the polls and other recreation areas I believe it of a concern revisit feasibility of facilities and the current practices of attributing a lot of overhead costs not directly attributable to running a facility and assessing its viability previous managers of there swimming pools locally tell us that a lot of the overheads of the city are lumped on to them which makes their operating costs look a lot worse than they actually are so I believe we need to make a lot of use library would will be next door and that surely must be a lot of technical information relating to that project that can be directed to the hot salt water pools the cancer not organization has a mention the wisdom of the people far exceeds the knowledge of the experts that drives me insane but I think it's pretty on the back and I believe that our local knowledge is not really used enough josephs and associates have built and of the tikka poke balls franz joseph they're currently involved in a project in queenstown and have a huge amount of experience in hanmer and yet we don't often use a lot of those sort of people to to get involved in their projects Ellen Doran's another one who had 20 years experience running the qe2 vault and has a huge amount of knowledge and yet we use a lot of old offshore experts who invariably sometimes to a desktop analysis and we don't give I believe the full picture this council was elected with a mandate of tune in the organization into a can-do operation of the hot salt water pools for new brighton and moving forward which I think we are going to do in this in this recommendation and we need to move forward with them not believe with a multi-faceted design combined design feasibility expression of interest to a process that acknowledges the community desire for this project that's been going on for 86 years and a need for it to progress and not be built delayed by further unnecessary reporting I think within this design feasibility of interest prices we can deal with the aspects that have not been addressed in projects built in close proximity or dealt with within the construction of similar projects else will the community advisory panel have expressed the desire to be involved in the process and I believe that the community should be involved as often the parameters for feasibility and or design are often crafted to achieve their desired outcome that does not necessarily reflect the desired outcome of the community so I support this motion obviously there are some considerable concerns around funding and that there is a a genuine desire identified are opportunities for strategic partnership there are opportunities for this council to be to do the project themselves or create a council controlled organization to run it there are a number of opportunities that we could explore to fund this project I believe that it's long overdue and as I said it's been 86 years and the consideration and I certainly think it's long overdue and we should be getting on with it now so I encourage fellow councillors to support this motion we have before us today and let's see this project underway for the betterment of not only new brighton but for the whole city okay I'll take Paul Yanni and then Glenn I just want to say a big thanks to the bureau Pegasus community board but also to pull xiamen and eastern vision qureshi rounding the community up and bringing them all together on this project I'm a mess of supporter of strengthening our natural assets and I believe this legacy project will strengthen a natural asset which is that coastline and also I think that it's not just for Christchurch and Canterbury and I think we need to be looking at more of these ideas and strengthening our community as a whole and I really want to get behind this here and I think it's a great way forward that's why thanks guys and I will be supporting this today baldo yani thank you um look I'm really supportive of looking at a legacy project a new brighton I think we do need to get on and get us work progressed I just have to go back to 7.3 because we need to take the community with us that's incredibly important but the community advisory group have never seen the 1.3 section of this legacy hot salt water pool report they never saw that report it went to the community board on the day that the community board made the recommendations so we're basing the scope that hasn't been seen by the we're we're being asked to agree to a sky that hasn't been seen by that community advisory group my understanding that community advisory group then an idea the Surf Club so it just seems really hard and I appreciate that you've made it a minor amendment to it based on but not limited to but that we're actually making a recommendation for something that does not give effect to what the community advisory group solved which was a hot pool facility that included the Surf Club so can I are Laura the advisory group did not include the sort of Club proposal thank you on a hundred that the trouble were introducing by way of debate something that wasn't raised as a question so anyone could ask an answer it's just as problematic well can we get can we get a response from staff or from someone as to whether that's true or not because we have no information around the key advisor group I've understood been given information not just recently that they did include it and I think it's important that we understood but if it can be changed in terms of 7.3 to include a specific reference to what the community advisory group sought as being in the issue I think the idea of adding in the woods but not limited by was to enable us and I mean with Andrea myself Carlene and Glenn and David had to sign off on the expressions of interest so what we don't want to do is to hold things up if the surf lifesaving club don't want to be part of this process so you know it's of course we'd want it to be a single facility if it was possible but we don't want to hold this up and we don't want to hold them up either so I just continue then so I really love the idea of the salt hot water pools I think it makes a lot of sense but I also love the idea that education that having children going to the beach to learn about beach safety is incredibly important if we look at journaling statistics in new zealand if we look at the groups that are over-represented in drowning statistics marley pacific island people we know that we have in our city communities close to the that do live in that area so providing the education providing beach safety and actually doing a joint for saut√©ed I actually think makes a huge amount of sense and I've been incredibly impressed with the work that has been done over through the new brighton business ale and Association group and the other people that have been involved around that possibility of actually getting a 1 1 a 1 for education a wonderful community I went for the private sector a win for creating a legacy that creates investment in new brighton and I I still have to say that when you when you look at the whole rationale behind the what hot salt water pools and the report was presented on the day to the community board that is based around health and wellbeing for people spending large amounts of money to go and get beauty treatments and get therapy etc etc it seems to mess what I think is an incredibly important aspect of what the community advisory group wanted and of what I think we should see as a benefit to the city which is ages and about being accessible to a wide range of people so I'll reluctantly support 7.3 but I do want the group that's just being delegated this responsibility to consider including reference to education and the surf club and the aquatic facilities and that in that document as it goes out and because I can just read 1.3 and look at the absence of any any information around education beach safety surf club there is no reference to at all and it has a very different focus to what I think the community advisory group has asked for then I'll be quick Mira counselors the main thing I'd like to say today is that my my viewers that the community just wants to hear the council say yes one meaning of legacy is gift and this this can be the council's gift to them there's nothing so powerful as being remembered and that's what the the hard hit our new brighton and the wineries community would like today the feasibility studies that came out of David's idea for a waterpark gave very way to revitalize the community so in my view the case is very strong already prior to a specific feasibility study that would actually show yes it would work and in my view I think it would obviously for New Brighton so if we can throw our full weight behind this start at the high level some of the concerns which journey is bringing I've actually heard an annual plans over the eastern Rick and SportsCenter over educating our children and our lifeguards are cetera when they need to rescue them so that we have these facilities so I think it'll be taken care of in other words very good and I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that's carried thank you very much so um I think that you have you got any other pat or Andrea before you go have you got any other parte decisions on your other you here so the first meeting foliage or can we do first of all deal with can we deal with the item number 12 which is that because'm going to assume that David and glean will move and second that the report be received and I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and the one before is the item number 11 and it's part a was just the rough 50 domain one so and there's a board recommendation which actually read to me as if it was the same to the as the previous as the staff recommendation you want to force there are you happy to move the staff recommendation Glen and David do you want to speak to a Andrea I don't know it was feeling straight for all straight forward yep everyone's happy I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and then I assumed that counselor Eastern counselor at Livingston will move and second that the report as a whole beer adopted yep yep it's just that I comment that in the 5.1 regarding caspian street and the rest of future flooding events destroying council's attention to the fact that embankment last week local residents expressed some concern about the size of the aggregate and gravel it was being used that it wouldn't do the job they were assured that the engineers said it would we had a storm last week and half of it disappeared and now we're back using something substantially bigger obviously some considerable cost to counsel so I think that's a classic example of the wisdom of the people far exceeds yeah let's catch up the exploits and well you know that we waste a lot of money at times well um that the reporters a whole be adopted before their maybe if we put that the chief executive be asked to report back on item 5.1 in relation to the recent flooding event okay and that the report is a whole be adopted so right thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or as opposed say no that's carried and it's you done and dusted thank you very much it he is thinking right Phillip faithful hey thorn sweet yes name is continually of deputations is that on your one no it's and in this one that's some 55 2.2 it's made of a metro bus review deputation that's a minor thing but it's completed up how's it my spell no wait its crude no its crude the way it's spelt no that's right um maybe it's just your board where it's going no no today today that is hey thornthwaite yeah all right I'll adjourn the meeting for morning tea and we'll start again at eleven-twenty thank you
And now could I have Paul Simon from the New Brighton legacy project good morning welcome back thanks no great surprises what I'm coming in today to talk about I was actually going to come in with my dental presentation to the one I came with three months ago and one that I came with six months ago because we keep going around processes and similar attributes in this case that I did meet with staff quite recently and after the last council meeting as well and I have to back up Caroline Thomas here she's been absolutely fantastic and going through the process we've started obviously exploring the Legacy Project quite quickly and we're supposed to be back I believe at the end of May so everyone's running a touch behind as it is the staff recommendations put forward we're supportive of it's at that time we start running some of the numbers the feasibility and business case behind what we're actually looking to do and you brighten as well we're still treading water as far as I'm concerned over the last 20 months and those have been widely agreed upon through the legacy advisory group which was a spinoff of the community advisory group for the New Brighton master plan there was the appetite to see some significant investment from Christchurch City Council in New Brighton so the community advisory group came up with a dollar figure which is obviously in the report currently the community in New Brighton is asking for some level of commitment from Christchurch City Council moving ahead currently we've got a master plan that's still got a few more hurdles and loops to go through but that doesn't have a budget behind it there's simply no money at the moment and one of the big things we need new Brighton is investment from a commercial perspective I'm working incredibly hard with the private industry sector to make sure we have forward movement and that is going incredibly well but still we're waiting for some level of commitment moving ahead part of our biggest thing obviously has been making sure that we're looking at holistic approach to things of the pier and library it still gets used against New Brighton to an extent is that there has leave a little visa in the past that hasn't worked why has it never worked in the past the government actually did a peer review not too long ago pardon the permanent peer review they painted a review on it and it was an isolated planning project it took 30 years of community fundraising etc etc you've got one little project on the foreshore with no connections back to the commercial we currently have a master plan and process happening at the moment one of our criticisms are what that has been that it's been focused on B 1 and B 2 and it hasn't been able to extend the scope outside of that for us we're looking at a suburb wide master planning process so years for focused on the b1 b2 but exploring those opportunities outside of that that gives us a holistic approach to the CBD rebuild this legacy project is the opportunity to look from car park to car park Lincoln to commercial having that legacy project on the foreshore this is only conceptual imagery we haven't_''_188.92 changed it in 20 months because we haven't progressed any further as it is what we were looking at was obviously the mirror way aquatic Surf Club with salt water hot pulls straight up at the last council meeting we had a workshop with surf lifesaving new zealand some community groups jazz max and our appointed architects and we went through what the Legacy Project couldn't tell and next steps for that we also had involved Tony Joseph's and associates there behind Franz Josef hot Paul's Lake Tekapo and Queenstown hot pools they've got data which is two months old and that's completely relevant to what we're talking about they're the only firm in New Zealand that's actually working on hot pools right now so obviously that's incredibly relevant to what we're talking about and their data is fresh so as much as we're looking at feasibility in business cases we are urging that the council uses some of the consultants quantity surveying panel of Christchurch City Council so they are an accredited by Christchurch City Council the big thing for me is opening it up to questions I can sit here and go over the same things as we've been gone over for the last 20 months three different designs and hot pools are ready the bottom rights actually from 1928 so that gives you an idea of how long hot pools have been talked about we're still on the same boat if anyone wants to build bottom right one I think that thing's awesome the top left one is what's come out of Jason mill from perv Anish top rates come out of evan smurf in the bottom left was tony joseph's and associates we're looking at a transitional facility which we were hoping for obviously a water park or eastern rican sports that was a transitional facility that had a preliminary budget around four million or four sixty two thousand dollar feasibility study behind it for a much smaller scale so nick steps for us that we're totally supportive of obviously study that's something we'd like to get cracking on pretty soon it's going to be impossible to decide the scope and scale of this facility without having some of the numbers crunched around it it's it's a reasonably simple way forward at the moment though as far as I'm aware there is no budget behind this proposal the the legacy project I'd love to be proved wrong on this but at the moment there doesn't appear to be a budget behind it and it would be good to have an understanding of what a scope and scale we're looking for for this facility as well these are some of the other surf club aquatic facilities that are being done on the foreshore internationally so North Bondi Surf Club works incredibly well and once again the marowak on Sept is the big one that we've been backing it off which is why jazz Mack's been involved to date as well you can see that we had the workshop and there were some of the outcomes of that looking at scale have some questions I'm hoping you've got some questions yeah um Yanni thank you I'm just trying to understand you said you support this the recommendation that have come through from the staff do you support the board recommendations as well there's one part of the board recommendation where they're looking at a reallocation of funding from a community board level that's the only boat that I've done agree with I think it's a nice gesture to start hurrying this process up along the way but considering timelines the only problem is were under-resourced and burlwood Pegasus for community groups currently and taking funding frog understand that but so what I don't get from your presentation and from what you said to the supporting recommendations as the Aquatics earth arc or poles doesn't that doesn't appear to be part of the any of the recommendations they face one of the creditors in my head when we talk hot polls the scale scope location we still don't have an understanding of this project that's one of the issues potholes what scope and scale the Surf Life Saving Club currently is working with Jazz max for a new redesign of their facility so they're already looking at a two and a half million dollar build on the foreshore for themselves what we're looking to those partner these projects together so when we're looking at hot pools is the ability to add value to that by partnering and with an existing project so do we need to specify that in the recommendations because it seems to me I'm really worried the surf club will do their own thing and we're gonna do a whole another process room Facebook or what seems yeah I think as part of the business case of feasibility study that we were looking at was that we would be hopeful that we would be a part of those conversations and have the ability to input into those business and feasibility cases as well to ensure that there is that holistic approach taken with the issue sand STL reports of last year as a desktop review so we weren't actually able'd love to be a part of those conversations I think it makes a lot of sense Tim I'm you mentioned with regards to the the pier in library it was soon to be there was a disconnect between dead and the business community is with your picture with regards to the hot holes or the pull up by the surf club this seems to be a larger disconnect so now I think it would be that you would want to pull summer very close to the library if not connecting or that the connection between library and the cube then at the mall itself yes there's there's a lot more work behind this I guess then these pictures here and a lot more that needs to be explained what we're looking at that as original concept pictures are very very old what we've done since then on the top right here you can see there's a three identified locations for the facility the one issue is is moving it too close to the library at the moment we've got free space as could be further well utilized the disconnect I was talking about is that you've got a road going through with one pedestrian crossing they're part of what we're talking about for village and a water park which went up in front of the previous council multiple times was many assets strategically placed around the New Brighton regions so when the water park went through that a secondary spend benefit of 3 60 is a go to facility you go to a vending machine you buy a cup of coffee what we were proposing is a series of different facilities and and around New Brighton that you would get an engagement process worth and that came back of secondary skiing benefit of 27 per person or something so you can see the statistics of that it's not just locating a facility close to the business district or even in the business district and so open up commercial land it's ensuring that the linkages from these facilities are in place back to the commercial but that this isn't the only project that's occurring in New Paul these gos game report says you know with Davis what a pipe idea did suggest the secretary head over there it'd be a strong case or it suggested working towards the village and a water park concept if you like so you've got any thoughts on me well there's a series of private industry investments that are potential around New Brighton so from wave garden on Alice Terrace which is obviously one that we're sharing quite heavily there needs to be a project to Kickstarter and that goes back to the HTS and STL reports as well we can't start with nothing which is at the moment what we're looking at so if they need a starting point I think dying from water park down to nothing and meeting in the middle somewhere that the ability to start for legacy project on the foreshore of some scale there's a good way to kickstart things on top of that the village and a water park out there are building other assets around the area that's something that will continually be worked upon we're not going to be done in your Brighton in the next year this is a long term planning process Viki you mentioned some other projects do you want to tell anything about those there's a few that I've bet commercially sensitive at the moment look there are by the end of this year there'll be a lot of good news coming out of Brighton yeah we've been working incredibly hard for the last two years certainly haven't_''_667.17 been sitting around doing nothing there's a lot of the master plan implementation etc is underway and we'll work incredibly hard on that there will be a series of good news stories to be coming out at the moment we have to park them until they're real I don't want to go out to the community and promise something we can't deliver quite yet in terms of potential for New Brighton would it be fair to say that by testing the market with an expression of interest at this stage might infect produce a strategic partner that would mean that in major part of its contribution with with potential additional support on a strategic partner basis rather than having to run it completely itself difficult to say I've been quite a big fan of looking at public-private partnerships obviously it's something that we brought in last time already as well that there is a way to explore that as to a way forward I'm not 100% certain on that it's something that we've discussed obviously before but what the community is asking through the the legacy advisory group as a sign of commitment Christchurch City Council it does feel way out in the boondocks and the wild wild East and it really does feel like there isn't a high level of support and that's a feeling that's based on the community it's already committed thirty million dollars to an Eastern Aquatic Centre yes this is an addition today so you know I understand how people feel but I also have to again repeat the the financial situation that the council finds itself owned makes us irresponsible not to look for strategic opportunities think that going down the direct of identifying a contribution without knowing what the what the costs are actually going to be it actually just tells people that the council will put an X amount of money and that is not a good commercial discipline so what I'm very keen to do is to promote the concept that we go out with expressions of interest to find out what the private sector interest is either on a completely commercial basis or on a prior public-private partnership as you say if the expressions of interest has been tried before a new broker on the foreshore it was for any purpose and the only expression of interest as I understand that came back at that time was for a multi-story hotel and that was an association with a plane change that actually raised the the heights on marine parade so I don't think that anyone has gone out with an expression of interest to operate what I believe will be a perfectly sustainable commercial activity I can only represent my organization on the community's appetite obviously for the area and see how they felt about that before and it being in a public setting and saying whether I agree or not to it I think there are definitely areas to explore with public-private partnerships moving forward but I don't think it's going to come to zero cost I don't think laned a zero cost and I don't know that that's been factored unto anyone's consideration of what the council can contribute to the project and I'm not saying that that's all that we can contribute but by going out with a set amount of money and then expecting the private sector to not regard that as our contribution as as beyond comprehension does anyone got any other questions all right well I think thank you very much and pips can I am by Andrea to come up and we'll deal with this item on Eugene now
Members have a declaration of interest to make I haven't_''_3.17 been advised of any gives me none and now we'll move to deputations and the first two deputations are deputations that would have gone to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole but that was cancelled in terms of a lack of substantive agenda agenda items and so I'll invite both of those one after the other to come first and the first one is Taz makram window founder and CEO of the Canterbury Business Association tears would you like to join us thank you and you give them 15 minutes and allowing for Question Time within that period so 10 minutes as the as the llama thank you in yep we made for assistance with a site for an international market so deputy mayor is to be Vicky buck gave some stuff to look and work with us over the last three months so that process has been going well however we have not been able to resolve any specific site at this stage that could be used for a market for international people three objections to commercial and to permanent so I have addressed each of these needs that I think certainly the need for a market is quite evident in terms of the number of people who support the idea I also believe that charging a stall fee does not make it's unusual or necessarily commercial because we're still a charity and the permanency of the markets have proposed that we look only at a summertime market in this instance so launch it for summer for our city and we can review the future of that could post that period the staff sentiment seemed to be that perhaps we need to join in other markets also grow slowly or look at private land our explorations of private sites have proved that it's quite expensive obviously to rent sites and we actually looking for an opportunity to make a start but I must add that if not exhausted looking at private sites we can continue to do that so what I've come here today is to look at possibly just three or four suggestions one of them is that possibly if know that it's a designated space for market we are happy to start there it is a matter of making a start it's in the middle of the city and there's a blue shindy and it's close to the restart there's possibility to of hey glee park they are complications around other events but I know there is a commercial kitchen there that is currently closed there is a swimming pool which is great for the families and has been enjoyed by the community in the past there might be issues around rehabilitating those facilities but also I would like to find out what the intentions are post April if we started in cathedral square for the crowne plaza site what I presented before you as well as a plan which I've explored that has utilized a space similar to Victoria Square in Belfast where they've created a therapy from Victoria Square to so for example in this case 70 kill more Street using a covered roof and I believe that a future plan of that sort would utilize that Park in that into the future but in this particular point in time the other constraint I saw is that the Public Policy Act for 2010 which governs where people can trade is still quite narrow because it has not been reviewed since the earthquakes so it only allows for a few places such as the Art Center the cathedral square victorious queen and possibly by approaching council you can get right to other sites so I believe if we looked at expanding this in the moment as to where public spaces could be used for trading that might be assisting the stuff as well to give more options for our kind of request there any questions well I think I think you've presented to the council before which is possibly why they're there aren't fear the question so you'd like us just to simply take this request and and come back to you with a with a response yeah I believe that short of some sort of a directive we're going to actually not be able to get a resolution as to where we can put a some specific some specific suggestions yani high-test welcome back every time I see you I ask this question so I'm given the time that's gone through but Sarah and the government owned a huge amount of land in the central city now probably more than we do heavy house conversations with them going have they identified any sites with you that you could possibly okay so I haven't identified any specific sites they are facing the constraints of needing land for major projects but yeah so it's not be impossible to say which land is available for which period of time where a temporary market could be set up and I possibly believe that council may have a lot more instrument in terms of public land that could be used for this type of event in terms of the experience the policies around events and trading in public places have you talked to them about that Eastern frame they seem to have a huge metal end in the Eastern frame and the idea for a market reacts to residential would seem to make a lot of a council staff member but yeah we just haven't been able to make much progress in terms of Sarah and the sites that they may have for such a man should just so I'm clear you're now asking us for a permanent site the idea of a temporary transitional uses sort of no longer out I think we need to look at just giving it a start and that's what I'm suggesting aid a sort of a November to April market that would allow us to do it in summer period and possibly outdoor and possibly adjusted cathedral square all right thank you very much much appreciated could I now invite kevin mccauley
That it's back on that one and then we are on item 27 28 sorry 28 the hell moores lane bridge just a second to just I'll just get you to tell me that when you will just have it really on that damned if there's okay how moores lane bridge right this is the intriguing saga oh is it a wrote are you sweetheart yeah move anything you want Glen right home was lane bridge and we had a deputation last time and we were not sure whether the consultation was okay and Richard is now going to tell us the what is not in question is that how male has been closed I think those and we've provided some new information for a memorandum the gate of 1967 was not correct which which the delegation picked up you know me now sure was eighteen ninety-five so the the fact that the road was closed has no material effect on the consultation was certainly closed the date of 1967 was not correct we think that Dave related to what was happening with harper ave extension since is that under the reserves act 1977 does not appear to authorize a through Road in a recreation reserve and we're also we also have the reserves empowering Act 1971 for a bleep are as well and the legal opinion therefore concludes that given section 54 of the 1971 reserves impairing air as reserves it that no part of hagley park may be taken or set apart under the Public Works Act for any public whatsoever will be extremely difficult for counsel to now lay out he'll moores lane the South section as a road in terms of in terms of a road access through the park okay so the recommendation so we've got a staff recommendation and aboard recommendation okay ref would you like to take us through or Jenny take us through he hasn't seen enough ah do you not to true confessions were you I'm happy to would you like a mover in a second arrow well which which resolution would you happy I thought we act for maybe um filme I married to move a note if ref doesn't've got our board recommendations are aligned so I'd be happy to move the board recommendation not enough yarn your poor f want to second need to see in them in so can I just be clear which motion we're actually going through it's all stored recommendations it's not sorry sorry um Oh no the board's options unlawfully oh yeah I was just looking for a matter of process do we have a resolution agency like order any we go see actual can't_''_233.59 do things that are illegal it's cut and dried let's just look at the staff recommendation because legally that's all we can do ok we asked if you cut clarifications or he'll get Peter to provide that clarification Peter Robert oh sorry so so the clarification was another razzoos ok this stop road cannot now be permitted by counsel to be used as a through Road okay so is the staff recommendation legal and the board recommendation illegal yes yes yes so are we saying that we're voting on a Hobson's choice will weaken hmm can vote Yes or abstain because you can't voting there's a silly dope it enhanced oh there's a rabbit already but I'd like to clarify the fact there was a road there before the earthquake there's a road there now can I the road was legally stopped in 1895 so legally there was no road there physically there was a reformed carriageway that legally there was no row since 1895 the legislation has intervened in particular reserves it now because one step back when the rover's stopped the land became recreation reserve and became part of hagley park subsequently we have legislation which has intervened including the reserves act in 1977 and the reserves precious City reserves empowering egg in 1971 those those statutes govern the use that you can put recreation reserve to and quite simply in very very basically you cannot build legal road or road recreation reserve and in specific and specifically as Richard mentioned the impairing x has a stronger provision which says thou shalt not take any part of hagley park for a public would I erode but that existing it was there unlawfully so it's not a bit longingly until that act it was it was their lawful until 1895 and it's set here so what is what do you mean doing honey 20th yes I just found this out all right is there any case law around this where roads have been there which have been taken away because they were illegal because of some strange so the different the particular difference here is you have statutes which say we it cannot be road but it is a road well it's physically a road it is lawfully not a road to to lawfully make it it returned it to be a new road we would need to take cognizance of the existing statute or we would need to ask the government to ramin those provisions which so could people sue the council for having an unlawful road for the last god knows he'll um somewhere some busy some busybody could have gone to the court and ask for decoration to require the council to remove their Road yes they could have done in position has moved separately from the practical position now we're talking about possibly returning the practical position to some sort of agreed status now we have to take account of the legal impediments and those are pyramids prevent that happening there are other examples of this in Christchurch that we don't know about well we don't know them yet I've simply been asked to advise on this particular instance Richard might be able to tell you if there are he's nothing malice if there is cost you where they can be remotely with public roads you can't hit living situations or past where some people will have like here we have the duplication courses looking to connect with hints always has come out to another situation too on the field stomach we're here to do a survey having somebody found that and I'll use by pedro street I'm not saying there for road by suddenly the whole little part of it does my own by the concept but still old leads land from the 19th century and we need to go may never come across this again or to hear there may be others this with the sort of thing mailbox but they're just haven't replied to talk okay I got a proposal or an idea we fixed the bridge to a strength that could take but probably wouldn't take I weekly ational car I refresh your car and if cars happen to use it without authorization that would be just the case the unlawful thing is not building the bridge it's so that I was saying it's been out of North over 125 years what is the unlit all part of it then an awful part is using the approach as a road yeah right the bridge the preachers actually it's still part of Hell moores lane as soon as you haven't get on the other side of the river it's recreation creation how could it be used for an emergency exit the reserves that will commit driveways and pathways for the use of the reserve so the use would need to be tied to the use of the reserve so the should remove the road completely because cars are driving down currently I can't go walking so we really should actually remove the road all together that's what you really say no no no if they're using that that that formed carriageway to park their vehicles while they walk in them how they drive onto that that's awful if they drive on to that I Drive to send that stop on the way we're into town yeah we have to wonder what so then I could drive on a park and then like a get out of the car come back and then drive and drive over the bridge and they have the other end if they really wanted to maybe thought I think dave was next two questions what are the what's the procedure to actually formalize tillek nicely wanted to actually say well let's make it legitimate first question and signal months probably the reverse what if we just do nothing and ignore it and carry on well that the answer to the first question is it would take an amendment to a parliamentary amendment which is of course a significant bureaucratic process to undertake why well it's simply what it is it takes I can take one to two years to an amend an active power I was totally out of 25 years to give this fair enough this is the issue that you need to think that that position turning on sibley 14 sportin is result of to get ourselves all right regal bars this is a piece of laying that was part of there is a road through higley maybe not or we just legitimizing what's already there now that I point Robert way before you've had a physical characterization see with no one knew that it was not need to write your now period of information of black and white that it is not legal road trip creation was there and to take the point that Paul was raising before drive the reserves aculaser driveway so you can have roads and parkview drive you don't a car I can you don't need to play in Brazilian walking resort desperate what is not legitimate council from practical point of view you know turn them into colder sack of some porn so the public could not use it as a food Sorry Sorry those next he's been very patient I had actually look we could go around around this all day and and we've got a risk of quite a big agenda to get through look that Richard Hunt has been right resonant and has reporter Kelly the stock road cannot now be pen by council as a su road let's accept there is a clear staff recommendation on paid suit on page seven seventy it's a it's the same really as one of the options which came to council when we asked for this to the legal part that we looked at the recommended option allows pedestrians and cyclic says it's a safe option let's just do it and if the community ball want it brought back that's fine tourniquet this is what we have in front of us a day and we were a lot of other work to do to any of you guys will have a very practical impact on that area I used to live in desmond street for and obviously use this road illegally for many years but it will have a very practical impact on the people getting in and out of that area if we're after some funds and perhaps go back to the examiner christmas decorations but they write on it they raise another point those if I move the motion be put no it's too boring well well well it will get it to it in a couple of minutes if you're talking about coming to that place to park up and actually walk around the park you should be able to come from the other side of Hell's more rain over the bridge to park up and actually use the park on the other side of heaven lady I can't see any way around it can you can you guys with your creative legal brains and your other creative brain step you can't find a way around it okay so we stuck with the staff recommendation whether we like it by Jenny right and Yanni this is a very succinct question otherwise feel was going to move his motion violent what concerns me as we went out for consultation with options that weren't actually legitimate so I think we're in terms of the process no actually cuz we said to pick it's a decent repair it we didn't say we want to put a road through hickory park I think we'd ask that question we may have got a different response are you satisfied that the consultation we've done is robust enough if it's challenge because I can't see this being something that someone challenges options of in terms of the bridge repair thinking at that stage that the access could continue they unfortunately we have to write to all the submitters and form them that regretfully the access one of the options has been legally removed okay he has it you've just had yep just focus on getting those Christmas decorations yep Dave didn't just a point of clarification are you saying that we cannot legally put the board all of them yep okay if we put this recommendation and it's lost what happens then that will be really interesting we can try that you like but I can't see another solution yeah yeah still it's not yours but it's not used for through traffic at the moment it's shut off hmm that's true Pauline so we saying just a clarification we went out with two options okay then one of them was legally not correct two of them were legally not correct so if therefore effectively moving out this one option which is also illegal we went out with three options but we reduced to one yeah but that's not I don't think that's okay as I don't you have to lease more than one option oh that the the other options we've now found since not legal I think we're on shaky ground here agree with yanni I wonder if we should start the process again well but the option that they've got is what as either close that or close it off it options that we mean out with already is I think we've made an ear of you and I agree with yanni we need to be careful I think we need some advice about it but it go that we are now in the situation where there are no options there are solutely there there's no the no decision to consult listen I think that we need to do it again so what the community is going to get is a letter saying look I'm sorry we our options were not option I just clarify your point Pauline is it quite legal now to limit as I understand it your saints quite legal for us to having done that to limit it to the only legal option that we now have absolutely right and there's no challenge and that challenge in that and why it's the process Weiss it would have been useful for the legal advice you're being given earlier in the process they didn't occur but that but the reality now is that there is only one option available you know there go leg and consult on a single option exactly yet if we stick with this option and put an amendment to repair the bridge to a better level so that a car could accidentally park on it didn't say that okay I don't think you can actually do it I think your intent is contrary to the law cool and I think there's a few rules about their local government good try though Dave I can't for the love of me understand why we cannot go back to to government proposing a bill that doesn't just allow proliferation of roads anywhere but just legitimizes this particular piece of road why can we not do that hey from over local world to change the 90s in resilient parenting the good works is is that you're not like that but public works and without any problems with it you can think about Mustafar the reason why I raised before history is just that in my view provide last youth is a very import to go from that point it is an option that's like you but I like to move an amendment not only we pursue options to legitimize how folks like make it happen roads through heavy pack really really you really want a good you see 425 years on a good use of ratepayers money it's been there for a hundred time I guess we've got other priorities lets me okay okay so I haven't got any other amendment before me so I'm going to put I put that you seriously want us to go and revoke the night asked to revoke their no no I'm not asking to revoke their I'm all I'm asking is to legitimize that particular piece of road that's been there for a hundreds of over a hundred and twenty-five years but I'm hearing from Peter that doing that means revoking the nineteen 70 let's put another button private member's bill through to legitimize hell moores lane it doesn't mean revoking nights in Baptism para necklace accidentally package reparations what to do is promote on the amendment with to the words of the effect that helm use as a legal road and then take us through that process Peter because that will take what two three years it would take probably a cup of usability election coming up you and what you're here to do the local consultation called their concept of that particular local to it's a long time to wait at the bridge to get across it just seems to be a potential a bit of though oh no no it's not to be fair to be totally fair that is the process of a local bill these are aligning it very well but also yes we know yeah now the other options we've got is the county could say the staff today we'd like you to go away look at your own counsel objects which would be quicker combat perspective other that would involve you can see the government can see and I got to very heavy partying Jane I don't think we should point out that mr. Mitchell's summary includes a lot of staff time and cost but if we subsequently we're successful the option would be I think we would add on more cost for the road to so council should be aware if they want to go down that path I don't know that option threes half a million but that's not taking into account for fixing the the road that isn't a road okay I'm almost regretting not accepting your motion now of putting the motion so have you actually seriously got an amendment well I would seriously my concern is no no no no yes right have you or not hello move that we consider options to legitimizing the section of howell moores lane that passes through hagley tracked by seeking a local but I sit through order and council or amendment to whatever okay is there a second up with it I'm sending a sensing it's not going to pass by always Mitchell okay right can I go back to the motion Lee yep okay I've got the motion I thought this was going to be a two-minute do we want to put an apostrophe I see how muslins actually got an the old deed I don't know who helmor was oh hey or there you go EOD key back I'll put this those in favor please say aye those opposed Oh Carrie what do you want your vote record to get step what's that he use don't give a right
Hey I would declare that carried thank you guys I've got no idea where we are now where are we clear the addition of a memorial in okay so I now need to move the resolution to exclude the public and put into the public excluded the male land site okay so that's moved by Jenny and Sigrid buckle put that those in favor please say aye those opposed thank you all of your public you can stop us live streaming now
Just because in relation to cause 27 the male site we need to go into public excluded before we make any decision as I recall yeah sorry 15 what was 15 ah sorry just in relation Chris just in relation to the area wide mitigation for was 15 we needed to move that the item be deferred until the July seventeenth council meeting which is what you decided this morning okay moved yannis seconded Jamie okay I'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed to carry
We've got I've have we got 13 oh yeah 13 a page 750 the report of the chairperson of the Environmental Committee go to the bus stop thank you look I'll just speak to that the committee's recommendations because they're important the the option ADA mini lounge in fact is select somewhat more expensive than the preview than the option to be but the committee felt that their gave the community that Ennis bishop that the bus riders community and the best option in terms of how in fact the warmest shelter the big shelter could wait lounge could be configured so option a leaves that opened for it the whole that the other recommendation as of course would come back to a joint meeting with the community board and the environmental committee the committee also felt that particularly because we want to get this shell waiting lounge up and running that we didn't want any undue delay especially towards the end of the year so we're ready asking counts as indulgence to allow the measure to be delegated the decision back to this oh well no I just I just have to ask because we've taken a lot of public flack we've been attacked quite strongly by the EK n over the lack of progress on some of these facilities but when I read the cost year this is a crown lead project so what I'm still struggling to understand is why are we doing this I mean I'm supportive of looking at what we can do to assist but I'm really confused over us putting up all this money through the cost year having an agreement that we are now doing stuff that the crown wanted to do and said that they were going to do and now now doing stuff that we thought we were going to do like performing arts precinct so can anyone just give me an understanding of a very high level like what is the deal with the cost share what does the deal with a bus interchange project because you know we got ten minutes notice of the design being released and and yet this one we're doing all clear understanding there's no easy answer council you're handsome what's this I think everybody wants a bus shelter it is a resident councils jurisdiction to actually provide infrastructure I don't want to have a big debate about why or why not we should do and I just want to see shelters war for people catching buses that's what they want I don't give a toss who does it but I just want done did that give you a clear understanding there's this budget implication so we've actually signed a cost year no worries there is chemic just be clear on the budget implications because there is money in the budget for this that is coming from three different sources I think right do I deliberate on it yeah right yes I'm from yes there is boo ass there at the Environment Committee welcome back Tyrion Richard I could confirm that they the funding for the Riccarton hub and the bus priority measures are included in the cost share agreement and a token amount how much tomorrow I think it's about bro and can you just help me understand no probably not given this is a Crowley project what their involvement is a feeling if the project is how old Nicosia has a number of elements it has the central bus interchange it has the pre-planned super Stop of Manchester Street a plan super Stop of the hospital corner super stomper Richter road and the Superstock have been doing plus the riccarton robust priority measures that's all within the the package of PT measures under the cosh air she is really clear that the crown is leading this yeah that we doing it so I'm just trying to understand how that's happened and I I do have another question around I can't we miss the priority for rekelen road being done as well ok you can ask that second because it's not actually part of this because there was a separate report on Rakatan road and we obviously haven't got to record and road and I can understand their imperative to get people out of the rain and actually crossing the road safely and so you are leading on the bus interchange of central city and they will also lead the development of the manchester hospital super stops but the council is leading the process around riccarton and papanui because we're closer to the community and Sue CD you are so therefore it's more appropriate that we actually wasn't that thing steep oh but just just to be clear on on that on our budget implications with the cost-sharing around the bus exchange which includes the new interchange the two Super Stocks and Manchester in hospital the rivet of northern suburb or when the changes and the Riccarton road bus priority our total funding for letters 29 million in total yeah that's degree and the rest is actually handled by crown and the nzta yes Jimmy you mentioned earlier regarding to the victim the pass a change in total 2 million dollars that's including a long tender kind of 18 angio just a moment it's kind of 2 million dollars needed over 18 ang in some other facilities at the moment the culture is in terms of providing facilities you does that include possibly if we don't spend it all on here decent bus stops down the length of written road well that will be included in the Riccarton Road corridor possible it's not good so we've left some money for that hip we we still got soft finally from possible okay excellent right any debate on this or we're all good with it seems to have been around for a long time cup of tea no let's vote on this first and then you can have a cup of tea Phil moves and its second it Timmy do you want to chit second it hard is that your ward Jimmy okay I'm fine with it okay let's just put it okay those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you that's now carried as was that a report as a whole yes was there anything else in it no no okay so that reports to hold meet up with those in favor say aye those opposed Kerry and ref has got an urgent issue of the four need there so 10 minutes yep okay bekheyr guys it
The area wide mitigation I think we have to wait for some and public excluded stuff before we go so we'll move on to item number 16 which is the proposed exchange of resumed reserve lend on broomfield common number 13 I will come to it mr. comedian yes otherwise I have to find it so there's 13 and the supplementary bit will come to it when we do the supplementary okay there's item 13 and the supplementary but we'll come to it when we come to that big pile of pink or white actually right okay so we're on moving on to item 16 in the main agenda the proposed exchange of reserve lived during field common which was the subject of one of the deputations this one terriers okay should we move on to item 7 more 17 while we wait for him except there's nothing in it quickly haven't normally moved this one meat and cheese security package there was number two okay it was for sitting okay so moved Yanni sorry just thought I'd try moved to Tim one that we've forgotten yeah it's from the chief executive report okay notice we clear that this is actually a council lead project rather than a CCD ulit project my understanding from the cost cost share and responsibilities is this is actually see rly and that's an interesting question and because I think but I think we'll get Mike tilan to answer it because he had to answer at the other night gotcha come down here and answer that question this is the accessible City who's actually running it well in practice it's a mixed end joint so it's the classic high dose that mixed grill we have a birthday of a bit miss year but so that's sorry that's the most critical and striking give so look because they are a series of integrated projects so we are doing that in cooperation but particularly on the matters that first phase matters that council resolved on the other week we are leading the consultation on those and so it's a slightly interesting and different form of public consultation yes because approved recovery plan document so and then has a legal status and we can't_''_186.049 be inconsistent with that but we also have certain obligations and powers that remain with the council under the local government act to consult so we are going to have to consult with our community in a way that allows them to meaningfully engage but fundamentally let the effect to the outcomes of the of the recovery plan so there are some difficulties with us yes yeah yep yani we've spent over half this meeting sitting here listening to concerns that people have that it actually related to the government decisions that the government are making I'm really clear that this was actually a crowned lead project phase one of our central city transport play I can't see where we would be doing this if all we're going to do is set up and have hearings and listen to people and then tell them sorry like the crooked want a glee park we can't do anything in response to what you're saying then why would we want to put goes to the core of having a good partnership with government let's be really clear about what we're doing and I I don't want to approve this going out until I'm clear over what it is we're actually people can consult on be consulted on and why we should be doing it when government are imposing this on their city okay it's a very good question do we have to do this or is the bit if we don't do this what happens does the government actually engage in any meaningful way I think that well that would be a decision of of ccd you about how they would do that I mean while while they while they could do that base we this is what it does get legally complex we still have the obligation under the local government if council was of a mind to say actually let ccdu lead that consultation then I think that the necessary action would be for the government to use section 27 of the Act to basically modify our responsibilities so that they don't act provisions and respect for these and they could as counsel your Hansen has suggested lead whatever consultation they liked on that process and the downside of that is that we get no sense of what people want in the central city for their area for the time when ccd you may not be with us well yes that's that's true but I mean see in ccd you all those changes one once made I mean that the city is unlikely to an or two and try and reverse those because the engineering of changing a one-way street system or something that is quite countries okay so so in a way Mike there is a choice about whether we do this or not and it's whether we choose to do some limited consultation with all the constraints that are on that or whether we choose to do nun which is and I think if we choose to do nun we need to send a signal back to ccd you to say that we aren't choosing to consultant perhaps I mean if that's the will of no but though I was going to say is if it is the intention of counsel that we could craft a resolution allows us to go back and talk to Cece you about them leading that process and around whatever statutory changes they need to make to make that happen okay as we've just got this as part of the acting chief executive report I'm I don't know if we've got a full report on the agenda I haven't been able to find one so actually what I want is actually a full report over who's doing what what the parameters are because they're proving just to go out to public and stakeholder engagement on a project without any detailed information about what it is we're if you have any conversation about doesn't sit well with me I know we've got okay let me just test it yani is there a time imperative on this there is a time imperative and that if we are going to I mean that the fundamental projects which are commissioned mission critical to the lincoln road in time so that the physical works are done before the cricket world cup starts to bite into that area the other ones are around two and freedom Manchester Street and respect for that timing with the bus exchange council had a full report and adopted they amended phase one projects last month and so what the consequence of that as we go out to consultation okay thanks Mike is there comment from others attempt I have to file from what I only say if we go out for consultation and the expectation from the public is that we are going to listen to and rate and raise and follow their concerns and a process that is being led by ccdu and that ultimately is driven by CC to you and the final decision is by cz cz d you your aren't we raising the community's expectations which we cannot fulfill I think you have to actually go back to the previous item it's no different to consulting on a bylaw in some respects we can consult on a by allure and seek the community't if the community come back and say let's let's take legal highs we simply do not want legal highs in our city we cannot reach that decision as council because that's repugnant to the law we're in the same situation here we can consult we can get people's views but if people say to us well we want to oppose this going one way the only answer we can legally or legitimately givers actually no you can't because of the recovery plan that will make this one way so there are always going to be boundaries and limits to our consultation but might with that example we were able to restrict the placement of outlets crews in this instance we may not even have bet but but the I suppose and that's that's around the focus of what consultation we do so it's around trying to understand the the needs of affected parties and landowners so that we can work into the detail of whatever is done to say well you know we can have this amount of parking here the intersection in this way because we can identify some need so consultation is important in terms of of having that dialogue with the community but I think as as the deputy mirror said we have to be very careful and clear about the limits and opportunities we have to influence the outcomes and as long as we frame that consultation correctly then I think we're fulfilling our duty 10 I've got a couple of comments about this Huggies my observations since the CER legislation was introduced this is my view is actually it's served to put us it at judicial risk and we've copped a big time on things such as the well I can think of a few examples where we haven't consulted as required under the LGA so that it's one point but the second when you agree though that actually if we take the gut public on board which you find it and we obtain some sort of leverage and we in and flips the outcomes and we see this I think over let me hear things like the stadium time don't you think that you know G it is important to have them starting to it's lost well so I just saw as Richard so when we when we adopted the full report on the phase one transport projects so we move to consult but this one was excluded because it was tied up with the Manchester Street this one through you madam gia this one was specifically excluded because at the time the council puts we put our original report up council was still considering legal action in relation to the majestic so obviously we didn't want to see council approval to go out to consult on widening Manchester Street also think council on the other hand were still considering pursuing legal options in terms of retaining the majestic building which has on Manchester Street so that's the reason why it was specifically excluded councillors since Scott legal advice it's my understanding that they are not going to pursue that option of challenging CCD use decision to demolish the the majestic building and now what we're trying to achieve through this is agenda so in that context manchester streets catching up with where council got to on the other phase one projects a month ago and and I think I mean I think from a staff point of view we agree with you we should be out there consulting but I think what we have to do is that we are working with two distinct pieces of legislation which don't automatically fit particularly well together and I think if we're going to be fair to our community going out we need to give them a reasonable opportunity to have a say whilst being clear about the limits to what thats thats a practically can deliver and I think that's the difficulty I can totally understand why people are sort of annoyed about this because when we mean public consultation we actually mean listening to what people say this one is going to be confined and how far it can go and it's kind of a consultation that's not as meaningful as you would wish it to be the difficulty is if you ask nobody you don't businesses on that corner who see the traffic flow there and who's noticed the patterns of traffic behavior in that Street for 20 years which is incredibly useful in any sort of planning document so I can totally understand people's annoyance about this my my inclination is always to go with consultation even if it's limited because you always learn things and I'm just so looking forward to the day when we can actually have control of the central city back again and not not pretend that we have any say in it as we are at the moment really I'm really open to us doing engagement with our community I welcome that and I would love to be able to do that but what we don't have in front of us as a report that sets out timeframes sets out the designs sets out the concept sets out the scope of what we can talk to them about and that's where I think we've gone wrong previously because we go up and we're not clear that the other bigger question we improve in concept proceeding to this and that when that report is really it comes back to the council prior to going to the public can we get a report that came I on what this consultation engagement will look like iron frames well let's at their lips because these guys have got a time limit as they always have whenever anything comes from next door let's let's actually approved the concept in general what yani would like to see is the more specific form of the consultation prior to going to the public I can imagine that's a problem no so we have a so the capital program guys are basically developing that process at the moment we have a report going to to the yannis community board I think in 10 days time it's a briefing to the head leafy community board so we can easily brief that that board at that stage about the process and the timeframes that we have are you guys okay with that just going to the community board or do you want to come into the kalica see we are we are stuck the time frame we seem to be stuck all together with us so well I'm actually not not happy what the proceeds of okay okay so we've got it open for debate yep yeah sorry I think were unique school just seeing some documentation from from historical meetings we're sort of we going out on that on the north end zone and the rigid and transport hubs which is actually syrah lead project and we're expected to pay for but us it's their project so this is almost in the same veinous it's quite bizarre I mean yeah nobody's debating that nobody's debating the situation is bizarre it's just what do we do about the specific runners on the table we need to know exactly what we're sure you get it we do need to know accessible what what were actually going to consult on okay okay that's fair I've got full term Jimmy was you I think we should just say no to this really like this is really what going on p it's cotton you know not called consultation to diesel by death or whatever but it just isn't working and if we click you know if we're not clear about the guy lines and what we're doing I just think let's step aside and let them do it like we've got enough to do without without this it would be nice to always better but it isn't that's so friendly councils already resolved to go out on consultation on these these matters this is the only one that's catching up I guess I should explain so we actually have a resolution to consult so sorry Phil I should have picked that up before you and launched into into that great speech but so at the moment we do have a resolution to consult for everything but this one particular project so we're adding this one to the mixer you can probably make it a unique decision out this one if you choose otherwise the issue may be more about saying either you want to you want to rescind and report to you again or it is about actually informing counselors and all the board specifically about the program of consultation that we wish to undertake ok Tim I think as you mentioned before it's going to be the key is the clarity of what we are going to consult on now we pass the resolution that we are going to consult but how we can sell a could see see do you lead the consultation and we kind of fit in with them and be very clear and specific about the areas that the council is able and only able to consult on who I do not want to be in a situation to raise people's hopes and expectations Tony to turn around so well that that they've been totally cheated with the regards and totally devalued with regards to the consultation because I think that as crucial as Phil said there is a lot of consultation going out there but where is it actually getting people I suppose I see that slightly problematical and that what we're doing is we're in a lead the consultation will be standing the wing saying well we're only talking to you about this little bit and we can't really implement see come to some sort of a particularly great message to give our community I think the reality will be that if the council shows any unwillingness to take hold of that responsibility I think CCD you would just take the whole thing over and my view will be they'll be doing this limited consultation as they can yeah I think that's a very fair assessment to me because they based on the staff I mentioned earlier council already approved you know to go to the consultation but right now we need to gather is kind of the consultation a document which including the kind of concept design a time frame or dto sa to this padishah draft you know can report to the either like a star missioner to take a firm a chemical and also amendment committee or together then to go ahead otherwise we already approved to have a consultation okay can I make a suggestion to move us o'clock tonight and that is that the council approved in principle proceeding to public and stakeholder engagement on this and that the specifics of that consultation go to the Hagley ferry meet community board and back to their committee of the whole when will you have that Mike practical sense they're hoping to begin actual consultation with them about two weeks okay so so is there a committee of the whole next week no no I mean was just sort of a hole at the moment but no okay no okay no no yes thank you no council until life in the 17th of next month so there is a higley think there's an angry fairy community board which and and we're quite happy to sameer we can ask capital program to make sure all councils are sooo excited with it consultation program ok can I suggest that as a perhaps a way forward that we could try a second but to the resolution I mean that just be says note that this project is part of the ccd you lead phase one of the accessible has what responsibilities well what that will be circulated in the specific information which it can be we've already had one briefing put off at the community ball because they didn't have enough information so but they're saying they can do that right for that we can get a list of the phase one projects who's leading it and what each organization is responsible is gonna take us but that's fine cook can I just also comment though that you know I don't know unfortunately it tends to rub differently at different times but sometimes leading and following and collaborating and working out what practically what who practically can lead better than who officially might lead bitter is actually part of the mix as well so we're happy to come back on that material absolutely okay was there happy to do that so I don't need to include it in the resolution happens because ya know we've got because what's been happening is we've got that at all undertaken to make it happen so let's see if we this or as well can I put it and just those in favor please say aye those opposed to clear it carried and do want your vote recorded yeah knee felt okay okay I declare it carried and that then we are back on to
Um Pat hey haven't_''_3.98 got any pathway all right the natural environment one occasion this one yep so that was oh I see I'm sorry is a sorry right I'm sorry yeah it's on the screen yeah okay moved council a johansson and see if ended can't slack off put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and part two done the natural environment recovery program put their recommendation on page 180 those in favor please I'm sorry moved by Councillor clearwater it's see candid by councillor Livingston those in favor please say aye those opposed carry to the report as a whole be adopted as probably set up I was closed carried
To the cow committee please sorry the chief executive an employment matters committee right yeah okay pate moved by phone seconded by yanni bet those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the reporters a whole be adopted those in favor please say aye those opposed carried it was moved and seconded by the same people the earthquake recovery committee of the whole
Last one is it says here and by by law here we are revoking the existing by law and replacing it with the heaven fire sacred bylaw 2014 and the principal points of this file or creating a separate section on fireworks providing for conditions that apply when lighting fireworks exempting more cooking devices that oppose the low fire risk for example cancer oven exempting fires for reasons of research training and for biases security purposes and lastly just amending the distance of a fire from buildings trees he does etcetera from five meters back to three meters so they're the main points of difference for this new bottle thank you sick dude councillor tuna any discussion not but you have to wait those in favor please say aye quickly those opposed carried the reporters are all be doctored those in favor please say aye those opposed carried
Then consents committee part a reports the first resolution which is rapidly coming to the screen is traffic and parking bylaw amendment 2014 moved by David East and seconded by Thomas Kendrick could just forget the talk to these please talk to it look the first first boil out by law is the traffic and parking by law it's an amendment of the existing by law and if I could just highlight the major points that are being altered on this bylaw the first one is really just making provision for alternative means of payment to be made for parking such as cell phones and things like that ultimately and the second point of significant difference to this bylaw is just around shared paths and zones mechanisms to create zones with respect to council roads and really clarifying the status of shared past so they are there are a few other little bits and pieces with the traffic and parking by law but that's substantive Lee the major changes so that with public notice that will come there was a hearing panel and then really we are just to bring it back for final approval that's fine so yeah it's can I just ask two questions that I've been asked about this and one is yolk bikes where do they fit and the second is those electric powered bicycles where do they fit input in terms of barking now in terms of the shared past few parts I can't quite answer them on stuff but you know I I can see 3.5 I'm just not sure whether an electrified bicycle which there are a number in the city or a YikeBike is defined as hair no very mobile people Oh al Jazeera fear to the end of the table so in terms of the current biol or a vehicle is defined his same definition is a vehicle and the lantree it's 48 and it's quite broad to the covers bicycles and contrivance has equipped with wheels tricks or revolving runners on which it moves or as moved so the shared paths at the moment they would you would think that they would come under a with a wheeled recreation device units electric capacity and also a bicycle what where does it fit I wasn't able to answer the question that's why this won't be the subject of the bile or this is this is a consequence of an interpretation of the but it's an interpretation of the existing bile or presumably so there's going to be a new clause that goes into the vial or that authorizes shared paths which is a new thing that's come into the land transport road user role in shared paths effort it sees at the moment this is following than the in transport road user all pedestrians cyclists riders of mobility devices riders of wheeled recreational devices now if you want we can broaden it out to wield recreational devices like skateboards and scooters they're not all used recreation centers are used for transport so it might pay to expand on on that recreational or it may be that mechanized is not intended to be included so I think we have to be explicit and I think that's the question being analyst yeah Moshe motorized bicycles you they intended to have access to these shared paths mmm well that's the first time I've considered that I have to be honest but if you want them to have access to the Sheep paths and we can broaden the new clause 14b to include those types of devices or becomes a part of the submissions process and when it comes back we amend that well they accept ratified a basis walking on today africa I would I would have thought that these were existing definitions from another bylaw are they not the spy laws is not being revoked and replaced as amending the existing by law so we would be unless we are altering the definitions and the existing by law watson there would would remain yeah well that was my point it must already refer to what the definitions are does it not it doesn't at the moment because the sheared pads are a new thing so what we've done is brought out we've looked at other councils it it causes about sheehan halves and also the land transport road user role in which is the new proposed I understand that I wasn't talking about the shield powers I was talking about what was the definitions of cyclists pedestrians writers and mobility devices and writers and we'll recreational devices oh it's so as writers of wheeled recreational devices are brand new definition excuse me may apparently mr. Adamson can help okay she'd zones it's a new concept come to New Zealand and Australia Ren you will find them yeah and I think basically they've got their definition of rules and traffic signs obviously this is I think help me here I even read the details in by law but the Bible was just allowing you if you feel are appropriate to actually set up some of those well then there are things like maximum 10 kilometer an hour speed limits and those but the issue you a few actually decide then you want another definition of it you're actually going to have a subset definition that may be the general public when they come here we'll think well I can do this in Auckland in so basically it's allowing you to set up shear zones if you wish to you but I would be suggesting it we would be best to keep with the definition that suit with Australia New Zealand being adopted under the living street for New Zealand where pedestrian cyclist and motorized traffic there so you share the same roads those special rules and speed limits apply but basically this is just empowering I think to set them up if they want them doesn't make sure I preciate that day it's not a question the YikeBike comes from christchurch right so there are a number of them on the road there are also a quite a number of people riding bikes which had the capacity to become any let the cloud but they are also pedal-powered and it's quite a number of those people around all they want to know is whether they fit under these definitions and where they fit given that perhaps the definitions haven't kept up with the inventiveness of people ok so at the moment our by law doesn't define the term a pedestrian is defined and we can put Paul own definitions of you from the road transport road user also there is a definition of pedestrians not really pedestrian that's a she it can imagine what if it is what would what would try to do is is did the did we refer to this mate I mean is this meter explicit and the bylaw that sees their ammo motorized cycle is allowed to be used and they shared zones no it's not explicit so unclear at the moment but is it appropriate that we go out to consultation just by putting it on by way of an amendment at a at a council meeting when we haven't had any sort of the pros and cons put to them because I presume that the Briggs and consents committees sort of signed off on the on the policy but hasn't turned its attention to this issue correct is it safe to go out to come on a document that hasn't really had any consideration given to this issue whether motorized cycles are included from my reading so a cycling rules that the shared zone set some rules for pedestrians and then everyone else has to give way and that foot cyclists and any other motorized vehicle whether it be a mobility scooter or anything like that in that second category so basically the pedestrian has absolute right away and everything else whether you be a cycle a scooter a anything else has actually got to give way look after that so it's yeah sorry on a road right very simple they go on the on this sort of thing but but there are some things now out slightly outside the scope of em GTA's definitions or rivers definitions and we need to address them because that there are a number of them interest you and they will ask because they already have look I just think that the issue hasn't been raised so we're raising it now the question is do we ask for that to be resolved in favor of the addition of motorized cycles or do we ask for just another bit of work to be done on it and think I would favor the letter yep okay so let's let's defer this decision and asked for a report back to the next council meeting all that yeah sorry excuse me I just going to say that and the proposal was with this amendment to save costs we were going to put that for consultation with the other bylaws as well so it would all go to give it in one packet and Baker will be consulted on together so I'm just not quite sure if we going adds consultations all these things will come out during that process all right Bob I agree with Ruth code I think that 3.6 encapsulates that quite well that council is determining here the priority for users on a sheared path so that's really what it's for isn't it parents yeah so so what what we don't know is actually existing law which is whether these these motorized vehicles are allowed to use footpaths under current law and that is something we don't know so no no footpaths because they won't they won't so that's what we're trying to do is create a shared I know that I think what I'm trying to say is that the answer to the question probably lies in the existing arrangements for off road transport that is not a cycle but a motorized cycle so so we can find the answer to that it doesn't stop us going out to consultation so just a question to start then does the definition we recreational devices is that broad enough to encompass chhan is whether it's motorized or not and whether it's allowed to use the footpath in the first place because if it's allowed to use the footpath in the first place then it will be allowed to use these shared zones once this bylaws through the Ministry of Transport have got a definition here and it says here power-assisted cycles power-assisted cycles but it with a electric auxiliary propulsion motor that have a combined maximum power output not exceeding 300 watts which I don't know how much letters and not motor vehicles and are treated as ordinary cycles thank skateboards opinion get skateboards with motors on them and you can get that is the answer to this that's actually the answer to the question that Vicki ass right of the very start to finish yes oh and I thank you keep that definition yes no I'm not proposing that we change a statutory definition so I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's scary that's your fault I blame you for that and drive the second hit second one is packs and receives body and by Lord's the parks and reserves so that's David moved and seconded by Thomas Kandra yep and this one essentially we are revoking the existing parks and reserves by law and replacing with parks and reserves by law 2014 some of the main changes to this one adding clause for where we are recognizing a police officer as an enforcement officer which apparently wasn't in the original reserve bottle is a clause on interference it with reserves where we're looking at damage destruction and damage to park assets're not going the Auckland way and charging for it but there are instances where ash's have been scattered and reserves on plants that intolerant to ashes so we'd want to tidy that went up and another another one probably might be of interest to counsel the back taking of fruit and nuts and a manner too likely to damage the tree so that's part of that one yeah we're also looking to answer to improve them the dialogue with relationship to behavior in reserves obstructing hearing with another person or persons use or enjoyment of reserves tightening up on vehicles with in terms of the access again with also in relation to sheeted paths illegal parking etc plus 14 just tidying up on sporting and other vents organized events fees and a new clause 18 just providing exemptions your exemptions from fees and charges to the parks and reserves act so they're the sort of main changes staff may want to add a couple more possible with or answer any questions but so yani yeah I just want to pick up on the the and egli part comes to mind but also parking on grass verges as well I don't know it may have been the other one but what are we actually doing to stop that behavior given the damage that it calls us are we in aving us to seek compensation from the people that are doing the damage I don't know that actually the vial or address is parking on the boom yeah no sorry that's probably the previous one but for this one in terms of where we like I went past hagley park the other day and it's like a whole mobile village sits up when they've got rugby games on the weekend coffee stalls and food carts and everything in the middle of winter driving all the higley park seems like you know and then all the parking around it seems kind of a little bit unfair that we pick up the maintenance costs and people can just park willy nilly so is there any consideration given to toronto madras set in a more proactive manner anna is not an not in this area set aside for parts for parking so it would be in breach of the bylaws I suspect it's also in breach of our traffic and parking value so we could and I'm pretty sure what's hagley park you know there there are areas where that it's of each of our cat compassion fine also we could enforce it in that way for example clothes in here that said if you park on a public park and you cause damage you're liable for making it right making it good there's that probably make relate more to close 14 for sporting and other events where we are allowing part of the park to be utilized for a particular event and then it becomes an issue with the fees and charges for that event and and associated parking what that event as well so that's that's probably where it where lies rather than explicitly making provision for such as we believe it acting on the reserve just like the follow-up from what yani say no the boom that that goes right along that Dean we're talking though causing potholes about this deep all around the is LA she caused a lot of traffic issues rolling onto the onto the boom and then getting off the boom so it is quite a problem which is not exceed on hagley park with us around the boom up hagley park I'm not sure whether that's actually part of the park or part of legal roads Jane are you able to get help can I make a suggestion that we we do come back and get the facts and figures around this I have a feeling that the parking on bear arms is a as a we've got a bylaw and it's a matter of policing it but we need to come back and confirm a model I'm not sure but we need to confirm your bogus bottle and I also understand there's a cross cancel parking team working so we need to tell you about that so maybe by way of a min a memo and then if it raises other things we can follow up and where we need damaging our parks and reserves that I can't see anything in the Bible that means there is under Clause 6 and interference with reserves a section there that deals with the destruction or damage of our back edges yeah I understand that so if you catch someone doing that what is the consequence I mean if its a 50 lore fine and I've done six thousand dollars with the damage it doesn't seem very fair so in the breaches of the vial or it just says the enforcement officer request them to stop immediately the bylaw itself has got quite a lot of detail I'm going to have to go so Tim I know that within the park if you're running an event is a heavily park or any other Park that the user you play it pays a bond and a dessert for the Parks and Recreation team or whoever gave them permission to use apart it's their responsibility to enforce the bond whether it's been damaged or not however whether that's been done or to what extent it's been I know that I'm alone Park Terrace etc it has been seriously enforced by our our parking units but around the rugby I mean it's been there and have been used for some time so I mean I'm not quite sure with regards to the rolleston oh sorry the UM the north south east side of it but it would be more of an enforcement issue rather than you're talking about someone actually getting on to a park and doing burnouts on a pack and a point of order please yeah I just want to how much of this discussions actually necessary because this is a more of a process matter to put these out for consultation will be coming back and working these through I think that I think that that's right I think that it's important that we get these bylaws out for consultation I think the point there so your hands and makes is one that could be a submission that's made toward if it's not already addressed in another by law yeah I think we're to get section well there is these penalties and park for parking offenses no I'm for that this one that we're talking about now the others and reserves well I mean so overlooked it but I can't see where there's any penalty but maybe if I mean we can make submissions but what I worry about is that someone will come in and say well you didn't go out for consultation with the penalty section so you can't have penalties and later and then you have to do a whole another process Peter Mitchell might be able to throw some light onto this for us council has a general Bible which covers all the bottles of capital make that Google Bible has a conceit can be improved come forth by the original school accountable to that point of view nothing part would be a criminal normal way typically it was good right are we all bored of that subject now okay okay can we put that one staff recommendation we've got a mover yep eastern standard those in favor please say aye those opposed carried is untidy and has the wrong dates for consultation it's different to all be over so need to be so in July to 15 august okay so 6.6 becomes 14 July to 15 august right okay nobody's screaming about that good okay it with that change will put that again those and penalties they are those clothes carried and now we move on to the every policy is the water related services which again is a revoke of an existing by law and replacing with water supply wastewater and stormwater viable or 2014 the current by law doesn't really clarify clearly define us and say the respect of obligations of counsel installers own Republic in relation to water supply and storm water systems and briefly the related change there with water supply it's addressing issues of waste and misuse contamination backflow damaged unauthorized connection and vulnerability to disruption or restriction this is where in the banks peninsula area with new rebuilds there is going to be a requirement to have retention tanks in those those areas with wastewater West water issues potential damage or misuse of are the need to provide counsel with the availability to control inflow of storm water into the public storm water system control discharge of contaminants into public storm water system looking at authorized discharges into the public storm water system and putting pollution downstream or exceeding the capacity of the system and lastly just potential damage or misuse of the physical infrastructure of the storm water system cool and two sentences dad what does it do that you can't current what does it mean that you can't do that you can do that and two sentences what's the effect of the bylaw well a principle one really I think it's just tidying up a lot of bits and pieces but the banks peninsula okay they have to watch what they do interesting or not okay folk thank you and thank you David for explaining it um I Beach of David some well issues really regarding information and up and hot off the press information if you like regarding for example storm water and wastewater that the flood taskforce have dealt with but I don't think cuz it is going out for consultation and so I'm I'm quite happy than fair any new information we could incorporate and enter this later yep cool Yanni very briefly very briefly um there's a real issue with controlling stormwater runoff from someone's properly into neighboring properties that the committee consider this issue and is there anything that we could add to this that requires individual property owners to it's not just about into the public system it's actually two neighboring properties I don't_''_1653.93 this draft bible does give a better control of discharge of store water not a in general from from a private from private property over other property and Pete just before you do yani Peter just wanted to add a sentence to that managing the public water supply system you asked the question about the reason that impacts on us is where we've got areas of land mass movement we've got water just streaming down from earthquake neglected properties that have been damaged they are just being lived on Keem okay just need an answer it off solutions to the problem okay but it's obviously not found in this bowl or not as well yeah I think there is one one sort of overarching statement in the bylaw that we need stronger by law provisions for stormwater to gain desired the desired level of control over storm water inflows so the whole package is looking at that sort of control of of inflows into our stormwater system okay I'm perhaps I could call the council's attention to the proposed laws 34k which says unless authorized by the council no person may allow stormwater originating from within or flowing into their land to discharge onto or into a neighboring property other than what would naturally occur from a pre develop different in a manner that is likely to cause nuisance or damage unless the discharge is authorized by resource consent from Environment Canterbury and excellent thinking we just seeing Peter into the corner to the moment okay yep you go excellent thank you very much for correcting us note that there is a recommendation that this may also become part of the district plan or after district plan goes through but I'm very supportive of the rainwater tanks I'd like to see them in all new builds actually I know there's a cost to the Builder but the benefits are huge so it's thinking God moved councillor East seconded councillor cutter third councillor johansson register um the requirement and begs from that sort of put in the teens there's something I thought we took out of the district plan requirements so I was just kind of are we doing something different in the Bible and what we're doing an industry with my and all I think strict Claire it's probably a wee bit outside of their societies yes okay okay you you well it's not really we're not debating the district plan so it's unfair to ask that question making a bylaw that's got we're going out for consultation of this to a plan my understanding was we removed the requirement to have a water collection tank we're now bringing in a bylaw I just want to make sure it's not district plan so it's aligned but if it's completely separate or different happy to leave it but I do think it's silly to go for a consultation one thing saying you have to have a tank the other thing no you don't can you just get your bills yeah can you just check that before it goes out and if it is in conflict let us know especially him okay thank you can I put it move signet yet moved and seconded I'll put those in favor please say aye those opposed carried yeah you another bowl or item yeah the next one is probably the most contentious one for the city is the cruising by law we're proposing to revoke the cruising by law 2010 and replace it with the cruising and prohibited times on roads by law 2014 the major points for this change by law more prohibitive times on roads it's going to move from the traffic and parking by allure into the new bylaws hopefully sending a consistent message out to road users secondly all restrictions regarding cruising will a5 p.m. thirdly including a provision allowing the consideration of the views and preferences of persons affected by this nuisance value to be considered in any resolution to prohibit cruising on on path of or all of any road that lastly we are proposing that will extend the period for repeated driving from 60 minutes 24 hours which means that they can't cruising seems to be going to backtrack within 4 s really you can't go up and down the same piece of road within four hours okay how do we cope with riccarton road well they can't do it what they do it once and they can't come back for another 4 s so once you get home you have to stay there for the next four hours do you well you can go and cruise somewhere else you can't you can't go back over the same piece they can't just keep going around and around them and an hour's time and stop and then go and do full of highly supported by the police highly supported by what if you I'll be I'll take it very seriously turn right I'm sure somebody went to speak on this no it's okay Jamie don't speak on it whitey for hours that almost seems lean too lenient singing what was happening no I'm saying where'd that come from like one you say 24 hours well once once what was happening apparently if we look at there was a problem so in nearly every day and they were doing a circuit be the Arab Fitzgerald they're coming back down just going round round round so the there was a vial or sin that they couldn't do that with what within an hour so they were going so far packing up for a while until they are ticked over and then doing it again and again and again so now every night they do their circuit they can't come back for 4s and the police the police are extremely supportive of this move they've obviously got a handle on on lots anything out there they know where it's happening and why it's restricted to one period no I get all that Dave I guess my question really was though how did they come up with the rationale for four hours and why wasn't it something like six hours or twelve hours beautifully because if you did this at six o'clock you could be back you know in the same night it could but you could only do it was right yani I I have really strong concerns about this I I cannot see how this could be reasonable under the Bill of Rights this is a serious infringement on people's liberties and I appreciate that there's a balance between the nuisances been caused but just think about people that work at McDonald's at night or we've been 24 hours chefs who might actually have different patterns of doing phones to be limited to be only to drive if you lived on one of these roads twice in four hours if you're going to work coming back from work going to visit a friend I just think that's that's far too draconian nothing's we've tested this through the Bill of Rights and I mean I'd be happy to support two hours I could look at that but four hours seems incredibly you know long period of time and I just cannot see I think of most counselor your Hansen if you even one hour you're potentially infringing on someone's potentially Phillip rights so I mean we're talking about here a of a convoy of our vehicles continually driving around the city so one car or two cars is never going to be picked up that a convoy is and that's the problem we've got areas of our city that are subjected on a nightly basis to a convoy of cars that just keep continually roaming around the city can we be clear would you like to explain to us just in terms of this being allowed on this check of road over for us is this relate to only convoys of cars or individual drivers or how does it work here's the definition for cruising is that must be driving repeatedly in the same direction vehicle in a manner that draws attention to the power or sound of the engine of the motor vehicle using being driven or creates a convoy that is formed otherwise then and trade or impedes the traffic flow so it isn't just a single car or people going backwards unless they're resourced has broken here some clarification from yannis question about the Human Rights Commission solar facts recommendation is the proposed Bible is not inconsistent with their project can week has an explanation on on that case and in the in our legal advice it says that the probability a prohibition on cruising does not prevent a person from driving on the particular Street involved in the prohibition only that they can't undertake cruising and similarly for the prohibit prohibition on driving at roads on certain times doesn't provide a person with a legitimate reason from driving on that road they're allowed to do so so if they're delivering something or if they have on their that's fine and then further legal advice says that the benefits to local residents the temporal and's by law is seeking to prevent combine to make the bylaw reasonable and subsequently not repugnant to the general laws of New Zealand or the Bill of Rights that's very helpful thank you and I presume that council owning the roads we have a right to determine how they're used yes okay thank you any other questions or debate no Paul it has been a major issue in the city for of some time I know the motel Natalia's down that believe the hotels and the he has been a major major problem for the city and it actually is really off-putting for visitors into the city so I'm actually reasonably supportive of this I think we do need to do something about it we need to send a clear message that we're not going to tolerate behavior that actually destroys the amenity for the wider public ok so it's moved cancel East seconded cancer lonsdale any through the debate if not I'll put it those in favor please say aye those opposed carried item five even fire safety bar
Thank You bike and soda p the meeting reopened and I want to go back to the resolution that we proposed off the back of the chief executives report and it is a narrow recommendation that we take the remaining twenty thousand dollars that set some the metropolitan discretionary response fund from the 2013 14 allocation and that enables us to be getting on with the job of looking out for the interests of those that may not qualify but we don't think that'll be anywhere might be one person it might be two people you know so it's it's really not going to be a lot but it just gets us through the period between the announcement yesterday and when when we know how many might be affected so I'm actually quite comfortable with their so I must say that when I first read it I thought that it was the 2013 14 year and I thought it was the balance of what was left we are now dealing with the balance of what is left for the financial year which ends on monday just like to put the resolution I'll put the resolute oh all ended you know no it's been sick and doesn't yep why this fund and not the other neural relief because there is a lot more work to be done in order to bring a report to council to get it approved and this plot said unto them is welfare fund which is very flexible in which will be enabled to quickly respond to applications not all of the allocations out of the other fund have yet been finalized so once that's finalized the balance of that fund will not be anywhere near what it is at the moment so alright I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know it's carried thanks very much Ricky
List of the par-tay resolutions as the facilities rebuild planned north beach community crash did you want to move that Jonnie um yeah absolutely moved this one um it's again pretty straightforward widget we defer it once to get some more information came back and it turned out we actually were entitled to more insurance if we get what we're properly entitled to and we've got a group that work that can make use of the site so I think it's a pretty good solution and um happy to support and david Easter's seconding up is there any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried second one is the facilities rebuild repair of their powers and Martin's toy library oh no it's not I just over locked the right need to make on these facilities rebuild once because we've got a number in here and I know I was really hoping we could do this is part of the annual plan where we set the budget in the three year to be done around us there's a number of requests in here for funding for these different facilities the only one that I really wanted us to consider today was around the demolition or replacement of the wolves umemura fallen soldiers pavilion I think so social we should we just get a resolution to tidy up all of the others so so so the motion would be that items 34 there am I was at five did I did I do the wrong one oh okay so items 1 3 4 be the subject of a separate prioritization report at a I justjust at a future council meeting you don't need at a future report yeah was part of yep at a future yep that's up so you'll move that Jonnie second of all I'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and which item is the item 5 and yanni you'd like to move that and n term scandrett would like to second up so I'll open that up for discussion um so we had this facility this is recognized as being a fairly unique memorial and that it's not just a sports pavilion that's been badly damaged but it's actually a utilitarian war memorial and that and it's believed to be one of the few if only ones in New Zealand so that's two World War one so there is a kind of time pressure on this and I think it's really important that we move forward on it today so that we can meet half the dates that we've got suggested in terms of three March 2015 we are expecting that staff will be applying for addition for for funding from other sources particularly relevant to war memorials and the like so it's important I think we also make this decision today to enable staff to be able to apply for that external funding that can go towards this project thank you it would be would be good to know about external funding options what's the timetable for applying for those all have we already made application yep the applications to the laundry practical're successful in this on November so clearly we want a decision today to enable us to get going and in parallel to this process will be an application to the lottery grants board for any and all funding required to complete this project we wanting we're wanting approval today to get on with certainty to enable the project team to push on and get this thing done and then rebuilt and restored in time for obviously the centenary next year is there any sort of suggestion about what we might qualify for in terms of those funding yeah 4.4 from the committee World War One commemorations the environment and heritage criteria yeah so we'll be working with some Lincoln another's upstairs and the funding areas put in a strong but dear so I'll currently no I mean not normally speaking this would fit with honor the prioritization exercise that we have agreed but the reason for treating this differently is that it has potential for external funding there will not be you know which will reduce the cost of the to the right path and terms of to give us Susan T to make sure we can demolish and reconstruct and rebuild in time for the end of march next year it's looking to a decision now to get us going on there he's put up you know I mean there we've been through a pretty you know sort of strip process on our budget and so I kind of I mean I don't want to make a subject to receiving funds but because you need to get on with that for the purposes that you've described but I want to have some reasonable comfort that we are going to receive funding from external sources I know that you can't give a cast-iron guarantee but I want I want to get an indication from you about what that is looking like right now I just can't like you so I just can't answer their question with any degree of confidence we are expecting a total sum insured of this of 95,000 from the insurer's as well so it's very expecting lots of money from our be the application for funding I don't know I don't just don't know right now what that number is going to be whether it's the total amount or whether it's just the part the memorial itself is the facade to what is essentially a utilitarian building yeah it may just be that it's the component part for the memorial the rafters and beams that comprise that and what how much is that in terms of the total put me on the spot I'd probably say it would be thirty percent of the total you worship just to give you some certainty we actually have applied we applied for a very similar thing in south than and got quite significant funding for upgrading them war memorials now I'm not sure exactly what the application involves and how much the put extra emphasis on World War one so I don't actually know this particular war memorial but basically there has been a reasonable acceptance of those funding applications from central government so again we can't guarantee we don't know how big oversubscribed that we we don't know until those applications close but to date applications I've been involved with other organizations have been very successful so I'm just looking back through the notes when was it originally built a very good Christian I don't think we've got that information to hand actually is it a whirl whirl one memorial or well were super more immoral war one utilitarian War Memorial it's believed to be one of the few if only utilitarian World War One memorials in New Zealand as it was not until world war two that memorials of this nature will commonly built and we've been talking to the Historic Places Trust in the RSA and regard to this proposal as well now probably on board yeah all right thank you and given your extensive experience David will be calling upon your ability to to put a good business case to the fund yeah Glenda G evolution it's just a minor one obviously I'm not a part of the committee bit discussed this just wondered over the timeframe thirtieth of mark enough time building do you think for contingency why's it place the project it is that's certainly I wouldn't be here otherwise I wouldn't believe we could make these timeframes that the intention is we need the approval to demolish we need to get going with demolition we endow certainty around funding we're asking for two hundred and five thousand dollars in terms of construction that's reasonably straightforward it's a it's a fairly simple building it's the memorial part on the front that really gives it a little bit of something special yep thank you I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's Carrie thank you very much think that and now we move on to item number seven the heritage conservation policy review is it no oh sorry item how are you sorry I apologize that the notes item number six sorry it's my fault I'm will it's adam number six sorry it was my fault I'm for apologizing come back yeah and since which time it mistake if we could go back to that item number six can you get it up on the screen sorry thank you so what yep that's it thank you there has been a change to this so it was I think what we need to do is ruin the the fund balance at 750,000 that's right dropping it from the 2.5 so if we could change 1.5 million to 750,000 or point point yep that's right by dropping the fund from 2.5 million and returning approximately 1 1.75 million yep that's it so who will move the X yani and I'll second ya li like it's the next you need to look at this run in conjunction with the next report as well and I mean it doesn't give me any satisfaction to reduce the amount of money going into our city's heritage but actually we need to develop a heritage strategy and the absence of anything really concrete from government around historic recovery program a heritage recovery program I think we need to now take leadership and just do it ourselves heritage buildings that we could look at such as rates relief perhaps as we've possibly suggested for high street tax free zones for businesses but again we need a strategic approach the purpose of this resolution is twofold one is it's to accept that at the current financial situation of counsel with a huge operating deficit that we had we will make a sacrifice but actually also to extend the purpose of this fund that had previously been under subscribed to actually go put it towards things that have practical and real users and saving heritage and so that's the second part so you need to read this in conjunction with the second report which is around developing a heritage strategy which I won't speak to you because I think it goes with that same the one amendment I do think we need to that second one though is a really clear time frame around developing it so we can have some certainty to the people in the Heritage community thank you excellent okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those the heritage conservation policy review which yeah it's a heritage conservation policy review yep and I Jana Johansson moved Phil Clearwater seconded oh sorry yeah so sorry it's my fault item number seven as the Signum because the yani said the next item on the agenda are no he's not so the next two hours item is important important is that thank you the chief executive date about what's called the rubble and that relates to the contamination that we now know as the and the site which I guess further highlights the fact that we need this to be whole all of the issues to be clarified yep and so what the I'm passionately me motors now would you like to move that move the recommendation oh well and actually add to add the word to reduce an urgent memo please yeah I'm can it okay but we just had a whole bunch of information in the seas update you said we did but there is more in terms of the whole picture but some of the original information was received by the out what can be put in the public arena so that's all that's holding things up that's so engine yep so that's moved by Phil Clearwater and seconded by yanni Johansson I'll put the recommendation all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and then the heritage conservation policy review moved by yanni Johansson seconded by pauline Kotter yani did you want to speak to that no but just moving a min man yeah I think it really should be clear that we're doing this this year so you know develop a heritage strategy yep for the 22 fell apart parotid strategy and the two thousand water but by that by the end of the calendar year 2014 is that right yeah I that probably why yeah well no we can aim for that yeah and we can get a record Packer that's not gonna but that's good yeah oh and I they need to develop a heritage strategy and to report back to council by the end of 2014 now that may mean progress or it the word need and we actually just asked council oh yeah council agreed agree to develop the greater to agree to develop a heritage strategy and to report back to council by the end of 2014 all right I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried so it's now 114 so I suggest well we'll be back here at 145 so it's half an hour break for lunch and I'll see you at 145 thank you
We've got another 10 minutes to a one o'clock so I'm going to propose that we go to one o'clock and move on to the report of the Housing Committee the tenth of June the first I parte item as the facilities revealed social housing program I'm assuming that counselor Livingstone will move in there to counsel a cotter will second that motion is there any discussion please over my in 11 Stan may quickly provider an update reward photo in there sorry Corey nothing all yours carry on it a great green on and that was good a couple of recommendations in relation to the photograph of the mayor at the opening there you will see that our total number of units in our stock is increased where you save 2649 we have to 675 the 12 additional Morris Carter and if I have my calculations right the balance is the owner occupier units coming back so that that's what those are construction has begun this week as well as we've seen in the chief executives report over their new units in proposal referred to in the public excluded part of the meeting which you will have seen as well we've repaired over 300 units my main concern as you'll see from the waiting list surrounds the those on the list mostly single and our closed units which mostly comprised the the one bedroom and the studios and we're having a going to have a comprehensive report coming back over how best to use our repair and rebuild budget over that obviously we're going to have as a committee I suspect a creative discussion between getting as many units open as possible and not throwing quote-unquote good money after bad so it's going to be a really good good creative discussion we want to use that bit money effectively the exciting part of the meeting for me particularly the whole meeting was exciting but the the committee was of one mind over this the rental register which you'll see in there they grabbed hold of it we asked staff to go away and report on this reported come back two months later the committee made up want this and so they're calling for a further report that they recognize that the social situation in Christchurch now is such that there is a kind of in it and anything goes with a lot of rentals in the city we want to see whether we can put some tools in place to exert some control over that if we can with the warrants of fitness there will be one way or another some kind of kind of repository or collector point for warrants of fitness so that may serve to give rise to a register anyway but this is something that the committee was really determined about so I just want you to know that in advance to additional recommendations coming up one is that we receive monthly written financial reports and poorly in his second one we did receive a comprehensive financial performance report it was in the supplementary report to the committee was supposed to end up in the supplementary for the council and it hasn't so we will get that to you so that you can see it can we can we wrap we could go back to the resolution that's there and amalgamate the because this was just on the part a report that you've really traversed the Part B report as well so if we could have the that that the that the report on the facilities rebuild social housing program status update and the report as a whole beerus be received and that britain financial reports be included on the agenda of every monthly housing committee meeting yeah the additional two recommendations and its staff request eager to assess council old cold social housing units that would benefit from their insulation program in the e currency I work together to expedite the process so we just put them all together into a single resolution I mean you might want to just make them a and B so that Russian financial reports in don't know whether rain Pauline would like to speak to do aborting did you want to speak to that I mean that's pretty straight forward back forward it's just that eka does free assessment and free installation of insulation and since Canterbury Energy for for what they can do like thermal drapes and I previously put a motion up for looking at heat pumps which would be as a cost to counsel for our social housing fund of about I think around 1300 to heat pump since they're doing that work anyway avika end and canterbury energy actual work together it seems to me sensible I'm wondering if we need that n staff and near as well but we disabled as those two I'm not sure okay so I'll put the whole resolution as a single resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried you about from the CEOs report it we see the DS are completed I'm wondering if council of staff of meeting in decisions around the 144 closed units how many of those are likely to be demolished or is it too soon to have that information too soon yeah so but there's perhaps a report that your committee could receive we take you to their whole community group they've had to handle not only the social during the the flooding work planning task force works I know they've been some big hours including on the weekends and evenings for them I've there's knowledge day all right so thank you for that well we'll start the community committee because we have another five minutes before one o'clock
The second item as the earthquake claims update as of the 30th of april 2014 the recommendation is that the report be received moved ref mangie seconded Andrew tuna any discussion yani Johansson just wanted to confirm that we've received the 26 million that covered costs tooth jun 2013 from sarah the crown that claim was launched into September 2013 I think we heard that the committee that we had progress on that so I just want to confirm that it's been put into our bank and it's enough phones Peter come to the table thank you and dying years thank you the answer is we expect to receive that money today right so you know this is kind of what we heard at the committee that was gonna come this is real it's really expected today we've raised the invoice you've told us they've got the money it's just processing I'm throw into the system you know we do expect it at the end of the day okay photo by cabinet and really seriously expected today ok so we've the last year but fits cold thank you thank you for following it up at ING yeah just to follow up obviously we get the interest for lovers while I'm reminded the social housing payment that 15 million that we got that yet yes beautiful all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie and now the be base limited draft statement of intent and again ref mentor you happy to move and seconded Council of tuna that the accounts will set the draft statement of intent for be based on I said Jana Johansson oh yeah I'm really unhappy about 3.4 where we basically been told at the stadium the base are not recovering its direct costs that are not making any profit and I just want to be reassured that they actually pay off the debts that they have I'm also really concerned about 3.42 and 3.43 where v base are asking us to negotiating with us an additional charge from council to pay for arrangements and regardless of those two events so you know that of stuff on our budget and now we've got the expectation that we're going to be spending more money on on these events through V base which really concerns me so I'd really like an understanding of in the statement of intent can we remove that expectation I'm going to be base are really clear we do not have more money to go towards these events we've put on enough money and they should actually be making it out of their operations can can someone help us at the end of the table 7.43 are where the base is seeking to recover its own staff costs for running those projects which is running on behalf of the council so it would be normal and where you engage someone to run something on your behalf to recover it and that's what they're seeking to do now the staff on the council side will have to meet it from their existing budgets on on 341 and the stadium trust I was directed yesterday to investigate in progress and discussions including their financial health and in that some quite nice profits you know I hope I think we need to make sure that V base are actually getting the cost back but also I hope that they are thinking that they do need to make some money to pay off the dead that we've taken on as accounts on the other are so they can actually be section 362 looks about fee basis repaying 29.5 million of its debt by the end of 1415 your end 42.2 by the end of 15 16 yeah I'm Ellie can I ask with regards to the operation of feed basin I guess it comes in to the statement intent of the organization of the whole day the organization generally operating as a commercial entity would I'm also consumed by looking at these causes but there appears to be exceptions being made or requested for the organization for the council to cover costs here whereas if it was a commercial operation that wouldn't be the case the base isn't isn't truly of commercial organization because it has also asked on behalf of the council it does do now that comes at a cost to the company and that's part of what's written in a statement of intent so while the fee based management doing their best to provide a commercial organization they're also obliged to meet the requirements of the parent which is also what they do now last year was six just clarify I am a director so of the fee base and our statement of 10 we we propose to give 300,000 back to the community and reducing costs to the community to use some of the facilities an actual fact we gave way 650 six thousand dollars last year so if the disk counselors of mind we'd be quite happy to reduce the level of discounts we give to the community groups back to the statement of intent which therefore would actually put us on a slightly be position that we currently iron because we continually get put under pressure to keep giving to the community groups which we try to maintain but we are put under a lot of pressure by the council to do that a bit I mean I see that there's a declaration of interest as a board member of V base here but I haven't noted your declaration of interest so if that was the declaration of interest could we'd record and the methods that we've just had a declaration of interest from councillor lonsdale who was attempting to be helpful and Tim Skindred as well I think that the point of this though as simply the minor changes to the non-financial operating targets for the 2014-15 year there's really the focus of this report is just accepting the draft statement of intent right so okay I'm just in three point four point to the world cup cricket there seems to be quite a lot of level of subsidy going on there and an ongoing subsidy beyond the world cup as well in terms of the operation of the facility in the park and I'm just wondering if we are totally confident that all of our costs for next year have been picked up in the budget that we are expecting to come up against respect to V base or wider than V place it's slightly wider than the V base because I see that V base is negotiating an additional charge with counsel I don't think you can use a statement of intent to ask a wider J of it earlier later no problem we will follow that up yeah it relates to UM my understanding is the Council of us have got an existing agreement to to deliver services for these events what V base are telling us through the statement of intent that they want to come back to Council and ask for more money because they can't deliver the SU says well there's last thing they can't do it with them the budget that we've already said so I don't want to I don't read it that way so perhaps could we have a vice on their know that that isn't the way it is it is that they base was asked to provide those services which they did they the original statement of intent did not look include any allowance for saying here that that is still to be done and we've built in a provisional amount of based on the general managers estimate of 200 for each so that is to enable V base to recover its own costs for providing services to these two things on behalf of the council now whether it's in to answer your question of her mud whether it's um council's budget is the problem of the council staff because they knew it was coming up and they will have to meet it if they haven't sorry I wouldn't talk to our sports and rec people this morning because I was concerned about this my understanding is and again if you read what's in here at present the nature of the agreement is such that V lace will not recover its full costs and providing the services that asking for additional charge with counsel to compensate it so I think we need to be very cautious epling that's in the statement of intent if they need to negotiate with our staff that's fine but I do money outside of what that first agreement was and that's something we would probably need to consider as a council what we wanted to go through that route but you know I I'm really concerned about us I'm concerned about channels of information so bringing an item to the table of council without a you know a proper reporting function based on advice that I'm reading in a different way so can can someone respond to that absolutely so councilman VV a star for meeting to discuss the issue of compensation for V pace over here and that's just the staff time and operating over hits so that may be why there's some confusion between full costs as opposed to staff time and overheads I think that might be one aspects and currently these discussions are still progressing were expected that any compensation provided to v base will come from current budgets entry arrangement with v base over these is there an existing agreement with v base around providing these services with counsel and if so what is that was the cost so I christia yep thank you why don't we just yesterday okay and so my expectation is that there's an agreement for those services but we're still tied down as it says here the issue of compensation to the extent at the issue of compensation and requires budget to be paid to V base that will be found from current budgets so I if it's happening already this is the statement of intent for the next financial year it does need to accurately reflect the arrangements of it also the statement intent actually technically has to say all the compensation that you're requesting from the local authority so the shareholder and this is a statement so they are seeking to request some funding from the local authority so from counsel in the so we're not going to as a council be asked to find additional money to put on two budgets this will be found with an existing budgets yes good I'm glad we've got that on the record okay so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed andrew tuna will move and second that the report as a whole be adopted I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried
And we'll move on to the report of the Finance Committee separate attachments are there and we'll move through the Part A recommendations the first is the performance performance report for the nine months to the 31st of March our 2014 and sorry the resolution is that we received the report and approve the budget changes do you want to remove that riff and sickened by Andrew tuna is there any is there any discussion on on any of those items we don't need I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's care
Seven as the council resolution trekker and I'll move that the report be received and the deputy mayor will sick and that is there any discussion Phil but there's a lot of Medicine arise from this and a lot there's a lot of fun and quests that council asked for in progress and maybe a way well I think I really suggest a way of pulling these reports together so that in fact like the number in progress is high that the council chip cheers the council committee to actually meet regarding this to what the staff yet to try and resolve what in fact doesn't need to be it can be given the token signed off and which ones really need to be pro wrestler yep no I've totally agree with that course of action I think that what we asked for and what we've got at two different things so what we asked for was a list of the projects that the staff were working on a lot of it was work that was generated by the previous council and so we going within the organization and then a mechanism for ensuring that people were reporting back and working on issues that we had raised ourselves as a new council so it was a combination we've ended up with a trekker but it's actually because of the way that it's presented a doesn't that isn't as effective as it could be so I would I would be very happy that the chairs met with staff to work through tuning listen to an effective mechanism for ensuring that we're very aware of what the staff are working on and that they are dead aligns with what we want to be happening in terms of policy and direction David yeah thank you I support Phil's comments but I'd also I think I made this comment before here we one that goes back to 2008 and summon two thousand eleven and twelve I really think that these should either be post off completely and started again or we just don't need stuff on it on it you look good having things unresolved back in 2008 on just need to deal with these ones that are more than two years old we are can live with things in two thousand and thirteen and fourteen but 12 11 and eight you're right they've gotta go off the system and be restarted or or or some other process but we shouldn't be shouldn't be receiving reports with outstanding matters that are now six years old which means that we need to have resolutions on the box saying that we no longer wish to receive that report or whatever so so I'm going to leave it in the hands of the chairs of the committee's to work with staff to get this into a format and to bring back the resolutions that then into the work programs for particular items that are still appear to be live right for I think I think you should report back to us by we are we up to now we're at the end of june so if you could report back by the middle of august yep all right that gives plenty of time for that all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carrier
Okay is it yes I just wanted to raise a measure in relation to an item and the chief executives report the mural flooding task force continuing to work on flood mitigation options the government announcement yesterday in relation to access to the accommodation supplement that not the accommodation supplement the temporary accommodation assistance yes port available through now for people who are flood-affected on the basis that they they have received a letter from eq c advising that they're on hold given that there will be and probably not many but some who who may not have received the letter from from eq c but will have been flood affected because of damage to the infrastructure or the creek having its capacity reduced so it's not an eq see related reason but it's still an earthquake related reason why they are out of their house and why it's still why it's flooding and so we want to make some provision for their ourselves in order to just pick up those individuals that may not qualify on that basis and the easiest way to do the stage 1145 thousand and fifty seven dollars from the 2014-15 metropolitan discretionary response fund to the miRs welfare charitable trust fund so it goes into the Me's welfare fund to be applied solely towards assistance for flood affected individuals and families with the fund being effective from today's date under the administration of the strategic initiatives manager would anyone like to move that Phil Clearwater seconded Tim scandrett ally I just asked a question about that better than the information that came out yesterday with regards to a leash for me to seeing it was related to repairs only because my understanding was it was essentially an extension of what the qualification is when people out there was it was people got a letter yeah from eq c because of their land so it's damaged tool and increase flood vulnerability some people will not get a letter on increased flood vulnerability for their land we don't think it'll be very many it might be one a business ability to apply for their assistance yeah based on that Lisa they based on the letter so other criteria as well but the letter proves that they are in that category of increased flood vulnerability to land right so what we're saying is is that we've got people who will be increased flood vulnerability but it will be caused not by the reduction and their level of their lane but because of the damage to the wider infrastructure including the creeks capacity to carry water so so what we're saying is is that for the few we don't think there'll be many they might only be one who doesn't get the letter from eq see this is just a backstop provision and it enables us to address them very very close because it's a different qualification as far as the criteria goes for the flooding to access that than it was for people who are out because it is quite yes but it but but to prove that it's earthquake-related damage it's a very simple way I mean I actually think the government's come up with a very neat solution that the increased vulnerability to flooding is that we think that there might be the odd one or two who may not have that and this solves that problem for them David now can you tell me what what's the level of the metropolitan discretionary response fund and if you are making these lessons will be helpful to know you know what what the funders when we're making an application and what's left after yeah morning the 2 14 15 metropolitan funders as it was stipulated out there that's the power some of the budget envelope 1415 so we're allocating the entire year's discretionary response fund for the Spurs that's correct and what was it allocated for in the first place it's for emergency situations where groups miss out on the council's deadlines for strengthening communities or small grants or new projects bring up in the course of a year which fall outside of our application dates well it concerns me then that we are actually before we've even started the financial year effectively wiped out their entire discretionary response fund I wonder if it wouldn't terms of getting grants to individuals but I wonderful easier just to transfer some of it over and and then as we see the use of it come back for more or have some available for anything else that could happen well as first my my question really would be what level of funding is required now or chem can the Emir's wealth your charitable trust funds handle any applications that are required as at this moment and do we actually in need to actually transfer any funds across so yeah I'm can we just defer this to later on in the agenda I mean I'm sorry it's I haven't_''_384.42 I haven't been sufficiently well briefed I thought we were going to do this through the through the fund that that is the earthquake earthquake fund but charitable trust fund is well for later you know that means charitable Welfare Fund is actually doing quite well because of the directors fees that are being put onto it from directors that serve on CC h 0 and CDC so Thank You counselors for a major staff might be able to apply to respond to davids Christian oh and in fact we might be to deal with it now is that what's more okay so we don't need to revisit it sorry we're talking about than me as welfare fund at the moment no I guess that's one part but the I guess the main might seem from David Easter's that has concerns about the amount of the fund and he'll and approximately how many people might be eligible for that but what I can't understand is why are we taking the whole of next year's you know the next year allocation 2014-15 if it was just what was left now 2013-14 then we would agree to it but why is it the whole of next year's grand if you're talking about 2013 2013 14 the RF was fully expended but there was a amount of twenty thousand dollars left for a previous group so that's the only money they're amazed in 2013-14 and the resolution was to for the full sum of 145 putting the small amount to cover for those situations which might arise as I'm indicated earlier today well I'm just going to have to accept responsibility to Versailles I haven't been sufficiently well briefed so I have to deal with it later I'm sorry thank you thank you we'll deal with it later we'll move on to it was there anything else in your were there any questions of the chief executive Yanni yeah I just wanted to say um thank you for the information in regards to asbestos management but I'm I'm still not clear given the quite serious revelations that have come out in the recent months that we actually are doing enough in the space and I'm really concerned about the health impact in the community impact so this really tells us what we were doing but clearly what we've been doing hasn't been working because we're finding that has become more and more concerned more cases of things being identified so can we get like a really clear understanding around how we could mitigate actually do different recognizing that what we've been doing today hasn't actually been sufficient and we can certainly do that I guess the issue is out in terms of what capacity that counseling the wrong and council heads as opposed to other agencies but we can look at how very public agency yeah great thank you I I've sort of put through a list of like ten things we could do differently and better around things like notifying areas like if you've got a big site being demolished the fact that nobody around gets notified that it's going to space dose that there's no clear reporting mechanisms for the community or public to raise concerns about pistols the fact that we don't seem to have a regular program of scheduled site visits or unscheduled visits in terms of checking on that the practices and so maybe that we just don't have enough staff it may be that he can doesn't have enough stuff but I really would like us to get something back that looked at being more proactive in the the asbestos other stencil occur and other phones when you read that consent that into to a head where they were breaching just about every single condition in it and it took months to to actually get any anything done so I appreciate the information but I do think there's a there's another question about what we do I think that that might be with while having a sort of a more full report to Council on on all of the issues who does what and how that is linked up because we do play an important regulatory role so did the other agencies and and I agree with you I think there were buildings that were taken down on the CBD that people had no notification that they were filled with asbestos and you know that there will be issues about that for a moment and I just flagged that in fact the Environmental Committee has discussed this issue and we've asked for a report and I understand from Mike chill and then fact the reporters coming this month Oh God so we'll do that will come to four counts but really what I'm what I'm asking I guess is that like I'm not satisfied with the current practice when this joint group was set out that was in response to recognizing that the current practices weren't working what we've seen since this group's been set up as actually this still isn't the most effective way of dealing with it I suspected some issue around resourcing but when it when the report comes back to the Environment Committee can I just ask that there's as consideration that what we do in a more proactive space rather than just relying on what we're currently doing yeah I just had two other questions in this report one was the portholes the mass movement reports being delayed again until peer reviews of those reports have those peer reviews being done or if not winners when are they scheduled to be finished can my tail and Pepsi we're waiting for the last of those dear reviews to come in so this was supposed to be done by the fit with two months behind that's I think we've already previously advised you on that counselor and that was that the peer reviews the international perogies have taken longer than we and ng and is anticipated so we've actually briefed your net rule so we are we are getting those and obviously as you know we are in working with the pound on that information wrong so when can we expect to report around what's happening with Liam s movement here is based on the peer reviews I think the the mayor has asked for us to present to a workshop on that so we'll be just arranging a briefing to two counselors on there but in the next few weeks and the next month three months that's dependent on particularly on your avail of me and counselors availability but where we are able to go to that as soon as we get a day yep okay and it's the final question for me was and again thank you for the avin of our information we still don't really have a schedule of so budgets and time frames but it is good to get the topics which is a staggering 1.4 million more or 1.3 million more than what we're currently doing we're being told that we've got a three percent increase in our budget coming in 1516 for objects for anchor projects taking this as an example we've got a major issue and given that the consents already been applied for I do wonder if we have any chance to modify the scope of this aven River precinct because you know having a huge increase like that 1.3 million per year is quite significant yes I can't come comment specifically on that I understand that Don Michelle from Sarah's committed including to the council without those includes and by the time frame can I can I ask that the consent that's been lodged do we have any information as to whether that will be publicly notified or not because again that's probably something that is consumed I can't we can get a memo back on that but I think given the consents being be able to give us really clear detailed capital expenditure in time frames thank you thank you alright well I'll move that the report Oh yep first one page on our 743 regarding to the a spaced holes that is also I just want to know what is the procedure for the City Council provider education in a device to the home owners especially day you know to dispose the loss a space toes because this kind of Dimitri sorry but could we deal with it in the report to the Environment Committee it would certainly be covered in the report which the Environmental Committee has with environmental committees receiving a report on the whole asbestos issue and if we could worsen if we could include education the role of the council in terms of educating people around safe few sore safe disposal or whatever then bits included with the environmental committee report okay okay yeah thank you see second producer in the last I member the a concealed report I ask one question regarding Tula almost a key encode project older p community the facilities whether the star instant when we're to the handle of the draft or detail the feasibility study when we're carry on the kind of concept design dto design in the construction otherwise everything which are you know to to review the just small portion we don't know whether this the project has ahead of schedule behind the schedule all a compliant with the schedule then the diner member a team see your farm is no problems I just don't know when we were gathered Easter information well that's a start in repose yeah it is the it is that it's not just the facilities rebuilds Jeju it's the dovetailing of our major rebuild facilities with the anchor projects that Sarah is leading on as well so it's a combination Jimmy has been very clear that it's not just about the anchor projects that are signed up for and the cost share and the blueprint that's the as the important facilities like the or Southwest hub to see what it's cool no no I mean just include it in it so that we they are putting along that line shape a master schedule yeah very good Paul lonsdale just just want to get an understanding for the operational costs as we've budgeted for the central library Metro sports and bus exchange the current budget that set them here how does it compare to the budgets we had previous private earthquakes on the library and the buzz exchange and the Metro sportsman if we put that into relation to the perhaps the qe2 park which will be point the closest to the Metro sport so if we get understanding what the difference is if there is a difference that'll it as she impact our budget will come back okay all right well I'll move that the report be received to have a seconder Jimmy chin I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no thank you survived your first sorry thank you now look I've I've arranged for the group that was going to brief us on the port hills issue to come in at one o'clock which would mean breaking now is that we haven't got very far on the agenda and we've got to deal with other issues I'm actually of the view that we shouldn't proceed to have the port hills briefing today I think we should leave it until the next meeting if people were are agreeable to that and then I'd like to take another few minutes just to see how far we can get on the agenda and maybe break for lunch about quarter to quarter to one or one o'clock alright so if you could cancel the the experts
I just wonder in terms of having received two deputations with two different positions I wonder whether it would be useful just to reflect a little briefly on the history of of how we got to heaven less and the district plan I mean as has been stated and in terms of the undertakings given and the expectation that has been created that they would be in this and the first phase of the DPR I can give you a brief historical outline and perhaps prevent will be able to comment more specifically on on some of them or lack of discussion I think as councillors who have been involved will know that the mail site is as one of well it's a site within a corridor which has been identified for some time following the pc one review to the urban development strategy and to the RPS for consideration for its long-term land use planning I think and speaking and sort of in the round the existing established rule five zone has been identified as being effectively a form of planning blight and not a sustainable zone durable corridor suede so in when the UDS was being when pc12 the UDS was being considered there was submissions concerning that and the council was given a direction to look at that whole corridor ins and look at what the land use planning options were is that that's the corridor that way rather than the corridor dama more lemon that's correct yes yes so the corridor running down rusty road the the male site and some of the land around the male site is further complicated by the fact that going at perpendicular to that there's an inn always corridor which relates in an approach path corridor to the east-west runway to the Airport and now if I move to the particular the mail site has been a point of contention for some considerable years because there have been aspirations that various landowners have held around the development of that site versus what either the rural 5 zone or the noise and height limitations for land under the approach path and activity limitations have historically been so it is a conflict site in that regard the council initiated plan change which went through a number of discussions and that promoted and I'm for mr. Christiansen may have outlined that or but it has gone for a number of guises but has looked largely at being a retail and business center when we begin the district plan review we looked at a number of private plan changes that were in train and basically as you would do in any normal circumstances go to those plan change proponents and say what we're about to commence the review of the city plan it would seem more efficient and more effective to all parties including the community to rep those private plan changes into the district plan review we had already in discussions with male over a number of years expressed our professional opposition to the extent of development they are proposing so when we went to them and Brigitte might want to comment in detail we said we we will look at this area we we believe that there is some merit in moving it from a rule five to a more active zoning that is reflective of highway 1 corridor going north-south and being under the flight path and and we will look at producing and appropriate a zoning to go into the review that zoning may not satisfy the male proponent and they were aware that if it went into the review under the council's name they would have to lodge submissions to that like any other party but our intention was to actually actively address giving a long term rezoning in place for that land we as you will as you will also know from the discussions around the DPR we've had a number of discussions with you regarding the other elements of the northwest review area program where we had previously identified three new business cells in there again the same principles apply and there have been various discussions about how much of that gets brought into that first phase or second phase review so that's the process we've been under the undertakings to to the mail proponents was not to deliver their rezoning it was not to agree to what they had proposed it was to carry forward into zoning that would meet the objectives of the corridor would be responsible to the particular situation of the site and to the airport so that's the approach that's been taken today and I'm happy of Brigitte wants to clarify any other matters if I could just add a few more comments just regarding consultation as mr. tellin has already said this site has been under planning sort of spotlight for some time it was first discussed with the community and citywide as part of PC one which was a change to the regional policy statement chapter six and then was put to submissions and further submissions as really the way that's correct previous quake and then as was already said it also when turned to the loop the land use recovery plan which was also put out for consultation however as there was a recovery plan there were no submissions and further submissions process but all that was was just a statement that the area was subject to this great I mean it was just a line on a Mac a lot of people said it green fields he said it was just a statement on a map but didn't there wasn't a whole chapter that says we're going to have green kurds develop right that's correct so that was under the Landry's recovery plan and it was clear that the actual zoning for that green field business would be done through a district plan and then there were a number of public meetings I have brought to you through the public ook ell and workshops process all the consultation that has been undertaken but specifically in this area of the city there are at least two public meetings which I myself attended and at those public meetings we discussed a number of elements and asked a number of questions and we discussed the male site and some detail at both of those meetings also there was the draft chapters there for people to look at in the maps that highlighted exactly what could happen should that go through it was also highlighted that the process was that this was pre notification engagement and all of those comments came back to given to you and showed to you but also these the specific issue was highlighted when Stevenson talk to you about the primary issues that came through regarding the industrial chapter so just adding a few more comments on how the owners of the site might consider why they were in thirst ranch and I'm strung here between being told by the government that discussion of the OIC is meant to be confidential however in the early days of the development of that process they were considering a moratorium on private plan changes and so there was a need to go to all of the plan change proponents that had planned changes in the system or that were coming up to go to them and ask you know do they want to go through the through the district plan review or not otherwise you know take chances it might have to be considered with later on that has since changed I understand there is to be no moratorium in the OIC however as we all know that is not yet signed off by Parliament so I can't say say at this moment I mean I'm I'm only aware of what I've been told but in previous versions of the OIC we were asked deliberately to go to each of the private plant range proponents so did we know did we know that well so in what respect where we advise that that individual applicants were going to be approached about a vision and an order and council that we didn't know about that was very early on in the piece right in the beginning of the year I believe so no I don't_''_574.11 I don't think we would have advised you on that but but I would irrespective that I would still I probably would advise you that the normal process when a reviews under way is to look at private plan changes in train or private plan changes that have been received and to go to those proponents and try and wrap them into a review that's common practice by most councils so we got the impression before though that this was something that that the council staff wanted well the process to avoid having different processes potentially operating under different pieces of legislation not want to say in terms of a particular outcome right so do I mean but I mean we're a rock and a hard place I've been working on the assumption that the private plan change can just be lodged and it can proceed if this one isn't sufficiently timely for the applicants it can be is my understanding and they would probably have to withdraw their current plan change possibly because they well I'm delving into the OIC here and I'm not sure no no but but maybe maybe without delving into that OIC let's talk let's talk they haven't have the applicants got a plan change lodge with you at the moment they do and is that is that where they want to be ultimately or does it now reflect a slightly negotiated outcome to go into the district plan or no well if these are pre-existing one in place then surely it doesn't it doesn't take anything to just activate it does it move to notify that plan change so it's still in them but again we it's in it it's in that state I so so you end in that scenario you would end up with a plan change which is it's different to what staff have recommended inside the review it would be proceeding we would have I suppose two exercises operating in parallel which is the which is obviously our preference is not to have too literal processes operating at once but we understood that that this particular wonderful if they weren't satisfied with the with the the change in the time they still had the ability to to put up their plan change which as you say as a different a different model different outcome then the one that has been worked through in the district lens well I find it quite unsatisfactory to be doing this and I just I'm just trying to think that without because in a way it shouldn't be dependent on the order and counsel to get to get to the right position I'm just yeah know from from from our perspective I mean we did we didn't yeah I know I need a little help here I mean it's just not I didn't know that this they'd been any change in that respect so I refine that can I just be very clear the the applicant can put through a private plan change at any time even though the district plan is up for review the law normally does allowed it to happen yes and is that still the case we can't_''_864.61 say that's the best actor so um I think we're going to have to go into pdx but I can't afford to hold up the meeting so we're going to have to deal with that when we deal with public excluded later this afternoon so I'm sorry but it's just not possible to consider the recommendation that we have in front of us without helmet detail Johnny it might be really useful um this is like two items on our agenda that really rely on government may be really useful to give frame for the IC becoming a sign and also public I feel really concerned that we're going into PS the discuss things relevant to a process at the community are asking for certainty clarity and transparency and we don't seem to be able to give them any of that and open which really concerns me so is there any I mean I haven't_''_924.61 been involved the IC but does anyone can anyone give a timeframe and can anyone enable the community to understand when these processes will be done because the other thing here that seems to be the issue is what is the timing around stage 2 if we did say sure are we doing in the next two months three months is it going to be the next year if it's only two months we actually might save ourselves up at a time well you've just asked the whole state of questions that we're going to deal with them MPX so I'm just going to think all it think the the two groups having made for submissions I do apologize to and we have to make that on the best information that's available and we can't put that information into the public arena so I do apologize but that's the waiters and we'll have to move on to item item number five which is the
Alright good morning everyone I will declare the meeting open and first of all will I just remind everyone that that the meeting is being live-streamed so if people could speak clearly that would be extremely useful we are yeah I just I just wanted to just confirm the the timetable for today so we're going to proceed through through the initial part of the meeting until eleven-thirty and then we'll a june at eleven-thirty and then come back at two o'clock where we will debate the annual plan so this morning is really set aside for us to get a head around all of the particular issues that we will be addressing and then we will deal with the with the debate this afternoon are there any apologies yeah but yeah I don't_''_73.979 I don't think he has an apology I think he I think he's just maybe out of the room for a minute so there appear to be none of their any declarations of interest that people want to raise I haven't heard of any know and of course we consultative hearings process and therefore no deputations are promoted at the meeting so we now move on to the annual plan
Patient of a petitions of which we have none and we've already resolved to bring the supplementary reports and into the agenda so now we move to the acting chief executive sorry it's not the acting chief executive report anymore as the first chief executive report thank you I'll handle I'll hand over to Colleen earbuds and thank you I just want to again thank everybody for the supporter welcome that I've had and across the organization as well as our strategic partners as minister spending time with over the last eight days certainly seeing some very Hardy skilled and passionate stars and really enthusiastic about the opportunities to look forward and importance of improving the things that they do you're also very busy you'll see for instance some over a thousand consents in May first time and call center having something like 50,000 37,000 calls during the month of may as well and both of those areas in particular looking at ways to achieve the targets and improve their responsiveness around the work that they do number of other issues in my 4.4 around Southern a row and the recommendation that we extend the time before we start the consultation getting some further information that may change the options that would want to discuss with the residence so I'll move that the council put the Summoner Road consultation on hold for up to two months to have a seconder for that um scandrett it's not a consultation it's a information it's an information concentrate yeah it's at the lower end of the ia PPE spectrum yeah this is this is really critical to a whole bunch of other things I've just cheered the master plan hearings through the main road road through in through that area so there's a whole bunch of different consequences that flow out of this in terms of two months that the issue is that skirt are doing work now along this road corridor yeah you know I mean the thing is is that and I mean I can speak to this because I'm aware of the background to it the horizontal infrastructure governance group has undertaken with it with they're calling a loss food optimal optimization process which is about getting the value for the money out of the remainder of the amount identified and the co share agreement for the horizontal infrastructure sprint that's required us as a council to put our non scoot projects and to the mix and that means that we have to do a little bit more work on the Summoner road proposal so I'm happy to change the word consultation put the Summoner road public public information process our house if it's just a reconsideration of the decision then shouldn't we just say that because that's what it seems to indicate in the report so we're actually not putting it on hold at all we're actually reconsidering the options for it it is that correct I think that what's what's going on is that is the question of where this would sit in terms of the priority and end the decision-making around it so when we're not reviewing that but the whole decision making around it the only point I was trying different outcome we're not actually just putting it on hold we're reconsidering the priorities of timing and I think there should be some again okay well why don't we just put that the council put the Summoner Road project on hold for up to two months for the purposes of a reconsideration so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you
So address item 27 memorial ever new investment number to the site thank you welcome the Evan it community group acknowledges with deep gratitude the opportunity given to us to present our education this morning or thanks to mayor and all the counselors were giving us this opportunity we are in neutral non-political residence organization our prime object is to secure the best interest for cabinet and the surrounding areas we represent over 7400 households from this area we are concerned about the recommendation in item 27 of the supplementary agenda for today's meeting to reverse the resolution on 5th jun 2014 to defer the decision on the male side to phase two of the DPR we are here to place before the council why the resolution to defer the decision on the male side to phase 2 should be confirmed first of all the inclusion of the mill site in the Lu RP as a priority greenfield business zone was done without any consultation with the community in section 32 of the industrial chapter at page 7 it is stated and I quote that during the pre notification meetings have been held two sessions with stakeholders industry landowners investors and other interested parties were held on 22nd and 29th august 2013 to seek community views on the proposed industrial chapter coatings the even hit community group would like to point out here that this information is entirely inaccurate in relation to the mill site the landowners right next door to the male side the hotel copthorne commodore were not even informed of the proposed industrial park until the public information evening on 18th march 2014 further we the Evan it community group was never informed or canceled did about the male side proposal this was despite the fact that our concerned about industry and business in Evin head was well known to the officials in the strategy and planning unit here we were never informed that the site was being negotiated for inclusion under the lock and the dpr further at the public information evening on 18th march 2014 the officials inform the community that the only possible used for the male site was industry because of the love the officials categorically replied to repeated questions from the since learnt that the male site is being contemplated for a 200-room hotel which is a non industrial use that is allowed under what is known as policy for this is on the page 75 of your section 32 of the DTR it shows that the community was deliberately misled on the contemplated and possible uses of this land moreover a hotel in this site contradicts the council's main objective of bringing back business and hotels to the city center due to the overwhelming public opposition to the male side proposal we believe that the decision to defer it to phase 2 is entirely appropriate we have been told by Sara that the council is empowered to decide how the larp is implemented through the DPR it is within the council's discretion to put the male site in phase 2 the council shouldn't have to owe a duty of care to a small group of interested landowners when the entire community is against this decision further it can be it cannot be argued that the site owners had some legitimate expectation that the land will be resolved when it was well known to every party involved that there was so much of public opposition to the proposal and a lot of legal uncertainty about how the LARP and DPR would interact as well as the time frame over which the decision would be taken moreover any claim that the owners had a right to the rezoning being carried out under Phase one shows blatent contempt for the council's about stance that it would undergo a process of public consultations submissions and hearings prior to any notification the supplementary agenda recommends that the male side be brought back to phase one on the grounds that the owners of the male side reached an understanding with council officials that including the site in the DPR would result in a quicker decision-making process than a private plan change proposal we consider this to be strongly objectionable it was known to planning officials that the male site was a controversial site with the community in view of earlier court cases it was clear that the male site would need to go through extensive public consultation for the officials to try in the lab and the DPR shows a deliberate intention to disregard public opinion here this goes against the council's about policy of openness with the public and is a travesty of fair procedure and democracy if anyone is responsible for reaching the situation it is not the council but the individual officials for working against the established principles of natural justice the council is responsible for the wider community not just any private landowner if the owners decide to take the Mel site out of the DPR and restart a private plan change process it does not place any obligation on the council to facilitate the zone change by keeping the male side on phase one according to item 27 itself a private plan change is a longer process it still requires a zone zone change and resource consent under the ordinary non truncated procedure it will still be the council's ultimate decision whether or not to grab the private plan change in view of the impact on the locality the possibility that the mel site owners may restart the private plan change is no reason for of the DPR the community deserves the fair treatment from this council and we are confident that the majority of the counselors the mayor and the deputy mayor all of you have the highest respect for the community's opinion deferring the male side to phase two is an example of your respect since it will give you a better opportunity to fully comprehend the whole issue I am confident that all of you around the table will understand the anguish of the local community at the proposed plan changes the proposal benefit no one except for a handful of landowners who want to reap an immediate benefit at the cost of the whole community and sustainable environment I should reiterate here that we the community are not against any sustainable development we are against bringing industries and business in residential areas Rusli business park is one of the worst example of the misconceived planning in the earlier regime we can't allow the same to be repeated in the mail site again the average community group is comm unit committed to supporting this council is bringing a sensible approach to be through a meaningful dialogue between the community and the counselors who are our democratically elected representatives we are the council's partner in the mission to build a better Christchurch thank you okay there any questions right thanks for your submission in terms of them not being against any kind of development what would you see as a compromise solution perhaps or what would you see as development for this site be acceptable to the local it could be anything except industry and business it could be anything which will not disturb a residential community around the area which will not have traffic cows infrastructural cows and this assurance was given to the code in 2005 and 2007 by the same planning and strategy unit we have got the judgment that due to the admin adequacy of infrastructural situation there like the sewer line stormwater drainage and so many things the earlier case mail site owners lost and council said that it will take another ten years to develop code said okay after ten years once it is developed then you come back without developing the infrastructure once thing has been changed for business and the load what will come on us for the exit and in race for those areas is going to create a have a problem for us Jamie thank you very much roofie so um why obviously this council is the utmost respect for its residents and that this is part of the process and how would how would progressing this through stage one not be showing the utmost respect to to our residents and what is the benefit the tangible residential benefit to pushing this to stage two yes opposed to the recommendation which is the difference between stage one being considered in stage two as being contemplated in the last meeting that we hope that there will be adequate opportunity for the local community to have their opinion right from the beginning and even from conceiving the plan what they contemplate to do there we are being told once that there will be an office complex some time being said in the paper that it will be a 200 it can be proposed for a 200-bed hotel tomorrow we may find that should come in consultation with the community not against development we know it's an iconic site we are very very mindful about the whole issue we do not want to make the landowners a loser we want to work with them but it should be in the interest of the community it shouldn't be just in the interest of petty landowners that's all so it's about a more robust and comprehensive process exactly a comprehensive process and which should which should respect the community's viewpoint that they should know that what community expect from them and how the council I mean that the way they were they want to contemplate their planning then the council can be a party to make a meaningful dialogue and prepare a plan change right thank you very much for your time and effort on coming on today thank you very much I'm just I know that previously I felt that it would be appropriate to move straight on to this item on the agenda but I'm now worried about the time that we're under time pressure submission this afternoon on behalf of the council to a select committee that's in town so I'm just I'm trying to get a steer from councillors do you want to deal with this matter right now or yep deal with it now alright so could we have staff at the table to deal with item 27
More 11 new investments limited sight even here our physical head sorry we wouldn't have to do that if we were dealing with it there sorry so Phil will move and some will second that that supplementary reports be included in the meeting I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and we'll move on to them a more 11 you and distance the night of the site
Okay that's fine thank you thank you very much could I invite mark Christensen to come forward regarding the item on the agenda item 27 memorial ever new investment limited sight mail and I've accepted your late request because we do have a dictation from the even here community group and since that you've come all the way and I think that it's only fair that we hear from you guys hadn't realized it was deputations in relation to this item so it was the reason for the late I hope to my left mr. Andrew Mason from Laurel Avenue investments limited we haven't prepared anything but simply that the issue this goes back for quite a number of years the issue of the appropriate zoning for the site at the end of memorial avenue Rusli road and in 2007 and application for a private plan change to rezone that land from the current rural to a business's own was lodged and it was a subject of a long discussion in various further requests with further information from the council a long time landris recovery plan has then since come along which puts this land along with some others inside the land use recovery plan is a priority business Greenfields area so while we had been progressing the plane change we had discussed earlier and january of this year with council officers that a more efficient way of dealing with the appropriate zoning of the site would be to fold it into the district plan review and so over the last six months we've been working with council officers and really get to a place where the zoning of some sort of business zoning is required by the lenders recovery plan is able to go out for public notifications out of your district plan review and so we got to that point and we had agreed with council officers that that was a more efficient way of dealing with it rather than as by a separate plan change shows account request Oh was it canceled request mr. MouseMan lines for years so here we've been probably I was following them between their mail his has changed its position and spent a with council offices overlays to below the ultimate zoning or the outcome of what that land should be zoned for and what sort of business there is a difference of opinion between male and council officers of the stage mouths view that it has to be it's an iconic site it's a part of the Gateway to Christchurch it needs to be hugely high amenity it needs to have a range of business options but at the same time it has to be very careful and it's crucial that those business activities that might go on the site should not interfere in any way with CBD recovery or with any of the key activity centres and so the the ultimate outcome is will be the subject of the normal resource management process truncated as it will be no doubt through an order and counsel as to the process but that is the so we're seeking simply to get into the district plan and to have a chance at having our say along with all of the residents and others who will also be able to make ready to go and seeking is to get into the process as we had it had effectively worked on reliance on where the council officers had had directed us to have our chance at having a say along with everyone else thank you I'm you have the capacity to reinitiate your private plan change if they're well I'm not sure that at the end of the day we will currently today we might the order in council I suspect will stop that because the order in council will will likely say and this is from discussions I've had only informally with lawyers at within Syria that there are there will they will say though certain cut-offs at private plane change or plan changes already in train will be able to continue those which have not got to a certain point and I don't know what that is but I suspect it'll be notification may not be able to proceed so we may we may call it between two stores we're not at that point because council stopped us we haven't got the notified and underway it might be possible but I suspect that we may well if you if you cook us to touch here we may fall between two stores is anyone else got any questions I yarny Jamie Phil so um when was your agreement with council staff and did they advise you any time that obviously it would be up to the elected members to make decisions around timing for things like district plan review and priority chapters we've always known of course at the end of the day elected members sign off on and on what what you're going to do so that the arrangement was around the end of January we first were told and that we the twentieth of January and then we worked I suppose over a week or so looking at various options and agreeing that rather than proceed with the plan change we would fold into the district plans that would have been only februari and since then we've been working with council officers on the form that should take ya know jet Jamie yes I'm just interested to to really keep the out line between being a part of district plan review phase one this is phase two stage two we've spent considerable money which just goes to the four winds you know six hundred thousand dollars of effort councils hiest which is out of date cadool again we could have lodged our pain change in febri with what we had but we elected to go forward with council because that's what was asked of us and I was very hesitant about it because I was mistrusting of it and after considerable soul search and we decided that we would based on representations given to us so here we are in late June the representations around timing haven't been met and I get that you know everyone's busy but the timing suggestions that were given to us when we initially agreed to it that we moved we moved we moved in good faith with treated with the council on this process and with compile a lot of the reports for council at our own cost in order to speed up the process they are the process of reactivating and so entirely kick the touch though just know so if we're not on phase one of the district plan review just as Mark said we may be and most likely because that's the way things work there'll be some moratorium around paint changes that we we can't participate and because we haven't gone to the notification process we we could have done had we not treated with counsel it'd be a request so we'll miss out on that so we need to wait for face to all the reports all the work that we've done there's wasted I mean you basically you've got a site that zoned for pig farming on the most iconic site in christchurch of it what do you want to do just keep it like that forever if it really is that what is that what you want you know you leave the airport and you drive through the Year port special-purpose your fault zone has six meter setbacks from memorial air in 20 meter high height restrictions so you can can have buildings within 6 meters the road 20 meters high then you've got this bridge the arches of what you're going to be 29 meters high the the top of the rails are about 12 meters the road and then you go through and then what you want a little farm and then you get some houses is that what you want and you know to see if it's set a sign for pig farming your we can but we don't have to pay if I concede is that is it sort of first thing that you want to show the tourists you know we've got a fifty thousand people a day drive across that bridge you know it's Christchurch we're just putting a handbrake on it then the government looked at it through the the land use recovery plans this of all the places that we should start trying to encourage some business that would have to be one of them well actually I think that that isn't an accurate reflection of why it ended up and the lube it which was developed before we had a major earthquake so Phil and then ref and you've referred to a previously being zoned rural can I just ask you those currently zoned rural apparently yes okay so be taking the importance of the West melt and echo fire and account and how shallow that the surface gravels are in there and the need to protect that equi fire can you tell me in terms of your plans what sort of mitigation measures you have haven't they have included the proposal for the zoning will require the the same controls that the Environment Court has approved on the airport yeah I'm going to rule that out of order because it's not the issue that we're being asked to make today we're being asked whether at stage 1 or stage 2 so it's not relevant to the issue that we're dealing with a couple of questions obviously if you knew that elected member we're going to have the final say how come we didn't know about this I don't know though the we wanted to have more time to consider what the best use of that site was and then the best way to zone it and we weren't confident that we had enough information so we put it into Phase two there's other areas around there which also need consideration at the same time so it made logical sense for us to do that now I don't see that all the work that you've done should be compromised by that fact and that actually it gives us more time to sit down and say well actually what does everybody want out of the site you know is there a compromise what is the best way to actually do it but without our input with you know we're making decision of blind well I don't know what sort of information you've been able to to get over the line six months or so so forth from I mean the district plan review was I mean he does the work we had was televised and it was pretty clear from that that counters have no idea amount of work we've done with the council offices there's huge the amount of meetings with head is huge unfortunate hasn't_''_719.91 got a they're not our job to do that though now I do some of the we had understood and we had seen on the videos that references to this were included within the workshops and so we were surprised that the counselors weren't aware to the extent that we thought that you were so we're surprised about there but but but in reality what difference is it going to make I mean okay so whatever another six months but within that six months we might be able to actually get to a better outcome well I think that yes two things one is that we're ready to go now secondly the process is for getting the outcome you don't have to decide on the final in best solution for it to be notified otherwise you there's no need for a process so we think we're at a place where it's able to be out go to go review and and we may well be able to come up with some sort of compromise or some sort of different mix of uses that will be the best thing through that process not just through a hearing process I think there's much better ways of doing that and in advance well we want to be actively working with people who are interested but we think we're ready to get underway now all the inputs required such the question and all the other suite of reports that you need for for this type of land-use change they've all been done by the council for us that they all exist but that it's finished we ready I mean I did council it hasn't suggested that they need anything more I mean if around this table you're suggesting I'm not but I'm not sure that the trainers could imagined that there's anything more required because we've done it all except there I mean it's your issue around the iconic nature of the site where it's located but thank you very call on professor bug she on behalf of the raven-haired community group
I just I think it's important to note that the section 124 notes as pertains to the dwelling and me as a geologist I get quite nervous because I understand that you spend most your time and your dwelling but there's a fact in a case in after earthquakes where somebody had a rock protection structure and he was altered and suffered the consequences the fatality so I just like to emphasize the fact that if you go even if we go for a rock wall protection structure it's designed around the building act and it protects the dwelling it doesn't protect the whole property and the risk around that so it's not the cure all that give we things that maybe I understand that but I guess you know part of the frustration for local residents as a fact you've got the government and counts or having different assessments and actually the whole complication around you know now you've got just a plane coming and see you know people just just get totally confused about you know what processes are being used 20-foot a whole bunch of people so slowly that there's wider analysis done but in his site specific analysis it has to be known in certain cases so it's hard for people to understand because it feels like things just keep evolving and changing in terms of the risk if the landowner is prepared to bear that risk why don't we just let them do that because legally we can't if I legally we can get them to sign some no legally we can't and I mean perhaps I know which solicitors in the room but it's clear that counsel cannot contract itself out of its legal liabilities so we have liabilities and again I can understand that but is there a way around that in terms of the landowner coming with a legal representation of their own well we I think we would advise you know there's not end and we you may have one landowner telling you you that property may be sold and does the next letter under understand and hold that and ultimately has it been proven in case of the responsibility of the council has under the legislation to protect people it's very very clear yes I guess duty of care is always a it's never a fixed point so I suppose the question becomes who is prepared to actually sign that risk over to a third party it would not I would respectfully say not be start acting and the delegation oh let's give an example here so if we look at proposed earthquake environment where people were not allowed back into their buildings in the city yet lots of people went back in and got their stuff out we had the case in San Francisco where they dealt but with that by having a waiver that residents could sign to go back into their building but they waived their rights under the duty of care from the local authorities so could we not develop something like that for individual landowners who are prepared to do mitigation but are prepared to where the consequences and of course if they ever sold their property that would be quite clearly indicated on limb and other information the postman I work with the fire services and that the police so in an event of an emergency they are going on somebody's advice so in these areas we will hopefully be putting them into high-risk situation that they will not initially have an agreement with so there's all sorts of knock-on effects visitors etc that unless you formally gave them a risk assessment you know every time they will become unwittingly in that that hazard me the life risk is calculated one in ten thousand if I'm driving down Martians Rose I'm actually a greater risk on that road and many other roads in the city because it's been identified as the fifth riskiest I think like this yeah it's an interesting because the it seems the Kiwi appetite for risk is is a factor of ten more than other place in the world anywhere else most hong kong europe etc after the risk is deemed hi one in a hundred thousand that's deemed intolerable get into my spine so that we we like 10 times more risk what we're with regards to get people going into buildings following the earthquake we read into two buildings falling the earthquake equipment here was done under with permission from emergency service done under their supervision and with a time frame so we they were very very strict and clear and also the roads we could use to get in and out so it's yeah but there were there were a heck of a lot of people who were denied access for weeks and and so they took it into their own hands but in San Francisco there was a very good lesson that they learn from there is that you simply get them to a sign and it's only an individual themselves so it's not the other people that would be coming they sign an authority but a statement that duty of care is waived that they accept full responsibility for the consequences of their decision to go into their building and I know that you know I mean business people have risked running in their veins it's why their business people so it would have been quite's a learning out of the Christchurch situation post the earthquake there's actually to trust people to take on that risk for themselves and maybe that's a conversation that we need to be having as a city is what our risks that are you know because we can talk about risks that are assumed by individuals that sometimes the consequences societal so and that's where you're talking about living in an area of known risk is that something that we we simply transfer the risk of something happening to the wider society and I just think of the the beach site warn the cliff cliff side properties very mentions built on cleft sides and as soon as some coastal erosion starts to appear pressure goes on the small local council to meet the cost of it and and that's because you know and when I was Minister sorry when I was in opposition spokesperson on civil defense emergency management when I went round the small district councils to meet with civil defense they always came with a planner because they knew very clearly that the either erosion or after a disaster and if we think of what's happened in the east side of Christ Church in terms of building in areas where there was known risk in terms of liquefaction without any suitable ground preparation we know the price that we all collectively pay for those poor decisions Andrew I can give your name I just wanted to drill down into a couple of the issues that have come up around the cost chair agreement and it might be that this is his legal advice or someone that's got some expert knowledge of the cost share agreement the transfer of the fifty percent of the the land adjoining council reserves to council when that land has been red zoned it was mentioned that the the spirit of that was to improve access to the reserve now is that actually noted in the cost share agreement or does the cost share agreements simply say that fifty percent of the land will be transferred to council where it joins a reserve because presumably what we choose to do with that land after it's been agreement says it's to be transferred then it's to be transferred regardless of what the what the future use of that might be so that's my first question and then the second question is around the cost share stating that if a suitable rock rock fall protection solution can be found then that would potentially override the the red zone offer or could override the red zone offer and the cost of that would be shared between the council and grams of both parties contrib use when this is agreed and I mean there's there's an argument as to the construction of that agreement I guess you could look at it from a technical viewpoint that if it's agreed technically that this is feasible and the council's geotech and and the government's geotech agreed that's the case or where it's agreed by the minister and obviously the minister as withheld agreement but if the minister is withheld is agreement unreasonably I think there's no good technical reason why the process couldn't go ahead the rock fall protection structure here that the minister can't unreasonably withhold agreement I probably I probably can't answer that question I suppose so I'll rephrase it you asked question it draws down into the legal technicalities of the agreement and that would need to be a properly considered answer before I could start could offer that to you particularly in regard to that second question so you know what what is reasonable what's unreasonable what would be what's the attitude of the minister I think that I suppose that all I would say is at the moment though it's clear that the minister has fundamentally built his contribution to the port hills based on the fifty percent buyout option and that says fundamental platform so I suspect that what would give him to depart and that would have to be something very very significant and there's been a figure that has consistent comment to us about the use of the red zone land in respect of the land the fifty percent transfer know that I don't believe the cost sheared does explicitly talk about that but the red zone was first emerging it was very much that our interest in acquiring land back was to basically complete reserves or two to make improve access to reserves I think from a professional point of view from a technical point of view we we would say actually as a council we should be wary of actually acquiring more land with as known to be of high hazard so again entering into that we both may have an expectation about what we want but we should also be careful that we don't acquire land which we particularly don't want either but certainly our sentiment around that at the outset was it was around reserve protection rather than around being the basis for any sort of area wide mitigation or anything like that but if there's now an opportunity to construct area-wide mitigation that would save homes on land that under the cost share we could acquire I would expect that something that we would be investigating is that a question or a statement it was slightly rhetorical this is a it was a statement about them comment on it welcome to comment I think I go back to where we were with the principles of what we're talking about the fundamentals is that we don't want people living in areas of high hazard second principle and that's that's a principle of go forward principle of you've established through all your discussions on the on the district plan in fact you're actually now talking I understand about areas where you want to prohibit activity so you're prepared to be a lot more rigorous around controlling activity on horror films though the residential I suppose that the solution that we've come to around giving solutions to individuals is where we are using individual rock for protection strategy as the mayor's alluded to over the passage of time the number of properties so that the mess the ability to benefit a large number of properties has eroded simply because people have chosen to avail themselves of the red zone offer so the numbers have decreased considerably that seems in our view in my view is to say actually so so look at where you can put area-wide mitigation that's what council just to do we've done that yes if you had as we've said before if you had additional land and they're some of the some of the the numbers might change but I still think that fundamentally we were talking about a limited number of potential beneficiaries the individual rock fall protection structure policy is still the most appropriate response by council just can I just run through the on one point to the friends that we asked for and the report so legal advice on the council liability that was dealt with previously because it's legal advice not and the public arena including all information provided to councils on 7th irme including response to lecia from moco MP and the cabinet advice which you preferred that that wasn't cabinet advice that was the advice to the Minister for can be worth quite recovery that's what's been attached so I presume that spoil its referring to have we got the the response to the letter from the local MP did we came to to them to the mirror office okay and I'm not sure that we have no we haven't replied to it okay Tywin so Justin Peters just advised we have met were through subsequent to that meeting and we have canvas that little was hurt right yep also we don't have the information around one point two point three which was what I was just going to go through that this excluding expen to cover ground own property and I also and we shot probably should have put it in there but I think we also mentioned in the debate bacon sections as well I've got in in relation to one point two point three attached to the report is the detailed cost benefit analysis that they kingdom of what we looked at doing we've been seeing what I think what you were asking for previously has what would happen if one was to do those cost benefit that cost benefit analysis of you would to add back into the mix the red zone properties and the challenge that was presented when we look to come up with were predicated on the numbers of available properties so if you start to put more red zone copies back in you change the design so the easier thing was and we just have to get it organized but we could have shown you what was done in 2012 which probably the more it's probably more useful in tinkering with that in other words what's and the technically feasible and financially viable areas look like in 2012 I can't we have that information could you flick that story to us yes yeah it's great and you've done the MV review and the specific information on Finny's big fat so it's it so really what's what's Abe senton is the response to to Ruth Dyson and that and maybe that's my responsibility but I better chase it up and secondly as the is that 2012 certificate so we're not going to I think perhaps what I understand better today that I didn't understand last time that we looked at this was that in order to redo concept design because you're actually you need a different design of a structure if you're covering more houses and so I thought it was just a simply a matter of sort of like multiplying here and multiplying here and you get a different answer but actually it's quite different so if you could give us that 2012 paper that I think that'll give us the answer that we're looking for is best that it can be a dream so the question is do we want to proceed with this in the absence of that information or do we want to await that last piece of information does someone want to move that the recommendations set out and the agenda be accepted all I will our movers and Becky buckle seconder so do we have well that I think that it would be appropriate to debate the the recommendation at the stage yani age thing is important that we get the 1.23 information because really what's it it seems to me that the nature of this debate will be about whether we believe that we if that's the case then we just don't go any further well we don't actually want to present the case and collect that information and then go to government actually because the cost you is between the crown and the council I don't believe it's just the minister so actually one suggestion maybe we get the information and then we take that case to to government so I don't know what the mechanism is and the cost you to get agreement to what the party or and I don't know whether that's just a letter from the minister or whether that's an approach to cabinet or through officials but it seems to me that's pretty much the fundamental sticking point here unless we see what's in that 2012 report it's hard for us to really make that call and Phil if you because it's important and well I do support yawning particular because this whole issue is so important for these residents and I think we do need to know that information as well so that we the technical feasibility and the financial viability is through their previous report Andrew yeah absolutely support while counselor you handsome councillor clearwater have said I believe we need the information from one point two point three before we can make a positive decision on this today well I understand why that is the case but what I've heard is that there are people out there who've been waiting for something which is a vain hope and I don't believe having read now the the medication framework for port hills properties that was presented to the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery back on the seventh of September 2012 that there is any hope that the government will change its position on this and I think that it's unfair to to our I think it's unfair to continue for another report that will change nothing and the deadline for the red zone offer as rapidly approaching duty first of August we have a district plan review which we're referring to the minister 44 comments before it is publicly notified and referred to a hearings panel which here today and and we've made a set of recommendations in that area about about development in an area of known risk so I I believe this has to come to an end and I don't know that it's really fair on people that we wait for another another report that at the end of the day will show what could have been but will never be and so that's why I reluctantly have moved this resolution so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no I will have a boat on that so we could well that is a a even so that means that the recommendation is lost and we yes the status quo so could I ask officials I don't think I need to move a resolution to provide the the 2012 information for the next council meeting you today unfortunately when able to get a time for this exhale gender item so but we can come back later in the day and have the the relevant technical people available to put that information up that as part of today's item yep that would be yep yep if it's kind of it today can we also get your prices for getting agreement and the cost yet so can we get clarity around what process we use to seek a gunner in the cost year it would have to be know what has to be a discussion with crayons it should be in a document there should be a section and I mean there's all these 28 clarifications but it should be a section and how we how we negotiate with government how we approach them a good faith how they work with us in good faith but what I can't understand is how it is there is any good faith and someone saying no when we haven't even presented the case so what I'd like to be clear off as in terms of the cost share if we wanted to use that as a rationale foot going going back to government and saying here's our case what is the process to do so I don't know that share I don't know that the staff are in a position to to answer that because nobody nobody can understand why that provision is in there I suppose that I mean that Rachel attrition make work maybe maybe if you could have a look and see what we've if you could find out what the intent of that particular provision was in light of the earlier decision that the minister had already made it may be that it wasn't it doesn't say area-wide solution it may be an individual property yep so we'll go in if I understand that yeah okay thank you yeah okay well we might as well with June for the morning tea and return here at five past 11
Um could I invite staff to come to the table I think that there are a few questions that have arisen from that presentation that would be with while addressing first one is the history with respect to the area wide mitigation proposal that was put out I'm afraid 18 months ago as a long time before I arrived in this role and I don't have the history on the port hills that not even as a in my former life because there's some Phil pointed out it's the Honorable Ruth Dyson that was has really been knowledgeable in this area and I want to get an understanding of the relationship between the offer on area-wide mitigation the cost share agreement because there is a provision and the cost year agreement for the crown to share this cost but it is by agreement and I want to understand why why that agreement wasn't able to be reached because I guess the presentation that we've just had as well it sounded like a good idea at the time at the outset but all it's though that really mom to him drive to a conclusion that none of us really want it so what's you know I kind of want to understand how do we get to the position where people have pinned their hopes on on resolving the rockfall issues with protection measures to a point where it now feels like there is no choice so is anyone able to shed some light on that and light of the representation we've just had um oh I'll give it a go so that the if we go back into the history the issue of area wide mitigation was investigated by the by the council and by the crown the the minister ultimately and there was a process by that and that looked at the technical feasibility of where my moment occation could take place that also looked at financial feasibility in the conclusion the minister raises before with council minister made the call that he did not and would not support area why mitigation on the port hills and the the alternative that was established by the minister at that time was to create the residential red zone buyout offer the council resolved to become a party to that and so based on the 2007 valuations for properties the minister offered to purchase that fifty percent would be funded by the crown fifty percent would be funded by the council so that's have been a program that's been in place since sort of July August 2012 and can I asked us the cost share agreement says that the parties agree that if a cost-effective engineering solution can be identified and agreed by the parties which will reduce the life for us from rock fall and or rock roll so that port hills are our said is no longer applicable to their area the costs are going effect to their greed solution will be shared equally between them so if it was signed on jun 2013 how come the minister said it wouldn't happen in 2012 well yeah so I can answer what the cost share said because I've not I haven't_''_244.59 been involved in that aspect of it but the policy that's been in place has understand over eighty percent of the properties that have been red zoned have accepted that offer on the port hills the council subsequently resolved I think in december of that year to adopt the individual rock fall protection structure policy which basically indicated that the council if someone could develop and demonstrate to the council satisfaction that they could individually protect an existing house the council would basically contributes fifty percent of its buyout offer to that process and now that process has been that policies been in place that policy has a number of properties have gone through that and we can comment on that directly large number of people have looked at that but clearly as has been explained before the rock pool protection individual rock fall protection structure policy is designed to comprehensively address the risk as we now understand it so the thresholds for that are high and invariably some of the costs associated with that are high in some instances they're not but in someone since they are high and that's obviously influenced people and the choices they've made about either pursuing summary the response by the council we believe has been has been more than adequate it has participated in the redzone offer which was led by the crown and it has continued to offer the individual rock for protection structures to private individuals on application and that's the current policy that were operating so would you agree with really what we've heard which is that or that really that we've been we've been cut off from from really making decisions that that might have been available early on in the piece by the lack of contribution of Crown land and the and ability to access crown n did we ever get a response to the request for access through crowd no not on X is true but my understanding is it as always the minister's been open to the concept of X's through Crown land to buy the to build rock for protection structures haven't_''_404.55 we been so it was just the decline fortune to use the creatures banners yeah and that's been consistent with his yep policy for some time have agree with that I think we've got to look at that in the hole so he's been very clear that he won't he and I think this influenced his decision sometime ago about why he refused here while it again I think he was concerned with the residual liability that he bought if it went on to crown land I think he was concerned that the advice he had at the time suggested that the solutions that were being offered weren't as robust as we're being purported now he made those decisions not that council I think we also have to be very mindful that our overall the overall policy position that we are in is actually not wishing to extend occupation of those areas or encourage occupation of areas of high hazard so that's the discussion you've had is that as part of your role with the district plan yes we want to recognize in instances where there's been existing an established occupation there may be instances where people wish to retain that occupation and the individual rot for protection structures included in this as you said a number of months ago with our report some of the benefit cost ratios would change but until the minister changes his mind and in the case the crown land may be available then clearly that's not going to happen is there any opportunity within the context of the cost share agreement around seeking up to fifty percent of the adjacent land to reserve lend for you know fought for our purposes as a council would that then get him will get us over the line and some of the in terms of some of the analysis because what that would do is that it would take away the risk that he appears to have you know that determined and obviously that the risk would transfer to us but obviously we're we're seeing that risk at a different level we haven't specifically addressed that question to to Cyril the minister of the stage the principal you know as I've explained to counsel for the principal for where the fifty percent came from was actually around improving access to our wanted to be able to take back some of that Crown land on the basis of making logical extensions to reserves creating access points to reserves I think that that was certainly in the intention and the fifty percent sort of trade off option it would be an interesting and moot point to see where the minister would actually a countenance selling count or giving land back to the council if it wasn't for that purpose even if it was the fifty percent okay thank you and Paul if the source of the issue in other words whether with the hazards actually originated is on our land have we not got some sort of responsibility through that yep providing that risk well you would have seen the you would have received some weeks ago the confidential report on on the legal position that we have we know that the legal position is complex but you will have seen the advice which believe that we are not we are not liable in in every case for every rock that could come down so we believe that we're not in have seen that report NESN PX Yanni um so so noting that the cost share is different to the signed version of the cost she's different to the report that went to Council which was all and not 50 be seen but given that the cost year makes it really clear that if we identify areas where there's a cost benefit regardless of who owns the land that that is something that we can go back to the crown with why haven't we done that work while shooting the mere act of that question to you a couple of weeks ago and that is a Cauchy ultimate requires the agreement of the minister no no then the end and we've had the advice the minister won't agree led to know that that's actually different the cost year to change the cost she requires the agreement of the council and government what I'm saying is what we've currently got on the COS here so we're not talking about changing the cost year we're not talking about doing I thought was that states the parties agreed that if they cost share cost effective engineering solution can be identified and agreed by the parties so it actually has to be agreed by the parties which will reduce the life for us from rock for when a rock roll so that port hills residential red zone is no longer applicable to their area the minister's stated on the record that he will not change the residential red zone and the costs of giving effect to their greed solution will be shared equally between them so that it has to be agreed yes but we haven't done the work to go to the minister to say this is something that we believe is cost-effective and reduces the life risk so he might still turn around say no sorry that way that won't do it and we don't agree with the assumptions you've made but if we've got assumptions that back up the case that it was put in 2012 that the right risk is being just that it is cost effective surely we should get their information and presented support us doing anything around the land that you've already got because it seems like we haven't even made the case we haven't done the work to make the case to secrecy we have asked him if he will change his position on area-wide mitigation and he has told us no and he won't give us access to his land so I mean that the answer has been given to the question we have asked them there's no point going to the crown with a proposition if we haven't if we've already been told the answer is no I mean what I cannot understand is why the cost sharing agreement agree I'm has this provision within it when it was patently obvious that the Crown had already decided not to go down the pathway of area wide mitigation it makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever and I think I mean it might be worthwhile asking why that particular provision was included in the cost year agreement because it has raised a level of expectation amongst councillors I mean the trouble was before the last local body elections I mean even the counselors that that SAT around the table today that voted to accept it or voted in the resolution against the resolution to accept it that they had not seen the documentation so they didn't know other than they had a provision and a cabinet and a council report that said that this was going to be part of the deal is that right yani johansson knows this back to front so it was a lot white of it than there it basically just said that the final binding cost year will reflect the council's current position I think around the rockfall so for someone for some reason mitigation once this has become public it has created a public expectation that the crown would be the you know what would receive such a request but we went back to the minister I think it was and identified in the may report we had a meeting with them and he said no so I mean we have actually raised it with him again le the stars tara fication please around of proposals to mitigate on land one application has been approved according to him but the council says three I just want to cancel an application for 14 the Crescent has been approved for 16 the Crescent has been approved the application was put both both property owners to given and we've been told that the application for 62 our attorney belly has been approved and we are talking to another seven or eight property owners about applications that they are working on to put my understanding I'm film can I just clarify in terms of individual rockfall solutions that have all of the people residents have been involved have they all been able to have Tara fication about option option zini way of individual mitigation in it yeah so I think we'll get Ian to answer you on that because in fact in every case that in our opinion has been strong interaction by our staff it has been focused on trying to resolve people's issues but as I said at the outset these are complex structures and so sometimes they the answers aren't the interaction they have so you mean might they have been discussed well I absolutely do I absolutely yep I've been involved the number of discussions from people ultimately looking for a technical solution so they obtained individual geotechnical advice coming to see us to see whether we think it's appropriate and then seek our clarification on the pre application funding not all of those have proceeded and my understanding is that's not from technical perspective it's from things like insurance what's the point of doing this if you're not going to get insured etc so people are making decisions based around that but from a technical perspective I am not aware of any application certainly fun that I've shown us that we've actually refused and want a technical basis we've actually approved on technical grounds to all the ones that are posted coming not all of them have proceeded to a final application but there are a lot of reasons for them and presumably that's because the the the plane say that other that the reasons might have here view they haven't been sufficiently strong to pick the steam has deemed it so from a technical perspective every time the GA tech consultant to come to see us we haven't actually returned them back so we go through drovers peer review process that looks at if it's not going to reduce the hazard or the light risk acceptable that the theory is that they'll get sim back and redesign to date we have not had any of that all the ones that have come in have actually gone through their peer review and we've said it's technically feasible it all fits the design and were to be completed we would update the one people notice thank you can its ask you a wider question too because like there was um feel well we made a comment about the peer review I just wondered in fact what was that what why was it not some consideration of price or perhaps you can tell me differently and the other part two was whether or not it included a methodology and if it didn't widen the work that we are done and it's important to understand the work we've done is at a conceptual level and no places was there detailed design done were for any of these area-wide it was a concept to answer some very basic questions is it technically feasible as a financially viable and under that framework we are scold up because it was probably got the most XP expertise low key with the involvement on the gondola is certainly on the costing and the costing blow ups that were involved but to look at our basically at the structure of our report but it's important to emphasize that they were done on a concept basis there's no detail designed for all the design parameters that anybody can start picking holes and Janet individual basis thank you can I ask a question about the cost-benefit analysis affairs Phil said the crown owned properties were included in the calculation would any of the would any of the area wide mitigation solutions for with an a cost-benefit analysis that we would we would accept so can I just rephrase as for the purpose of restoring houses on their lesson say for example that it hadn't been sold to the crown so say they were all individual property owners and they all wanted to be part of remaining there would the cost-benefit analysis have been sufficient for us to be signing off on the area wide mitigation I think we'd have to go back in and calculate that certainly think you've done the calculation in principle if you add more properties in you are invariably going to the numbers will change but particularly if you start to grow the extent of the properties in obviously you have to increase the volume of protective works but yes so we did a little bit of work to look at that and it does does shift some of the BCS but if it really does depend on where you draw the outer edge of the properties that you're going to be including but invariably the more properties you add probably that in principle would tend to make the thing more affordable so phil was right that at the beginning up and favor of remaining or area-wide mitigation that the cost yet that at the beginning of the process that would have been higher than it was at the end and that there's a certain degree of inevitability about what's weird they've ended up and it's really just over this period of time of people giving up and selling their properties to Sarah well arguably yes I mean the most the most the time at which it was pets the most affordable would have been back in 2012 when the red zone the red zone offer hadn't been presented yeah yeah yeah that's correct clean thank you I was going to ask the first question too but I had another one about appreciate the the peer review firms locally as experiences how confident are you that that peer review was independent oh we're very confident that was independent yes yonni so um accepting I mean I don't accept that we shouldn't do the work around the crown owned properties but accepting that that hasn't been done and the reasons for made an offer to pick with beerland why have we not included barely and as part of our calculation or every I think it I mean it's a very good question because it actually goes to the heart of the principal one of the things that we don't want to be doing is encouraging additional development in areas of high hazard and people who have BL and have not occupied that so if we allow our new houses to go in there were actually introducing new people to levels of risk so that's why we've excluded beerland if we if we included beerland how long would that process take how do you mean to calculate this yeah well I mean it's a calculation and you do it you'd put a nominal value on a return on our property but it would to introduce that in my opinion would be contrary to the policy position councils taken on new housing on the port hills so and maybe that's a good time to sort of kind of switch to the district plan review and the kind of update on that that's how include just that days when we the district plan provisions are so so just stepping back the the district plan review follows the the Christmas in Tony tag paper that was referred to earlier in terms of taking a risk-based approach and so for the full report Hills we we have got a non-complying activity for rock fall in the high hazard areas so anybody who doesn't that doesn't prohibit building obviously it's non-complying rather than prohibited but it does set a very high bar so if anybody wants to put any residential development up there they would have to demonstrate that they had mitigated that risk sufficiently the other thing to note about the district plan and the natural hazards chapter and you may recall from when lee when the district plan was presented to you though there is a very high level of engagement from the public in terms of the need for policies to control development and restricts development whether our high hazards and the survey results indicate over eighty percent agree that we should control lend is affected by heathers so there's a there's a broad community feeling on this that that also has to be balanced against those individuals who are who have existing houses and indeed bespoke solutions is it where could you speak to the existing youth rights I show that Phil raised yes if in terms of the district plan the the new if your house is within one of these new hazard manage that has been been met those rules do not apply to your existing house so if you can live in that house and you can maintain that house but you cannot extend that house or build a new house on that property so you can't intensify the use as it were right and so that would be the same for bare land and the area for beer land if there's no no existing you throw zombies right and so that it would be subject to a very high bar in terms of being able to build there that's right but if there was area-wide mitigation that applied to the area I mean mean it's in a way it's a tension between those that want to remain and the cost of achieving the sufficiently safe environment for that to occur over the the wider societal costs I guess of having people exposed to that do that degree of risk that's right so if the if there is a rock full protection structure in place say or a proposal for an area-wide rock fall protection structure that that doesn't make residential permit it because there is still a residual risk okay so you in terms of in terms of in terms of risk removing people as is the most effective that there is safe because the people aren't been exposed to the hazard a rock full protection structure simply mitigates the risk okay so it reduces the risk that has it remains and you know if there's an event above the design of that rock fall protection structure then obviously it may fail so it's not it's not people are not completely protected and safe there's a residual risk so if there was a rock would still be subject to resource consent but it would be a discretionary activity rather than a non-complying activity so the bar would not be so high thank you Yanni just two further points I wanted to get clarity on one is the request for clear guidelines from mb o for protection structures have they issued clear guidelines winner when did they come out if they haven't come out when are they coming out and we do they apply to okay maybe I can seek some clarification council developed the Rock Port protection guidelines in house those guidelines are followed will uplift 0124 so there's been no impediment to actually stopping people do it the issue with the majority of one to four properties and that the port hills is either there has it's too large to mitigate or it's because it's on a third property land so it's not necessarily a technical reason the guidelines I've been appropriate from a technical level we have lately because it's always be in council's position that we shouldn't be doing guidelines if we have been trying to engage with mb for a while and lately with the last couple of months we've actively handed over those guidelines and then we are basically taking them on and they will basically adopt what we're saying with them a couple of minor changes they will probably move to a hazard based approach rather than risk so you don't have to calculate a risk you just need somebody sadies they has it there and you need to mitigate it and this is how you do it that's nothing is different from our guidelines in that respect it's just that either where the g8 x is the problems too difficult we can't mitigate it's too costly etc or you need that person's permission to do it it's on somebody else's land and that's not forthcoming those are the main reasons why 124 notices have not been uplifted not because there's a lack of guidelines or a way forward it's just the situation for Hills cases that they're overturning s1 to force that we don't so they don't follow our guidelines they run an independent approach from independent geotechnical engineers and so they will get a variance of the geotech story what is clear is that where there's been a a determination and they've left to the 124 it's been pretty much on the margin of the rock full energy so it's debatable and it comes down to dare I say which model you use etc so it's in the vacancies or the uncertainties of rock form but I would say is that if you do get it wrong the implications of a rock pool of pretty drastic and that's my concern okay and then the second question I had was around why did the peer review not look at the methodology that was used but they did look at the methodology what I'm saying is that the methodology employed was a concept study so we did not run site-specific investigations rockfall analysis for all these concepts they were merely concepts based on the available information as you probably know it all these areas I actually try get information to go one step further into an actual design process would be a timely and very costly exercise so we basically are some very simple questions as conceptually is it possible to protect these areas so how would we do it what are the broad parameters we're going to use those assumptions and then we open some finances onto so to say it was like a pre-feasibility concept and there's no detail design done in it there would have been methodologies and assumptions made yep and you're saying that they have been peer review yep okay so I can just also draw your attention because the question of 12 fours and application by mb and the determinations did come up so there's quite a detailed section in the report as you're now in section 4 which looks specifically at those few instances where determinations have been given and then as you will know there have been one or two into how many instances where the determination to have been overturned and in a number of cases are the ones council decisions site by site basis and I think counselor Hanson you also specifically asked around I think pensar vieira what why some properties were what why one property was overturned and yet one two fours remain on properties around and below that and would cover that off as well
Isn't it's not showing on the screen yep thank you and the next item on the agenda deputations understanding order 3.19 we've got three deputations whooping requested to attend and I'd like to invite bill bill Amy to a drill me sorry to address the meeting on item 15 area-wide mitigation item 15 counselors and I propose to move to item 15 immediately after your presentation thank you good morning after a long process we're here to talk about the area wide mitigation report that was been presented in various stages since it was asked for in January this is for the portholes rock for what overall we're very unhappy was this report that its premise that Sarah owned properties and beer land not be included in any area wide mitigation scheme effectively leaves it dead in the water we're not sure how it came to that we were of the understanding that this will be done as an independent exercise to display to the council what the numbers look like the report itself you know there are strange justification for why particular beer land included there are no Sarah owned properties in food if there's no single properties included it leaves a very scant number properties that that could potentially be protected by rock for perfection so yes there are no there are no clear areas which which which show economic benefits that would certainly be in place where all of the properties included the technical design of the rock for protection that is included in the report as is completely over designed and I make this judgment based on my own technical knowledge and CCC's own criteria for teaching the costs of the RPS against the life costs of houses they protect are not comparing apples with apples the the RPS life costs include all maintenance costs and such like over the period of 50 years which is the life of the mitigation measures the that I compared against basically a one-off costs of half of the 2007 government valuation does not include the cost of demolition of the houses it doesn't include the land remediation that will be required it doesn't include any loss rates income doesn't include the benefit to downslope properties which will require rock full protection in order to obtain building consent when your new build repairs that sort of thing once the red zone is cleared that I also contend that the report has not been properly peer-reviewed independently golders peer review is very limited in its scope all it does is evaluate or or legitimize the method of pricing the rightful protection over its lifetime it doesn't make any judgment on the type of rock fall protection priced and it really doesn't say say anything that would would lead me to believe that it's a proper peer review and and and and most certainly to my knowledge these people who did their peer review are not independent of counsel at least one of them has been seconded to counsel recently I ask that you simply resolve that this report is now not well founded and and that the reason area-wide mitigation is not found to be economically viable as simply because the Sarah owned properties and the bare land properties are not included moving on from from things about mr. Brownlee's policies with regard to the rock fall protection on the lack of area wide mitigation as door has decision not to implement any rock full protection on the port hills it's been a disaster in terms of personal and community well-being it will result in unnecessary destruction of good housing in a city that's screaming for it it will cost the ratepayers and taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and arguably it will increase risk to residents is there any good in any of that so where to from here we've got a policy which which is hell-bent on clearing out the port hills red zone the coercion is extreme council staff are adamant that the individual rock fall protection scheme which is available to two individual residents is working well well I ask you after 18 months of 18 months of that scheme being in place there have been as I understand it one removal of source approved council staff have assured us that there are actually three approvals been given to my knowledge that is simply not true that the believe an address in the Crescent where that the actual source could be completely removed therefore that those properties would be zoned agree where do residents like myself go from here we have existing one s124 notices on our homes how is the new district plan going to be dealing with people with existing youth rights and we simply don't know we haven't_''_489.42 been included in any conversation over this thing that there are existing resource consent requirements for a rock full protection that um I can't see how they're going to go away but there are existing is 124 notices that still have to be lifted I can't see how it's going to be done at prison this is three years after the earthquake this whole thing is an utter mess and and and you know that did the coercion for residents to to just accept the red zone buyer and leave has has been extraordinary I've been involved in all this I've been trying to get some results in the political spectrum and technical spectrum I don't even know stay in our home ourselves I know it can be done you know as an engineer I know what's required I just don't see a process for doing it it's not there I last time I spoke to you I brought up the report done by you know Tony tag and I think Calvin Berryman which you know that the previous council commissioned and you know it's it's a strong recommendation was that any residence in these areas you know should be involved in the conversation over their houses hmm that hasn't happened it's still not happening winds are going to happen we've got two months till the red zone off of runs out I my family and I well you know we'd like some sort of certainty around what's going to happen because we just don't know and they're only you know certain option is to take the red zone offer and for us that's simply not an option that this yeah doesn't work for us so does anyone have any questions you know what Yanni Thank You felon but thank you for you know know how hard this has been for you and your family and others in your situation and you have been coming here you know a lot trying to get us to look at what we can do I hear your frustrations with government so if we just accept that the government have a point of view which we have been unable to change as well as a council but what is it that we could do as a council if we don't if we can't do area-wide mitigation because the government won't let us on their land and won't take into account crown properties then in terms of our individual prices is there anything we could do that would be of assistance to you and others in your situation are there any changes we could make to that that with that would give people the feeling of us as a council trying to support that the desires that people have to be involved in the and about their home going forward okay well my experience of that council is an adversary rather than trying to help us move on you know that the evidence is there that in over 18 months at the start of that that scheme they work there were hundreds of people who were interested and over the 18 months that it's been in place it's virtually resulted in nobody being able to get mitigation in place and save their houses if if mb we should release proper guidelines it would go a long way to residents being able to use proper processes to you know proper building act processes to be able and demonstrate their homes as safe or can be made safe you know if council were to call on mb just like the parliamentary regulations review committee have to release those guidelines that would be great the s124 notices I put on these houses by council and surely it's incumbent on you to give residents a method of getting rid of those is 24 notices the individual scheme hasn't done that it's been it's more rather than being a helpful scheme that's just thing yeah we I don't feel like anybody other than the Human Rights Commission and Ruth Dyson is actually on our side I'm really sorry Phil but thank you very much for making your presentation and perhaps if we could turn to item 15 on the agenda thanks Bill
And the next item on the agenda is the confirmation of the minutes council meetings twenty-second am a 28 the May fifth and the twelfth of June so that's if I could have a someone to move that these minutes be confirmed then Livingston seconded by Andrew tuna I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried
Uh declare uh the meeting open if I can just remind people that the council meetings are all live streamed and if people could speak clearly into the microphones and not otherwise then we will um be able to uh ensure that people can uh participate in the proceedings even if they're not uh here observing in person uh the yep so the um okay so I'll move to apologies um and I haven't received any apologies uh declarations of interest um standing item on the agenda I haven't received notice of any declarations of interest
On there yeah text and then you do one for the whole of us and then and then for the hot so the next resolution I need a move on a seconder for the 2014-15 annual plan consisting of the draft and the changes in ABCD and if and adopted by resolution above is adopted so Andrew Turner second to clean loving stone I'll put that motion so one of the issues we ran into with the border office over a few years was being really clear that we have a resolution that sets that the timing of Ian and still wants a G and the penalties can I just check that we've got a formal resolution happening for those because I don't want to end up in the same situation my stuff like we were I think that's further down ass up 1415 financial year in bold yes it's out the detail of the rate so rather than just being in the appendices which has been practiced in the past they're included within what you are adopting and improving okay are we going council guess so end of that first paragraph the council resolves to set the following rates you but that's not the one we're dealing with naraz oh no no no it's a nice one so it's not yeah okay yeah it's coming it's fun so we've got a mover in a second I'll put that notion all those in favor say aye all right there's a post a no that's carried and now we come to the resolution to set the rates and but we still have to go back at the end and do that rafal up resolution Billy yeah okay so classic you get my gist right there is a further resolution going near adopting these in charge has some changes to the investigations policy will run as amendments to the three-year plan concurrently with the ending scene consultations that happen right so that's been well some of it somebody put it up after they took out the minor sound of the nearest one so I can end it but well how can it be in schedule encounters unchanged from what was in the dark so the we actually we actually dealt with that part of that resolution but it doesn't matter councillor East and counselor Livingstone will move and second the this other one which basically picks up those that the amendments consulted on concurrently with the draft annual plan being adopted including the amendments to the fees in charge of schedule set out in appendix D they were reported as minor changes and corrections to errors and the original resolution which is why I ended up asking where it had gone so anyway but this is the wording that is preferred and it doesn't measure that we've already passed the other one yani um where's the resolution that changes the dc's policy that's it so I just like I'm really nervous because actually the Audit Office was really critical of us making sure we had sufficient detail for people to follow in what we're doing so if developers challenge us I want to be really clear that we've got a very specific resolution around what the okay they're all they're all set out an appendix D so I don't mind the writing of the word development contributions policy hey where's page 211 of the draft plan has the changes to the development contributions policy yeah no I know what's happened is that is that the amendment around we can we just take out the amendments and what are the amendments and the and the three-year plan that were consulted on concurrently there was a development contract development of contributions policy okay the amendments to the so can we can we take out that hold of that including the amendments to the feeds and schedules citizenship appendix D we've done that we've accepted the minor and corrections to eros it at an effect so can we go back to the beginning of that resolution and say the amendments to the development contributions policy and what other amendments were consulted on concurrently that's all the amendments to the development contributions policy 2013 contained within the 2013 here amendments to the fees and charges consulted on as an amendment to the that death resolution is as it is okay the amendments to the development contributions policy and the fees and charges as at policy fees and charges or just fees and charges charges and fees and charges so take out with that the race relations and postponements policy and the rates remission and postponements policy yep contained in the draft 2013 16 three year plans consulted annual plan three year oh no so okay no no no that doesn't make sense it's not a draft no I know I know that but it sees with the draft annual planner adopted so the amendments to the development contributions policy the only change that makes that was would be to get rid of draft before 2000 years just about to do that so the amendments to the development contributions policy comma take out the word end fees and charges and the rates for emotion and postponement policy contained in the 2013 consulted on concurrently with the draft 2014-15 annual plan are adopted so so and we've amended the appendix D yeah hey if we use the word fee schedule after think I've been scheduled he's in charge of schedule is it a Joe on the plane yeah it's not really a schedule within the draft annual plan no but as it is is it within the three-year plan yes it is ok so the fees and charges schedule in the rates from Russian and postponement policy contained in the 2013 16 three-year being consulted on concurrently with the draft 2014 annual plan our adopter so that's been moved by David East seconded by Glen Livingston I'll put up Flynn you're not Glen your Yanni I just want to make sure you're really clear about the DC is because we've had a lot of changes that we made and new information has come to light on page 2 18 of our council agenda outside of the amendment to the three FN we have a table setting out the activities that we're charging DC's for and I just want to be reassured from stuff that none of those tables have changed because that's what we were going to now and it example the hall to libraries being pushed out into a different year I think you just need to look at this and see that that says implications for what we're charging for disease and if it's changed we need to have it mended because I cannot believe between witness went out for a draft and now timing hasn't changed and budgets have not changed Police Force abilities quite possibly I mean I hate to do this at the last minute but it's become very apparent that through our conversations that this is critically important are we able to give me guidance on that there's as far as the development contributions policy goes there's been no changes to any of the timing of anything else then we're looking to charge development contributions on at the stage other than those that we will bring through as part of the carriage house which is the normal excuse me which is a normal process that we're doing july once the year has closed would come back to the council for carryforwards but all other budget had flagged for the draft and not so if I take the eastern pole recreation facility 640,000 was supposed to be done by the end of this month clearly that's not going to guess it's not going to be expended so to be carried for the oscar awards that a ball back to you in july so the dc's policy contribution policy and 2014-15 should reflect that that would be do teen android or however much that actually is you know because we have to carry it forward so until we carry it forward you're saying we don't change no the kept the carryforwards will pick up the final position and the capital projects and that's simply because of the stage of the years it's impossible to know where we are with all the world yep all right so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and I mean counselor your Hansen's absolutely right to want to be very clear crystal clear on these because we know that there's a piece resolutions were not clear and appropriate and the past so the next resolution is in fact and extremely important resolution in that regard and so who would like to move the correct resolution for us Phil Clearwater seconded by Paul lonsdale so these ones are the setting of the rates under the local government rating edge and can we have an assurance that was the correct resolution no no we're asking is this the legally correct resolution that is acceptable so that we do not have to subsequently be told that we haven't seen our yes yes and all right so is that we could call it the if there has to be at local we call the the last thing that I ever did for the crusher to be careful but if it's any consolation to mr. Mitchell this this reflects the resolution that went through in September last year correcting the rates resolutions drafted carefully by some sangria sent over a long period of time that then that we've taken that used it this time flicked it back to some sangria sand yet again it the last time we ever use some some prisoners all right no that's fine so is ah it's not so much about setting the rate per se it's about how we see it and it's hard to incorporate this in there it so they didn't sort of administration question Molly in the house and what I'm going to ask does six of one half dozen of the other but would it be possible for us to when we seen the rights bill out to actually have discount for an early or on time payment as opposed to a penalty for a late payment it's just I preferred sticks over carrots I want to be and incentivizing counsel as opposed to a punishing counsel yeah carrot incentives not distance he does carrot better than sticks it's the same thing but I'd rather offer a discount if they paid it on time or earlier as opposed to penalizing if it was late as it possible to do that um yeah Annie I don't think so because the rate the rating act rating actors is that's how they work interesting that's the way they look at us for us later they were right you know can I actually host there with him can I just correct myself into that let us go back up before we resolve this could we go back up to the top and pass the resolution that was I thought that we'd had agreed that there would be an overarching resolution that's very odd yes that's right so where is the resolution that does that so what is the resolution okay well I will move that and tim scandrett had actually already seconded it so I'll put the over arching motion all those in favor say aye those opposed to any no can we do see the detail under no no we're not doing that one year I'm just this is the ovaries overall yes I think the public vehicle is lovely above is now confirmed so I put that motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that's carried and now we move to adjusted for the decision that was made so that's why they're different from the ones that are printed on audience oohs okay so if you would like to gently scroll through these so that people can see them I mean the words haven't_''_990.94 changed except for the dollars and cents okay yeah all right is that all good yeah I correct so the first one of these has been moved and seconded that this is the resolution that sets the rates I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now we set the instalments with due dates for payments and I think that I should let yani your head some moves us and seconded by Phil Clearwater so I'll put the installment resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and then we come to other matters for resolution will deal with these separately so all we've moved a bit fast there should be a resolution just under the table Oh of the areas around the adding the that was the other thing that that wasn't right so who would like to move the penalties I'm Jamie Christmas camp and secretive by David ease day I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and actually I think we can put all of these together that authorizing the chief financial officer and the corporate finance manager to borrow in accordance with the liability management policy authorizing the chief financial officer to make me missy necessary amendments required to ensure the plan is in accordance with our resolutions and resolves to apply option two of course 63 of the Canterbury Earthquake rating order for the 2014-15 financial year which I think means that we don't have to orderly that's the one around a building being demolished or being rien habited throughout the year oh you slips right that's that's about yes we don't_''_1142.44 we look around individual once it was in the background of the report which I tried to use for another purpose and found that I couldn't say that's fine all does anyone want to second Paul lonsdale so I put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed they know that's carried and that appears to be there yes so look thank you all very very much I think that you know people have worked incredibly hard people have looked for solutions I know that staff had worked incredibly hard behind the scenes and I just want to record our thanks to you for all of the work that you've done we know that you've got a great team back there and you know and it's and it's great to have the confidence that we've passed the right resolutions and certainly done everything that we can to make this better I am seriously looking forward to putting our line in the sand in terms of the historic position that we have inherited and 30 first of July as a date that I'm looking forward to when we can really sit out a vision for our future as a city and and plan the way ahead and then start working with much and thank you very much I declare the meeting closed
And the first matter that I will deal with is the disposal of the mayoral Daimler you have a written report in front of you it just has a little mistaken in the background refused to November 2006 I think the person preparing the report couldn't believe that it has been waiting since 1996 and so it but you'll see from the previous resolutions recorded below that it was 1996 oh sorry but in order to deal with us we actually have to accept the supplementary report on to the agenda as we always do with late items to the agenda so it's someone right to move Pauline second debate glean that that the report be received and considered at the annual plan meeting of the 25th of jun 2014 I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and I would personally I would personally like to move that we agree to revoke the previous council meeting decision of the 27th and November 96 and to approve the disposal of the mayoral Dayman ah by way of public option fund do I have a seconder for that Tim scandrett is there any discussion there any discussion on the motion I would like to place on record since we've got them on live screening we'll just start the auction now if you'd like to if you'd like to just sort of zoom in on that you can see that's actually a very very it's a very beautiful car so prosthetic prestigious yes and so so it has a unique history turn armed and I think Vicki back was the mirror when it broke down when we no visit so there is a lot of history associated with it but it was between jobs okay so but the point the point about this is is that that it is an opportunity for some generous peace without their to say this is an opportunity to add to the to the to the Christchurch earthquake mural Relief Fund and actually make a contribution to assisting us as we recover from our disaster but at the same time I think dispose of something that we no longer need no well I think it might have been yeah I don't think we made de Murcia so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much and now if we could have there was a another item that I wanted to deal with just quickly but it doesn't seem to go so where are we up to right okay okay well what I'm going to do is I'm just going to pass these around and I'm going to convert the use of selfie so you cheated wish you were here teacher so I just met works I'm Julia Holden over the lunch break who's an artist who some painters these wonderful pictures of Christchurch as it is today and although some of the paintings are now out of date because they some of the buildings have since come down but they are a record of history and she is displaying these as part of you know just reminding the rest of New Zealand so they've been displayed as billboards in the process of fundraising to bring them down to Wellington to display them there she has sites available for them and she wants to start a bit of a campaign around around these phantom billboards printed 20,000 of these postcards so I'm recommending that you keep these postcards once you have tweeted them and then you also mail them out to someone else and get them to tweak them as well so that's end of those of you I think everyone's on social media here so we should be able to do that but I thought that this was a good opportunity don't David's on facebook so if you can't if it if you can't if you can't tweet if you can tweet you can facebook if Paul and Julie you're actually yards by gonna Julia we while back and there is an opportunity for us to also this place I'm an original was actually in there an hour for you and and I think that'd be a great way of also supporting the campaign I think so to that that point I also agree that we should be doing more to encourage some of the wonderful contributions their artists make to the uplift of our city and and I just think that she's she's she's captured and a series of images that have they you know the thing is is that because we all know that ground to them we know that there is some sadness and them but I didn't feel sad when I looked at them she she's captured them beautifully and I I think that there's this there's a lot that our artistic people and creative people can offer in terms of our recovery and I see that counselor kata is in fact sell feeing with the Danelaw it was oh do we have a first offer yeah that's right anyway so so that that was that was as an aside and not an official part of our agenda but I thought it was a wonderful opportunity while we were all sitting around the table to give some publicity to a fantastic idea that that that very much it is on the back of the postcard so hashtag wish you were here chucha hashtag wish you were here chucha right so Peter begged to you is your microphone on o mine wasn't either I'd like to go through a pen Dex be for a start so over the lunch break we've run through the changes to see where we r things landed and so I'd like to update you on that and also have a general comment around some of the background if it's possible to focus on the a through D columns and just extend it a bit please yep so what we have here is the starting point of the six point five percent we move through and what we've done is we've captured within here the the recommendations within the appendices Mears recommendations with an A&F and captured the ones that have been agreed to so for instance under the flooding remissions you can see that that's now at the net level of 160 or point zero five temporal timber Templeton pull trend proposal head-to-head changes that we've discussed this morning the Historic Places fund reduction winery sewer project budget reduction the CCR Christchurch publication ceasing the banner changes for one year the RTO route upgrade brought forward the library opening hours back to existing and the 2013 forecast operating deficit and you'll notice that in that operating deficit sent abroad the that has decreased to four million so the over lunch looking around to see how that is currently looking at this stage has changed somewhat from when we submitted the paper on Thursday we have some greater specificity about the reasonableness of an accrual from NZTA which I'm willing to be prudent around and accept at this point however there is still a lot of uncertainty that's only a forecast so it's around that figure that brings us to a recommended final 2014-15 and your plan its impact just exclusive of 351 million eight hundred and thirty one thousand or a rates increase of 7.4 eight percent now I did look back and refer to the three year plan and it appears that in the three year plan million of rapes revenue so it is actually five million less than the rate set up and second year after the three year thing so that is that as a pin de ce be I'd like now if we can manage the technology to go back to the background of the paper because the background context has now changed I'd like to explicitly and bring that to the attention so from the annual plan report and that was circulated on wedding state we had the purpose and your remember that that I walked through the background and the appendices in some detail I don't intend to do that again but what I did want to do is and just point out that we have follows that the appropriate processes and that we're in line with the local government act particularly moving on to page four note that section 100 subsection 1 the local government act requires us to set each year's operating river with little revenue sorry add a little sufficient to meet operating expenses I balance the budget I believe we've achieved that that means the council must either barrel fund the deficit now the change I want to bring out here is proposed at the operating deficit we offset by one-off increase so that no longer features within within the table within a previously be and isn't captured by the resolution notice that it wasn't captured by the resolution anyway so I just wanted to point out that that is now included within the general it's not a specific strictly one-off basis so the next point F adopted by council this would lead the overall rates increase to existing ratepayers for 2014-15 at 7.4 eight percent details set out and that then you're appendices pmc so thank you for your forbearance on on that what we do now is we now work through I understand the the adoption of the 2014-15 annual plan and in particular and from the staff recommendation working through the council resolutions that Peter Mitchell might want to guide us on the manner in which we work through those okay well okay well we quick okay we can put them under virtually so the together appendix a and if and it's already been moved and seconded so but do we do we have to do them separately or is it normal policy to do them separately okay does anyone feel that we have to go through them individually or do people mind if we just pop them as a single package yeah and if that know that that they are so we're no no appendix B is the new form of Appendix B so we've got the mayor's recommendations as set out in an appendix a and if so the resolution that we have in front of us yep and we need to make a change to appendix D so and we've just we've just accepted the changes to appendix B so that's now changed don't do it does that need to be recorded separately that we've accepted these as a whole well it gets to the monitor time okay so so would someone like to move the first of these bullet points I mean then we'll put the whole lot together in so by Andrew Turner and so that's the mayor's recommendations as set out in Appendix A and if our adopted all those in favor say aye all right those opposed say no that's carried the second one is the financial changes to the draft your plan set out and substituted appendix B so okay so but is that ok just to add the word substituted appendix B so can we add on the word substituted so who will move that David East seconded fool clearwater I'll put that motion Oh yep given that we've just got the fingers back and given that we had a lot of you know probably the one contentious one was around the Benatar changes and given that we're 7.48 and that that's 0.02 I just wonder whether we consider putting some actually back into that I thought the goal was to get to 7.5 we've got the financials and it seems to me the sake of having a division over there we actually have got extra funding that we might go to put they're not confirmed though there may be a wee bit of movement and the forecast is always just a forecast it's not it's not actual so there is a degree of you know which way will it go up or down and the the point that counselor you're handsome is one that's that's open to you the implication for us is simply running away and doing the decimals again so we wouldn't be doing that right now now we need to go to the process climbing issue oh my god like the second while yani saying I mean we've signal earlier on that we would be if we lived it in the budget we would still work to actually try and achieve sponsorship or other funding models to bring it to bring that costs down and I think of this sends a clear signal to a young people we do care about Christmas for them and add a second I can't accept the amendment I can't because we already debated on it we had a vote on it it wasn't unanimously accepted and I _''_983.13 it's not appropriate so I'm you know my hands are tied and I forgot so so I'm going to put the motion as it is so all those in favor say aye all right those opposed say no that's carried and then I'm told that appendix if we've already done that Hemingway yeah but but the next one is appendix if it's already been done so remove that so the next one is appendix D the minor changes and corrections to air is set out an appendix B actually did we include the the rates one and the and the featured one from the building control area yeah the phase change one but also the one that Jonnie gave before lunch are we able to the burnside one so that was not a rates change that was bringing our attention to a submission issue that got missed out of the printed copy so we do have a response to that submission that submission response does not recommend a change as I as I understand it so based on that unless there was a rates impact could I just speak to it Leander I don't think there was a rates impact anyway because these guys were going to walk away from using this space unless we changed the rules I thought their submission was actually very compelling and very sensible and I had no difficulty with accepting it so I'm not keen to go back to them and say no way but if it doesn't have an impact on the on the on the annual plane this is not the right way to change those kind of an impact on the serpent so what we need to do no we need to refer this for a report and to ask for a report to come to council so that we can make a decision on it we're we're being asked to adopt a schedule of fees and charges today we've had a submission that says in adopting the schedule of fees and charges we think you should add an additional category this is perfectly reasonable to do it as this time at this time that is standard practice and I defer to your much greater experience than mine but to change the philosophy behind why a particular approach has taken what the representative sporting code as opposed to individual clubs I'd actually like to know a little bit more about that and I want to have a direct staff to prepare a report and bring it back with us I mean I think they're going to get the the you know the issue in front of us is relatively as quickly as possible and then we can make a decision based on the issue rather than on creating another category which is actually undermining the the principle that the council's already established I don't know whether this has got any validity or not I mean I mean the council position and I'd like to know that before I vote on it so I'm just going to sew this is as as I'm just going to move something quite separate here so if you could write up another resolution their submission 1 16 18 burnside Rugby Football Club be referred to parks Department for is that the section or shall we refer it to to to the chief operating officer to refer to the chief operating officer and asked for a report back to council directly by Jane I'm looking at you how long do you want okay by the end of July yeah by the end of July anyone seeking that Tim I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and the the next one is to move the amendments that Dave East has in relation or have they been written unto the had they been written done no they will need to be they need to be edit okay so Davis moves and who seconds yep and who's second doing that for Glen Livingston so I'll put that amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and then we moved on to that appendix d isn't it yep so who will move that the amendments to season sealed it where are we sorry I'm lost where are the minor there it was up there before vision so it was that um we we did the other resolution go that okay but where's the one that we've just done for David East that's on there that's all they're cool and so who will move that the minor changes with every did we get a mover and a seconder for that David and Glen so you well you might as well do the second one as well so this is other one so are there any things and the minor changes and corrections that need to be drawn to our attention all straight forward I put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that's carried and then we need to go back to setting the so it's the scheduler brate set up an appendix e be adopted and those those rates have now been amended haven't they yep so who will move that the general answer is yes however under Appendix C you'll also see whether uniform annual general charges come in yeah term scandrett seconded Paul a bit clarification about the uniform annual charge so I'm assuming that the additional 1.27 person hasn't been edited I just want to clarify here no no we're not doing the one point two seven percent singer anyway so we're passing a rate of 7.4 eight percent and the uniform annual charge has not changed no that changes that we have made under Appendix B at A&F today have not impacted on the uniform charge or unit charges yeah if only impacted on general rates and that's it yeah yep so I put that motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that's carry and that then should bring us to ber you look the full resolution of the Gazette right oh no vehicle yeah
The additional amendments and appendix if and there there are a couple that we're well one that we're we're just quickly reviewing but we'll start with the reduction on the Historic Places fund and would someone like to move that items Kendra seconded Jamie golf is there any discussion Yanni um I I'll reluctantly support this because I know that we've got major financial pressures and I know that we're actually on Thursday going to be considering a report around developing a heritage strategy so there are ways I think that we need to be more proactive in the heritage space and it's not just about funding so this is a fund that has been sitting at a certain amount that has been unused for quite a while and it's really timely that we're actually looking at how we actually have the best response from a strategic point of view in regards to heritage preservation conservation etc in our cities so I'm happy to support this as a one-off as part of this process recognizing that we're going inform the LTP are very much more strategic approach to trying to save heritage buildings in our city so I won't repeat that comment for the next one or they do more clarification over what budget the next one is coming out of yeah thank you very much Yanni Jamie no Pauling here I just have a question around it that is there going to be any impact on anybody expecting any funding from this will it negatively impact on well it's the paper that's coming to council tomorrow has a reduction of 1 million dollars already in it so this takes it to a reduction of 1.5 million and it's the 2.5 and as Jonnie caesars not allocated every year so it probably be noted that's right the reason for the pause was I was trying to think about the expectations that people might enter yeah thank you so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried I propose that we move what we don't deal with the second one now we'll come back reduce the project budget budget for the winery's sewer by 1.9 million that's move Phil Clearwater seconded yes yeah Bucky back Second Earth so is there any discussion on that Andrew I just wanted to ask a question if I may please of staff Peter could you just explain how and where this 1.9 1.9 million saving has been found please I'll defer to Jenkins so a good result there and helpful addition to the two it to our situation so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried but someone like to move the next recommendation sister city grunts can be reduced Paul lonsdale seconded Andrew tuna I would like to speak to this just just simply to say that this is not I mean that the previous council made a strong recommendation around or established a policy around sister city relationships and I think that they did so without really being aware of the enormous financial pressure that the organization was under so I think what we know now is quite different from the position or reorienting our focus on sister city relationships to focus on those anniversary years rather than focusing on our you know a three-year visiting program it enables us to reduce the budget quite significantly over the next year and and and beyond I think that the the China visit this year though as has really been well signaled it has been there are a number of people that are relying on the council being in China this year as part of the 30th anniversary of the relationship with gansu province but at the same time to make the visit to Wuhan which is a second sister city relationship at the same time to visit sichuan province to sign a an agreement on international education which will be a first for New Zealand which involves a mutual exchange of teachers as well as the involvement of the correspondence school and it is an incredibly unique and powerful relationship between our two countries and I think that that's something that is worthwhile as well obviously it's another opportunity for the city to express its desire to have a direct link't have the flights coming in via Auckland and then straight to Queenstown but actually direct flights and to Christchurch will be very good for our city and that is something that the obviously the airport company has a great interest in as well but I believe our city does and at the South Island does we know that visitor spenders greater when the journey starts in the South Island because this is where the great experiences are and that's where we generate an enormous amount of return not just for our city but for the for the country as a whole and there are other issues that we wish to pursue in China one also being the desire to host the Chinese Antarctica program here in Christchurch we already have relationships with Korea United States and Italy and and of course we host the museum program here in Christchurch as well we are one of five gateway cities to enter to corine the world it's an incredible opportunity of China where to choose Christ Church as its base for the program so that's another reason to sister city visits to other countries as you know purely you know sort of relational but actually the trip to China is much more than that it's more than the relationship but if anyone understands China relationships are the basis for all business arrangements and the other relation relationships of the basis for the level of trust and and also the capacity for building on what we already have so I feel very strongly that we must continue with that with that visit but to make a significant reduction and the and the program will still enable us to get the best possible benefit for our city at the same time as as having a good foundation for reorienting our sister city visits so that they are actually connected to significant anniversaries and that makes a big impact I've just received a report on we know all our anniversary dates are and it does actually mean that there's only one other anniversary data and the three-year term so it just gives us a real opportunity to push things out into a much more measured way of approaching having to hear your words around China because you guys done considered it is there the economic lays the golden egg I suppose and at the stone it's terribly important I just want to know just for my understanding when I vote on this what implication is that going to have one you know the reduction of seventy thousand dollars to our relationship with China and also to other strategic partners probably like Seattle as a key one with lights of gublin us as an innovation leader or potential to be an innovation leader tangibly what difference will it make is probably showing the Duncan isn't here but yeah I well I mean yeah Duncan Duncan is probably regretting the fact that he's not here at the moment as well but the point is that I think that I don't believe that it will make a difference in terms of those relationships so I've actually got the the Seattle day so I think 2016 as the as that time frame so it can be pushed out to beyond our term in office and I think sister city relationship that actually has falls within this term in terms of a particular anniversary as the 20th anniversary with Tsonga poo song pegu and in Korea and that is next year and the the 40th anniversary of Christchurch England which is on door such as people know as next year as well but I'm as people are aware I'm being funded to speak at a conference next week in London by the World Bank I've been invited to address a conference on understanding risk and building urban resilient and so I use that opportunity to jump on a train and go to Dorset so actually the city will get a very cheap sister city visit out of out of those arrangements that will just simply be the cost of the train fear the and I arranged the sister city visits so it's friday and saturday and the door sir the christchurch city are in fact funding accommodation for the night so yeah I think that we should also think about opportunities to add and sister city visits to other opportunities such as that but reasonably so I will be writing to all of the sister city committees to because sister city committees are volunteers there you know local people who've got relationships with these sister cities and and I think that there will be an opportunity to to reinforce how important those sister city relationship SAR and to organize for a new policy yeah Yanni yeah I think we need real clarity about which budget this is actually coming out of so I I can't see I know on page 70 of our annual plan is this coming out of the silicon international relations budget which has got a proposed increase of 88,000 so I just think we need to be really clear because I don't want this coming off the sister sees operational grounds I think it does come out of the Civic and international relations mural visits or whatever other budget that they've got but it's not a reduction to the Sister Cities grants it's actually changed to another budget as I understand it but we need clarity on that object can u dine yep the of which I'm twelve and a half is for inbound and twelve and a half for outbound and presumably flux I'm not quite sure maybe relationships but 86 is from the International Relations grants closest so certainly the 70 at the moment was intended to take from the 86 if there's no treble then it would be possible for the budget to be reallocated between those lines running so on page 17 of the draft in your plan is that a reduction to the silicon international relations budget by 70,000 this is is that what we're doing it's actually not the Sister Cities grants at all sorry can we can we get that clarified and we'll just carry on what's that what's that that's going to say my understanding is this is the operational budget for the Sister Cities committees that we're producing it's not the Internet cool relations fathom yeah that's a change yes questions well Google here at the moment with their Google loon project and they want a reception so there are opportunities yeah exactly a range about the partners who are working with Google as well or another range of other organizations yep I agree absolutely essential can yes I've checked is with me coming from that line yeah so is this the correct phrase Sister Cities grants one year reduction yes what if so yes that doesn't that doesn't make sense with what we've got here which is it's a civic imagination relations budget it's been page 68 provides quite a clarity around so I think it's better to take it off that wider ground so that you have the discretion about where you can save their money rather than justice it say it's a sister city grants which can get the impression that you're cutting the operational funding which I don't think is the intent of what you've spoken to well the total travel is 25,000 so if you wish to cut 70 and cut some from what I believe is travel the balance would have to come from the grants 70 yep well I won't be supporting that I that the sister city committee is would have made submissions a fitting on that their funding was going to be cut and I don't think it's fair to cut funding without having a conversation with them about where we might be able to save costs even that is an 88,000 proposed increase in our three year plan I would have thought the more responsible thing to do would be to say that we don't wish to have an increase the valley 8,000 to our three year plan with what we have currently budgeted and we you know hold it level it was for the previous yet sorry I'm just um I'm not sure what the question was yeah I think that I've kind of misunderstood what the what the whole of the funding reduction would mean can we can we take that offline and get some more information and we'll move on to the next one will come back to it so the who would like to move that we cease the publication Glen Livingston Jamie Gogh Lynn did you want to speak is the kind of trouble I think our ratepayers would like to sing and you can see as part of the equation this does actually have a significant effect so it's all these things heading up Jamie look we're well aware and extremely cognizant there's illustrated here that we're trying absolute darkness to try and cut our cloth accordingly we will know that not a lot of people are actually enamored with local government goodness only knows why but but for someone who sits around this table who actually is really interested in at a young age Dara so I've actually never read this publication my life and I'm one of these strange people that loves local government so I I do one day actually who is ready and the other thing I look at is we've got a heck of a lot of local businesses and I see the Java Council and they will then get on with what they do this give them a bit of business let Liam employ people so I think there's people out there too far and it's perhaps our role to liaise with them and help them build a bit of publication build those relationships there than trying to be because I've said a lot of time be the be-all end-all of everything inside Council so here let's get this one off the books yeah I'm I'm perfectly happy to see this as a recommendation I think that people were looking to us for quality information information not spurn not not the good news not the glossy nothing like they're what they want from us as factual information winners this happening why is it happening how much is it costing and what are we going to get by way of benefit and they want us to play a leadership role in terms of combining commute communication sources so that information gets out to people in a timely manner and they can trust it so that it's not rah rah we're doing this we're doing that with you know fix this number of pipes were done that that people want to know when are they going to sorted when are they going to see their streets mended when are they going to be able to live the lives that they want to be living instead of loving you know the nightmare that is the reality for too many of our people so I'm really happy to see this go from our budget and I think that we need to focus our attention on giving people the information they need when they need it and how they need it not thus David as a substitute could we Institute a page on air oh yeah Jana there is no question that we can put this information that's contained in here out in fact there are many people who already put this information out but it is focused on on achievements you know what has been achieved instead of giving people that information they really need which is one of the things that aren't being done going to be done all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that's carried and
I refuse collection and disposal costs would someone like to move that we conduct a localized trial and more efficient collection of refuse during the 2014 time scandrett seconded David East is there any discussion on that Pauline I just asked a question about it does it actually mean looking at reducing the the service or what does it actually mean well does this came up as a result of a submission from one of the submitters who identified that in 10 years the cost of collecting our refuse had gone from four percent of our budget to ten percent of our budget now that is a significant increase of the allocation of our rates and come to this operation a requirement it's part of our core business but in terms of the percentage of our budget being allocated to it that's gone from four percent to ten percent and rough tombs now there is a significant increase and so the recommendation that I'm making to council is that we actually because one of the recommendations that that staff put to us before the annual planning process buns I can't remember the green buns right so so to reduce the that the weekly to fortnightly and at that stage we weren't we weren't keen to go down that track without some knowledge of the impact that that would have and also what benefits would actually accrue because sometimes you can say well that will reduce the costs by you know half but actually it may not because there may be contractual arrangements there may be all sorts of other things and we thought that it would well I personally thought that it would be a better idea as a result of the submission that came that said have a good look at this let's look at that that's drillin to all of the you know what's behind such a massive increase in the proportion of raids and it may be that you know in a post earthquake environment is there was a lot more rubbish that was being collected and that wasn't as efficient in terms of the return that we were getting on you know sort of recycling and reasons behind it but let's let's see if we can invite a community to be part of a localized trial to see if we can get the optimum solution for the city and I think that that's a much better way of rather than just simply saying let's cut the amount of the service and save money let's work with a local community there is willing to work with the council to see what the most efficient collection of refuse would be that would actually have a financial impact on the city as a whole in terms of its budget but would also produce a better result so that's the reason for a localized trial and two more efficient click that's great but I wonder if we should be actually calling for a full report on the whole refuse collection in the first place to sort of try and identify where those costs are they in the reed burn or the yellow burn or the green burn for a start and I'm all for localizing specially green waste I mean I think for green stuff but I'm just wondering if this is we need a report before we move into a localized trial yeah no I think that's that that sense of all so if we have counsel asked and return East were acceptable we will it is recommended that counsel ask for a request a full report on well the yeah yeah that well it's the gear that just yeah a full report on on the on the costs of well-known the most efficient way of the most efficient and effective delivery of refuse collection services I think and end is part of that authorized the conducting of an localized trial I think we also need data on the historical collection you know no no but it may have changed that I mean if we request a full report on the most efficient effective delivery of refuse collection services as part of that we'll be looking back but also looking forward so as we do their ear as we do need to break down between those buns which the costs in the I mean you might have a month I don't look do yeah or even want CB two months or you know where's the cost yeah did honest we do this yeah I'm happy yep so I thought I think that's a very useful addition if they have counsel scandrett and east of the fine with that all right I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and the last one is headed the stadium trust but it isn't actually about the stadium trust it's actually about the stadium so if we could take that we're trust off there and would someone like to move this phil clearwater seconded Glenn Livingston and Yanni would you like to UM the consumer him about this motion as it actually there's no action and I think given that a large number of the submission submitters talked about the need to do something differently around the spending on the central city projects I'm just really unclear what this is actually doing so I I think we need the needs to be sets out what processes for us to be making these decisions in considering the community feedback so is it something given what you've seen around the July thirty-first in the public process we will go through that we could amend us to note that as part of the council's consideration of its financial strategy we will be going through a public consultative procedure over the prioritization of spending on anchor projects and center asleep projects I'd rather not do it that way um but because it's like I mean I'm just really mindful that the season I know it's I know what you're saying relax we spending money I know what he's saying but we've entered into an agreement with central government around some of these issues and I would rather I the reason I wanted this included was to be in a position publicly to note that in reflect on the fact that we receive significant community feedback on the stadium rebuild and Central City issues it is that is really to put it clearly on our agenda that that and that is to feed into the work that we're doing in terms of our financial strategy and the long-term plan so I don't I don't mind adding in a phrase to say that this this needs to be reflected on our consideration of our financial strategy so that we're looking at what we have to do for ourselves as a city going forward but not to step over the line into something where we have an agreement because if you have an agreement with somebody you either honor it or renegotiate it or breach it but I'm not in a position to do either of those two alternatives and at the moment we're obliged to honor that contract so I would rather that and and I did want it on our agenda so that we were very clear that the community had fed back to us the priority is here not the stadium rebuilt and there are central city issues that seem to have taken priority and we want you to thank out into our communities that's the feedback we had on to feed that back into the next step but I don't want to take the next step yet and I can't soon then becomes as when do we take the next step and given that we've had requests I'm going to sit all of us out on the thirty-first of July right so okay so that could easily be reflected in there to say that it will note significant commercial read back and on the road agian to the three-year plan because I think we're starting to get into the realms of changing the three year plan yeah and kitten three year plan does say that the council acknowledges acknowledges that are assigned a binding agreement on funding the rebuild with the government and this has been committed to and cannot be changed and less agreed by those parties yet so this is the opportunity for us I would have thought based on public submissions when we asked people how should we be spending our money to say or actually we agree that things like the stadium should be a lower priority yeah we push cost year have been unilaterally changed repeatedly so the Metro school facility for a cup Johnny I'm in charge yani the pointers is that the that statement that was just read out is an hour three year plan so we have a binding agreement with central government can you read it out again Peter so it's your page 50 of the volume 1 the council acknowledges that it has signed a binding agreement on funding a rebuild with the government and this has been committed to and cannot be changed bracket and lease agreed by the parties in bracket so so we we've had significant community feedback on the stadium rebuilt and I do think that the public discussion at the moment around the children's playground for example indicates that the public don't have a very clear understanding of the nature of the decision making so I think that noting significant community feedback on the stadium rebuild and Central City issues to help inform our consideration of the long-term plan or the our financial strategy I would actually prefer to think of it as part good thing yeah Paul actually the statement you've got up there she answered what actually opens up two conversations one on the conversation on the the proposed stadium and a conversation on the current temporary stadium so I think it's a yeah it's a good note so it fell I think it highlights the fact that people are concerned about the stadium we've got a lot of submissions about that we're very conscious of the position of our current temporary Stadium and how that is all part of our city to including though the whole issue does need to be addressed so just that temporary Stadium the stadium trust can we put a timeframe for report coming back on that so that it's really clear that we're actually actively pursuing the opportunities what what concerns me is we've got really time critical dates that unless we make a decision lose the opportunity to defer the new stadium because the temporary one will be passed its its useful life yeah I'm happy with it so I think that we probably need a Stadium oh no what's it called the stadium trust submission by the end of august I would prefer August knowing what what else is happening in terms of financial strategy everything landing on 30 of 31 july I think that allows it time for proper consideration but it does mean that if you've got it earlier than that you can bring up board as long as it's with us by later than the end of ya to the full council by the end of july I but by the end of august we also want to understand x veo the setting trust financial position as well in obviously they are sort of Mount of money and have done so for quiet consult amount of time so as part of this report we need to have some engagement with the salient trust on their financial situation I'll ensure the report covers all unless all aspects of it all right the longer we lever the more cost it's being incurred because the seats are currently leased yeah we it's rude we understand that issue but it that all right I'll put that recommendation all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried so now we move on to the the new schedule and what do we need to stop for it morning tea if you want to yeah haha he's morning tea outside so holla June now before we go on to the next set of changes of time to get them up on the screen and so if we can be back here in 10 minutes thank you
And the next one is the is the contested one so would someone like to move that we further investigate alternative service provision of this facility Thomas Kendra second to fill clear water and see some discussion Jana Johansson ask a question about how realistic these savings are that we're expecting to get and whether actually effort I support looking at trying to make this rates neutral I think we all would but I can't see any reason why that couldn't be one of the options so so I just wanted to be clear as is that part of the consideration because what we heard from the submission was people saying we think if council promoted it more we think of council did some things differently we could actually probably run it as a cost neutral then you and I just wanted to know with it in terms of booking at alternative service provision that's one of the options that can be included in the criteria and making the recommendation to to the council yeah that when people made submissions on this they made it quite the fact that it ran on the sort of kind of good employer and it ran on the you know fully qualified you know registered staff and as I understand it there has there was a change in government policy a few years ago so instead of continuing that moved to a hundred percent qualified staff it's now down to I think it's about eighty percent but I can't recall off the top of my head so there was a there was a serious tip set of arrangements across a 10-year period I believe where it that that the intention was to get to a hundred percent qualified staff the the community-based sector have committed to that but the private sector if have committed to it where it's where it you know where they make the decision to do so but legally they're not required to move there so I believe that that it would be our responsibility to set the criteria based on what the feedback was in terms of in terms of the people who use the center this is the last one of running early learning centers that's not our function it was our function when there weren't very many when and that's why they were originally attached to council facilities this is a good location for an early learning center but is by no means the only one in that area anymore and and that bet to me is where we have to make the separation between what we've done because we had a reason for doing it in the past and actually ask ourselves is this the function for the council now and into the future and I don't believe that people don't have access to early learning centers and Christchurch anymore that requires the council to kind of lead the way in fact we've opted out of it so no I don't I believe that this is actually asked us to investigate alternative service provision of this facility so we don't want to close it down we want somebody else to run it and we want to set the criteria around that and it might be a hundred percent trained most important thing to the family families that presented to us so in terms of a report coming back which I presume this generates what time frame and how realistic given that you've obviously got some costs associated with a change of service provision is it that we save a hundred thousand dollars this year it is the larger that's the loss right so if we if we go down this trick we don't budget for a loss if we don't go down this track we budget for a lot as I understand it so we go into a deficit basically if we haven't got an alternative provision or if the cost of changing the service are higher than the forecast loss we still end up with a deficit yes 0 so Peter do you want to take us through that because that's dealt with on that above page as well so the the budget currently is break even it doesn't traditionally breakeven it usually runs at a loss so budget budget impact of retaining you would see as zero but to actually in performance perhaps along the SPX said councillor your internets mentioned so what we've assumed and that's later down an appendix if is that we are either outsourcing so there's no budget impact or if it's not been out sourced that we make the savings to avoid the hundred-thousand-dollar loss that's traditional it's about like the corporate expenses that we've had with the restructuring so when you when you change something there's a change costs associated to it and that's really what I'm trying to understand so if efforts I mean I presume you can't just shut something down without any cost there has to be a cost associated I'm not going to shut it down there isn't one of the options go well actually I'm supporting the recommendation particularly because I guess the cost which is like a subsidy you know it has to it really be addressed especially on an ongoing basis and and I have in terms of criteria being set by the council it's really clear that those criteria can potentially able to run this too and to me that seemed to be a good compromise I understand whether the people who made the submissions were coming from very clearly but I think it has to be workable and affordable for ratepayers as well okay and this is not the only one that we're actually subsidizing there are in fact if you look at tomorrow's grants applications there are nine other preschools that we still pay the rent which is intriguing given the massive change in early childhood and early learning centers and their funding from the Ministry of Education over the last 10 years so the Ministry of Education currently has I think ninety-seven percent of christ church preschool children or ninety-five percent in early learning centers with the target of 98% and we still have nine or including this one ten where we either pay the rent or actually put a major subsidy in which is a kind of unusual given the dramatic change in in the sector that there has been the sector is actually funded okay by the Ministry of Education not a statement I this one is and I'm not sure why we still have these ten select areas where we pay the rent or a subsidy on them so I think it's not just this one but there are nine others that we need to address as well yeah the history though is that the council used to the council owns the land where they're located and their community facilities that community run so they don't have the same access to the private sector resources I'm not sure I totally understand why they were there 15 years ago put post them there 14 years you know that's change I really wouldn't want this to be confused with yep the grants and the grants I think that would have to be well signaled for a change because a community organization can't yeah yeah yeahs question I really had it was around the time prohm for this coming back to us because what I've heard countless says they want to have a wider conversation about the whole philosophy behind council being involved in early learning centers through the LTP because you could actually make the same argument about gems as well so we're actually funding jumps through this plan but actually the private sector will happily fund gems and recreation centers and likewise swimming pools so can I just be clear about a time frame for this coming back to us in terms of options so I'm that this is going to come back to our Susannah as a council any decision so that would be during the course of this year but it's subject to formal consultation as well but in terms of establishing the criteria that would have to be a report to us in the first instance and presumably that would involve some discussion what the local community that uses the facility yep so can you can you can we indicate a time frame I'd probably need to refer that to to change yeah but that would require some community engagement food so I would actually suggest that it come back to full council because as a annual plan decision going forward well you'd want to allow sufficient the next two months I salute timber by the end of September's yeah by the end of sep tember yeah yeah okay so a report to council by the end of sep tember but I don't think we need to note that under recommendation so is there any debate around the recommendation just to say I think investigating is fine so obviously when it comes back to council we can make the call if we like the options that have come back we can have that consideration so you know I don't want to be seen as being supportive of outsourcing this necessarily but I think investigating the alternative service provision I'm happy for us to go and do that okay all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carrying
Yeah yeah okay right so and now so that we've moved and seconded the the recommendations I'm sorry about this but normally speaking we would then suspend standing orders to have a debate around Council ones but I don't know that we have to move on just one each one we can yeah but we can debate them yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah so so but there are there are ones that are an a that are honored they're all pretty much covered in here sorry no so but we're just circulating these oh thank you yeah so what I'm going to suggest is that we go through a first because that a has all of the recommendations that that come through I mean that might that might be the easiest thing to do well except some of them have been changed to so the flooding r emotions we've reviewed the amount of the flooding r emotions no that's that's would reduce the capital cost on that so I'm just wondering whether the easiest thing to do is to been amended so the flooding remissions budget I mean it's it easy it is to move each one and second each one all right so let's start off with the flooding remissions budget but we have to be aware that I'm actually recommending that we change this so in any appendix a it states that it's recommended that the council approve a further point eleven percent increase and rates to cover the cost of flooding emotions and we want to amend that to read approve a further point zero six percent increase and rates to cover the flooding remissions estimated at 200,000 and the reason for the change met I think that might be point 05 the difference between the 360 in the 200 but if we if we work through and approve a under Appendix A and then we subsequently go down the list of appendix f and take the reduction then we'll work it through as the total at the end oh god I think it will be okay to approve that the flooding remission and then amend it makes absolutely well I reviewed and light of the numbers of people who are now anticipated to qualify so it has been reviewed but would someone like to move that we approve the rates increase to cover the cost of flooding emotions Eddie Jones seconded by Phil Clearwater is there any debate on that I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried but someone like to move that we extend the opening times of temples and pool by one week here's the key but Jimmy chin I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye are as opposed they know that's carried would someone like to move that the council include additional money in the capital program for an extension to the tram route as pure option 1 a and further investigate and consult on the later stages of the tram pull lonsdale moved seconded by Jamie Golf is there any discussion on that one you need to bait I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried it's the okay I'm assuming there Andrew tuna would like to move the head to head walkway recommendation seconded by Phil Clearwater is there any debate on that would you like to speak to their thank you yeah the head-to-head walkways is and I'll keep this very very brief very important to lyttelton harbour communities and we hope to the whole city as a recovery project and a recreational project certainly the benefit to harbor communities in terms of recreational activity and in terms of economic development is going to be significant and whilst the amount that's in the budget here isn't as great as the amount that was in the original three year plan I certainly welcome the reinstatement of this amount in the budget it allows us to get on with the job and to actually start implementing some of the planning work which has already been done and allows us to plan for the next stage of the project as well so this one has been a long time in making and I'm absolutely delighted to see the work of staff and and the starts to come to fruition in this next financial year so I don't cancel is to support this one thank you very much I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the parameter work more choir suspect that Andrew tuna would like to move that one as well and seconded by Tim scandrett would you like to address the promise of walk where as well um do so my comments on heads ahead in many ways this again is a project which has been in train for some time there was an article appeared in the press not too long ago perimeter walkway has no signs the tracks are largely in place this one in in many ways is a recreational project just waiting to happen with multiple benefits and there's a clear link between the perimeter walkway and the head to head so these two projects together in terms of creating some relatively easily achieved but some very valuable recreation projects for the whole city certainly up there I'll put the motion all those in favor'm assuming that councillor care water would like to move the cycleways recommendation seconded by pooling kada would you like to well the HD I'd quite like to say a couple of words on this because and its really to follow on from comments that cancel your hands and made before in a way I'm actually glad that the cycleway program rephrasing for completion within eight years rather than the five years I'm glad it was an annual plan because it really focused all of the public attention on the fact that the people of Christchurch want our city to be a cycle friendly City and they really want us to achieve these cycleways within the five year time frame but the annual plan is not the right place to be doing this because it was never a financial consideration it was a question of capacity the amount of consultation that has to be done around the various routes the you know the work that needs to be reflected across the council programme of work in order to achieve it but we need to set the says have told us they've said this has to be done and it has to be done within the top five year time frame and I think that we've had a very clear steer so this sits appropriately and the long-term plan and I'm very pleased that this to be able to make this recommendation to the council Phil Clearwater hello I also strongly support pulling the time back to five years and we're hoping that that is achievable was clearly like it this recommendation is subject to that technical feasibility as I've repeatedly said but the benefits of getting the cycleways underway and they're underway now being built as we speak huge like we know that the major problem for our city is congestion on the roads we know that if you have options available people more people are likely to to choose other options like walking and cycling and it has to be safe so these will be brought safely there'll be a terrific addition to in terms of our city infrastructure ceiling yani johansson can ice get some clarity on the the next five years but being reflected making a long-term plan decision today it's not something we can do so I think it needs to be considered as part of the draft long-term play but I don't think we can put it into the Jeff I mean I don't think we can put up the long-term plan today we haven't_''_641.11 I mean we've been told repeatedly that we cannot do that so it's just a note to self really since this will need to be reflected budget well in order to be achieved and in the dryer yeah no no it will need to be reflecting the long-term plan if it's going to happen I mean it just it is not a change to the long-term plan it's a statement it's a note to self this will also need to be reflected I think in that and viewer the number of submissions which were well based it wasn't like that deal was a template type submissions at all and we just need to do this in support that's fine for the Metro sports for a number of other projects yeah but I thought we can t it's not changing the long-term plan it's just saying this will also need to be reflected at there's nothing wrong it's a note to self okay I'm so I'm really happy to support support this I think I mean I wouldn't love to have done it over three years and I actually think in terms of seeing a stretch target that should be feasible with the amount of money that we're spending on horizontal infrastructure at the moment I did have a question about whether we've really thought through the best mechanisms to deliver our cycleway program and whether we should be thinking about using the district plan review as a way of designating roads that would have cycleways on them so I just think this is something that people feel really strongly about and I think it's incredibly important that we do try and get these sucka ways and as soon as possible so I hope that earlier amendment which we haven may be ways in which we can work with skirt to actually achieve this this program in a cooker time frame as well very supportive very good I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried the akaroa museum and cancel tuna seconded council your hence then is there any discussion I'll speak to this one briefly if I may this supports the amazing work that the staff and volunteers at the acura museum are doing they've got a facility there or we've got a facility there which is only partially open due to earthquake damage in a context of increased visitor numbers to occur or because of the the cruise ships of course that are going in there in the summer seasons this change brings the admission charges for the a Corot museum into line with the canterbury museum the relatively small cost of removing the admission charge also removes the barrier to entry so that more people are able to be welcomed truly into the acura museum and it's noted that it's highly likely that the end up producing more income than the admission charge itself so urgent Ansel is to support jana johansson yeah thank you um the cobra museum is also part of our facilities rebuild and it has been damaged so we've been charging people to go into a damaged facility and I just want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the Minister for culture and heritage Chris friendless on who they have the government have put together a contribution of 500,000 towards fixing the echo amuse iam and I do want to acknowledge publicly and thank the government for making that contribution so I think the sexy aligns really well with that that we've got a facility that's going to be repaired and open to a larger number of people and we're waiving the entrance fee and the point that and remade I think is really important actually we know the canterbury museum through work that's been done around entrance charges have shown that actually it's much better to have free entry and charge for special exhibitions and enable people to acquire merchandise so I actually neutral but close to it and I think it's a really sensible way to go we know that people were going to the museum and then not going in the front door off the cruise ships and the increase in tourists that we had in a Corral so I just think if we again investing in facilities to have them open we need to make them as accessible as possible and I think this is a really significant way of doing that no age because I went on the same visit with councillors tuner and your hand certain and we had a pretty powerful case put to us by the by the staff there who do do a sterling job on our behalf and that the fact that people you know would come off the cruise ships and for the sake of an entry fee I'm sure that put a donation a coin into the into the box you know a donation box well positioned you know it does attract pretty much the same sort of money so I don't feel that there's any sort of keeping it on so I'm very pleased with this one I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you who would like to move the recommendation on volunteers cost of travel Pauline Cotter seconded Andrew tuna I would like to speak to this but because I was just so embarrassed when the volunteers center came to the council to make their submission to say that they'd received advice that volunteer reimbursements including travel to and from the volunteers place of volunteering was not able to be considered in a request for a grant under our strengthening communities and of anything that we wanted to do to strengthen communities was to resource volunteers to give freely of your time then I would have thought that this would have been up so I did kind of indicate to them last week when they had their volunteer recognition awards that I would be seeking to address that and this year's budget although she has annual plan I certainly couldn't indicate how the council would vote on it but had to remedy so I'm hoping that this does get supported does anyone else want to speak to us Pauline like to reiterate that the the amount of volunteer hours that are contributed to the running of our city if you equate that to financial dollars its massive and to reimburse some of the travel costs which is often bus fees there's a small price to pay for the benefit that we receive so clean up were supportive Tim the spray and healthier community bullet-head their community awards last night and it's amazing to see the very the variations of volunteers in the community and are really the soul and backbone of our communities and hold them together and our wonderful it's great to see that this organization is showing the depth of respect we here for these groups and individuals and our communities by supporting this so thank you ok I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that's carried recreation center hours who would like to move that Vicky buck second David East anyone like majority of the submissions that were heard on on this aspect were centered around the number of people that wanted to actually access these facilities before they went to work I'm sure that will sit comfortably with our new chief executive as well so for that reason I really think this is a very smart move it does appear that there are a huge number of people that access these facilities in the early morning period now particularly before they're going to work so very happy to supporters could I just a internet I thought that the number of people who went swimming or to the gym at five thirty in the morning was astonishing actually I don't quite get it but I completely understand that people need to do that and what came through incredibly strongly was the urgent need for additional recreation facilities in the city yeah so what we have we have to leave open as long as possible just so that as many people as possible can can get can get access to recreation it came through as such a strong point of I do manage to get the unwilling um the diverse age group from young to old as absolutely amazing and that's something that kind of I don't think such young ones would be there so early in the morning but it's time that's when they train so that's absolutely essential yeah I'm Ali thank you I can't remember what a gym looks like yeah I endorse what Vicky was saying to and I just wanted to also remind everyone the recent results from that's all right campaign and survey which made it very clear that what a number of people are still or are doing in Christchurch you are still under stress as a result of eq c or insurance or house rebuilt or what have you is there basically without something too flippant letting themselves go and doing the sorts of things that they perhaps were doing before an exercise and which is a very important part of relieving stress so I totally endorse keeping keeping it open and also I noted in the submissions were a number of whether who husbands whoever were at home at that time with the children allowing being the time to go to the facility so I thought that that was particularly significant to yeah Andrew thank you um this also speaks to the point that some counselor Johansson made in relation to the library's a little while ago we we've invested significant amounts of money in many cases in these facilities and it makes sense to have them open for as many hours as we can the strength of the submissions around this point was certainly notable I know there are at least three of us around this table that our early morning gym users 5am 530am start and and I know the value that that routine puts into my day and and and certainly the strength of the submissions suggests that for other people as well so yeah great that we're able to support this one today clean was it an indication you wanted a talk or just a me too don't go there we're not going to talk about mammals either which a middle-aged men in lycra all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that's carried the next recommendation around instructing staff to work with various trusts around the acura water supply lean assuming canceled tuna seconded Tim scandrett is there any comment that you'd like to make on that in addition to the protection of the acura water supply the the purchase of this land or the potential purchase of this land brings recreational and ecological and strong environmental benefits as well it's at knowledge through conversations with staff but there's more work needs to be done in this area but I certainly welcome discussions and considerations around the long-term plan so that we can consider locking this one in that time son okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried
Just move on to the on to the recommended annual plan actually in its probably lunch number I just need to duck out to sign a document at lunchtime at twelve-thirty or 1245 yeah I will go to have engaged in any way I've paid a couple of requests to sort of kind of schedule the lunch break so maybe if I should you the edge of the lunch break for 12 to one so okay yep so that covers everyone I've got a one o'clock appointment that I now changed to 1230 so that's okay no no but I think gleans gotta come up man so I'll rule in favor of Glin on this occasion and the lunch break will be from 12 to 1 thank you right so if we could just well egg geodis I just wanted to make a couple of quick points just to kind of reflect on where we got to yesterday there's obviously been a lot of hard work going behind the scenes we had a working lunch yesterday where we work through a number of the very carefully at what is in them what are some terms of their annual plan I think very much yesterday was focused on how we got to where we got to and this is an inheritance document we our starting point as the three-year plan and obviously it's the second year in that three-year plan and you know we are restricted in terms of what we can and can't_''_105.42 do with respect to what we went out and consulted on and where we are today and of course we've had events occur during that period of time which we have not been in a position to absorb the cost of but I also want us today to reflect on looking forward because this is as I say it's a part of a process that has come to us as a new council and where we go from here on and after we set the annual plan today we are then in a position to lift our eyes up and over and forward into the future and I want us to be in a position to really what the true financial situation of the city councillors what the parameters are that have been imposed but also what the solutions are and I think people are looking to us for the solutions and I'm very much looking forward to the opportunity to putting all of those on the table and the dates that we are going to do that is the 31st of July and that is the date that we will release the Cameron partners report because we will be able to look to all of the options that certain front of us and that will be a very good foundation for a for a public conversation because it is not just a simple matter of going out with a plan and consulting and calling for submissions having a few hearings and then coming to a situation like this I want us to be out there in our communities having a very deep and meaningful conversation about what the city's future is a vision for the city a vision for us in terms of our future but also a vision for a financially competent in the hard choices that we've had to face in the past that does mean that we have to make hard decisions and I'm not going to resolve from that I think it's what we have been elected to do so the 31st of July that will be our line in the sand and it will be our opportunity to go out and really talk openly and honestly about what the options are without any fear that anything is hidden from view that it is all our there and all of the options are on the table so I think counselors for all of the hard work that they put in yesterday I know that it was reported as a stop-and-start occasion but I know that how hard people worked behind the scenes and I think it did make for a very good day and it has set us up for a good conversation this morning again people have worked very hard over night to be looking through some of the detail around some of the options and if I could invite Peter gods or our chief financial us to be in a position to to go through some of the proposals that have been worked on but I also want to to move and have seconded a recommendation but given that that hopefully will get to a position where we can amend that recommendation I don't really want to do it straight away so we might we might actually get that resolution on the table at morning tea time so if I could also just acknowledge that I've received a last-minute amendment and from one of the counselors with respect to the stadium trust requests for funding for their seats and I want to refer that particular resolution not not not to accept that resolution we agreed that the resolutions would be unbiased will be in by Monday to refer it to the chief financial officer to meet with the stadium trust and to work through all of the issues that have been raised in the public arena obviously yesterday in relation to our relationship with the trust but also to come back where they proposed that would that you know that that would be endowment fund so that the council itself could consider what that position would be so if people are generally happy with that course of action I'll just refer it to the chief financial officer to follow that course of action thank you and and so now we are going to circulate hey oh okay sorry no um so um I'm now going to ask for some assistance Peter and you haven't_''_438.27 been through this process before as I haven't been through this process before but I'm thinking that perhaps if we could go through the options that have been worked on overnight then that would give us a starting position so that I can get the resolution that I move in line with the recommendations that the council is prepared to make yep it's a couple of minutes with Peter mentioned to figure out the process oh okay okay well I'll just adjourn the meeting for five minutes just everyone take a quick break thank you y'all have a long bleep
And could I have staff back at the into the table please sorry we have some more questions and some more issues that we want to go through so and in part what we want to address and we don't want to get onto my motion yet so I'll come back to that in a minute I just wanted to perhaps do a bit of a run over I mean obviously a number of us have been discussing about what we can and can't_''_33.57 do with respect to the annual plan and we have a number of amendments that counselors have forwarded and I think that certainly when I had a good look through them there are some questions around some of them so I want to go through all of the amendments this afternoon to make sure that we've got all of the information that we need in order to make good decisions when we get to that tomorrow so and I perhaps I just wanted to reflect a little again on the the reason that we're in the position that we run and so this is year two of a three-year plan and the although this is called an annual plan in fact it's just an amendment to the middle year of the three-year plan that that's really what we're doing here today so our capacity is as somewhat constrained because we're not starting with a blank sheet we're starting with the three-year plan that as I said earlier was basically developed under the pressure of time as against the pressure of time that matched the cost share agreement and so the cost year agreement was supposed to be ready in April it wasn't ready till June it was signed in June and this three-year plan was also signed off and June to strike the rate for the first of July so you know I know that I'm you know speaking to the converted here when I explained the situation that we're but I think it is really important that people understand the process that we're going through at the beginning of this year every single one of the counselors was committed to retaining that was set and their annual plan and the three-year plan that was the commitment that we made that was what we were seeking to achieve and that was 6.5 percent on average increase across the city so and when we when we did that we had certainly pushback on a number of proposals but we actually hadn't allowed a number of proposals to come through into the draft annual plan because they weren't necessary to stay within the 6.5 and I know that myself very strongly and others around the table would have pushed for more changes to go into the draft annual plan if we had known that we would reach our capacity and our capacity would be exceeded because of a storm that nobody could have predicted and at the end of the day I think that's one of the inheritances and something that we will get away with get away from sorry and the future is absolutely the need for this council to set aside sufficient resources to weather any storm and I choose those words absolutely deliberately we have got to be both financially and economically and socially as a city so I think it's fundamental that we get this right that being the case we have we've also really found ourselves stretched to the nth degree because of the impact of the loss of accreditation and the dysfunction of our building consent Authority and that as as being addressed and it is costing a lot of money but it is appropriate we continue down that path so we went out to the public with a draft and your plan that would have promoted more savings of those savings had been necessary to stay within the next six point five percent the trouble that we face now is that we can't make changes to those proposals without where they would affect people without going out in public and consulting and that's appropriate if you're going to make changes to your three-year plan you really do need to consult with those that are affected so we're looking internally within the organization we're looking at some of our own budgets to look at whether we can somehow overnight and any small amount of difference will make a difference and I think people will see that we are attempting to to deal with this responsibly but I do want to re-emphasize the fact that this is the transition year this is the stick from where we were with the previous three year plan to the long-term plan and that will be our responsibility as a council and I'm not walking away from responsibility that we have inherited but it is inherited it's the legacy of the arrangements that were entered into last time and we can commit as a new council to writing a long-term plan that will make a difference to the city and build that resilience into the financial framework that the city absolutely needs so on that note I want to go through each of the proposed amendments so if they could be brought up and I'll just invite each councillor just to raise just in a quick couple of minutes the point that was that was wanting to be raised in the amendments and and then I want them and then might such as and whether they would be accepted as a as an amendment tomorrow or whether they will be deferred to another process so a day in the same order yeah from the start yep oh okay so um councillor Jones First Amendment swimming pool and community center an age where thank you the transitional facility in each we're at the moments been very useful but it is transitional and I think that in itself suggests that it's time to move on and get something more permanent the pool was unceremoniously destroyed in the darkness of dawn in 2006 or some of you may recall closed at the end of the 2006 ES and it was one of the most used most popular and community run out outdoor pools in the city so edge we needs its pull back they needed it back before the quakes and they need it back even more now ironically there's a huge amount of water and sand albans we'd quite like it in a pool with a community center around it so that we can actually help people deal the recent all right survey has shown that people are letting their health and well-being go because of the stresses and thus part of shirley papanui has been hit pretty hard a number of times in recent years so I think this is an extremely important thing but I do feel it's probably better a place within the long-term plan process so I'm suggesting that we we do that yeah no I think that that's appropriate for their Thank You councillor chin yeah this this is related to a temporary work in service center in Holmby area as you are aware the long-term plan in the three year plan has been secured for 30 million dollars for building a new service center with library home the area to replace the shot on the soccer field service center due to the earthquake our 2011 februari but regarding to new home based service center the site in which Beijing has been taken for a 20 month since September 2012 so up to now has yet to pre send it to the victim week when Hannibal in the council original the schedule wavy series so the week when other Western Association and the temperate and resident Association plans for individual and repairs have makes a mission during the draft a new plan on behalf the wider the humble area the repair in y de jambe area including the hum bhi hai hai room via instant interpreted suck when Tara man we can sky assay to tolerate a no service center walk-in service center for three and a half years para got into the schedule probably will be complete in 2009 22 2019 to 2020 so they were thoroughly for another five to six years so we softer to list a problem papi to upgrade the current the temporary service center is the best way as you are well current service center located in a home builder with your shop but no walk in the service center so no stuff in there can other answer all repay equations and also know basic function nagato registration sh 0 so how to strengthen I think that's most important it also Lester y de jambe area the repair and the community the neat I'm going to propose that I refer it to the chief executive to work with you and council about to find a solution for the interim period I don't think it is required to be in a minute or their annual plan okay okay thank you and do I think you're the next one as well yeah feasibility study for the Southwest sports and recreation aquatic center okay thank you mayor yeah because are you are where base almost always the area plan the southwest area pen a jewelry southwest area is the most faster worcester area and also after earthquake the population growth in the area the younger estimation of the pre the earthquake in 2009 to 2019 the long temperate has been secured the southwest area sports in the recreation aquatic center in two thousand fourteen to seventeen for three years in the 22 million dollars however last year the last attempt council the staff presented to the council people they got the information the information was specula the at the end of two thousand eleven mentioned all the claws of the southwest the area year three year plan laid before no stock budget tonian million dollars in 2017 the other 20 million dollars deferred to 2022 2022 million dollars so this time the temporal reznor association victim whitman communipaw in the week when the rest of association they particular you know to express concern in the mex emission in the draft the annual plan so that I polite arrested is the issue whether the council can take the feasibility study for the southwest of sports recreation are critics and center facility in this area to meet the people's the urgent needs I'm thank you with that one I'm just thinking that it might be a better one 2d fear at this stage not deal with in the annual plan but to have the question of a feasibility study come forward to the council I mean it doesn't because it's not in the annual plan doesn't mean that we don't have the opportunity to review their request is that acceptable yep so the next one is the hour Tara brute upgrade tita and in the and a new a weed in there however the start the deferred the least two thousand fourteen to fifteen to the 2015-2016 but this was submitted by the victim we can come near Paul and also the our host will rest Association they're strongly against to tee further one year that would like to remain in 2014 2 2015 the camp tonight can I interrupt and ask a question what impact on rates would debt our tear root upgrade have rights perhaps somewhere around 15,000 rate impact there's a fifteen thousand dollars yes be transferring the capex into an equivalent operational expense that would impact on right somewhere on that their friend okay so well I will I'll accept that one as an amendment and we will debate that tomorrow okay so your window lean forward I will all accept it as an amendment yes so you move the amendment tomorrow okay okay and you can debate it tomorrow so you have to okay thank you the next one is flood protection Kirk road again counselor Chen has been very busy writing the area because one of the community no under lease the issue actually happened for many many years in a temple area for the Templeton Restaurant Association and also victim we can come near port they engage mr. stopped a large in a counselor csr system for many years however now know any the progress so this white this time the clicks on we're going home depot in the temple and resident Association they raised this issue again because a moment looked like a city why have a kind of the flood an imitation mr. issue they would lie to you know always them together to fix this problem so that one I would propose that we refer to the chief executive to refer to the land drainage recovery program so and and and you'll report back to us yep thank you and councillor gen Ewell last one as seeking facilities for youth and homes well yes okay last one is regarding to our house where the wider community they would like to seek in the kind of facility for use in the house where area because the host worker community they consider in concern you most a faster growth population area and a new subdivision spraying over in everywhere hoster demo graphic a certificate changing especially pilot fuel a teenager with the user you know come to move to the Vista area with their parents so also a resident Association they have made a submission now popular Petula 2007 up to now has been the seven years but never the heifer fulfill never response from the council so this time the highlight of this issue again other staff response the particular comment or facility for use are being considered as part of a serious problem in the area but that also a resident Association days late response they broader this issue to council attention in 2007 which pointed a we call a council was considered facility for use in host where they have seen no progress since 2007 so wonder how much longer the considering will be taken so this data Patil concerned so late home in an email to me and also agree me so I will light on their behalf to raise this issue to the council any of them eating
Just bringing their ginger up and perhaps if I could invite our chief financial officer to the table and perhaps Ian Thompson as well because solicitor he will be addressing some of some of the issues and I just thought that I would just give a little brief overview of of the position where we are up to at the moment and then I'll hand over to to Peter God's all to take us forward from there and I thought it was worthwhile reminding people that under the new section 41 a of the local government act 2002 there is a requirement of the role of the mere to provide leadership to the other members of the territorial authority but also to the people in the district of the territorial Authority and without limiting their role in terms of leadership in any way to lead the development of the territorial authorities plans including the long-term plan and the annual plan policies and budgets for consideration by the members of the territory authority so that is why the amendments are the proposals are recommendations are in my name it are the reason that we're in the position that we're in at the moment considering an annual plan and a what feels like a bit of a hiatus want one between the establishment of the three-year plan by the previous council and our beginning a long-term planning process is because is because the government appropriately intervened and the long-term planning process that had been established by the previous council and substituted a three-year plan so we are in year two of a three-year plan and in many respects that was always understood that that three-year plan would enable the council to get to a position where it would be able to re-enter a long-term planning cycle and I have a copy of the regulatory impact statement that the government prepared at the time that it went through and it did make the point that at the time they felt that proceeding with the long-term plan at that time the council would not be in a position to prepare a robust reliable and accountable long-term plan that covers a ten year time frame with the level of detail required uncertainty and financial pressure and Christchurch as a result of the earthquakes so this was written last year and in many respects it was a precursor to the signing off of the cost sharing agreement which this document assumed would be done sooner than literally at the eleventh hour before the council of the day had to strike a rate and so for the three year plan the striking of the rape was had to be completed by the 30th of June as it does this time round and they were essentially up against the wall because it had to cater for the provisions of the cost sharing agreement and as I understand it there wasn't room to accept amendments that in any way conflicted with the provisions of the cost sharing agreement as the as the as the budget as the plane was actually taken through the council so it was a extremely difficult time last year and the concerns that had been raised about the ten-year plan actually actually resonate quite true a lack of robust information could create business risks for the private sector communities and financial planning purposes this couldn't turn affect the level of investment into the rebuild and confidence and the recovery
I very much doubt there's going to have much of an implication for the annual plan if any and we're happy to provide it yeah I I thought I'd mentioned the cycleway program too because I got asked the question about that this morning although I mean we've been very clear that the pushing out to eight years was had nothing to do with the finances had everything to do with capacity and so what this has now become as a stretch target so in the long term planning process we are going to have to find within within the council the capacity to deliver the cycleway program within five years that was very much a desire of the of the public who submitted on it and it wasn't and I think that this is a great opportunity to to sort of really do push up push a target and to achieve it so that's going to require the long-term plane to really for us to focus on the long-term plan and making sure that we deliver on that full so I agree with we've got recommendation on it we come to there but clearly that the achievement of that will be subject to the technical feasibility of us yeah but we have to make it happen that's what a stretch targets for absolutely this as a can-do council we came to write again I'm going back to win the agreement was around during the three-year plan we were noted that there would be schedules for indicative capital programs that were longer than three years of paranormal council building business facilities rebuild in cycle West program so I think having a schedule of the cycle waste program and the changes order would be really important as with the facilities as well and this ties on again to that DC's thing so having those two schedules would be really good yeah I think that a lot of this is going to be focused on the long-term pain and it's just it is not an ideal situation that we find ourselves in but it is the situation that it is and we have to address what we have in front of there any other questions for staff and so yep pulling a small clarification on page 12 with the heat look where the perimeter will play as the heat to heat walkways also the banks peninsula walkway are you suggesting substituting 50k from the perimeter better than the banks for lunch line set the hint here I'm just not sure but confused but my understanding is that the heat to heat is just bringing forward and the activity from 15 16 to 14 15 so it's not substituted for anything I've ever done then if substitute 50,000 neck to the perimeter from banks peninsula walkway this is the exponential different than the heat to heat then I'm not sure they're okay so it was the 50k being substituted from banks potential was that the total set aside or was that just reducing an allocation by 50 the perimeter walkways being language this amount of resided and things to give it a kick start okay thank you just have one hit my name please get the one-point-two percent one point two seven percent forecast operating deficit in does that split is that mostly can is can it mostly be attributed to the consenting costs than one point that's there's actually a very difficult question because the operating deficit at the end as is the remainder after all of your operating expenditure and operating revenues so we see the the building control area being reset has been 10 ml over budget however we've found significant savings within the year of around nine million as a rough order of thumb within subsequently here subvention payments come in 1.3 la and we've had the flooding costs of 2.8 mil which happened past februari so you and also within that is there's all the other revenue and expenditure as well so I couldn't pin it on any particular item the way the year has flowed through it's been the impact of the of the flooding the emergency response is required there and thus invention payments that have captured us at the end of the year but it's the whole mix that that's created the operating deficit what was the split between CI about sitting here when we wind out with the annual plan but we didn't know about CI al so what was the what was the split between them I'm silly clear well don't have the figures I know City care was around 20 million but I don't have the other figures I'm sorry but really as I said look we did know about said he could carry early in the year we didn't know about the airport until after we'd sit what percentage was CI al I have to go and and look at the numbers and bring them back to you a lot smaller than city care so okay so maybe we should have budgeted for that rather the staff you soon as I said we've changed our process so that we don't get caught in that position for next year right yani I did ask this question prior to the meeting yesterday but when we come back it would be good to have it and that was we've got a lot of money on for facilities rebuild in just wanted to understand if that amount has changed at all and a list of what facilities if any that we've got programmed under that is it possible to get that information when we come back after lunch and can you explain further what you mean by the abilities of episode project project ID tooth to 2089 his facilities rebuild expenditure of 21 million and 13 14 37 million for this year 1415 and 38.7 4 15 16 and I just wanted to understand as that money's still on track has it changed and do we have most of any facilities under that that we funded I can I can try great thank you yeah okay can I also clarify associate sorry associated with it the basement infrastructure abatement fund is that all assumed I appreciate its just borrowing with a different map take is there all assumed to be speak in the coming capital year in the coming year it doesn't matter if you don't know the answer now but after lunch would be helpful well we'll check thanks that's a very good questions that you've been fielding around what are essentially capital expenses I notice on page 98 of the draft plan you've got a 2.25 million cost of borrowing in there that obviously was current at the time the draft plan was put out clearly there are capital expenses which being deferred hook back brought forward all the time and there were some questions that will be answered this afternoon around there are there any changes as a result of any capital deferrals to that cost of borrowing that we should be taking into account as well no change really to the cost of borrowing because we had put hedging and which is when you go out and lock in an interest rate in advance we had done that some and we've always done that for some for some years so any change from deferrals would possibly be more towards what what approach it would cost to replace rather than the cost of funding there any other I am Andrew um so if a capital project that we expected to deliver in the draft budget in the next that would be funds that we weren't spending in 1415 year that we had expected to spend which would potentially reduce the borrowing requirements which in turn would reduce the amount of interest payable on that all right yes is what is where I'm coming from so that that must then make a change to our operational outgoings on to our outgoings for the cost of borrowing over that period which in tune with that effect that is so but what we what we do is part of the budget process is we actually budget for quite a large carry forward at the end of the year which is based on actual observation of what's been delivered in past years so the plan might say here's what it is but from a budgeting point of view of determining the interest and the interest expense we make some assumptions there regarding how much we think we'll actually be delivered the year that will be caught out as the year when the capital program people deliver everything they say they're going to do is that ever to the draft a new plan the staff are original to defer some of the capital project from the original 2014 to 15 to the two thousand fifteen and sixteen however we went to a public consultation and the community has a different view and through our submission my question is is there any financial impact if lost our project because of the 41 year if we we kind of use the building and fracture the beta man fan we go ahead just consider progress we need to power head to power in this fan from the item effect then next year can the kind of offset to the current year so is there any financial impact so I think the financial impact depends upon whether it's prioritization of spin that was already assumed in budget and I will go back to the Premier bucks question around the betterment fund I'm usage profile so we'll come back on there and so whether it's reprioritization or whether it's additional to the profile it will have an impact if it's additional to profile it will have questions alright well thank you very much for being on the receiving end of it and I will adjourn the meeting until two o'clock this afternoon thank you
So your question is for the service syndrome hornby with a 4.6 with a 4.6 million and 13 for Dean's been carried forward to 14 15 okay yes the answer is yes to but the 2014-15 they still have a five point of four million dollars if a cue minute together almost 10 million dollars however I know the pathways that behind the schedule whether how much the particle you were put into the the next year 2014 years and the 15 they're asking whether it's added together to BTS Ian and for a minion or whether it's push the area for this is a point for the answer will depend on on project managers assessment of how long it will take to complete the project so if he believes it can be completed in this 1415 year the budget will all be there to meet it a moment not yet not know this information not yet well it's part of what is done here in once we've worked out what has been finished for the year the projects are moved forward and brought um thank you for the mirror for giving us a really comprehensive overview and understanding of how we got into a three year plan process I note that one of the resolutions was that you know obviously the cost shield should be done by April end of april 2013 and it wasn't given the concern that people have had in our community over the our financial position as it inversus that this plan will be audited and if not what would be to stop us from getting it audited the and your plan will be your solution in your plan has been partially audited in preparation for the long-term plan not not before complete order that you would normally expect but as part of the long-term plan and as part of auditing the annual report auditors have looked at aspects of the annual plan if we got the auditors opinion or advice well normally we would have it's kind of an annual plan a letter from the auditor that would say we've auditor that laser that concerns all this is the clean you can or the long order for the long term plan which will be up forgive forgive me for not knowing but that I'm just I'm assuming that the audit is done prior to the long term plan going out for public consultation so we'll be we'll be sending all of our records to the auditors and this and this coming financial year and that obviously they'll have to report to us before Christmas if we're going to include it in a public consultation or shortly after Christmas it doesn't so much get a certificate like the annual report does but part of the process is they do report back so they'll come back to the risk and Audit Committee on their findings and as I said the court in preparation for that the course of the flow-on effect of an annual plane into a long-term plan they have had a look at aspects of this year's and your plan the one we're discussing here so should we ask them to report to rust and all I don't think I don't think there not all of it and they can I just defer to Peter on there there was a brief report wasn't there that we've seen yeah right and so that goes out with the public consultation yeah so that the reason that I mentioned this is that because I I've just feel that we sort of caught between a rock and a hard place we're in year two of a three-year plan that really never intended to have a third year would that be a fair assumption that is that is correct but each year when you're doing a long-term plan that's the beginning of the goose to you that's your annual plan for the first year of the long-term plans right and the second year would be the equivalent of the second year the third year never becomes anything either it gets merged into the first year of the following long-term plan so in each long-term plan although it's a 10-year plan it's only over the first two years that are actually plans for functioning right is that what I was get no independent audit of the three of famous I ever well we didn't have but I think that your counsel did the previous councils don't actually asked for a it wasn't a full audit and we did receive their yeah around the financial strategy so I just wondered does that get updated as we go through and not as a normal course of events and I would be reluctant to add the additional cost of an order to a process which will be fully guided by the audit provisions as we go into the long-term plan I really want people to get the idea that this is just you know it is just a stepping stone to where we really need to be which is the long-term planning process which is why I don't buy the argument of building the one-point-two percent into the and to the base rate because if we do that we don't we take the pressure off in terms of the organization find the savings that we need phone I just find it really hard for people because we've there's no detail in here over we were spending the most amount of money in the next year and I think it's two years so it's really hard for people to know how they can influence that but I just want to come back to the statement on camera we knew your idea went out it had all of the epic yuddam it heat up hope I don't have the cost shared and have the Inca projects that didn't have the indicative nine-year capital program it didn't have them it's that this is an annual plan yani we're trapped between a three year plan and a long airplane so I think it's a bit unfair to sort of kind of say that we haven't given people you know what we couldn't possibly give them it's not possible in a one-year plan situation all of this will be out in the public arena for a very comprehensive discussion about how we recommend as a council how we get to the that lieutenant the long-term plan datos when we are big debates but I I appreciate that but there's a window there's a 12 month window we're made 3 184 million is going to be spent that the community have made submissions to us during this process over where they think it should be spent of what they think it shouldn't be spent on that we we don't seem to have any ability to make changes and I'd say it's right we don't have the ability to make changes unilateral changes to the cost share agreement so can I just take that off the table because we're not going to have that discussion here and now there is there are things that we can change there are things that we can't change and that's one of the things that we can't see straight entrust the submission we heard from the stadium trust where they wanted I think it was about 4 million to extend the temporary life of the stadium that currently exists Y of staff not recommended that we contribute coming to that okay and first I will be auditing our year as it finishes they'll do comprehensive back on the year that's been to make sure that was fine make it financially rivers so that's the normal critique you have from a normal body as how are you going with your previous year rather than looking forward also they very distinctly have a clear line of reporting and directly through to the audit rescue management committee so we are held to account very clearly by them as you'd expect with regard to the stadium trust from memory it was two million dollars they were requesting for the purchase of temporary seats the rationale behind not necessarily wanting to support that some factors came into play such as it's not our stadium or our choice around delay the benefit of delayed is not a crew to council also additionally there is contention around monies owed from the stadium trust they they still have a number of payments that they need to make to us that is not yet been cleared up so those factors came into consideration around it's not our we need to sort out payment from from them to us before we would go any further those were the factors that came into play around their decision or recommendation and we've got 250 million on budget so I think it goes back to the cost share arrangement and the unilateral ability to and change the stadium timing okay um the second question walls we had a quite a detailed submission in terms of fees and charges that hasn't been picked up it was the Burnside Rugby Club I think over the sports fields and I just wondered why this it sounded pretty straightforward request it was really probably less of a semantic level around the charges of organized team activities for Simmons and it was quite high and I just wondered why we hadn't kept it in there or whether we could cast after we look at there there's no there's no reflection and hear about that I assume that you've got an amendment to cover their so Jamie um okay or can I just enough kind of sauce another person in over for information how much would it cost to restore the library have we had information around that restoring the library hours what they currently are okay yes we've had a quick look at that it appears to be around ninety four thousand dollars which is around your three percent of rates from point zero three percent and you're about thank you in terms of the Civic building that the problem I'm having is trying to understand why the Civic building can open for an extra half now or without any cost but the libraries can't can't open it's apparently the report spells that out and says they've just readjusted staff hours and consultation with the staff so could we people were in the building from seven o'clock in the morning every day I know Jamie Thanks morning and this is just really a matter of matter of process for the items have been soaking throughout the annual plan concert to rebuild or repair better than before I guess and a commercial setting you'll be having your capex in your annual budget this it would seem that this place for that would be from the fund that's been set up for betterment for exactly at purpose does that need to be signaled throughout this annual plan process would you simply deal with it when there arose and then take that from the betterment fund or does it actually need to be articulated in this annual plan when we sign it off my opinion on that is it something that can be done and should be done outside of the annual plan there's more of a prioritization call an examination of the of the way in which that fun can and should be spent in is a number of of calls on that at the moment yeah great things better out of the number of submissions this year compared to normal number of submissions on annual planes can I invite Peter Ryan to talk to that point I know he's got those details at his fingertips so when was the last time that it was the slow 446 motion that you are you're saying is this is a low number of them seem to be generated off the train so so if the Train submissions hadn't been received then we could have we could have even been down as low as 300 I think that's quite interesting in terms of either the public's I don't know sense of exhaustion with with them put but I also think that they heard our message about keeping the rates at 6.5 so I still feel that we haven't quite quite quite got there are there any other questions these are the questions all right so what I'm yep Phil I just wondered it's not be a financial question per se it was really it's in relation to the Pioneer Learning Center and just that system it's clarification was the Greek the recommendation is that the investigation for an alternative provider and I'm assuming that where it says to be based on criteria set by council and effect we could include community groups in that including the parents who are currently involved yeah well I mean I sort of can possibly speak to by parents involved in the Pioneer early learning center and their concerns seem to be around the provision of trained staff so I know that in the community sector and as the faced with ours it's one hundred percent you know teacher change staff and early learning center and and in the community sector that is not necessarily the case in the private sector and I think that was the idea behind it was that we would actually seek the criteria by which we would consider alternative service provision of this facility so it wasn't closing it down it was still the idea of alternative service provision so somebody else to run it but we would set the criteria and if your question is would we set those criteria in conjunction with the with the families that use that see this absolutely yeah yani I'm just in regards to that that that seem to have staff worked with those parents they had a number of immediate suggestions around thinks that promotion marketing Council reducing its corporate overheads I in a position given that it'll take time to see how that how you could actually maximize the efficiency there because there was some very tangible examples that they gave you know they talked about marketing promotion things that we could do in a short term is that is even working with them around those solutions I don't have the answer to that but I would assume that we would always be looking for best practice in an environment but they wanted some I mean I guess some certainty as to whether we were going to proceed down this track and we have obligations under the Employment Relations Act as well so we have to you know go through a proper process to do this I mean just the final question from mayor's around that the indicative capital works program my understanding is that we see that program because we attract DC's so we charge DC's and we're introducing reintroducing them this year which is really good I still don't quite understand why they got taken out last year but can we get a copy of do we have an under gloom DC's on that's been amended based on submissions and changes and new information as you know I'm council Johansson that the status of our capital program past the three-year plan is as a working model more of an indication because it's a non-approved capital program hasn't been through the process whereby council has approved it we do obviously have to work off a long term model at manage financial strategy borrowing funding etc so it it should be able to be done however it's not necessarily something that's predicated on development contributions development contributions would be one aspect and there and it's probably more it probably is more of a charade of loop or as opposed to a input one way or the other well I'm really trying to understand us but there's actually a benefit to us if we put things in there a year play now because our DC's policy now includes the ability to charge for things that swing all well I think libraries community infrastructure so actually we need to know what so things and certain time they may not be attracting the dcs that we would wish to attract and so the just the dc's policy is based on a nine-year forward capital program which is I think pretty fundamental to us knowing what we're charging DC's on and I think the community would want to know us as well the developers Sydney would want to know what they're being charged for and can I suggest I forward onto a mighty long for the DC policy because that will be contained within that capital program so is that is that required for the annual planned sign of them so because like things have changed and you know it holds a library as moved to a different year so so it's pretty important to know what that indicative programmers at some stage and I would have thought the ability for us if we wanted to bring projects forward or move them out it's quite critical to the money that we get to the assumptions we need to know what assumptions have been made for charging DC's on on
Though that there are some properties that are currently classified as rural and our ward and as such paying those rates that in fact are to be revisited and to be looked at as residential sorry they're being charged residential but and I don't see that referred to in minutes that's just standard process and policy to make sure that it's not a nasty angeles is simply a title change and this the city care and CI al lower results so what was the budgeted budgeted receipts in and their actual and can I invite up all three met amir I'm diane brandish it and Bruce mo the I don't at the before and after amounts that the difference is around 1.3 million or point for one percent in terms of the rate of impact and what what were the original estimates based on or the original budget based on and what what changed the budgets were based on the feeders that we had received from each of the individual companies and be aware of the issues at City care suffered right on your also made the decision to make less profit available because it's how much they make available under the submission credit basis that that impacts on us so they made the decision because of their result to make less available to the rest of the group for profit sharing well it's a question around that commercial entities generally look for a seven to fourteen percent return on their investment and it seems to me we're getting out of the three percent return on our investment so I just like that know why we get such a low return from our investments that you know we've got a considerable money tied up and see CHL and our ccos so sort of comment around it please hmm I don't feel particularly qualified to comment on that point like that's more a comment or a question for see CHL yeah I don't know that it's relevant to this I mean I think it's relevant to how we got to the situation of a budgeted amount and then how we got to you know beyond februari _:_179.08 februari when we were doing our in that they you know that they were going to provide least then they then they advised us they would provide I mean it I can't understand how we get to feed Barry when we go out for public consultation that's what I want to understand is why we go out for public consultation we made it a requirement that we stick to the six point five percent that was in the three-year plan and then all of these other reasons suddenly occur and I have to say that what we've recommended what I've recommended out of the submissions you know it's like point zero two percent so it isn't that isn't though you know meeting the requests of the general public of Christchurch have you know sort of suddenly waked it on the rest of the the rating bill it's it's it's these reasons and I want to draw unto them and understand why they wouldn't notify us earlier and why we weren't alert to it we certainly were aware of of the airport until we finalize the decisions which is in March normally we would use other we would look for other savings within the total budget to offset the city care loss and profit but because we had already applied all of those towards the additional 10 million of the crown managers costs we were left in a position where there was nothing further no further savings that we could find within existing budgets to offset those things yeah the dying different simple terms if we're sitting it's a the rates that we wanted to sit at a certain level and our entities with the city here at airport etcetera they aware of that and they are commercial entities and they tell us that they are looking at a certain return for the year and then during that time they change their minds and make a commercial decision that will affect the end result what city ki adalat cetera we have no say in that so and they really give us a heads up we don't we don't have any sane is it is their them for the plan going forward is we have taken a lesser figure than what the companies had estimated that they will make so perhaps our last year one city care was totally unforeseen but we could have and should have taken a lesser figure than what the entities had indicated they were going to do and this is what we've done for the plan going forward but what we didn't do it for the year just finished yeah with regards to moving in the future would it be better to have it why what do we print have a better link with those entities so they know that we are relying on a certain level of return to control the rights well I think they do know that but I mean as you'd appreciate things happen between remember we get these figures before the 30th of June often things happen between when they give them to us and when they and when they do I mean I think your point is valid and as I said oh I think already we have come to that decision havoc fell thank you can I just ask you about the one point two seven percent being ring-fenced because I've got some concerns about sort of future flood defence and also say on ongoing costs of region which we might have to do in the future so if that one point seven percent sorry 1.27 was to continue rather than being ring ring fenced and could just tell me what sort of advantages you would see their say from a cumulative perspective of covering future costs it really is a balance of revenue versus expenditure so the 1.27 is seen is covering off the just over four million dollar operating deficit if you wanted to continue with that then you'd have the opportunity for further expenditure within budget but the the call at this point is it's a one-off as to fund the deficit and that's all it's there to do so as with any any rates increase if you look to have it continuing and continue into the future would have our further expenditure and the areas you wish to speak to them so applied for for things like and disaster defense the choices around though the way in which the expenditure is allocated as completing up to council tab it just on page 15 can you just give us a bit more of an explanation as to why the tram proposal and the head-to-head work way there is a lesser rates impact then the tram for example is a change of 1.6 nine million but yet there's only a thirty six thousand dollar impact on rates that's effectively because its capital that's being used for those works as opposed to operational expenditure so you don't have you you fund their capital through your capital or ammonia and you paid back over time so the the weighting of capital versus op X on your rating is quite different see operational expenditure items such as you're flooding remissions you can see as a lot less than the trend proposal capital works but has a substantially higher rate impact because it all hits we all pick sets immediately okay it also an amp all just on the trim with an expense to if you use the tramlines does that cost increase weather with an increased route there is a percentage of passenger and non passenger revenue that's payable so the extent that greater passengers and more passenger revenue is created from a larger loop there will be some payback to counsel from it however I would also say that it's not going to cover off the costs of the capital expenditure Johnny if one of the Justin at a high level we had a number of submissions quite a few that talked about the anchor projects the infrastructure rebuild in our three year plan and in your report this there's very little this there's no tables of their changes to the anchor projects which I presume would have changes to funding indeed what what we've had from the start of this crisis which has got chronic I you know this is the table that we got when we did the draft there's quite a lot of expenditure in 13 14 and 14 15 but a lot of that hasn't actually been expended so I like the stadium and here where the staff recommendation doesn't well the mural recommendation doesn't really seem to reflect it concerns people who have made so that you take the stadium one of the submitters said if you pay four million you could defer it for 10 years but that's not captured in here can you just maybe give us an understanding of where we're at in terms of the big projects that people cop you know wanted to comment on and what live up detail we can get to understand what it means our current financial situation because I mean I can go through like every bit just to give you another example the Metro sports facility we're expected to spend 16 point three million this year so by by the end of the week and we're supposed to spend 80 million dollars next year yet we know that that project is now being delayed to the final quarter of 2017 I believe and it was initially supposed to be in the first quarter of 2016 so if we save interest for a facility you know small one in a local neighborhood but we don't have that information so how can we get that information the approach taken on the annual plan is very much as described being the bridge between the three year plan through to the long-term plan so a number of these anchor projects have a longer tail then captured within the the annual plan the in your plan looks at the capital expenditure required in the borrowing and funding to to achieve that and from from memory the the capital expenditure within the annual plan is not significantly different now I think Diane you have a particular comment on on one of them all the SS in terms of the 80 million I can't see where that is and this draft annual plan that's being spent next year all right it doesn't show in there the when we publish the final annual plan we will have the the capital program so you will be able to see but we have already reflected the changes that were indicated by mr. Bromley so that's where there to reflect what he has said but we are set information for us so that we can respond to the submitters we do a lot of decision of councils the decision of the government and we've simply reflected it in our plan well this doesn't this doesn't feel right but there's nothing in the staff report the talks about the changes to our capital program based on the changes that government of unilaterally made around the cost year and it seems a really critical piece of information that I community need to actually and we as elect members need to have because of projects we put out for another year that's money that is a saving to us and it responds to the public submissions but at the moment there's just no visibility of what the souk the current situation is and this is money I mean if we're not spending 80 million dollars next year you know I want to know what's happened to that money in fact without further the mummies are part of the earthquake rebuild and it's real saving to ratepayers they are not embed that those projects do not impact on ratepayers to the extent that the amount and the plan was budgeted that is borrowing but that foot tends to fall towards the end it didn't fall within the annual plan year a lot of what was scheduled in the annual plan you as either initial investigation or was work that would have been funded and was budgeted to be founded from insurance recoveries this is very challenging because I mean for a number of us we're very new to this this is the first time we've SAT around the table to discuss an annual plane and this doesn't feel like a a normal process to me in any way shape or form us I just not have central government operates I've just call it back to most of these issues are around capital expenditure that's being delayed and that's around the long term Glennon pets yeah doesn't really have an impact on the annual but there were capital works and the three-year plan but they're alterations isn't any shifting of the time frame and association with government decisions has simply been factored in but it makes no impact on the on the rates because it was never that part of us never intended to be funded by rates it was intended to be funded by insurance receipts that we would have liked to have had by now that's absolutely right and as far as the general and capital program goes you'll be aware that we are carrying forward a large carry forward figure from this year which has flown through to next year the impact of that is that we take whatever was at the end of the year and move it to the year forward so in total the capital program the dollars are unchanged the projects that make it up maybe and they were reflected in the draft when we said this will be delayed this will be deferred so we've reflected that and once we get to the end of the year and understand where we finished for the capital program you we will reflect that in the but it's if the dollars don't change its content that changes for a normal a normal business yeah what I can't understand is we're spending 500 million five hundred million in the neat and the three year plan on these projects so so 150 1,000,000 was supposed to have been spin by the end of this week basically by the end of june yeah 3 117 million or so what Diane saying is just that that would have been funded by insurance receipts Oliver is money in there that will not be funded through insurance and given that we haven't got our insurance oh I actually think we need to know what the implications are this is if you read the submissions they there are many solutions that say defer these projects until you can afford it which I have a lot of sympathy for but what we don't have is any table showing either the ability for us to move things out a year to save money we just seemed that what client's just see is that it makes impact on the spending 80 million dollars now without the insurance proceeds on a project and you're borrowing for it Hester hasn't have an impact on your rates you cannot just find 80 million out of thin air and spend on a project I do think this is a long-term plan discussion not an annual plan discussion I can't_''_1045.47 say any more than it has no impact on the annual plan the table that we got when we did the draft was really good and I really appreciate the fact that staff and presented it to us I think this table just needs to be updated so that we can you know by tomorrow understand where these projects are now forward it's really we can easily get their table updated can't we yeah okay thank you Vicky hi there for the coming year the year that's under debate on the budget is there any project capital works that won't now get spent in that cat current year because of the government delaying some of those projects or for example the delay was the metra speech center the budget it's been moved out a year is it is that what you're saying there's nothing in but it was no sense at all yet no I appreciate some capital m but there's nothing now that is out of alignment with the government's current fad their current time table for those anchor projects we've moved towards with the government's latest title table they get the one that just came out recently okay thanks dad um Jimmy two questions first one on page 20 in the middle part your particular mention the new host where library service center of an appropriate not in the 2014-15 financial year so the almost kind of customer service labor service will be adjusting it means focus on the Oak X in Iraq or mean the apex I just wanted is automatically deferred to the following year oh it effectively is just meaning that levels of service around open house community contact and possible adjusting those levels of service because it won't be able thank you John front of me false librarian citizen okay second second questions in the crash endure because a three-year plane are in the pond leader a new service center with a library the we secure 30 min 13 13 million dollars you know in two thousand thirteen to fourteen have four point six million dollars and next year 14 to 15 have 500 for the million dollars regarding to the 4.6 million dollars because a moment might understand the even the party to secure in there however you know regarding to a progress series behind the schedule because the for example like a state investigation had been taken for the 21 month since the September 2012 up to now have not yet you know report we are coming up or in a council so these four point six million dollars weather is that automatically is carry forward from the 2013-14 tool 2014 250
So early 2014 council prepared its draft annual plan this was distributed for public consultation in April written submissions were received and opportunities given for individuals and organizations to appear before councillors to express views on the annual plan and the result of these processes you set out in their following appendices a an analysis of the written and verbal submissions made in response and this is followed by the mayor's recommendations be a summary of the financial changes to the draft annual plan based on adoption of the news recommendations see a schedule containing the rights information that is required to give effect to the 1415 annual plan D minor changes in eras and a summary of submissions and staff responses but could now get you the tour tune to Appendix A please on page and line she let's go to our page team you can see here the submissions broken down by the number of submissions on each issue the top ten or biggest issues that were submitted on include the recreation and sport services christchurch transport plan the road network so kuwait funding community grants and charges I won't read through the whole list they were the top 10 of 19 or above submitted by topic total number of issues submitted I'm at the bottom of page 11 you can see was 800 run for office and medals if we now move on to page 12 and the summary of the mayor's recommendations so with respect to the annual plan 2014-15 flooding remissions it has recommended that council approval further point 11 see an increase in rates cover the cost of flooding remissions estimated cost is approximately 360,000 Templeton pool it has recommended that council extend the opening time times of the Templeton pool by one week at an operating cost of one thousand dollars tram it has recommended that the council include an extra 1.69 in the capital program for 1415 to enable extensions to the tremor is pure option 1 a and just for those who aren't aware what option 1 a is Oxford Terrace cashelmore high street Manchester Street cathedral square loop further recommendation is that further investigation and consultation occur with regard to implementation and timing of is part of the long-term plan 2015 process 1 B being litchfield Street poplar lane tuam street high street loop and stage 2 being returned loop 2 cpit head-to-head_''_192.079 walkway it has recommended that council bring forward 142,000 4 15 16 to the annual plan year of 1415 to enable completion of the first two sections pony point to navel point in allendale of the governor's Bay as well as funding planning and design of the next section perimeter walkway it has recommended their councils substitute 50,000 in 2014-15 and 15 16 from the bank's dimensional walkway development program to accelerate the perimeter wall play on soco ways it has recommended the council resolved that the cycleway program beery phase for completion within five years with no increase in any plan budget this will also need to be reflected in the long-term plan 2015 echo Rome is in it has recommended that council allow entry to the echo museum free of charge with the addition of a donation box this will incur an impact on revenue of forty thousand dollars which was catered for in the draft plan all costs of voluntary investments including travel to and from the volunteers place of volunteering and Frances from existing budgets Recreation Center ours that has recommended the council retain the existing hours of operation estimated cost twenty thousand dollars a caray water supply that has recommended their council instruct staff to work with New Zealand native forest restoration trust the rod Donald trust and the acharya warrior community board to develop a joint proposal for the purchase of an 190 hectare reserve in a Corral which covers the entire upper catchment of the town and water supply for consideration as part of the next long-term plan pioneer early learning center it has recommended their council further investigate alternative service provision of this facility to be based on criteria set by council and subject to formal consultation with staff as per councils obligations under the Employment Relations Act refuse collection and disposal costs it has recommended the council conduct a localized trial and two more efficient collection of refuse during 2014-15 with a view to implementation in the 2015 long-term plan stadium trust it has recommended the council note the significant issues we turn to page 15 this is the summary of the financial changes based on the mayor's recommendations so Appendix B summaries of rates impact we work through the dollar changes and the rates impact and the rates increase to existing taxpayers so for example council approved changes on flooding remissions changes 360 thousand dollars that fully flows through to a rates impact which leads to a rates increase to existing ratepayers of 0.1 so it's a tabular summation of the verbal that I've just read out to go to index a under the mural recommend changes Templeton Paul you can see zero point zero zero percent doesn't round up to be even point zero one tram proposal because its capital works the rates impact is point zero one percent same with the head-to-head walkway again its capital being brought forward 0% impact on ranks recreation center hours point zero one that leads us at that level to a 6.6 3 rates increase to existing ratepayers when we add on the other changes central city public realm remissions point zero six percent in the 13-14 end up with the recommended final 2014-15 annual plan rates impact of 353 million three hundred and seventy eight thousand two hundred and twenty three dollars or a rate increase to existing ratepayers of 7.96 see if I can take you now to Appendix C this is the rates and information this is what is required to give effect to the 2014-15 plan it's also now explicitly included within the recommendations and any changes from the recommendations or additional changes will require these to be recalculated and reruns of origin family approves the recommendations instructor rates you can see they cover the general rates by capital value the targeted rates by capital value and the rate set by uniform uniform charge or unit church including the uniform annual general charge the waste minimisation targeted rate the active tracker travel targeted rate waterfowl service connection restricted water targeted rate and the loan servicing costs for governance pack the following page breaks down based on the acceptance of mural recommendations how the rates payable moved between 2013-14 actual and 2014 and 15 for a comparison at particular capital values across residential is appendix th-19 and these are minor changes in errors these are generally changes arising from new information that was not available in the draft and your plan machine developed so if I talk through them quickly the first one is the resilient cities network and it's recommended that council adopt the following levels of service and targets as amendments to the draft and your plan for the resilient cities network service they are those as set out the m50 1 15 2012 and 501 3 art gallery and museums the following level of service targets are recommended to be removed from the annual plan on the basis that the art gallery facility will not be open during the 2014-15 you so there are four items for removal and the following level of service targets are recommended to be amended for the annual plan also on the same basis for the Acheron museum it is recommended that the exhibit exhibitions target be amended to allow for projects that take place off-site and a meaning the target no fewer than three exhibitions presented Brennan to no fewer than three exhibitions the following level of service target is recommended to be changed to come in line with agreement with insurers that will all rise building related claims within 10 working days or less note that building related claims may include claims under laguna and the local an act but not the Resource Management Act and those amendment amendment follows customer service counters at civic offices the following level of service targets are in demented to be changed to improve accessibility of our services these changes have taken effect from Monday the 19th of May 2014 customer services counter at Civic offices been open at 8am rather than 830 a.m. closing time remaining the same and regulatory service counters also at 8am rather than 830 with the closing time also remaining at 5 gm noting there are no additional financial costs associated with this change as a can be catered for through reallocation staff hours across the day I'm due to the new hallsville library and service center not only in 2014 15 financial year proposed customer services levels of service will also need to be adjusted events and festivals following relation to the discontinuation of the Alice Lee international flower show icon event is to be changed and those two changes are in the subsequent bullet points serve submissions on libraries recreation and sports center and Early Learning Center submissions have been received from staff potentially affected by the proposals in the draft a new plan for 2014-15 they outline a series of concerns implications of reducing hours or in the case of the Pioneer early learning center exploring the possibility of another agency providing that service these stuff submissions are in line with our commitment to thorough process and it should be noted that unlike submissions from the community they clearly involve employment issues as such council must be aware if the matters raised before making any decisions what at the same time protecting the privacy of the individuals involved in the details of their employment for that reason these submissions have not been made available to the public along with public submissions with noting that the mayor's recommendations do not suggest continuing with the proposed alteration to recreation and sports facilities hours of operation however it is continue for the Pioneer Early Learning Center rating policy part of the financial impact statement recommendation to make two adjustments to the rating policy part of the financial impact statement page 124 of the draft and the plan change the name of the rural bracket Furman and forestry in bracket rates differential to remote rural bracket farming and forestry in bracket change the name of the residential and other properties rates differential to standard rate the objective of this is to clarify the intention of the policy which is to charge a standard rate to all properties not explicitly captured under the business or rules differentials justify the discounted rural differential on the grounds that such properties are generally remote and therefore assume to consume fewer council services and improve ratepayer understanding especially among lifestyle and urban farmers who feel entitled to the discounted rate on the grounds that their land is rural in nature and so reduce time and pressure for coercing to another affected staff these changes have been discussed with Jonathan soldier of Simpson Grierson who has advised that the changes are semantic rather than substantive in process without requiring additional consultation the last to clean full fees and charges fees relating to the clean fool bylaw admitted an error from annual plan fees and charges schedule this clean for licensing by law was passed in 2008 and under the interpretation section for fees it does indicate that the license application fee and license monitoring fee means that the fee set up in Schedule C may be amended by the council from time to time by resolution Schedule C provides the feens giving a license application fee at the time passing of the bylaw of 250 50 plus GST and the licensed monitoring fee at the time of passing the bylaw of 3470 plus GST and web page public notice proposal new feet this proposal arose following the publication of the sale and supply of alcohol Galatians 2013 which were published in New Zealand Gazette from a 21st of November 2013 as a result of the proposal a new website is needed and part of the proposal is the creation for a new fee which would cover the administration of this process opposed fears 85 inclusive of approval and inclusion in the counsel fees and charges schedule so that uncovers feeling much the background the context a summary of the financial changes from the news recommendations the minor errors and changes that are being requested and on that basis of perspective Metal Men thank you so I intend to open it up to questions and I thought that I just begin with a question around the desire to kind of ring fence the rate so when you the rate increase over and above the 6.5 you sit at the end of your report that the Canterbury Earthquake rating order 2012 enables the council to decide for each financial year to reassess rates during the rating year rather than only at the start of the year the reason is to allow rates and Christchurch to reflect a change in capital value as a result of building demolition and subdivision since the Canterbury earthquakes would we be able to use that to remove that additional rate if we were to find an audition arm an alternative source of funding for the for the damage caused by the floods you've got a deficit chords and part but so one point two seven percent increase has recommended on the basis that that was that it couldn't have been predicted at the time it was in relation to the flooding that occurred and March if we were to find an alternative also funding for that would we be able to remove the rate during the course of the year yes some good Paul so if we manage to make our CC HL performed better than returning a lesson or three percent dividend for us we could actually effectively use it and increase to reduce our rates the issue with the rating order is that it gives the council the opportunity to change rates and respect of properties that where the building has been demolished it is been part building with its been subdivision as a result of earthquake repairs and damage and it means that you are able to give you those rates or just those rates in accordance with what is happening on the ground so yes it you can increase your rate if you've got a a on it you can alter your rate to reflect that improvement through the year rather than waiting until the end of the year so that does that change the answer to my question then well the worse you always it's a different question we have the power to remove to end a special charge even if we have to able to find an alternative source of funding for the purpose of the water is together give us the option no no you're able to my question isn't really around the order sort of licked on the order because it was there as a mechanism so at the moment the recommendation is that we put 1.27 as a ring fence special charge an addition to the 6.5 and the other modest increase for those other two things the promotion the question is is there if we could find an alternative source of funding for that not not better performance from CC TOS but say we were funded specifically for the flooding damage that was caused through say a government source of funding civil defense funding if we were off during the course of the year particular its particular properties to which that rate applies and we have the option of either although remember a pretend I didn't mention the rating order because it's a separate question the rating order you're telling me is just around the capital value as a result of building demolition and subdivision so so what you're telling me is that I can't use the rating order for the purpose that I'm asking so I'm leaving that question behind and asking a new question which is if we find an alternative source of funding for the the incurred emergency response and remedial costs to help prevent further flooding in various parts of city if and so we've got an offset of these costs of rates increase appoint eight-six percent and rates remission for four properties affected where people have to move out are we able to take that special charge off if we find an alternative source of funding for during the course of the year here's I'd like to just talk with with Peter an answer I came because I think there might be AI don't want to make sure there are no fish hooks in responding to that question I can't wait yani my understanding is that it would be incredibly difficult for a council to change the basis for ratings in the middle of a rating period so you know I think really the question is can we change the rats level during the course of the year and my initial reaction would be no because we have a whole bunch of people that pay a different installment so one of the things that we're doing today or tomorrow is sitting out the schedule by which people pay so some people will be charged in the first quarter some of each other on the second the third and the fourth yeah and so if you removed it halfway through the year it's in pretty unfair to me on people have paid at the start and the ones yet to pay the whole purpose of setting the rates now is for the a year and the only issue is special charge though and it's not changing the baseline rate that that's the point that I'm making is that if F at a particular point in time it would actually it would actually generate a return to anyone who had paid it if we could find an alternative source of funding that's all it's a shame that yeah anyway yani sorry Glenn Glenn its or 30 intrigued with us just put the order in council is that your understanding that that could actually be applied on mess so my take on it is that provision exists on a case-by-case basis so normally we would not be able to do this until we've reached the in the beginning of a new rating year but my understanding is we can do this as you've said the point of demolition a secret so could we is it your understanding we could apply their order on mess across the whole ratepayer bus no we just if I could refer you to page 20 at the bottom the rate and policy part of the financial impact statement talking understanding is that there are some properties currently classified as rural in our ward actually that will need to be looked at as far as reclassifying as residential now I see your reference to the other way round but I don't actually see reference to the properties that are going to potentially be reclassified in the example I've just given could you respond to that place yes this isn't in any sense around classification changes or checking people's eligibility for particular classifications this is simply clarifying the wording around those classifications so it's not changing any of the rules it's just changing the explanation of the title to make that to make it clearer
3 the requirement for no auditing for the three-year plan prior to public consultation essentially the commitments and signaled in the final document would reflect the outcomes of the cost sharing arrangements between crown and council and that as I say it season the regulatory impact statement these agreements will be in place by april 2013 they weren't in place by april 2013 the cost sharing agreement was signed in june 2013 so the reason that I'm putting this out there is to really explain the pressures the previous council was under to strike a rate to come up with a position up against the the eleventh hour finalization of the cost share agreement which the regulatory impact statement never thought would be so late in the piece so I'm not I'm not making any justifications for the four things that may or may not have been done I'm simply stating the facts upon which we are now faced with a annual plan which is the second year of the three-year plan that was put in place under that degree of pressure there are two off by the council and the rates were struck for this financial year and then over the financial year that we're considering and they are the loss of accreditation and they are the the severe flooding that we experienced earlier on this year and it's interesting because the situation that we were in last year when we lost our accreditation didn't impact on our ability to issue consents and that's because you are required to have accreditation in order to be in order to be registered as a building consent authority but if you lose your accreditation while you are a building consent authority it doesn't deregister you the actin and many respects be regarded as deficient in that regard but we were able to continue to issue consents as a building consent authority next year we have to re-register as a building consent authority if we don't have accreditation we can't re register so actually the 10 million dollars additional unbudgeted expenditure that this budget identifies as something that there is no way that anyone could have planned for or could have up to that's almost like and I hate using the phrase there is no alternative because it has been used in other context before but there is no alternative to this council giving back its accreditation and giving itself reregistered next year when it is legally required to do so so what what the government identified last year was that the three year plan would act as an annual plan for the upcoming fiscal year that was 2013 214 much as a long-term plan constitutes an annual plan and the year of its adoption so we'll be going through this process next year and we're starting that process next month and then the annual plan adopted on jun 2014 will report on the remaining two years of expenditure under the three-year plan we will then rejoin the standard local government act long-term plan process into 2015 so this was all planned for last year and then it says it is expected that the council would be in a better position to produce a financially robust long-term black plan with greater forecasting certainty by 2015 and so that is the in-between year we go on to the long-term plan process and we start that process next month and we work through it we will have a long-term plan out for public consultation probably februari next year and and during that we have to have some serious conversations about what we need to do as a council and as counselors no we also have the responsibility under the local government act to provide leadership around that long term plan and we will be providing that leadership we are going to resolve these problems but we are caught in the middle year with 22 particular pressures on our finances and I think as we are about to hear with this capacity to move then we might have had otherwise so just on that note I think I'll hand over to you Peter and perhaps if you could take us through the process and and I think in your going to provide some advice to us on the role of the act and consultation requirements and counselor amendments thank you thank you madam ear I will pass over to n council procedures will get the fun stuff out of the way first well actually the the mirror has has covered a lot of the information that I think is very valuable for you two to hear in terms of the context in which we're dealing with the annual plan this year my comments are very strictly barebone stuff just to give you an outline of weird how we've gone in terms of the consultation and issues around some of the debates today plus a comment on li the rates setting first of all of you you all know the local government act requires us to prepare an adopt an annual plan for each financial year and we must use the special consultative procedure before adopting the plan and the plan must be adopted before the beginning of the financial year to which it applies the purpose of the plan is to contain the proposed annual budget and funding impact statement for the year is to identify any variation from the financial statements and funding impact statement and our long-term plan which for the purposes of the Christchurch City plan is also to support the three-year plan and providing integrated decision-making and coordination of the council of resources is to contribute to the accountability of the council to the community like that's important and it's also to extend opportunities for participation by the public and decision-making processes relating to the costs and funding of activities undertaken by the council the rates for the financial year must be set by resolution and be in accordance with the relevant provisions of our three year plan and funding unpack statement for the two thousand fourteen and fifteen year and as Sameer has mentioned we we don't have a long-term plan instead of that we have a three year plan covering the years 2013 to 16 and this was made possible by the Canterbury Earthquake local government act christchurch city three-year plan order and council that was made last year and the order states that the three-year plan is not a long-term plan for the purposes of the Act the three-year plan expires on 30 jun 2015 by which time the council must again have adopted a long-term plan and currently starting to develop an inter into for the preparation of that plan and the order also provided that the 2009 19 long-term council community plan expired in june 2013 so the only plan we are working towards currently as the three-year plan now in accordance with the act the council has used a special consultative procedure in relation to its adoption of the annual plan and has complied with the requirements of the local government act those who wanted to do so we're given the opportunity to be heard by councillors and we we tipped all of those boxes in terms of consultation and analysis of the written and verbal submissions made in response to the draft annual plan is attached to the report that you have received along with the mayor's recommendations in a summary of the financial changes to be made to the draft if those recommendations are adopted you may wish to move further amendments to the draft but care should be taken to ensure depending on the significance of those suggested amendments that they do reflect submissions made and are not new matters may be that further staff advice or consultation may be required in order for the council to comply with its decision-making obligations under the Act they may be alternatives to dealing with these matters other than through the annual plan process in terms of rate setting the legal authority for seeding rates is section 23 of the local government rating at 2002 and rates are to be set for the 2014 financial year by resolution in accordance with the relevant provisions of the three-year plan and the funding impact statement in the annual plan the essential requirement is that rates the actual rating mechanisms can only be set if they explicitly provided for and described in the funding and pap statement this means that the rates of proposed will have been the subject of consultation new rating mechanisms cannot simply be created at the time the 2014-15 annual plan is adopted however as referred to in the report that you have additional revenue requirements have been identified by staff and it's recommended that in order to meet these after the rate increase be approved over and above the six sought advice from Jonathan Salter at Simpson grierson on this particular issue and in his opinion there are mandated rating mechanisms for funding the additional requirement firstly a small part of the increase in revenue requirements is generated by the consultative process in other words is the cost of the council responding to submissions it is Simpson Grierson's view that there isn't it's an entirely normal occurrence to be accommodated by adjusting the revenue requirements that the revenue rating mechanism is funding ID by he lets the general rate secondly a larger components of component of the increase relates to the flooding costs that were unanticipated at the time the draft annual plan without for consultation in simpson Grierson's opinion notwithstanding that these expenses were not part of the budget or rates requirement at that time they can legitimately be included now simply on the grounds that it was not possible to include them in the draft plan would be a breach of the counselors prudential financial management obligations to fail to make appropriate provision for them once they are known and thirdly there's been than budget results from a number of our CC tos and it's recommended by staff that the operating deficit be offset by a one-off in is in the general rate that's my contribution at this stage in a nutshell I think it's more over to Peter now to deal with some of the financial okay thank you in what I'd like to do is refer us to the report that we have in front of us starting at page three I intend to go through an overview of the support process and summary of the mayor's recommendations then flow through to the summary of those financial changes the rates information that are required to give effect to striking the rate for 2014 2015 and also cover off some minor changes and errors so if I start as I see it on on page three the purpose of the report and the meeting today is to report on the submissions received in response to the draft 1415 annual plan and to approve the recommendations made by the mere and staff contained in the report I'd summary some of this with with Cavett already so I'll skip over some of the stuff that we have the requirement to repair and adopt is as we know contained in a local government act and in accordance with that act we have used the special consultative procedure and we've included the information you can see there the 1415 annual budget and the funding impact statement variations from the financial statements and that funding impact statement that were included in the three-year plan financial statements and a funding impact statement in accordance with the principles and procedures that apply to the preparation of the financial statements and appropriate references to the three-year plan and which the council's activity for the year ending 30 jun 2015 are covered by the 1415 annual plan so in keeping with the intent of the three-year plan the draft annual plan proposed an overall race increase altitude to existing ratepayers of six point five percent and that includes especially earthquake charge of 1.9 three percent however is already foreshadowed it is worth noting that a number of significant events have occurred since the major items the first has increased costs incurred as a result of the work being done by the crown manager to resolve issues with building consents the building control and rebuild group is forecast to be 10 mil over planned budget it was understood when the draft annual plan was prepared in February that it would be budget shortfalls in this area but these grew over ensuing months in order to offset this budget was removed from councils operational expenditure as savings and efficiencies this was a difficult task for staff to undertake without affecting levels of service and this has served to mitigate the cost to some extent and as you'd expect further savings and efficiencies have been developed for future years as well due to significant rain events the council then incurred emergency response and remedial costs to help prevent further flooding and various parts of the city who offset these costs a rate increase of 0.8 six percent as needed rates remissions for flooded properties lead to a further 0.1 one percent increase in rates which was identified in the May report to Council the of doubt this has no rating impact because there was provision for some flood related work in existing budgets in relation to the draft annual plan some 446 submissions were received and a small number were considered by a council to have sufficient merit to alter the draft and these form lemierre's recommendations in Appendix A the rates increase required to support them is 0.02 percent additional item is the cost sharing arrangement between or agreements are between central government and council which waives rates for land within the frame that will become part of the public realm for example parks this is a rates impact of 0.06 percent and finally as again as we mentioned there's been a shortfall intervention receipts and these are based on the profit results of the council control trading organization in particular city care and CIA l came in with lower results and planned now these are most of these additional financial impacts occurred late in the financial year which is why they weren't in the draft annual plan so it makes it extremely difficult to generate savings within you within despite those extensive savings being made earlier in the year and mitigating some of the overshoot and further savings with an offer number opening on one city to to meet sensors ie balance the budget for the 2014-15 year that means the council must either borrow to fund the deficit increase the general rate we'll use another rating mechanisms such as a target of rape any and is covered bad off already so it is proposed at the operating deficit the offset by a one-off increase in the general rate of one point two seven percent to be known as the Special charged 2014-15 this increase would be for the sole purpose of addressing the operating deficit on a strictly one-off basis it will not compound into future rates if adopted by council this would leave the overall rates increase to existing ratepayers for 1415 at seven point nine six percent and details set out further and appendices B and C finally in terms of background the Canterbury Earthquake rating order 2012 enables the council to decide for each financial year to reassess rates during the rating year rather 6 subtours three of that order the reason is to allow rates in Christchurch to reflect a change in capital value as a result of building demolition and subdivision since the Canterbury earthquakes if I could now turn back to the executive summary on page three
Like to move that we exclude the public for the bounce Nathan Phil Clearwater Paul lonsdale I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried so thank you
Right the next item on the agenda is the Trevor one supporter of council international relations Duncan so I will I will move the the recommendation to have a seconder for it item scandrett so Duncan could could you begin with just a bit of a an overview of the international relations policy adopted last year in relation to timetabling visits to our sister cities and what they what they mean yes ma'am the when a paper came to the previous council requesting authorization for the mayor to visit sister cities the council result at that time to conduct a review on the international relations policy a work council working group was set up which included community participation and over a period of months came up with a recommendation to with a new or revised policy which was result resolution by the previous council in the last council meeting to adopt that policy now one of the key items in that policy was to authorize the mayor and appropriate elected members to travel to visit our sister cities once per triennial term and also directed the Civic and international on in the term admittedly that we are now no longer earlier on the term that earlier on in the term that puts out that the plan over the period so that we can get on and arrange delegations and what have you rather than doing it piecemeal which makes the ability to organize a delegation to go with the mayor on these visits more difficult excellent the people who have questions Phil thank you for the report Duncan I'm just wondering I'm like do you think in your running in your opinion if particularly post earthquake recovery wise if the if the intercity relationships are perhaps more important than before and I guess I'm going back to the amazing assistance that we received as a city at a time of the earthquakes thanks council clear all yes the it's been my experience that it is I guess it's commonly misunderstood in the community what the sister city relationships are about and in response to the earthquakes all our sister cities including some of the further afield ones such as christ church in the UK now that we are sort of through through that phase and in the rebuild phase what we can get from many of our sister cities is actually best practice lessons that they have learnt not necessarily recovering from a disaster situation but an urban regeneration or what have you and of a specific example of that could be in seattle there any other questions Pauline I might seem a silly one but in the recommendation is this would this be compulsory fun to do or is it up to the knees discretion on which trips she partakes of thanks cows O'Connor I think that's actually a very good question and so much as it is discretion by coming to the council now and getting a resolution to approve the mayor and appropriate elected members to travel to these that means that we can go ahead and plan now in the event that it is inconvenient or it it it's considered not necessary we run out of time it doesn't mean that in the last year we've got to fit in leftover visits and have a it is discretionary Yanni can I can I just ask what the rationale is call in 2014 going to visit China I understand you know Adelaide there hasn't been a visit since 2007 and I understand the the UK is being added on to it you know a different event but it's been done at the same time but but given that was just a mural visit select delegation to China last year why is it important to do want to give this here China ously I guess the jewel on the crown of the sister city relationships when it comes to the economic development side of the house where possible we've tried to link visits to anniversaries or significant events and in this case there is a an anniversary with gansu province and we are expecting a citizen's delegation led by the vice governor to come this way heading to China in September one there is a period of time and the mayor's schedule that that we can vote a two-week period to us and our intention would be to build a delegation around in China too other areas of interest such as guangzhou beijing and shanghai just a second question as what is a report from those previous visits and how can we tell what the benefits are of these trips as what's the reporting back mechanism going forward but also is there reports from the previous it's from last year that we can look at to see what the benefits have been a report was completed from last year's visits and working through working through the follow up to those reports is often the case of the specific agency involved now with China that that really falls to Christchurch educated the University of Canterbury Lincoln University and CDC who are the ones who really would feel the benefit from that from that visit specifically so we could get it we can get a report on those visits and what the outcomes have been yes and who's following up what yes another problem I can great any more questions mmm any debate I'll put the question all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's cari thank you
And now we come to know just know there's another item sorry supplementary agenda oh sorry item number 51 there it is right okay so item number 51 I'd like to I'd like to move since I was behind this and I think I think that Elly Jones wants to second thus motion and that is that we retrospectively assume our council joining as a party to these proceedings obviously there are some issues around the potential exposure to to costs being awarded against us but given that the eqc and the insurance council are and court to establish whether there is cover for increased flooding vulnerability in terms of the land then we need to be asking the question as to whether there is increased flood vulnerability is that building damage because that then puts us in a position where we can address floor levels and I've spoken to both VPC and the insurance council and the one of the top insurers and and there is certainly I think they're very pleased that this matter is going to be addressed in the call so and the approach that we took the only reason that it got to the point where a decision had to be made is that I had indicated to eq see that we had an interest they the lawyer notified that to the court we were given till the theatre to make the application and so the call had to be made on that day and it didn't have a chance to come to counsel for a decision before then so Yanni I just wanted to check who our legal counsels going to be we've engaged Simpson Grayson I've got a specialist and will can I move that we choose someone else no no I'm not going to accept a motion like that but how do we might deal with it on a different occasion this is just simply dealing with the declaratory judgment proceedings and court and I want I'm not going to sit here and talk about with the lawyers are qualified to take declaratory judgment proceedings and caught there is too much at stake for people to make a few based on how counsel so I'm happy to take the question offline but I'm well yeah I did raise the technology the meeting so with you but this one we can talk about offline all what I sorta speak and supported I think that the cost to do this is actually minuscule into the costs the we're actually in curing which you fix the issues in the flop turn basin Williston and other areas around the city so I'm really really supported with this section good all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there's a post they know that's carried and now we move to a resolution
Thank you thank you Sarah and now we move to item number 28 the strategy and planning committee part a development contributions policy review update and proposed development forum he wanted we move have you moved the additional papers because wasn't there an additional type of it all right but make is that is this this up we're because there was an additional paper that came in oik there just so I don't need to move it now I don't need to move it now no okay all right sorry apologize so it's an attachment so I should move all of them so why don't I just okay would fill Clearwater and Who am I looking at Jamie Gulf have moved and seconded that these supplementary reports be accepted onto the agenda yep I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried I only did that because the there is a there was a supplementary report and appendix that came out for this report with the terms of reference for such a committee so so move this resolution when we find it who would like to sickened bit Paul lonsdale yeah okay so um yeah we do we need someone at the staff at the table mr. Thelen suspect yeah um give it given that DC's actually affect the wider community as well and residents so the you know the whole issue about DC is paying for community facilities and if we don't charge DC's obviously rates go go up so there's no representation on this group from the community and I just wondered whether staff or the chair of that committee had thought about adding some extra representation to to really have that view taken into account I really support what the idea of what the committee is recommending here I think that's really good but it does seem that is quite balanced towards one one one side yeah yeah we actually did talk about this the problem is when you try and do everything you kind of do nothing and I think with us development contributions are an aspect of it but it's a little bit wider at all but we've just really tried to say thats like the santa cruz month or so joined up approach with five of the relevant people from a city council elected side and five from the people that are really in the thing I think are they better people that are well suited to it absolutely there actually are like we can sit around here and I can give you those names but it's probably not a fair process when you look at that you know it is the chamber of commerce that needs to involve the property council it's all of these I understand it to a certain extent they are considered their repeat offenders but then the organizations that have got the clout and from this as a start point what yarny say makes a heap of sense and let's invite them along their to that because I think the biggest misconception that people can say is when you go oval maybe we share people from the community with us actually as the community they do pay rates they just know it inside inside some views there it makes way too much sense to have someone else that intimate knowledge of this to be Leah so let's have them there there's no problem with that in the slightest this is just a start point and it's just got it's probably a very good start point when you look at the it makes logical sense the people to membership that you've got there the way that I loved her that was that the development forum wasn't too specific I mean to only focus on development contributions I mean obviously because there is a review it makes sense to undertake in that regard but you know sometimes we make decisions around things and the absence of looking at what all of the tools are in the toolbox and you know we have a development contributions policy and the in the central city at the moment and I'm I'm not actually sure that we're getting value for money and that we're getting that we're getting the result that we're looking for so I mean and we while we consider a more strategic approach to how we get investment in the CBD particularly around you know tying and residential developments with with mixed views and and other things so I'm really happy for this I think this is a really good step forward I think positively it will will be seen very positively in terms of the public reaction to it I think that if we end up making recommendations around development contributions that don't address issues around community facilities then that would be that would be an issue but I don't think that that one thing goes without one thing goes with the other so I think there will be plenty of opportunity with other other forums and other processes that we put in place that will ensure that the community view is represented because actually if we decided to go down a particular track that Ben meant that we weren't able to resource community facilities then I think that people would be asking us some serious questions though but you know I'm I think that this is extremely positive you look at 6.13 this is to look at planned developments content timing progress of our capital works program rebuild initiatives plan private developments and develop related policy improvements and changes to process and legislation so that as if you think of the district plan you know there's a there's a there's a view on some quarters we should remove urban design we should remove the consenting requirements we should remove notification requirements but there's a there's a there's also a group in our community that would say actually we feel really disconnected from our district plan so I guess what I'm trying to understand is what is the safeguards what are the checks and balances around what this group does to represent a community during the audit would it be okay maybe to suggest that given you've got the Central City Business Association that you might ask for a representative from the central city resonance groups to be involved and I mean I don't know if that's kill Turing it too much out of what it's intended to today it has quite major implications for influence over a number of things that will have a community impact honestly suggesting anything the doing things to death again I mean we can't do everything with huge big committees having everyone I mean it's a waste of time I'll give you an example as in Wellington yesterday met with a major national developer who is dying to do stuff in Christchurch desperate it doesn't work you know it just does not stack up and this forum is the type of place where we can try and work out how we're going to make it possible for people to build stuff here because without that there's not going to be any promises yeah look how I agree with you ref and I think that the terms of reference make it clear that the first instant issue is related to development contributions but it says consider other initiatives to support development that contributes to the recovery and rebuild of Christchurch City this is this is absolutely our role and if we don't engage with the with we start to add on people that are then going to you know I mean I just think that there are there are ways of bringing people together that mean that they don't have to be on this so the development forum as to as to heart tasked with facilitating an engagement between the development community and christchurch and the council are matters relating to development on the city I really don't think that it's necessary to expand it there are lots of forums where we can bring other parties together to discuss the ideas that might be generated but I think that really to focus the attention on what works what doesn't work that's that's our role that's what we need to be done but some fool we have we have a problem with development in the city we know that we're not getting the investment put and we are very very lucky an actual fact that we have committed property owners that if you live in the city that are actually willing to reinvest their money right at this point other sectors so I think this is really important that we do find out from the developers exactly what is going to make them want to reinvest in the city so I think I think the recommendation from the committee's about right all right well I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you the second item is freedom camping monitoring and compliance approach and the recommendation is that the council received the report and endorsed the educated monitoring compliance approach until match 2015 when staff will report back and I think that Jamie wants to move it but Andrew wants to Second Earth are there any questions on it I'll put the emotion all those in faith oh okay I was trying to make up for lost time Yahiro clean if I may say when Andrew first proposes he it was disgusted regard to freedom camping where people can and can't go I'm interested in the can and that texted been noted in the report particularly in relation to New Brighton and other areas looking for four options so I do realize that the frame of this report is about freedom camping and compliance I think what you're referring to by way of homelessness book is regard to the 22 kind of categories voluntary and assistant is that right in the matrix that you've got we're close to those who may choose to intentionally violate also so we do notice that there are two types of freedom camping opportunities think that social tourists in those who are homeless because I choose to be or because the and genuine and situations where they don't have a fixed abode so we would want to work with them and their voluntary assisted category around homelessness in help facilitate and go to the right places that they need to go so in freedom camping and the freedom camping it says that freedom camping is permitted elyria and this there's a vine or that restricts the location or any other enactment that would restrict it and it might be a bylaw we've got a parks and reserves Bible it restricts or provides for so we're just trying to manage the people who are learning and obviously we've got people who are living in caravans on the sides of Road you know the house is not being fixed so we don't want to be necessarily causing them Andrew stress about going somewhere else that we also need to manage people who are also parking in long-term on council streets and areas we like and it's not necessarily appealing to their neighbors they need for that I might declare my hand if that's what it will support it but I just want to say that oh I'm particularly interested in the canned side of the equation we're beginning to have approaches from people seeking shelter both in the CBD and outlying suburbs and I can see there's some money on budget so I just want to let you know we've become these conversations in the Housing Committee and I will we I will be seeking to elevate this in the future Paul ones down I think I she Glenn is actually touching a point that that don't put some can into the equation we will have people sitting up on the streets because it's easier and it's cheaper and we do need to find a way we can actually manage it in a way that if she helps people out a short trip but in a long term we need to figure out a better solution good oh did you want to have a something say like I suppose that's the connection that we know that you're picking up and that so it's out of paper if we can actually take out of the equation those people who are living on the streets because out of need or choice as opposed to people who are casually living on the streets as part of a recreation activity or a visit or something I mean I think we'd all be support within Andrew and I'll keep this brief this is the logical next step in the stream of work that came about as a result of the well largely as a result of the complaints that came out of a a corolla my real community board had a briefing on the content of the report a few weeks ago and I'll make the point that they were supportive of what's proposed here so that that was good to have the support of that board and I just draw attention to the second part of the elution the reporting back March 2015 and I think this was referred to in the original resolution so that we've got the benefit of been able to do this work over the summer and then look at its effectiveness and work out any next steps if required at that stage we also are aware and this is in the in the can do part of this aware of two positive things that are happening on the peninsula at the moment we had a deputation yesterday to the a Corolla rural community board from representatives of the New Zealand motor Caravan Association who are seeking to set up a camping ground at Tech amateur just outside of Icarus and that's positive and the rod Donald banks peninsula trust are also looking at as well so for all this report is mainly around enforcement there is some positive work going on in background and I'll certainly be very happy to keep staff aware of that thank you right ok I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and we've got two minutes here before I declare the meeting adjourned so let's just try alcohol instructions and public places final turn uncool is 29
This 288 Springs Road compliance with resource consent we actually had a discussion about this an informal session and I think that one of my colleagues was going to whip up a recommendation that we refer it to regulation and consents to to work with community board chairs and staff to develop a plan of action to resolve the issue to resolve this and other similar issues so I'll move that and I think David East will second it yeah yeah we're just doing enough that this report be referred to the regulation and consents committee and the community board chance to work with staff to develop a plan of action to resolve this and similar issues I think that there was a view that that it would be good to take it offline for for a bit and then bring back the plan of action which we can then debate I think that's the and that's appropriate and it was by the end of august so to be reported back by the end of august is it clear that that's similar issues citywide that incident here it's actually happening another time is that clear that that's similar issues citywide it's not just this particular case that we want to deal with yeah it's similar issues Thanks it's clear yeah and that's why we got all of the community board cheers and to it Bishop there should be a report and annual report that comes on inspections and enforcement and I just wonder win that's Joe because they actually might be the time to actually look at some of these but I am worried about leaving this to the list because this is actually about people's health and well-being and I know there's a huge community cancer particular dismiss dose that these things are not married it will prob way how about take out well I don't know why we want to schedule a briefing I mean why would we want to be there detail yeah regulation consents committee and the community board chairs to work with staff to develop a plan of action to resolve this and similar issues and report back to council it's peter probably not inspections and enforcement have an annual report that they do that they report against the different levels of service they have and the different things that they've been doing over the year that report must be due to come back soon I would imagine is just like is that an opportunity as well to raise some of the issues and have a process for getting information what you need to hear you don't get involved in individual personal decision making your digital find it quite clearly dominica you know I understand that the read yeah I'd real q what you're raising is clearly the unit used to do that I don't know if they're wanting to do it this year but that was the end of M&MS came up over that was an opportunity for the counselors on the committee in the council to have a conversation of the enforcement staff around while I call the high level approaches from the horseman which is appropriate for a government spotting to hear because really what we're talking about here's what the cancellation hears about it is yeah all right can I just ask um is there any chance that this could happen cook it in August well we had we had a discussion about that and it's just literally the pressure on staff with the you know the long-term plan and the annual plan and the district plan and the the reset just really worried about the pressure on our community when you read this stuff and you put it next to what's happening with a Swiss dolls and people are really concerned so if we can do it so in a great understand that we do every we've given a deadline by the end of august so you know obviously people will work as hard as they came to to resolve it I know that we've got a regulation and consents will be very involved in the application for um accreditation too so I just know that people under a lot of pressure at the moment so I thought we had a mover and a seconder for that was me and David East motion all those in favor say aye there's a post they know that's carried
The extension of team of appointment of counsel directors on crash its holdings limited step away civil way Tim scanned removed Andrew and Andrew tuna seconders is this is this still on the same condition in relation to the the fee so the fee will still the no fees will still be paid to the welfare fund all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's keri next time
Back to the table so on district plan submission real and use recovery plan action yeah none of the directors took part in the boat named counselors so would someone like to move it was only see CHL that we appointed for that short period of time that's right it's all right so on district plan submission real injuries recovery claim would someone like to move there so clear water seconded by yanni johansson board okay Paul lonsdale would like to seek him down ok so the deadline was the submissions we made on top of May are we able to make stronger submissions as you'll note from this report this is not as far as we would we would we pay to might want to go in terms of requesting that the retail area be removed so I'm I just like to understand why not ends if we can actually make that call today this this is actually a loop Action reports that doesn't follow the same statutory process as the as they are ma we don't have the opportunity to make a council view advised Selwyn we have a stronger view than that however what I understand from staff is that Selwyn have already moved to submit their version of the this action to the Minister for his inclusion because this is a loop action they had to actually complete so they basically go to the government and get a fast-track rezoning so they can have more retail one drop and so on basically end up well what what what occurred was that as part of part of giving a people live there was a proposal that came to sell in district for a much larger retail area so we have we've made that submission as staff a similar submission was made by a can too I mean that my understanding is they have substantially reduced the amount of retail that's gone they into the loop proposal so and can I just check on our processes if we get something comma fifth of may and a month later and the submissions have already gone out and white why is this submission panel not being used and wire reports taking this that's something that we are addressing with staff unfortunately for whatever reason we only had seven days to make our submission so there was some internal process or something went to the wrong place inside the organization so that's fundamentally this one's been a particular aberration but general we would either come to a committee or the submissions panel yeah so except this one has not not follow than all viruses so but why would we get a letter on the fifth of may and the deadline be the 12th or May ok yes it is that a statutory note and this is where it varies from the normal statutory process I'm not quite sure what the steps iron and release not here at the moment but yeah not sure I can come back and try and clarify to you why that one occur in this way but it is it's a process that seems to accept outside of the normal RMA process because it's affection that had to be given had to be given the feet too hmm in the same way we use recovery plan that they had to do this yeah they're doing it intersection and so what happened was as far as I can ascertain apologizes I'm not fully across this their proposal came up with quite a significant amount of retail we've got a very short period in which time which comment will make submissions we went back in as we can and critique the amount of retail that's been in there they've now gone substantially reduced that as a result we're quite happy with their response on al bahar and unrestricted our submission and that's what's going on to be a proposal okay so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there's a post they know Carrie
Sorry honey I just did this welcome to this meeting and first apology for the first hour or so is from the end so I'm sorry guys we've got me for the first hour and the first any declarations of interest
Yeah ah okay guys it looks like we're starting um we are starting right we are starting yes and we have held over okay thanks guys we have held over one of the deputation so fellas here to make a deputation and so for we are initially in your hands this is on pause 52 and various other cemeteries as well okay this specifically on the report which we only received this morning and I am the only one of us who could make it to this meeting so here I am I haven't looked at the report in detail I I see it as another another step and in the systematic removal of that property rights since mr. Brownlee decided that he wouldn't introduce the I asked you to send it back for more detail on on the issues which we saw as being very contentious and that that were we understood to be included and yes actually I commend the cat counsel for the decision on the philipstown school made this morning it was fantastic to come into an environment where you were also up for port hills residents who are still stuck in the situation well that that fit well I've pretty much seen what I wanted to say I've pretty much said what I want to say yeah please as as our council advocate for us um you know and the democratic processes that are supposed to be happening yeah yani lip you I think the problem is we've just been given this report this morning I've told people that it wasn't_''_176.11 on the agenda so people haven't come and they would have a real interest in it bills come a short notice I presume um so I just think we need more time to understand what this report is saying and enable the load of the council I mean your local people that are interested to be involved and in what recommendations we look at going forward so you know I think it's great that fills come here today but I don't think we can get consideration when it's just you know put all of this can I just say that but the also by Tony tag and christmasy etc which made some recommendations you know made strong recommendations to include residents in these hazard areas and any conversation over what happens to their houses that simply hasn't happened we haven't had any look very minor influence on any of the decisions have been made on our behalf that's simply not right I'm felt I tend to agree with yanni that just read through the report and it is really complex including legal ramifications and I would like to deal with its more carefully at a future council meeting I just want to check with film l me tho thought I know you've had some discussions with the council staff are you really saying look that they weren't kind of like meaningful conversations into the relation to your own property and in mitigation well I guess felt that a lot of what those conversations were about really just haven't_''_291.289 been addressed and in the revised report that was seen today back so you're saying issues that you raised haven't_''_298.96 been addressed sufficiently many of which is something which you know we as a counselor should have future discussions with the residents like Phil and so we are absolutely clear about the yeah I guess what's behind the recommendations that the staff have made so I'm well this is we're not we're not dealing with this this item in fact I mean the irony is is that we've got a got a legal report which is in the public excluded section and it's almost like we need to deal with the legal issues before we deal with the report but I'm just wondering how do we do that as a matter of prices and if you want to do it no was it is that the best way to proceed to go into public it excluded deal with the legal report come out and then deal with the report that Phil's been speaking food is do we need to deal with us today and um you know there's other information that some of us would want buy copies I don't and I sir I don copies of it here of you copy of the costs and all that stuff a resume should be in the public realm because that's relevant to the residence but I'm getting a shake of the head from Mike tellin our chief planning officer which is that we don't have to proceed with this report today so if that is the case then I would I would suggest that it lie on the table until the next meeting of the council but perhaps you could come to the table right um that's correct you don't have to deal with this today I mean it was your call and we had the last meeting and we sort of had the long list I think I think I think expressed at that point to be a bit of a struggle to get the matters looked at in time but we have but it's been late and so the report only came out yesterday so I do acknowledge that did come out late but there was a lot of work being done so it's certainly on the be considered at the next council meeting quite happy for that to happen well that would enable us to deal with the legal advice this afternoon and public exclude you wish would be ahead of the dealing with this report yep that would be perfectly appropriate as well alright so so I'm just going to brawl that that's the course of action that we will follow on their item on the agenda and we'll deal with item 53 when we get to the prediction can I say one more yep quick this is I represent a number of people obviously end groups the one thing that they have wanted me to convey to the council is that at this point people have lost faith dear as a myriad of legal action pending hmm yeah it's a it's a hard position for to be and because that's not the ride that I've chosen to take but you know no it's where it's at out there and I've also been aware in the background of the court case in relation to the in that regard as well there are many people out there that are just stuck yeah I know I know I know this is a evidence that it's a dreadful situation to be in David they're almost sort of parallels to what we were discussing before with the Phillips down school some respects we have to stand up and make a stand for our community and gating as best as we can there so just a point I think that we'll have that discussion when we get to the actual document itself but not Phil you know I'm in a way out some there's almost nothing that I can say other than I'm sorry that we're in the situation that we're own I think you hear from counselors that we're going to try our best to find whatever solution we can but there are constraints that are outside our control as well stay indeed I understand I just employ you we impossible include us in the conversation yeah yeah yeah certainly have you seen a copy of the peer review report time to go yeah no that's cool but can we just ask make sure that staff provide a copy of that peer review report to the concerned residents so that they can actually see the information is that there no and it's online so soul is publicly available horrible okay by the time we come back so I would certainly invite you to come back at the time that we deal with this so we'll put it on the agenda for the council meeting on two weeks time yeah and yeah again of course in this situation urgency is paramount I know I know and I mean you you know people have got offers to that have to be accepted or otherwise but first of all of us that's right so I mean we do seasonally here the you know that your plea to us to you know apply our wisdom judgment to this but I guess what I'm trying to communicate to you is that there are constraints that are outside our control and we'll try and find is best away through as we can thank you thanks very much bill
Um abs sorry was it it was you it was you so Andrew and I'm me yeah it was you are you sure um yeah I'm a little bit concerned you know saying that there should be a less stringent monitoring or less stringent design standards in the area just because it doesn't have a suburban master plan and particularly when you look at that 21 day turnaround we've already made this design assessment process a lot easier to achieve than it previously was I mean I I'm wondering whether I really wouldn't prefer to see the 250 square meter remain in place and not relax that to 500 square meters in in any of the suburban sensors because I mean at the end of the day what we want to be doing is encouraging good quality design wherever it might be not just in Littleton pseudonym and the other master plan suburbs so maybe just to assist in our decision making with this could you give us a couple of examples of what a 500 square metre building might look like or where I think in you know it's quite an important decision that we're about to make and it would be good to be able to visualize the effects of what we might be doing two fifties not tiny and 500 twice that says mean 200 250 is like five times the size of a suburban hairdressers or dairy or whatever so 500 is like 10 times there is a significant a suburban center that's quite a significant size building I'm thinking effectively that 500 square meter fresh shelled will pick up what's been described in previous discussions as the mini majors the wit calls that was on cashelmore for instance pre-earthquake would have exceeded that fresh old and the fresh older should point out is outside the wit calls that was on Cashin wall pretty quick so as a reason reasonably our store but it's below that free shot we're not saying that there's not to be any urban design issues addressed we're just using a different mechanism to ensure good design so below the 500 square metre fresh old the standards the road front there being a pedestrian access point to the footpath they're being sick t of the frontage glazed and a veranda or other weather weather protection so the standards are there too and if there's a breach of any one of those standards there's then a resource consent triggered so it's not not saying that below 500 we're not concerned and the standards are really one method and above 500 we're using a different method which is to use our discretion to assess each on a case-by-case basis um yani I think um yeah I think I'm quite concerned about this as well I thank you you've given what calls what what are the buildings that you would see that just give us an understanding 250 square meters versus 500 what are the buildings that types of buildings that would be exempt now from a resource consent design measures this is difficult I don't have any examples to have 500 yards for example they wouldn't require yeah in a suburban shopping context that be your individual shops for would be below that 500 square metre threshold but would have exceeded 250 square meters but again they will stop with those standards in place so it's it's really doing using different methods and we need to get that balance right between enabling that development in recovery of those centers against still achieving how does how does having a design assessment stop stop or disable development from happening there's what's what's come come in from feedback as well as our own assessment by way of the independent review has been the industrial zones we've got provision for redevelopment of brownfield sites for residential and all mixed use and if the large retailer decides that and that in their assessment of where they located they'll consider the regulatory framework and how enabling it is of going in one place versus another and if it's if this potential that they can find an easier path through by locating outsider center and an industrial zone and arguing that it's a brownfield site that's no longer appropriate for industrial use then they could well get them back into commercial centers so it's really make offering a carrot to go back into a center given the change we're going up from which are given the change in the approach we're taking keeping in mind that in industrial zones at the moment is very permissive and we're using it effectively stick to say we want you to go into centers and we're putting in place rules to restrict offer some retail and industrial zones but we need to offer a carrot for want of a better term to attract business to centers of having having no design assessment as the kind of seems counterproductive to getting the kind of nice built environment that everyone asked water I think what Marx saying is it's not know designer system what it is is that at a certain level they they wouldn't require a consent for design issues but they would still have to meet the standards which max already talked about and then over a certain threshold and reduce along the road front they would have to get the consent and 250 and 500 you're talking about a significant development that doesn't need to have the consent for yes but it doesn't need a consent but it does have to meet standards so what what part of the consenting requirement wouldn't be meet you know I mean what I mean I just don't know what what anyway they're bias you've asked the question that was already asked and answered and you either agree with it or you don't and you obviously disagree with it and others agree with it so I think we're just going to have to move on what are the design requirements we've already had their explained to us but perhaps one more time can you explain what the design requirements are for buildings that are under the 500 certainly any buildings required to be built up to the street to ensure a relationship with the street there's a requirement for sixty percent of the elevation facing the street to be glazed there's a requirement for a veranda or other Weaver weather protection and there's shop or other use in addition to that there's rules that provide for activities at ground floor that will encourage activity between the street in the private space activities like officers and residential that won't have that relationship we're directing to above ground floor and from our analysis of the issues the key issues that we face and examples of given and possibly in the large blank walls like on new brighton road along the south side of the palms and whilst lance cable sports our favorite is not enough prosaic in the world make that an interesting place to be I like that phrase at and several years ago there was a assessment made of the effectiveness of the current city plan rules and it was found that landscaping on itself isn't going to be effective in disguising it was was a elevation that's got no relationship with the streets and it doesn't encourage petitioner and activity so it's really getting that balance right yeah le just ask a question around that wall we hear about the one now that I'm is designing building out and some night and I've got a wall that they wanted to put more windows into but were unable to because they were restricted they had they couldn't have any more than one meter war I believe it's a file room which is why that restriction applies so he's essentially now got a big blank wall when he wanted a wall with windows in it how do you allow for because when you see walls like that after hearing what saying it doesn't marry an entity the circumstances of that but there's there is a need to reconcile the urban design provisions with the building code and you're right there is a in the building code requirements for firewalls where there's a boundary between two private properties there a link between that and what you require from design urban design no because a firewall wouldn't be required between the street and shop for instance it's likely to be between a private property and another private property that there was a fire walls if the building was boundary between those two properties ok I'll requirement with is an alleyway is still a firewall requirement and it's not on to a green space that's why so you've got a blank wall yeah but anyway okay right I haven't got any suggestion of a change except that I've changed from lien and I've got the flu so there's no tolerance once we understood right episode ever got any change on this no okay are we being asked to move the chains that staffer recommending or are we being asked to just so we've got to change with us there's the draft before you includes these changes within it the reference to signum some and littleton where we proposed to retain the previous draft standards so I'll a higher threshold that's knots in the draft that you've got that will make that change to essentially require a little too many new ballrooms to be subject to that urban design assessment and in the case of summer and signum developments on a key pedestrian frontage or al-sadr key's to recognize that in order to achieve the outcome source and the suburban center master plans we need to assist those developments and also in cinnamon a little something particular you tend to have a finer grain of development and so potentially the risk of imposing the higher fresh shoulders that the majority if not all of that development would not be assist okay andrew is that not relevant to any suburban center there I mean I appreciate what you're doing in terms of looking at those more sensitive sites there's more sensitive areas where the grains finer and that sort of thing but is that not actually relevant to any suburban center there as it's kind of a bit that I've got some difficulty with because if it's relevant to sit in them and little turn and wherever else it's arguably relevant to any suburban center where you know a 500 square meter development in terms of a suburban center is quite significant it's of a reasonable size by any suburban Center standards and I would have thought that if the you mentioned there's a strong argument that it's relevant in any suburb the focus on those sensors is this a number of factors as well as the other master plan centers they sustain a significant amount of damage and is it a lot more rebuild required in those centers therefore be a little code of change in terms of the built form secondly there's a strong character particularly in signum and a little some where and in both those centers there's guidelines that have either been developed prior to this district plan review in the case of littleton or in the case of sibling there's guidance that has come from the master plan and to achieve that desired character and outcome there's a need to ensure that we can have some regard to those guidelines which I've always don't have any weight or there's also been a strong desire from the community to clean a little soon for that assessment of design so whilst that take your points this essentially different methods being used across different centers so but a lot Souls we're still putting in place controls but it's by way of standards rather than that generic assessment look good for ya know I appreciate that the third suburban center that you mentioned by name there was littleton Sidon and samba sumner that's good okay because some know if they hadn't been some know that would have been the next one that I would have been talking about but there's also an argument though where we've got other suburban centers like for example New Brighton or edgware or you know other places with master plans and there'll be some others without master plans that we should be aspiring to the same good standard of urban design in the areas you've mentioned and clearly you're feeling that lowering the threshold will bring the outcomes that you're looking for in those centers there's an argument that that would bring a better outcome in any sensor so I'm certainly suggesting that I'm in favor of keeping the threshold at 250 right across the board okay so can I seduce that it goes from 250 to 500 with a whole pile of provisions and you're clearly not in favor of that and the only is probably not in favor of that but can I suggest that we just do a quick show of hand so we get some sort of indication before we get into major details so mercs suggestion can I just have a show of hands for those in favor 123456789 so my hunch is that that's not going to go through if it's helpful that you are welcome to move it a few that you're good okay is there anything else because I there anything else you guys want to bring up I had one small measure to add like roll made right okay two very minor points one is in the objectives and policies of the commercial chapter there's a table that sits below policy one and don't rush for the toilet paper with the table the table effectively provides greater definition of what the function of district neighborhood and local center is to help the reader understand what makes a neighborhood center and the final point is that the commercial chapter there was a number of rules for commercial local zones so the proposed local centers and greenfield residential areas and to reduce the complexity of the chapter and to reduce Rupert's with consolidated those provisions in an attempt to make it easier for the reader so that's in retrospect sort of looking back on some of the decisions that we made to be inconsistent with the rest of the district plan and that is our requirement that we have to off-site car parking spaces so all of the rest of the plan we've looked at a very real promotion of public transport and putting people's houses next to where they can shop and all those sorts of things and then at some stage during what may have been two months ago or three months ago we actually in a debate here looked at the requirement to have to or streetcar parking space so this is the residential check yes residential chapter sorry yes and it seems to me to encourage homes to have two car impervious materials is totally contrary to our overall aims of the check of the whole district plan and to our whole flooding aims as well so I just wonder if we are absolutely weeded to that or whether we could live with one that is the current operative plan just before that's opened up to the rest of the council's perhaps I could ask David to give more elucidation on this topic because we're not requiring 21 but I'll ask yes sir so then the draft that went out to public consultation and debris we were requiring one per house across the whole city and then following feedback from the public on that we just was discussed in the workshop a few weeks ago that for large houses that have a floor area greater than 150 square meters yeah so that they would need you have to her house but any other how step less than a hundred square meters would only store only have one so it's only for those houses that have a floor area of greater than 150 square meters that would just very quickly for somewhere there's an insurance meeting no it's not no but as we've gotten some of the streets some of the intensification doesn't enable for people who have a very good immunity and look at things like a life straight if you're enabling more units to go and near without car parking we start to have some real issues yeah that was the difficulty I head but if people are happy with it I won't pursue it I think it's just an odd rule that is inconsistent with the rest of plan the problem is these areas where you could probably intensifying it wouldn't be in such an issue there's other areas around sobbing more smoke record or more for example or mirror about mall where if you don't provide car park and we to those ppl park and the board's already having to the parking strategies richest we can be going and look it actually what they do and it's a real mess so yeah the pipe are around erection mall is not that more intensive houses that actually have cars and if you look at the statistics around how many people own cars and the increase in car ownership you actually create a public problem that we didn't have to pay out everybody's fine with it I want to just follow from the other years quite right around the shopping centres it is quite a problem because what you've got a suspicion around me revives I manage the area for a number of years they starting to our restrictions which applies to unless we give some exemption to the to the private property owner they can't park on the street they have a nice paste in their property just till around certain areas there may need be some designation around hi you series I don't know okay I won't bother personal injury mr. point of clarification um you mentioned right the way across the city there's a requirement for one car park residential property I'm just checking that there hasn't been a change slipped in without me realizing it around the banks peninsula mixed-use Corot a town center if somebody was building a mixed-use development with commercial of ground floor level and residential apartments upstairs my understanding is there would be no requirement for car parking in that case it's only a clarified it and commercial centers that are there's no requirement for her packing if they the activity is not require undergrad transfer assistant which is what we discussed last week so yeah just for the infomercials ions so that would apply to as much use developments that and residential signs it is one except Littleton don't have to profile for Street cap back in all of volatility in Littleton you don't need to provide all the streetcar packing so it's only in those commercial zones where you need to provide um car parking fur and which was and residential zones you still doing it pride Elise one there'll be a lot of non-compliance thing yeah okay any other questions I'm general on general okay jaani I've got the map around the intensification of housing and I'm just really confused on cleaning that 39 run a scam or and it's a little bit hard to see because unfortunately eastgate mall was kind of cut into two other maps so it's quite hard to get a sense of exactly what's happened to that zoning but I'm not sure if the color hasn't come out properly or what whether some other thing has happened so we had a big debate and we voted on it and I just can't see the impact of what we are grade being reflected on that planning met you'll recall in all of these ones in that we lift it as loving to effectively instead of the more medium density once it was matters wasn't ready to type school days exactly as it is Helen white say yes I think what's confusing is that you've got oh yes what page are you on 39 little I got sdt in RND and in you've got so there's two different residential zones within the same color Harris I presume is the old living 10 but arias is the old living one but the iris DT is equivalent to the living to zone the existing living to zone you'll recall that the plan that we put out for public consultation referred to a residential suburban density overlay now feedback that we had was that people were finding that that density overlay confusing so we found it simpler or we made a decision and I think we've previously discussed this with the council as well to remove that density overlay and just apply straight zoning the RS DT is effectively a living to the existing living to zone or the equivalent of the existing living to sign so what ya next week edward bay
And the recommendation is that the council does not result to impose a temporary alcohol ban area for these two places jacent to each other thank you so who would like to move that David East to second up by Thomas Kendrick is there any questions or discussion just to note that really the whole issue around this request was based on the summation that there was an alcohol-related problem and in fact the warrant so main reason why we recommendations that the recommendation as as it is but we are asking stuff to monitor at the the park to ongoing situation that's great ah poor lon sounds I just want to make the point that there wasn't and there were other issues related to psychoactive substances and some illegal substances being consumed in the area but alcohol was certainly a factor on top of that as well but it wasn't_''_67.53 the the overriding factor but the fact there is this term where you have people consuming what was legal highs and a legal highs there was always alcohol involved and I just think that still needs all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried I actually think that I forgot to do the adoption of the report as a whole for the previous one is it right so we'll do the adoption of the this one as a whole feast so Thomas Kendra and David East I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and can we go back to the strategy and planning one and it's Jamie gough and Paul lonsdale I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that's her so I haven't_''_132.359 but actually we've got one more minute let's just do environmental committee environment the 26
Oh there is a municipal recommendation that the report yet that I think that's the one that the community board would like us to consider so Jimmy tuned you want to move that Vicki Buccaneer happy to see kinect second that so now I'll hand over to you we've got a resolution on the table resolution on the play will regarding their from the 20th movie the Christchurch southern motorway project stage one that lay on the table and that legal advice be provided by staffers quite a bit of fun issues that we needed to get some advice on regarding and the speed limits of joining the young the southern Nigeria motorway which also comes back to the to the alberta road speed limit issue as well as quite a lot of others we just wanted to get that tidied up a little bit before it does go out for through the public transportation so so that we could get things more in line with the community's thinking rather than the recommendations that they're coming forward yep I think that's very satisfactory that and their previous mess re is it what to do when I just wanted to comment on the we'll go back to the road naming on page 20 down the bottom where we've been recommended the fishway Gander Boulevard and David viewers present road names in new subdivision or Falls will drink the road that the fulton hogan subdivision so just sort God just like to acknowledge to or let the capsule know that we have recommended those names yeah with two of our previous council laws yeah and it's that's something so moving on being 20 the law when I were you know I think we've we've got to put this motions no oh I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried with and so now councillor chin and council buck would like to move and second that the report be received the report as a halt be adopted as there are no other items on that one that you wanted to just talk to nope I'll put the motion all those the next one is the joint the joint recommendation
Citywide speed limit review proposed speed limit changed a little more Avenue it dies road and that would be moved by I think it's mr. lonsdale chiptune to move it and muster your head since tuned to second it would you like to speak to that no just that it's coming back for a second time with another really good look at it we've looked at another couple of options and this is what's coming bit to counsel at the stage great I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried thank you very much thank you I make a point on that though there was actually a very split decision on that on that decision so the two councillors were in favor of film because right
Madona counselors for tina and we love me part days pretty much business as usual and the subpoena but one of the things I did want to take the opportunity to talk about which happens every time it rains as community becomes aware of the significant issue we've got with sediment entering the harbor every storm a beat there are slumps and erosions a lot of them along road network they're contributing to the sediment load in Homer Harbor I've seen one student project which estimated eight tons interred from one culvert during one 24-hour period so the load going to have a significant and is causing ecological degradation there was there was an urgent need for action identified at the time that the urban development strategy was developed and there was a plan for an integrated catchment management plan in net which was originally scheduled for 2012 it has been deferred and a third and now reduced in scope to a storm water management plan but the problem is here is the harbor and the leg cannot be separated they can't_''_74.909 be managed separately in maybe maybe that could be reconsidered maybe I mean I think definitely we need an integrated catchment management plan for this and it's certainly consistent with the objectives of the zone committee in the air is it so there's one other point to make is that this the issue of the roads every time there is a storm abena cost you no significant living costs millions of dollars to repair them across the insula and I think the council really doesn't eat as part of this work to look at how those roads could be made more resilient and how that ongoing maintenance costs abilities thank you just on a 2.1 Paul of the correspondence what was the nature of their correspondence from the little to information and Resource Center trust regarding those displaced in campervans caravans and buses and the we caught the visitor center they had identified that there were a number of people who were living in caravans and they had reports that some of the people living in caravans on the streets have been hassled by adjacent homeowners and asked to move on see meet with him it seemed that there were possibly about five people in this situation but when we explored the range of circumstances of these people there was sort of no consistent theme and in some cases people were living in caravan fry choice was one couple that lives in a bus that that he would support two weeks on to its off the bus moves around and so we did think initially we'd make a reputation to the recovery of the whole thinking it was a earthquake issue but I don't think it's quite bit something either and in a couple of cases the people have found other alternative accommodation so it's not like a generic issue it seems like specific things yep change of guard Andrew and move yeah in relation to the issue that Paul has just raised if I could move that in relation to lyttelton harbour in relations littles and have a sedimentation issues cancel request a report on implementation of the storm water management plan and whether it would be more beneficial to progress an integrated catchment management plan Environment Committee and the community board yep thank you very much that would be gross yeah it took like someone moves the report
Twenty first of May counselor you're handsome seconds accounts of a lonsdale is there anything that you'd like to raise him there no no I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there's a piece they know there's carriage and then we move to the partay on the Summoner community center and library rebuild but you'd like me to rule that that metal I on the table until the annual planning process as peer I think that's the only really fair way to do that yes it release for some of it I just wanted to point out though that I'm you know we just acknowledge what someone are going through in the ends of the recent tragedy that they've had this is a really important issue to them I think today is actually the day of one of the funerals I so you know our thoughts are with that community but actually in terms of setting a budget I think we should read this on to the annual plan so that we can you know again that wider council thank you I think the community board we're quite clear during the joint committee meeting that they would quite like many on budget to go out for a wider consultation yeah and there is some concern that if money doesn't go on budget at some stage and this is an earthquake issue it's not it's not a longer-term think there is no facility via currently at all and so I don't know with is she coming out of it the earthquake funding would be will be a good idea at this stage we to give something on budget now so that we can talk to the community would be really good mmhmm yeah well I think that the annual plan process is it's only cup of X ways yeah yeah thank you so I'll move on to the fourth of jun 2014 part a meta there
To the son of the agenda is Pam echo everywhere community board look I just say thank you for the support that we've had over the flooding over the last over the last minute of time back since March we really enjoyed the opportunity of working together with the New Zealand Transport Association and the Environment Canterbury and City Council to resolve some of our issues although we're not both quite related issues we are doing the flooding issues and leading on from that we have a meeting with Environment Canterbury who rang and offered to see what they could do to help our board through the situation so you know after some challenging times working together we've got some good opportunities moving ahead I also want to acknowledge Andrew and that we have recently changed meeting time I changed our day to find a day that was more appropriate but we would be able to see Andrew little more awesome there is difficult position sirs and the number of activities we do have in our board area we have a number of other activities like thinking town's not very happy with them and how we're not very happy with the number on the board so we have education program programs we have freedom camping issues there a whole range of sort of working groups that we have at the same time that we like to have Andrew long to to keep them in the picture of what's going on banks furniture so we just acknowledge all those but that time that Andrew does give to us and here's at the end of a telephone and keeps in touch so we do thank you Andrew for your time that you give to us mostly the morning for every load well it is very difficult and challenging and to get the feel for Bates Peninsula you really have to be there on the pitch understanding what the community is actually saying and no better way to be without storage so out of the agenda the things that are important to us what everything is important but procedurals have been causing considerable conservation to us and the sister report was written by Derrick Todd in study and it says that all's about the the results of the Coastal Range assessment showed that except for a few localized areas around the stream mounts very little change in shoreline position was detected any of the settlements from aerial photographs are over the last 60 years the possible reasons for this finding included that large tracts of the shoreline have been protected by sea walls and rebet months for long periods of time so the report goes on talking about the importance of the seewalds and for a long but hasn't_''_159.71 been there's been very little work done on the sea walls and necro harbor and the base and we're just continuing to raise his profile we have actually got a report coming back to council and I can say that a number of our sea walls have had a few clear repairs done under the last last few weeks and months and effects they're working at the moment and doing on some on appears on some of us for example on lovers walk or lovers lane if you happen to go to a little bit of work I don't dumb on up to make it safer and there was a comment from comment from a community board person yesterday but someone walking with a push here with a baby and a telephone and a hand somehow rather the pushchair and the telephone ended up down on the beach the baby was caught but the push he went over the edge of sea walls so you know our signals are important to us on being spent and we we welcome the opportunity of working to resolve those issues of which they're starting to be work through okay I also want to talk about how lovely graphical I'm going to take every opportunity that comes along your one is all right my amazed they're wonderful rififi girls who woman young woman that came over and spoke to a look they just engendering thusi ism and just delighted with them what they talked about with us as a community I wanted to also raise the profile of some of our wall place we are having trouble with some of our standards has come up again and again is on the bottom of page or the Niah point walkway well it's closed now so there's really no more no more issues with it's just closed but we are looking to improve the standards on some of our walkways this was part of a subdivision and has continued to cause us problems so didn't Justin and closing look out for the hundred and seventy-four celebration of a pariah will be focused I think by the look of it around french fist and 2015 with a whole lot of other programs brought together little programs that will contribute to an overhaul larger program and perhaps moves throughout 2015 but we will keep you updated as we move through that program okay thank you move Andrew probably you can seek and it as well seeking Oh seconded phone I'll put the reporters to help those in favor please say aye those opposed thank you very much indeed it was over in the drafting race this morning I'm sorry of course today sorry okay just wasn't League no point was part of a development it was originally power to develop they develop this form there and invest it and council yes it was very poorly put it was back early days and very poorly formed if you feel it was poorly birth and now we're picking up the ante for it you're on d do you think it'll be the budget to get it repaired just for a bit but it was a very important walkway around our coastline it's used often do you see here's the maintenance contract for those traitors particularly this one it's been closed I think it's green space so there's a council council yes oh yes it does account via council tree yes so we've got a budget for that we're paying for it but of something done well it wouldn't be done in the past okay that'd be interesting be poorly done you have to stand out of the walkway that we have the same issue at all throughout the port hills are sort of make that known here your walkways through the earthquakes and that's something we do need to look at as a council probably one of you should go to the
You've done it and then we've got the termini haven't had the whole report doctor just at one resolution of just the pate oh they didn't they didn't do the that even that the report as a whole be adopted gosh I honestly thought all of us would have been done and dusted I trusted my deputy I'm pretty sure you did earlier as well that she was much stricter on time than you were but it was not the case right okay so counselor lonsdale seconded by Councillor johansson reporters a whole bit doctor what is here something you'd like to raise and that context I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carried and now we move
Are you working on those widow excellent that's fine people don't need to see that written up today they've generally you generally happy with it so there any other questions so I'll put the oh no I don't need to put this but we're we're accepting that this is the or do we need to resolve to accept panel if you like madam chair you'll see under 9.3 above if you want we can start making some bullet points where it says to be listed oh yeah on the things that you're requiring us to do today so we could for example put an edit head wording in relation to quality check out some to just repeat it wedding in relation to strategic out stammers yeah yani should um so we're now into questions around the whole phone no no we're just dealing what the strategic outcomes but it is that all done and dusted just people were happy with that so if you want to carry on through the through the rears so if we're if we on to the it's just two more pages on the are we agreed to wear don't change on on the the last paragraph on endemic don't come nine you see ya complete so amend amend the last paragraph is yep so then just turning to the last two pages we which are sections out of the introduction chapter again with some additions in purple most of those additions really just take out of what was proposed to be in the street you directions chapter and add them into the introduction chapter appropriate places and most of them I relate to things like statements such as under oath went to a the district plan must not be inconsistent with the christchurch central recovery plan similar statements that were in the previous chapter that are no longer relevant under the strategic outcome section but I'll just point in particular to see at the bottom of the first page that's under 4.2 where there's also we've added a note in particular about again the loop directions for reducing consenting and notification requirements and addressing the efficiency aware that that's something that we are or in doing and the district plane but it's something that's obviously of considerable importance to the government and that was all yeah the UM I just wonder whether we should put the expiry date of the legislation and they're just as what just as a a note note to self of the earthquake recovery yes the 19th of April 2016 not that I'm counting I will air their them yeah well I think it is worth noting because this is a document that's going to speak in the future so and we might come back after the 19th of 8 4 2016 and there's more yani can we just stop it after it says the plane can be viewed and then linked to the plan or even after the discipline that's not being consistent with the lane use recovery claim sorry where's this on page 1 of 2 under chapter 1 introduction I just think I'm having extra wording and they're talking about reduced consenting and notification provides more immune ition actually I think would be our intention which is through the changes we've made to the district plan that's where those things have been addressed but I am concerned to hear bustles you know I think the least we say about that a better because notification no doubt they will be one of the major community issues that people do not understand so you know if you think of what we're doing with the flooding actually one of the problems we've got as people don't need to need to a consent and then it means we end up with problems likewise with some of the notification or things that are impacting on local communities I think just having listen here there's like a red red flag to a bull and it only provides any initial for those people to argue that they don't need a consent or they don't need a notification when actually that's better addressed through the substance of the plan itself so I'm sorry I'm at a loss here what do you want taken out then reduced consenting a notification requirements and address the efficiency and effectiveness of urban design provisions in some respects it's actually better to to state what we've done because they might that they might run the argument that we haven't done it if we don't mention that I mean but we have done we actually have reduced consenting a notification requirements and on occasions where that is appropriate and we have addressed efficiency and effectiveness of urban design provisions I mean the one thing that I think could be added to that as actually that it's the people of Christchurch that want even quality urban design I mean all of the conversations that we've had publicly about the what's that called the something comprehensive development mechanism or whatever it's all been about design lead because the last thing the people of Christchurch one is for a whole bunch of houses to be dumped on a site and and to have no connection to the surrounding neighborhood so it's been very much driven from the people of Christchurch and you know I'm that but if they want us to take that out I'd rather that we put that in there and let them take it out because that's the people of Christchurch have told us that they absolutely want its corrector that goes as far back as to the share an idea consultation process who that's right their communities and the land use recovery plan seat yeah but the point I'm making is that what you don't want is for a wording in here that enables the lawyers and the people with money who apply for consents or apply to get non notified concedes having further a munition to using it's going into the introduction this is the whole point of avoiding it going into the that's what the words do they read through the wording they highlight the weirdo they'll come to the staff and say what we don't need a consent because you've got it in here or we don't need it to let me notify because you can't_''_450.29 be inconsistent and we're supposed to reduce notification ya boy urban design should take huge amounts of time it should be efficient and effective absolutely actually and we have made it efficient energy to the room well no but it could we could we add a phrase about how we've really you know that the people of Christchurch have really spoken I mean because I have I mean this this has come this is not something that you know officials have set round and worked out for themselves or that we've SAT around and just thought of it's actually something that the people of Christchurch have said and I know that every time I talk about something being designed lead it's the only way that people will start to really relate to the intensification objectives yes we can manage it is really just as you were saying before a chapter about what the land use recovery plan sees yeah but on the other hand putting in extra sentence that it's a priority that we achieve design Mead yeah different designers it can go and in fact and the strategic outcomes an explanation of the words we've been given from the community there I think that's right and you say in the introduction chapter it does hold no legal way that's been explained before by a legal counsel or if we can add those weeds to vicky's and trow with that there is a yes but but it's the fact that it's come from the community it this is not just a yeah yes yes yeah yeah okay yeah we so we just move on now to Madison final pieces work commercial and industrial yep it's a what I'm about speak to about highly relevant to get in the discussion about high-quality design since since we came to speak to you last we've had an independent review of the commercial and the industrial chapters there's to ensure that the chapters and their supporting analysis a robust as we go into a formal process a key issue that's arisen from that independent review by a planning consultant and an economic consultant has been the unbalanced nature of urban design provisions whilst they seek to zones so for to encourage activity into commercial zones we need to show a level of provision that's an abling of that activity given that at the present time there's provisions that enable retailing and officers outside of those centers and we're trying to offer a carest so go into a center as opposed to simply beating them with a stick to get out of industrial areas there's the risk that the urban design provisions are seen as a disincentive to go into commercial areas and we need to get that balance right between achieving high quality design whilst ensuring that we're showing a willingness and wanting to enable development in those places that we want that activity to occur in order to achieve that we're proposing some amendments to the thresholds for wind development is subject to an urban design assessment and I'll briefly talk you through those rather than referring to the chapter now in the previous draft that came to you there was a requirement for a source consent to enable an assessment of urban design for any developments on center that there's a lot of activity and we want to promote activity outside those key pedestrian frontages any developments over 250 square meters was required to have results consents below this below that threshold that school B standards in the plan that required to be a permitted activity that you have built up to the road from that you had a minimum area of blazing and that you had a veranda now what is proposed to get that balance right between enabling developments while salsa achieving good design is to increase the threshold for winter resort resource consent is required to enable an assessment of urban design and is proposed to increase increase their free shall 500 square meters so any development of 500 square meters or more would be subject to the urban design assessment and that's to recognize that the key issues that we're facing in terms of urban design are the large-scale big box type developments that tint it we've seen that have the blank walls and like that interaction with the street and it's also about capturing sites that are site that has a frontage of 20 meters or more is also subject to an urban design assessment and thirdly sites that are on a corner and have a key pedestrian frontage we we see those sites as being prominent and highly visible and those sites can create landmarks within within the center as well as at the gateways to a center so essentially if there's three triggers proposed a 500 square meter threshold quang sites and sites with a long frontage and in our minds that achieves a greater balance between design was enabling development the having discussed these fresh holds which are put forward in the draft to you with the urban design team this felt to be a need to recognize that to support the suburban sift and master plans we want to ensure all developments in those areas that all development doesn't compromise the objectives of those master plans and so we're proposing to retain the previous thresholds of any development on a key pedestrian frontage within signum Sumner and in fact all development and littleton to recognize those centers where there's to recognize the character that's in those centers of those three sensors at the stage but with phase two we are looking at other master plans does that achieve quiet I understand and I think it's great those those thresholds you're putting in place does that actually pertain to tenants so certain tenants create enact the frontages so if you take the square pretty earthquake leading in from here for the street please sell you come under your beans of being a one side Anzhi back an outside to blank parameters on the ground floor totally inactive and really destroy the amenity you get them also down Manchester Street you have the you know the shooters the grumpy mole and all those bars they were shut during the day and just killed the area so tendencies it and my mind also quite crucial to understand what the tendencies are even the smaller frontages how they can actually affect in the same way that's a that example obviously as applicable to the urban centers where these rules apply and the urban design assessments rules apply to any building and decided to cover up the glazing on the frontage of that site then that that would trigger a non compliance with the urban design rules which would enable an assessment of that non-compliance in addition I should point out that uses that don't have that active frontage with the streets namely officers which can have a frosted glass window and guest accommodation we're directing that too above ground floor and really promoting the as well as residential above ground floor so we're really promoting the use of the ground floor for the types of activity that will have that relationship with the street yep I'm Tim and then 30 years is now one step before what Paul's talking about is if you looked at the old cathedral square you hit the ANC burden which first I thought was hideous did the beans that have so many different designs and the council had absolutely no control of most you go to other squares around the world and they have to conform or they're beautiful so with these standards do we have to come walk cathedral square or through those there's some key principles that will be considered as part of the design assessment so those examples you've given their all developments that would breach the fresh the fresh shop exceed the threshold of 500 square meters so effectively the BIA assessment which is limited to matters of discretion specified in the chapter and that considers not just the relationship with the street but how that development fits with the surroundings and looks at a whole range of matters so it would very much deal with the issues that have been raised here it's a quick turnaround though is enough the the design part of it yeah there's clauses that have been included in the chapter 2 not require non not require notification of those resources consent applications so effectively any application that comes in and a subject to that design assessment has to be processed within 20 working days yeah
The one one of the ones that I don't know how many you got we've got a that's 320 every community okay so that is one part a 16 debate Prague 2014 so nice easy bit of missing for Jamie yeah so yani you'd like to move that and who would like to see conduct Phil clearwater you like to speak to just a street east reserved landscape area so the board does already approved the landscape plan on delegation so it's up to the council to decide on the naming the area had been the specific site where the reservas had a house on it once called Chesterfields and it's a fantastic way story and they have the original sign that was at on their property from the owner of of the site I was named after his dog and been fantastic deputation from Simone Pearson and his son Sean and Mitchell and spoke and at the age of her I think nine and it was just fantastic and he did the entire deputation and we would like to recommend that the reciprocal example of a project where we actually can work with the community and actually it's been really a lot more cost effective for what we've managing to get where the community that's taking a really strong sense of ownership so there's actually a really good role model I think going forward and staff having fantastic at working with the local people sounds great so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carried and councillor johansson and oh there's a second one we're going to see one here Peggy closest ally Russia to yeah I stands yeah so councillor Johansson move that counselor clearwater aced East will see conduct in question of staff we did receive a memo with some more information around controls and and they had it was quite good at go really clear phone I just wanted staff whether based on that memo there was any wreckage Ainge's to the recommendations to take into account of what the toll I think it was just being a little bit more clearer about cetera et cetera so I don't know stuff wrote the memo but right staff can sort that out okay right right I'll put the motion all those who was seconded by David ice sorry counselor East yep I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and I'll now put the motion for the entire report councillor johansson councillor lonsdale seconded is there anything else in the rest I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye both close they know that's carried now they had leaf earring me community boards
That that's right yep no and here's an apology sorry for he's an apology for the meeting so Andrew tuna and Thomas Kendra moved and seconded the apologies I put the motion all those in favor say aye they suppose they know it's carried declaration of interest of course we all live in christchurch so who are all affected paper district men but I don't think anyone has an interest and any of the matters that we are proving to proceed to ministers for coming so the recommendation on the from the staff is that we received the report approve the draft
Oh sorry I page I didn't realize that was a community that was a report from oh I see okay all right yeah this is one that I think that the chair of the community committee wanted to reflect on first yeah so this should be a I don't have staff we've got the recommendations from the community committee but but the problem was this report was put on the agenda before the community committee had actually met all right yeah but it went to both I think it's nothing too low as well the community committee was up in mind that there's a number of requests for funding that are coming through both from community boards from annual plan submissions in from staff and we felt it was really important that we try and work collectively as a council to identify to inform the annual plan process the budget that we want to put advice over the next two years around all of the community facilities so we were of the mind that we should light us on the table and in order for annex ii the community committee would and normal reporting circumstances would be reporting after the annual plan so we thought it wasn't delaying it we didn't realize that this was on the agenda so I just think we need to defer this for two for two weeks and enable us to do some work as a council around how we want to fund community facilities given that there is a difference between the staff recommendation and the board recommendation and if we can try and find some common solution I think that's much better use of our time yeah well I'm what are the two counselors for the ward heavy with it my preference would be to just do it now just because I think the fisher dale community has been you know beaten for a long long time you're really suffering I respect what yarn is saying and I'll go with I'll go with the wish of the council but it would be my preference to do it now though yeah I mean I'm happy to defer but what I want community yes funding yeah so we need to sit down in the next couple of weeks and everyone needs to put forward their priorities for their wards and we need to basic sort out the budget yeah it's not particularly what that's going to go to but actually set the budgets to the community board so that they can then get on with the planning themselves yeah I entirely rakitin said one thing to there because totally endorse what refs saying we need to have a broad look at this so there's a wee bit a strategy behind it but the other thing to which I just get a little bit frightening about is that sometimes it looks like we've got a yay or nay way to go or very black and white and I think what the community ball was trying to get across is that we're wanting to ruin fence their budget so there are options if required but our preference would actually be to it sports and wider things can we do a partnership with a community group there could we sell so I think we want to try and broaden it because we want to save the council money and get a better outcome for the community I don't want to have to be tied into a black and white yay or nay way of thinking yeah all right well it yep I just want to say I support what yeah yeah and he's indicating like at least we have a process across the board it's if we were to agree to its four and a half million it's clearly example of you know first up be stressed and as a council we clearly don't want to do that so so I assume here this must lie on the table yep yep do we have any idea of the time that this is going to take as a center is closed and my second point is also the deputation this morning spoke about an economic negative impact on me the commercial sector around there and I was wondering if staff have any supporting data for that any feedback from the coop coop can we if we can kind of Britain report be done on it so that I man up yeah ok that's fine but my first question is a time and long was this process going to take two weeks we've had a initial workshop on a strategy for fixing our community facilities now and what's happened here is the community board has has taken a different approach to what the staff have recommended around that wider strategic framework which was we repaired Billings up to thirty four percent and other buildings we don't with some buildings we don't fix for a longer time but this is actually quite different so I'm working with staff to get an idea of what facilities over the next two years we can do remember the annual plan has a three year plan and we've already got two years left so we do need to try and just work out what can we actually do within that time frame and this one has a temporary facility there's others like the mud that also have a temporary facility in terms of the what I'm trying to do is get you a picture of what are the current services that we're providing where are the gaps and what's the current commitments and so we can be informed when we make that call about how much money do you want to put on budget over what time frame to address these needs all right so I'll just rule that now on the table until the consideration of the Council of the 2014-2015 annual plan but just like two weeks so um point that I'm also recommending we do the same for the sumner one which is a consider amount of funding so it's not there were another a number of other projects yeah the community committee had the staff had been requesting funding and all saying that we do that for all of them so that we can look at that wider picture it's great thank you now did we do all of the Hagley ferry me community board well no just one gosh p 0 Templeton you
Re build picks this community board 19th of me yes I've had a hip show street neighborhood park landscaping proposal yeah under the delegated authority the board has approved the landscape design in the delegation call and change the book that has to come to you guys as the the name of the reserve and there's been an extensive consultation process with flyers out in little boxes actors have been and very much a part of we've been negotiating and discussions link with both the families of the the two lady victims and we've come up with a recommendation that would be called rapini liar which means white ribbon there is also one of the families was was very in favor of the repeating marant the other family was in favor of her her reserved which is but his butterfly but what we decided was that we would put but we would put this the butterfly as an image onto the the signage for the big white butterfly butterfly in rapini marries the name and that appears to be acceptable to the families in the community what's to speak thank you just briefly I think in case you're a little bit maybe concerned over the teacher families but actors got behind the penny ma so not only is there a majority support from the community for that name I think the fact that the actors trust actually cited nearby to located nearby is behind that name is quite significant representing the community and the extensive ownership that the community has of the trust so I think we can feel quite confident and going forward that name okay I'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and Part B nothing a particular okay the rest of the report I think there was just much written notice can't find it right now but the eastern rican sport community advisory group kicks off at 12 30 today so that's a real good positive step forward for real Pegasus and getting that process underway okay you helped put the report as a whole move to a second to clean those in favor please say aye those opposed to carry thank you very much indeed thank you and we now
Um he reported the meeting of the fifth of may and the first one is in relation to hell moss lane bridge I could be evil and move the staff recommendation but I think that I would be in trouble with the board member the cat's was concerned so Jamie did you want to move the community board recommendation and ref would you like to see commit yes so um I'll hand that over to you Val um well from that community point of view end and headley fearing me to agree with us we would like I take option two and have the bridge opened to light traffic to keep that roadway open and as you've heard earlier the road has never been stopped or closed yep so yeah League I think we do need to get an explanation from staff over the deputation can we just get it clarified because it's quite concerning that we would go out with a consultation document that was factually incorrect and I you know I just sorry which what are the deputation this morning said that in the decision of council but they went back through all the minutes and there was no no such thing that they could find and they went through all the Gazzetta and it just kind of raised an important principle where we've got the consultation that's possibly being based on flawed information but I don't we haven't had the staff response to that so I would quite like I wish were dealt with anti page 132 yeah point from overseas in 1967 and the resolution was made by counsel Road be stopped and there's no record of that resolution or all the stopping that's what young and I can't respond to that having just had it I never saw a girl but I can't fall in love and the other question I had was I don't think that the skirt assessment is actually entirely fair it doesn't it just seems like they're not actually funding enough of the repair what confidence can we have that's good are actually paying for what what's needed to do to be done to I don't know dude I mean do you want to come to the table and yep okay okay look I've just received advice that if there is the case that the resolution wasn't passed then that would make the consultation floor so we are going to have to investigate whether the deputation this morning was was correct sorry I wasn't here at the time and so I don't think that there's any point going through all of these things although now that I'm going to suggest that it lay on the table until we have a report that actually accurately identifies what the situation was and whether the concentration was carried out correctly in the meantime could you find this the answer to yannis question go back and literally go through line by line mascoutah about the costings for the proposal both proposals yeah cool cool thank you so I'm just going to rule better lay on the table until we get those those reports so that leaves some Part B reports and so we'll have fun we don't need just yeah so council the Gulf and mangie that the report as a whole be adopted at there any other issues that you wanted to raise sorry to be niggling it's not my intention to but I just sort of look at this and we asked a question I in all honesty like process was that's fine but how many people are really going to sit there and not and I understand the point that's been made and it's quite correct but how many people would really go oh well you know there was a technicality that back in the 60s it wasn't really past the fact the matter is there was an earthquake is work to be done this budget associate with it do like vehicles drove across or do they not can't_''_290.61 we just make the call right now no because if we do then we open ourselves up to judicial review and you know and I just honestly thank for the for the additional time that it will take to simply check what the factual situation is it may well be and if we can establish that then I think that we simply proceed so I just I you know it's the lawyer and me I'd rather I'd rather make sure that we did things legally correctly as we can there was there anything else you wanted to raise them the report nothing more miserable okay I'll put the motion all those in favor well we're on hill was slain would it be wise for us to respond to yonI's query about the breakdown in the costs yes that's what we've asked Terry Tommy here I'm sorry thank you yeah I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now now that's up feel like the but I should doll community center I wish I
Andrea yeah not nothing particularly an open meeting okay move to me in seeking today outside the council Livingston seem to cancel at least those in favor oh those in favor please say aye well I've just been so inspired by all your speaking this morning yeah those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you
Taemin counselor Scandrick moving and seconding so are there any items and hear that you'd like to raise and I I think that there needs to be an easy process to deal and you probably love this an easy process to deal with the nzta around dangerous intersections because it's really difficult and we have brom street goes right through our ward and there are a number of dangerous intersections and it's very difficult to get any progress and our community board has been pushing this consider rule is their action and the community about the brown street Selwyn Street intersection and real concern and lots of children because it's right there addington school lots of children across there bro and yet we you know we're responsible for the infrastructure around that and section but we don't have any say about how its organized alright well Tim and then fell I just two quick things one I did mention to the chair of the philipstown still with regards to fury road that she did or they should talk with um the eddington primary school was could be quite good cross-pollination the other when the southern motorway was first brought to our community board we did point out the fact that the issue with traffic and the pressure with trevor was just moving one set of lights along and it she wasn't changing anything and to try I mean the various arguments it was kind of they just didn't listen to us but a way back then we made it very clear that the issues were just going to increase although doing is moving the issues one set of lights and they seem to be totally I'm just not heard so that has been an issue no just pointed out well before it's kind of raised its over here now yeah so I think Paul will get a later report from Spidey's community board in relation to a request that you clearly made have a workshop on this very thing so hopefully that be can be progressed and we can raise it when we meet with transit New Zealand to I Jessica this week as I come or the counselors just it would be you know we have these issues in every Ward and they all the time and it's like there's no seems to be no established process for engaging with the NZTA and it takes terra's were done counsel but how do we link up to the individual community boards I vs CSU so I wonder whether it would be worthwhile when your roles chair of the environment and transport committee to to actually pick up on the issue and may be organized a workshop with the community board cheers as well as we can certainly go wider than the local issues on here on the street and I think that's a good suggestion and because paul says there are other there are others that have state highway going through this beer would Pegasus does julie pub know and it's but it's particularly and I think what balls are learning to it's particularly when there are local communities for example cell and village who people who want to come off Brom street and two and as the board say at each hands oh yeah Pauline and we our boards never had any problem inviting NZTA along they always come along that really happy to talk through their plans and we found them really quite good to deal with do you invite them along um we have thank you um and I I have found it difficult to get everybody together so I mean we I mean council clear waters the previous you might want to comment on this but you know we have been trying to get some interaction about this intersection for a while um yeah poor McMahon's creek that it has been difficult arranging meeting entering she have the the trends that people at those meetings and it's something which will make a free request on that's all we can do that but it's the issues now really important it has dragged on far too long yeah we've got a presentation is it is it tomorrow yeah so we can raise it directly within CTA tomorrow yani um is this some water work that needs to happen around Brown Street I'm my father true there's a government has a recovery program or playing around putting in so yeah this is an important intersection but it seems like this probably plans to shut other intersections along brahms street to enable the flow of traffic are you guys aware of any kind of wider look at braums street and what the future holds and because we've got the same issue around the 4 f's where we actually need understand as a community board what roads are going to be sharp and how traffic is actually going to fly I am not aware although I would suggest that you know when we're told that if you put in a right turn arrows across brown street then it will mock up all the all the light timing but we've already got right tune errands on a number of those intersections we had right to narrows on all of them and that they were all that all the light sequences were working together so you still had good flow that would be really could work wave Ward is that the main issue is fundamental problem with we're expecting a lot more traffic to go down braham street because of the motorway and because of what we're doing in the central city we keep putting in traffic lights at every chance we get for extra development or writing changes and it's completely congesting our network well it's about safety and it and also it's about making sure that the light sequences work together to reduce congestion I mean I brown street without if you're not considering the people going across brown street you're making a brick wall for the community has already pretty much a brick wall and then going through addington and setting them and wealthy by by not dealing with that the issues of going across brands do it and tuning across it you're just making it even more impenetrable well let's leave it as a measure to follow up you know with your counselor and and community board initially and then if anything further needs to be taken from that then we'll we'll see what we can arrange but but with the NZTA tomorrow all right thank you so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you I think they're very much Paul
And Andrew who is the other deputation is actually going to do his deputation at two-thirty because he's just received the report and so have you so that allows you to have a chance to read the report and make some sense of it before he actually submits so he's coming back at he's going to be here at two-thirty to make that submission and andrea needs to go quite soon so we're going to start the community boards with burwood Pegasus with the permission of a pariah oh thank you thank you very much so um 20 second of april we've got a pave the easement over the South Brighton south lee Brice and reserved no issues that that I'm aware of what that it's just a standard these men transactions item 17 guys sorry I don't hit that online okay that's it yeah that was incredibly simple thank you okay a parte item that easement moved Glynn seeking to david okay I'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the Part B items reports Class C just um number 17 just a note that the board had indicated there were multiple quotes a source for associated costs and that has been rectified by staff slow caged up thank you but may the fifth can I put that report as a whole so those in favor please say aye those opposed carried who would pick a system eighth
And now Andrea come on I was done oh she's been without food Twinkie oh wow so what are we up to number 20 Pendleton y Mari community board foul and so I'm assuming that riff Mandy and Jamie golf would like to move and second the first report is there anything that you want to raise on that there's Part B report and no it's nothing really on that having on the air you've got fear the challengers with them silver birch trees I see but they're still being worked on we wish more reports from the sky we're expecting a report back from you at some point ice to speak okay no that's fine I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Kerry and now we move to the one that I thought would be dealt with by the time I got
What what we may do I think in the interests of all of the people in the gallery is move to the item the hagley ferrymeter community board um item that item 24 page 201 hey sarah good morning good morning um you've heard uh tony speak um I think it's pretty clear we um it's not just about education in phillipstown it's about community the council has invested a lot over the years in strengthening the community in that area and it is centred around the school we need a two-year reprieve and the board like to recommend to council that they support phillipstown in their bid for a two-year reprieve and we would like you guys to do that today please I thought earlier that we said that we were just going to deal with this and then go back I've got several other parties for later in the meeting yeah yeah I think it would be good coming from the deputy mayor and maybe one of us um but no I i think the significance of this is it's really important that moves it the better so it's supported by tony and uh moved by me may not be helpful at the ministry of education but I'm very happy to be here but I am very happy to move um I i think that the whole issue of what we have in our community and the community infrastructure is really really important and the key part of our infrastructure while waste waters are really important and roads are really important the very key part of any city is its people and if people are working together well and supporting each other and doing things that we want to have happen in our city then that's actually well worthy of us supporting so I have no problem with the fact that we are stepping into the area of the ministry of education or a government decision this is our community and I totally agree with the people of phillipstown that we need to stand up for what we think is absolutely right I have never supported the closure of phillipstown school I think it's a daft move and for the benefits of its community is absolutely pivotal just as great community centres are pivotal great swimming pools are pivotal and a school is all about its people it takes as we know a village to raise a child and in this instance this village is going to grow quite dramatically I thought the point about sea level rise and the flood prone nature of some of the sites was really important actually I don't quite understand completely the ministry of education rationale in all of these mergers and closures at all but I think this is a community that has proven to us time and time again that it wants to achieve an outcome that works not only for the kids but for the whole families in that area it's an area we have over a long period of time put a lot of effort and resource into and it's not just because that that we've invested in it it's the fact that it works and that community wants it to stay and I think if a community tells you what it wants job incredibly easy our job is simply to represent those communities and if that requires us asking the government to do something that it's not currently planning to do that's very very simple from our point of view so I'm very happy to move it and seconded by yani do anybody want to speak let me guess yeah thank you um I strongly urge councils to support this motion this is really important and I know and I thank council for the support that they've previously given to phillipstown school but I think the point that was made is that as more and more information comes to light many of the concerns and issues that were raised in the initial consultation have borne out to become reality and I just want to hold up two maps one is the first is the intensification map and we know that this area in yellow and you can see phillipstown school here this is what's happening to our city this is the zoning that we have around phillipstown which the government as you recall wanted to extend right our district plan so we know that government want us to intensify in areas around where activity happens and fundamental to having intensification as a requirement to have schools so it's totally contrary to what government want to do in terms of intensification to be closing this school this is not a merger it is a closure let's be really clear about that the second map is the flood hazard met and this is and you can't see because it's it's not in high enough detail but what you can see from this map is a little a little piece of green space just just here it's really tiny but you can see that this blue is woolston and this little green green spot is phillipstown it's actually outside of our flood area so you can see really clearly that the proposal to close the school and put it into woolston into a significant area of flood risk makes no sense and these maps have just again come out recently before the substantial opportunity was to present this information so that's two and I ask council to support this is that this is about local democracy we know this is a government that doesn't respect democracy but we as a council do we as a city have a proud tradition going back to kate shepard of being a democratic and progressive society in this town called christchurch and we should adhere to those values above all else and we've heard the concern about the democracy and the lack of it that is happening in this case just think about what message it sends to the phillipstown community to have already appointed the new board of trustees before the nominations have closed that is outrageous that is unacceptable that is not the sort of democracy that we should be living in in a modern day new zealand society and at the very least we should be sending a clear signal to government that what they're doing here is fundamentally and absolutely wrong it is in breach of people's basic democratic human rights and we should oppose what they're doing and in conclusion I'll just say totally endorse area over the past two decades we as a council we as a society have invested in phillipstown we've seen the government take the stadium and move it away from phillipstown we've seen a loss of things in this area while the school has remained if you take the school away from this area you are taking away its heart and that will have a huge negative social consequence and so it is absolutely right that we stand up and oppose and ask for a reprieve the government is acting in isolation against its own housing department its own police department those departments have invested huge resources into this area as have we as a council and government interested in issues of financial efficiency should know that why waste good money why waste that investment for a short-term gain at a long term cost to us as a society and us as a city so I commend phillipstown school for standing up I commend that local community for standing up and I urge this council to stand up and support I'll stand up as well we're but this is a very significant issue uh very something very fishy about this there's no clear rationale for the closure we have marched we've protested over the closure of phillipstown school there's still no clear understanding over the intent for by which it's being closed naomi klein and disaster capitalism writes about good ideas waiting for a disaster to happen that's the only conclusion I can come to at this point it's an idea that's been waiting in the wings earthquake comes along let's merge two schools which as my colleague councilman hans has just said is actually the closure of of two communities it does fly in the face of logic when you look at the investment by housing new zealand and also by this council as well in that local community and I take very much to heart what you've said here today tony and team about the about local democracy we do know our our communities best we knock on their doors walk the streets and uh interact with them daily and weekly this is about democracy along with yani to to fully support this I'm not an eloquent concert because the english is my second language however I fully support the hagrid family community board and also field time the school board trustee recommendation to reply two years you know for the uh considered the merger of philippine school and with the wall street school the first reason is I was touched by the the airport trustee the issue is the this kind of the decision making by the ministry of education was pre-consent so right now the demographics has the bigger significant change so the tony the he mentioned earlier this decision was not based on interest for the children and for the community is touch touch my heart because we are aware actually the children are kids it's our aside it's our future it's our hope and also they will become the pillars in this country that's very important if they're the the kind of school time period they are unhappy to study you know if the change in their study environment probably they have not achieved a's not not benefit the to the this company community and also to these countries so this is my particular the the concern and also the the other figure you know is compared to the after earthquake significant in philly pound survey surrounding the area the increase for the 8.4 the percentage is rather than normal you know it's a drug there's the the figure okay speaking you know I will touch the figure so I would like to you know council can engage with the minister of education and also some other government agency or enough profit agency to dealing with the issue this is my my my thought yeah thank you um andrew and then paul and jamie I've got I'm not sure so sure whether I'll be as eloquent as jimmy or not but I'll do my best um it would be easy to think that this debate's about education but this in fact is about a whole lot more than education this is about community and in this case it's about a community which has clearly got the is strong and connected and vibrant and has got a lot of community groups and community activities going on within it where the school has been an essential part of the the networking and the relationship building that's allowed all of that good work to happen now my banks peninsula award has an example of where there's a merger of two schools in littleton which is is logical and and which has been done for the most part very well what we're seeing today is an example of a merger which seems to be illogical and which isn't being done so well and I i have some concerns um prior to the meeting this morning and I have certainly more concerns as a result of what I've seen and heard this morning so I i certainly commend the the school and it's board for for taking the action they've taken I commend the um littleton I commend the um hagley ferrymeed um community board for taking um the action that they've taken in bringing this recommendation to us today council it could whatsoever but we definitely have a role to play in community um and it's for that reason that I'll certainly be supporting the recommendation today well I'm a first-term counselor and I've been observing my new community my my community prior this earthquake was uh privacy been elected was the central city it was my job in that role to actually build a city community and I work with the police I work with the businesses and and the people in the city and I know actually how hard it is to build a heart it is incredibly hard and it takes a lot of effort a lot of stress and I think the phillipstown school and the police and the community have actually shown the rest of the city what it does and what it needs to do to actually keep themselves together and if we don't support this then we're not supporting keeping communities together I think you guys have done an absolute tremendous job and one thing I really really admire is the fact that you haven't taken no for to get yourselves to the point where you actually feel that you're getting something you deserve and I think you deserve to be supported I think the people of phillipstown deserve to be supported and I think we need to support our police who have actually shown an incredible effort in reducing the issues in the city so we're not just supporting this community we're actually supporting our city and the people that actually look after our city tony you and your team support the city and you support your community really really well I think the policing unit that are in there helping you are supporting your community but actually they're supporting the wider community by reducing those issues and if you want to take one model of actually how to do it you guys have shown what that model is and if we don't support it we're not supporting a model for actually growing a better city it's funny actually because you know I'm a second-term counsellor now and I think I've changed in a lot of ways over've got heria um but well no it's a winter coat ellie don't get carried away here um but I i think I would have been a counselor that would have come in here and um and told you to stick to your knitting I think in the early days so often council gets far too ahead of itself and does a whole lot of things they never needed to do and goes into spaces which they're totally unqualified to even talk in uh and and I'm not saying that that doesn't happen all the time I I'm not saying that we're perfect but I think I was a person that would have been pretty clear that this is a governance role when you take a flight to uh to wellington or something next week and you and your and your flight's delayed you don't ring up a director of new zealand and have a cup of coffee with them talk about it that does happen as a councillor though but this actually just isn't a true governance role and a city councillor is that that's actually why you want to do this role because you want to be a part of it and doesn't mean there's a little bit of governance and management meddling at times yeah there is but it's our job to do it I think where I've also changed a bit over the last five years is that well government has its role in council has its role I think a big part of our role is to be an advocate for the community I think that probably four years ago I would have said you've got an education department that's in place to make a call and we've got roads to repair and put together a budget that balances for an annual plan and I think why I'm standing up here today telling you guys that I support the resolutions in front of us and saying that I endorse what the community have come and told us today is because I think that's really important as a role of a city councillor I think I't necessarily stuck to their knitting and I and this isn't a dig but the crown has never been uh so holier than now to uh to never put on a dig when they thought that we were doing something wrong so if I've learned something over how a relationship's been at times it's not about one upsmanship but it's about standing up for what you believe and I ran for council because I love my city and I want everyone else to love it as much as I do and I'm not so stupid to think that it's only one aspect that makes this city is it an economy important yeah of course it is but it's it's a waste of time if you don't have the infrastructure you know is infrastructure important yes of course it is but if you've got no people to fill it and no passion in there it's all just a waste of time it's like legs of a chair and one thing in isolation is utterly irrelevant so I was of people that are so passionate about their community come along here this morning and it makes me pretty proud as a city councillor to slightly step out of what's my knitting and to meddle the governance and management because I think you guys have done a bloody good job and I support you I thought it was a daft idea from the start I think it's a daft idea now and is it my role to really support this and go to the government saying it's probably not but I'm happy to and I'm proud to so good on you guys I put that motion I suspect it might pass okay so it's moved and seconded and I'll put that motion those in favor please say aye those post carry unanimously thank you very much um actually the at 10 30 there was a cup of tea and coffee served um so it is out there so we'll break for 10 minutes is that okay um you're all very welcome I don't know how many cups there are so'll be back here in 10 minutes which is yeah which is 10 55.
And that's moved by Thomas Kendra second up by Phil Clearwater strengthening communities grants review to the LTP yes so I mean that it simply put that over the last decade the funding discretionary funding for community boards that goes to our community groups has been cut and I know that the current financial environment for the council is a particularly Rosie but over the next decade I hope that we can increase step funding and an LTP back to what it was and before that cuts started because we get some stinking our groups to active and run on shoestring budgets and I see anything can move towards more high trust funding would be excellent as well yeah I think the wording of this needs to be just reflecting early discussions that we had which is that that this recommendation be referred to to the consideration of the long-term plan yeah so just leave the recommendation as it is but just say that that that what with the motion that we're moving is that the the community boards recommendation is referred to the council's consideration of're not tying our hands we're not making a decision on it but you know it's perfectly valid way to raise a an issue that you want us to have on the agenda and given the timing of the next set of considerations after the annual plan it's very good timing indeed thank you so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and part be moved by phil clearwater seconded some Scandrick there any other issue an area you'd like to raise I just want to raise that there needs to be an easy process for people who want to start community gardens and net and they need to work with the I can't remember the name of the organization but that there is you just do it there's also another group that and tries to work with all the community gardens and support them at the moment the process is not easy and it should be you know and I mean and also we we know where there is risks of contamination and I don't understand what why it's so difficult we get people say oh let's do this and then they encounter layers of barriers to doing so and it should be easy yeah but I don't think you'll find anyone around this table that disagrees with you and that's why we wrote the words can do into the new chief executives country so for a process for that to happen there's a community group I make who specialize in the area of edible gardens and edible fruits they're making a submission of environmental committee at our next meeting and two weeks time so we'll look at a processed and sure that in fact it's straightforward if you might want to come into you luckily and this that that we're toast on the whole food fight conflict is coming to the Environmental Committee on the twentieth and the ability for people to be able to do edible trees Gardens whatever is part of that so yeah great news yep that's great and I mean I couldn't agree with and having looked at what they've done in Sierra was just it's extraordinary that the amount of energy that you can get from a matching approach so instead of you know communities having the council coming to set up a community gardens that's actually you know matching the resource with you know support professional support from our people that that are involved in our garden etc and then also blinking and some financial support as well matching up with the community support so I just I just loved the idea I think we can be doing heaps of us so like in home last time our board got a memo about pros community garden we had no less than 20 reasons why not now and that was it you know that hmm Kent Kent can you send me a list can you see me that memo yes hmm I'd love to say it because I always I tell the story of the Fendall someone because I've gone to a community gardens meeting over Easter last year and I heard the people from fiend altar and give their community Gardens it up and it was just such a set of traumatic you know sort of interchanges that I thought all of you know at least it must have been worth it in the end I drove past it when I was on a ticket or with the community board before the election last year and we saw this these I mean it would literally three sort of three or four you know raised garden you know just really small tiny part of this almost like a pocket park so it's a tiny part of this little park and it was like they've gone to all of this trouble for this but it was worth it because of the sign the sign said working be here every saturday at ten o'clock and it was it's the community coming together that's what makes it worthwhile and I have to say that the less which Paul is referring to I didn't realize gardening was so dangerous actually let's personally why I stay away from that that's right but anyway um so say aye those opposed say no carried thank you sorry now we're on to the next the next one spreading heathkit again this is a counselor
Yeah I'm yes it does yes it does cool it just into the public understanding of this well that's a whole different issue well no because it was beige color when it came to us previously and now now it's the same color as the neighboring and even further down around submit for example it's the same thing so it's really unclear where the zoning actually applies this is where the different intensification happy honestly I think in terms of the iconology that's been used here if you look at the R&D zone that it has an area as I understand it that's dotted and blue and the residential suburban density area has there's an area thats an overlay of red dots which is about management area for its management for you if you look at the cinema area you don't ask anymore you're quite right I think it's actually counselor all right yeah we can make it clear it oh can I say I'm really like that on the pages that you had that you showed us think okay so we're now down to how this is actually expressed we're agreed that is actually what we should be okay um and you've taken it on board equal is there any other current minute can we please just make a valid point u- up there yes you absolutely know yet patient needs we make clearer yep that's cool any other general questions going sure now settle in question but I would like to bring to your attention if you don't mind just paragraph 6.2 that paragraph notes that there is still a little bit of work to do which we haven't been able to complete before we can to you today and I just want to be sure that you're comfortable with that it's not changing any of the content of the chapter it's simply more information that we're waiting to go into the section 32 to support what we're promoting in the chapter financial hazards and also for new neighborhood provisions okay in lastly just to reflect the discussion that we had around the commercial centers bullet point that sees something like for sending them Sumner and little turn the provision of urban design and the earlier draft shall apply something like that yep Paul we yes you discussed looking at how we can activate the provision of some community space for perhaps transportation within some of these large suburban sinners they're expanding and whether there needed to be a floor sighs activation points of it and I think we only did it for the new ones didn't we I think we were only able to do it for the new ones we had a question of discussion about that yeah we did we actually put a floor sighs attached to it an expansion of a flawless wives of I already passed it the outcome of the discussion at the last workshop was that as part of phase two and Ally development plans would be prepared for all our creativity sensors and for that process we can plan the location of public transport facilities for instance in addition to that as part of phase two we would to develop provisions to take financial contributions center and that work would include identification of the appropriate for yourself so again developing these lesions could also be land that'll be a lot of space yeah land or money could be taken through provisions on financial contributions and a district plan but we wouldn't be able to duplicate those with developed development contributions okay I've cancelled you a cup of coffee afternoon and on the basis that you'll be finished in three minutes hit there Jimmy review your original nine point of three particularly mention if we approved amendments sections that if you have a constant travel chapters you were under the five point of three in the right but all those the capital weather is a three-pointer three all those the chapter on me I mean though your documentation 9.23 all those least we're be under the guys are additional I upon your email oh no sorry I've changed under 9.3 I've just before he started deleting it should relate to 6.1 another degree was a mistake that was an area but yeah I'll get my pleasures but how mean because the all those the section 32 and the chapter all you here am I right if some of a chapter we have not yet a two-piece review whether we're pulling here or no no no just painting your face of chapters will come to you to go through exit this exact same process yes so no really only talking about priority chapters that you've already been through today okay okay red yeah thank you just so we don't forget the mail oh yes yes and so we want that shifted to be considered in part of phase two so you okay with another bullet point yeah yep you could with it goodness excellent come up what days reckon bone so that's I someone in the industrial park you know is delayed yeah we'll say we'll take any provisions objective policies rules relating to the mail site out and we'll bring them forward again inside a face full of all thank you for some journey is this so I just wanted to UM chick on and unfortunately me it's gone but clear here we have no agreement with government over what's going to happen we have no agreement over time frames powerpoints commissioners and I'll see you later so I just I just think it's really important that we understand basically the this document will go to the minister without an agreed price ease when it comes back to us we are able to make changes based on on anything or just on what the minister says and then it goes out for public so firstly I mean while we don't have an ordering council and place by the government they're obviously has been ongoing dialogue regarding that so as the mayor pointed out this is submitted an anticipation of that and I think basically if you look at 9.2 it does a subject to the subject to approval of the government's order and council so we wouldn't we're not recommending we submit that until the order on councillors actually sign don't do to mean we don't give it so we approved it to go to the ministers today but we's that's what we're recommending that because we believe that to be imminent but until that signed we wouldn't recommend submitting this to that to the to the Minister for the very reasons you've outlined and how can we know what given that it's taken so long Duke and we know what well that's something you've delegated to the mirror and to a small group of councillors who have met on a number of occasions with Sarah of enemy of the official Sarah officials you're disgusting but but we did that before we've done this so we've done this ahead of that process been concluded well we've done that we've done that because we we anticipate the time frame they're working together the outset so we are anticipating a timeline we know we have with the lips ears 2016 to get that we're on a very fine timeline so we've done this based on all that knowledge that's been built up through that dialogue yes we saw need to see the final order and positions are the ones that signed we're in a position to submit that and ideally that would be signed in order for us to be able to submit that by the 9th from I to j okay and so just the submissions so emission process it comes back from the minister unto come back for the minister we can make change we can only make changes in respect of the medicine boat raised by the minister and if we chose not to make changes in the quarters of those ministerial suggestions because there are any suggestions we simply have to give reasons as to why we don't the in council still has to approve the entire document to be notified publicly at which point the submission process begins when we will meet just the point I really want to understand is when we approve it to be notified publicly if more information comes to light over for you know in a few weeks time new issues are raised that we haven't foreseen do we have the ability to change what we publicly notify interfaces we don't would have the ability to submit on the review as council always have had the ability to submit on their own drafts okay can I put these staff recommendations now with the changes as suggested in front of you that's moved by Paul and it is that will you moving it or you're moving it and seconded by Pauline okay we're good I put these those in favor please say aye those opposed carried thank you all who's the UM awesome to actually get that off the table this thank you thank you
Have the chair of the spread and hiccup community boards welcome Paul our first item on the agenda is a part a report proposed revocation of reserve status and that will be moved by Thomas Kendra's and seconded by Phil Clearwater so would you like to speak to that one first if they're found the I mean the clear reason for doing this is because the the reserve isn't needed for recreation purposes in it could be available for social housing and that that's what the board strongly recommends that a LAN be used for the provision of social affordable housing and across its city and but I also wanted to note that you know I think that the best use of resources for the council at the current time is to focus on repairing those that can be repaired no social housing us that can be repaired but you know we our borders very strongly support through strongly supports the expansion and repair of our social housing portfolio yep does anyone want to comment on that or I'll just put a question um totally of an integrated housing development but IM consumed that where we've got a proposal to intensify we're reducing green space maybe him have you given any consideration to some of it being retained as a reserve for the intensive housing that's going to be put in spice it's not really green space I mean it currently has a facilities used facility on it that was used by the model engineers who are now in halls well and was used by a radio an amateur radio organization they're not using it anymore either and there is like you know there's plenty of green space in the area so I mean that our board is also you know the loves green space in our community does too but in this instance it doesn't appear to be a major concern or issue Tim Scandrick it's a very good point but if you look look at page 85 you'll see the aerial shot that I'm well and truly two-thirds of the area pretty well taken up with some kind of building or s veld peace within that debt site plan is very close so you know we were fully aware of that prosimian park is a good size park and very close to that area I was just thinking of like a little neighborhood pocket part but maybe as part of that development you can go through the other question I had was those facilities that are currently they're no longer being used by the the community roads but with any other community groups that could use those in the interim as that being looked at it had been looked at and it it's not a very useful facility for anyone other than the model engineers and it has and the staff have followed up the groups and the only group set you know the group group that was using it has found other facilities and I guess that is because we're visiting it for you know we take revoking reserve status as a decision of the council property unit to decide how best to use that and so I mean you know having adequate green space for social housing tenants development is going to include adequate for in space I would think and hope and certainly the board wouldn't want to see a development done in such a way that there wasn't enough green special too tense yep so essentially our we're adopting the board's recommendations so we would agree with you that that we would recommend to the unit that the lamb be used for the provision of social or affordable housing so I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you and now we move to the report as a whole so that's moved by filthy water and second thomas tandra is there anything in there that you'd like to raise with us I'm sorry in the report of the eggs the balance out the report yeah I love of the 15 if I just to point out that removing and that there is proposal to remove the bus route from Kashmir and there's a very nice bus shelter there that was erected amid some controversy and I would hope of that route going in Kashmir which goes up hecht on road and then dies pass rate or something like that have you is this mention done yours it um yes is oh it's just because occasionally a village green with a bus stop is oh I can't hit me yes sorry that's happy deputations about kashmir village green so you're talking about the council making a submission to the two EK non its bus routes yeah my recollection paul is that the community board included that bus route in your submission which council took into account am I right on there I saw that it's on agenda for one of the committee's and to discuss the deputation the the council submission that's why I've raised it so the community boards submissions will certainly take into account when those submissions will notify council sessions close next week don't they don't do 19 they've been certainly they've been they've gone through the 16 that they went to some extent but ok this is the community boards commissions all and we were pinned them all to the submission they went forward to weekend oh great good excellent thank you thank you so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and then we've got the apart a measure on the meeting of the set
And the final request was that to electricity related strategic documents be included in the glossary and as I've advised earlier for other reasons that close resection of the definitions chapters now been deleted in its entirety so there is now no class read and to watch those power plants yep that all looks good thank you the vision statement here ptooey Eamon I just produced some papers and it's probably easier if people refer to those satisfying on from the last workshop where the vision statement became a set of strategic outcomes and was proposed to be put into the introduction chapter and my understanding since I'd too it's about on that was that there was a request for a table to identify how the strategic outcomes related to the objectives and the strategic directions chapter so the very first document that's paper clipped on which is this table shows this the strategic outcomes and I'll go through those and bit more detail in a minute and then the right-hand column indicates the objectives that relate to those strategic outcomes so moving on closely at the strategic outcomes themselves and that's the next page for the first page of the staple portion which has some purple wording on it we've made a number of changes in this document from what you saw last time and the purple wording indicates the changes first of all the the first couple of paragraphs are really just minor changes that fits in to where it's now going into the introduction chapter but the main changes are the changes to the outcomes themselves and here we've tried to identify and highlight how the plan will deliver on the outcomes that are understood that the government has imperatives so there are some additional things like under outcome one there you'll see a new lying sufficient name for housing industry commerce etc through 2028 we understand that that that was a imperative for the government and so the all editions following below there are similar auditions for that purpose plus on the second the back of that sheet will see a new out come out come seven which is contaminated land which I understand was workshop let's we'll just give everybody this yep right look right um so number nine the healthy environment p yep where it says endemic flora fauna and the relationship with my targeting to the criteria is at least as apparent as European connections in the designer places open to questions really how are you supposed to measure something like that and secondly one of the issues around drainage that I'm constantly being told about from let's say older persons have been around for a long time suggests that a lot of the water flow issues stem from a shift to a more ecological approach to planting riverbanks for example with native grasses hmm and the rest of it yeah so I'm just I mentioned those two aspects like how how you going to measure success sounds like something that would be quite difficult to measure I'm sparkling lights is it a bit of sort of gospel or is it a realistic thing I think it the highly will these are pitched out which is I think in terms the first point you're raising areas that are often against tonight oh and there that is what I think it's trying to say is that we're there is the opportunity to do that such as a new developments that that opportunity is taken as much where the lira significance to know Tahu in terms of their relationship with the land both historic and current as in recognizing past European associations with that area so I think it's a matter of level the detail of that will come out obviously more in terms or that specific provisions of the plane such as a massive division chapter but also there is a planet eronel chip to propose in the second stage as well and the end the heritage chapter of course to which will look a technological sites and cultural sites of significance to tanger tofino are I should also add that there are sections under the Resource Management Act that actually require us as a council to include that certain things in our district plan and this is one of them I think was more the language at least as a parent is a parents just some kind of equality at least as a parent suggest something that more than that equality so other expected to be changes when I played if this edition for a bit of weird is I think it was just just trying to give their indication that that profile needs to be lifted and that this is the opportunity to do so well could we use the language that the profile of I'm surprised that so um maybe I'm just thick but endemic doesn't seem like the right word to me indigenous and Dimmick yeah indigenous and the names of some economies yeah suggests it's everywhere that's the thing yeah that's right happy so yeah yeah so it's what what did you say improve the profile of indigenous flora and fauna while maintaining our European connections and the designer places I think you could have mentioned both but I think refs picked up on something that would be did the second issue that you raised get it's just sort of the whole planting issue oh you're surrounded in terms actual engineering aspects of our Riverways so is its outcome sucks natural hazards when it's um yes as Peter said the key chapters that this will manifest itself and these issues will be that chapters yet to come to you so that's primarily the heritage and natural environment chapter and it's not to say that all indigenous trees plants to be protected not at all but there will be scheduled areas such as ecological areas where they will be we had that gut the market gardener guy in a few weeks ago he was saying that exactly it's gardens were being ruined by the way the banks where the banks are being planted right yep hey just a loser thank you yeah I mean it's a certainly take both there's no no I think that the outcome sex is sufficient to say you know that there are there's a there's a balance there on there Yanni turned about the process so the strategic outcomes what you're telling us as you've amended this to take into account what government wants now understand why we do that why not we just submit to the minister and he's got that process but why would you make changes after we've already considered this no no no no no we haven't considered this what we've done is we've we asked to produce a kind of a vision statement for us to ensue and to the introduction so that it wasn't part of the chapter it wasn't part of the district plan review because we were told that if we went through that process of having a set of principles that we could really understand their look so if you take out come one even extent I don't believe that we had a discussion about putting that in you said you've put that in because government wanted you to put it up no we're having the discussion now we're and we're sending us off to the government and I've certainly ask them to frame things in a way that that I'm hoping that will be acceptable to the government but this I _''_570.319 printed efficient learn but how do you measure a sufficiently because but we know the government wants to just keep increasing the supply of land regardless of outcome so currently a zoning we've got more than sufficient zoning capacity for housing but people aren't developing it so we're in zoning more land to be developed which seems kind of but how do you made it cool but it's the phrase all we're talking about is the phrase yani so one of the strategic outcomes of this district plan review an hour district plane will be that there is sufficient land available for housing understreet commercial and other urban activities so you know in accordance with the Canterbury regional policy statement it's a it's just a statement of of what the intent or the purpose of the district planners what I'm trying to understand though in real terms what this means is potentially to get the government has a different view about what sufficient does than us so if we have a 10 here we're actually opening up an opportunity for them comfortable with and that's my concern I can perhaps help yeah I can stall the provider a useful answer here that the reason there's a particular reference here to the regional policy statement is because the government had actually indicated how much land it expects to be provided in terms of fuel and through the amendments that made to the regional policy statement through the land use recovery plan so there's a statement here is just indicating that what has already been what we have already been required to do what we and the Regional Council have already been required to provide is what we're proposing to provide areas like the Northwest which we still have yet to review the mail site those are all the government has said we need to change those so we will do all Lear is there was a plan that was produced at one of the earlier workshops which had the greenfield areas indicated on it to the green blobs right around the city which came from the regional policy statement all those areas are now in the regional policy future and we required in our district plan to give effect to the regional policy statement so we are required to rezone those two even in the future so this statement is really just a reflection of what we're required to do anyway but it reinforces one of the points that we understand is particularly important for the government which is that we do actually get to resigning all those areas of land except we haven't had a discussion with our community about whether they want us to resign until what extinct that's already been done though okay I mean under for why what is it also eps of our if I could just draw your attention to paragraph four point one point six of the report you just if there's a sentence in there that says similarly the loop directs the city to ensure twenty thousand seven hundred and forty two houses are enabled through the proposed district plan by 2028 now we went through the figures with you as part of the residential chapter and we indicated to you how that can well be we know that we can meet the guidance of the solute statement it actually stated a number of houses and we did indicate you threw a chart via which happy to sit through again how that is actually going to be achieved through the residential chapter as it stands at the moment and the consultation as the mayor has indicated has occurred through the five weeks engagement phase that we went through with the community I was interested in the area in the northwest that we were having some you know doing his face the northwestern review area doesn't intend to have any housing allocations as such all of the housing allocations have been gone through with you as part of the residence Jeff down just in terms of one in terms of sufficient learnt the housing industry commercial what I heard you just say was the regional policy statement has already resigned that lean so effectively we can't do anything inconsistent with that so that area has effectively been resigned it's not resigned in the sense of zoning for a district plan it's indicated as plan the actual zoning has to occur in the district plan only the district plan can allocate land use zoning laws and I was to some can understand for increased housing opportunities within other lower density suburban areas what does that mean so that's the additional minor houses that you would have heard about as part of the residential chapter so the minor residential units the small residential units that are being proposed to be allowed on sections on existing sections with existing houses so it's those thoughts of the provisions none of the what we tried to do with these additions the things in purple is really just pick up on anything we could think of that is already in the plan has already been proposed has already come before the counselors in terms of the workshops that we think are particularly important for the government to see that that's what we are trying to achieve so there's there's nothing proposed and here there is new the reading here just picks up some of the points perhaps that we've picked up and first and buggy as strategic outcomes whether we're actually being bold enough with them they they strike me as somewhat sort of kind of a bit not bold enough in terms of what we want to achieve with the district plan and I would have thought what we were trying to achieve with the district plan was actually creating very vibrant lively communities and what we seem to have done right the way through is to make sure that those communities interact well through public and active transport with the amenities that the people living in those communities need now and potentially into the future and the other sort of guiding consideration seems to have me it seems to me to have been that we have looked for example in the housing at much higher environmental standards we want good design and we want to sort of put the human interface such that it fits with the environmental constraints rather than continually trying to fight the environment because we will lose that battle and I would have thought we could have been a bit more a bit bolder in what district plan like the fact that we do want to create vibrant library community lively communities where people interact easily and effortlessly and we're public an active transport links people easily to the everyday amenities those and then something about this means great design leed environmentally sustainable buildings and planning and where the human interface if it's worth rather than seeks to fight environmental constraints or something that actually sees what we're trying to achieve rather than just we'll go this far because this is what we've been told to do because my concern is that at a later stage of this that the design and the human elements of us will get zapped a bit and I'm really keen that we put them right there it's kind of in your face so that they're much harder to take out I totally like that and I wonder whether we could just capture those words and put them as the as the introductory paragraph to the strategic outcomes so that you know the instead of saying the strategically and use outcomes for the were just seed and then say that the these you know and in particular we are seeking these outcomes you know because I mean what in a way we got ourselves into this position because we talked ourselves away from having a set of guiding principles because of the fear that that would be an influence how the there just how the plan was interpreted and would give people the opportunity to challenge things whereas and so we move to the let's take the outcomes that we've got already identified and the various chapters and make them that said but then they've become outcomes and we've lost that set of guiding principles and that I mean but he's just in capsulated and a single paragraph in my view the essence of what we're trying to achieve I understand and totally accept that we can do that like it's I would bring you back to the point of the objectives and policies though and the objective state exactly what has been requested by councilor buck but there's no harm and restating some of things like high quality residential environment there's me there's nothing that joins it up and it make trouble when you're doing a chapter-by-chapter it's kind of like yeah silo mentality applied to a Russian it's written form rather than a organizational form
List of may and the first item on that reporters the Derek reserve proposed stock bank also parte requiring a decision of the council so moved by pauline cotta seconded by andrew tuna I would you like to speak to that I once again the the board was supportive of this busy can't staff available there are some questions that need to be sorry I'm just sorry is there any questions or comments I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know carried and then counselor Tata and Turner would like to move and second that the reporters a whole be adopted was there anything else in the report that you'd like to George our teacher Oh Pauline podrace in the correspondence 6.1 on page 70 that the board has been corresponding with the district health board and we were seeking clarification on the role and the participation with the flooding task force in also expressing a desire for the board to be included on that communication we were particularly communicating with th be around the health issues on the contamination so the way our last communication was 11th of june so we're just waiting another response from you yeah you know the just a note on that the as part of the flooding task force the district health board has been asked to provide an international literature review looking at the impact of flooding in particular on people and properties that are affected so and that that report has been received and it is going through a process of being briefed to counselors and I think we've got a briefing on it next week so and it's a very important document and we will obviously have to brief community boards on it as well because it does raise considerable concern about the psychosocial and physical impacts on the health of people and flood affected areas it's a really important issue yeah it's the feedback that we picking up from our community they've got really big health concerns so the board needs to be informed about their in order to provide a good response yes it's encouraging yeah that's next week but I made me think that maybe what we need to do is to get the community board cheers unto that meeting as well so I'll make a note of that myself thank you so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much thank you and
Um and amendments deemed and send them off to the minister for the Canberra earthquake recovery and the Minister of the Environment their consideration comments over 15 working days subject to the satisfactory approval of the government's all done council so I'm not sure that his that the government's order and council hasn't yet been completed but we are working to the time frame that I should turn on my microphone this isn't the last time that we as a council will see these chapters these chapters don't look so disappointed these tip you so thank you thank you the end so I think you've summed up really where we are at so I think understand that most of you or seemingly have got piles of paper so we've killed most of the Lower South Island forests to produce this plan I think and apologies I think from the organization apparently last night the whole system melted down as it tried to to deal with that firstly just in that regard the paper version you see is obviously first of all is the community and developers will interact with the whole thing is designed to be an electronic plan as those of you have been through the process will will be aware of we had hope to actually demonstrate the electronic version of how people interact with the new plan and today but unfortunately the system couldn't cope with that either but you're welcome at any time to contact brigitte or any of your team and we can arrange for you to work through that document so while it looks very bulky in a paper form that's the whole intention in design the plan is actually to be incredibly streamlined really there are just a couple of things to go through one is really I supposes as the mayor has outlined the process step we're at at the moment we are working through achieving the direction and the fundamental direction and the land use recovery plan which sets out having the district plan completed by april 2016 as the mirrors outlined the tool for that is the order and council which we've been working on or at the mirrors and her nominated team have met on this topic a number of times the OIC is not signed off and you'll see I think that our resolutions are subject to the OIC being approved because obviously the council doesn't want to be ultimately signing something until they satisfy the OIC flix what the council understands the agreement that it's reached so there is that there are also a number of minor matters that have been asked to be reported back so once we've got throughout that I think the the the sort of the high-level introduction and understanding of the plane I think Brigitte first was Janine and then with some of the others will take you through that so they just need to be signed off so that you're happy prior to those things being finally amended put it into the draft to be submitted to them to the ministers as the mayor's outline the ministers get 15 working days to make any comment council has to report on those or staff report to you on those and where we choose give them reasons for why we've chosen not to do so so ultimately the decision for what ultimately gets put to a community is the council's and that's an important principle to have regard to I know there's been discussion along the way about whether it's one chapter eight chapters or parts of chapters that go out I think it's important as I've said in the report both from a logistical need but also from our comprehensive sense need to take the body of work that we've got there now out to the community because the chapters while they do stand alone they do also make sense as a group of chapters that's really hard to understand the residential chapter without understanding the subdivision chapter and vice versa so there are a number of chapters in here which are fundamental to the recovery and that's what that's what that is what was agreed with the with the crown that we will do the priority chapters first a number of them are what you'd call link chapters chapters that elements and there which are not so important but but useful to get out of the way now like the definitions chapter like the introduction and the vision so that's fundamentally why the package that you've got here today is being put up before you I think rather than any more comment from me I think we've certainly open to questions what I'd like to do the enders firstly just think the team's you see a very small subset of the team behind you there the chapter leaders but certainly my thanks particularly to Brigitte and to Alan Matheson for leading the project thus far and spend and putting all the time and effort both in terms of preparation in terms of reporting to you in terms of consultation and a course to the rest of the planning team and the council and the consultants we've used through that so the document is what it is I don't think we could have got it here without the time that councillors have invested in it we certainly wouldn't have got here without the I just want to acknowledge their contribution as their general manager at and you know reiterate your words of well expression of gratitude to those that have really put on an extraordinary effort I mean I don't think anyone would have believed it was possible to undertake this amount of work in such a short space of time and I know that some of the issues between us and the and and getting resolution around some of the land use recovery plan I think held us up a wee bit you know and accept full responsibility is brand new person coming in but I think that without having that that background about the government's expectations in terms of residential intensification I think that we lost a little bit of time there so you know I do apologize for that but I think we came up to speed pretty quickly and I think we've got a much better outcome then what would have been the case if we'd simply set back and allowed the that the substantive rewrite of the district plan to occur so so even it created later on I think that it that from our point of view and for the city's point of view it was worth it so thank you very much for or allowing us that time to to come up to speed and try and unfurl answer change I think that the introduction is one that we do we need to do as a follow on from the other day when when Becky was cheering so would you like to start with that yes and if I just take you to section 6 of the report with the total finalizing of some measures in paragraphs 1 and 2 6.1 and 6.2 we outline a couple of things that's still needed to be worked through that we missed out on in the final workshop one of them is definitions which Janine will lead shortly and then we'll have Peter Eamonn on the vision statement that will go into the introduction right and then I'll have Mark Stevenson briefly to talk to you about some changes since we've had the last of the economic independent economic reviews could start with you genetically now I understand an appendix 3 there are situation of three summary tables to do with the definitions chapter 2 the first to a bunch of country before the final table is the one that has the purple text and that that was the one that I was going to discuss with you on thursday but do you get around to it so that's the one I'm going to talk to you about today so you might want to find that and amongst all of your papers yeah if you need it I've got a separate copies here that I can hand out so it's an appendix 3 which you've got a number of these tables on and that's the one total definitions so you might want to just flick through you've got quite a number of them easier to get the new one now as I understand we've already or you've already discussed the accessibility one at one of the earlier workshops last week you know I understand it will hit you with it so Alma quiz from the public received was that a reference was made to the definitions introductory statement to the effect that if the word or phrase is not defined within the chapter in the meaning should be taken to the SP and the resource management at the national policy statement on electricity transmission and the resource management national environmental standeth electricity transmission activities regulations 2009 legal advice to me was that this is an appropriate because it doesn't necessarily follow that the purpose of a provision is achieved by definitions is defined and either there or those two other documents so the recommendation viewers that there's no change how many words are did a big sorry how many words or phrases does that a feat I don't actually know I didn't go that far to lock but certainly I'm not even sure necessarily without having done that exercise that there would have been other definitions within those exit should be and the chapter Brian in fact a fan needed then should have been identified already through the means of developing a new order to made but I just it seems odd to me that there there would be late words or phrases left undefined that are defined and other legislation so yeah it just because if the meaning was different then you'd want it to say so and if it was the same then a reference to it wouldn't make any legal difference so anyway ah number three um another request that was that we streamlined the definitions relating to the accommodation in care of the elderly at the time that we consulted with the public they were six definitions sort of around in area which are listed there and the left hand side column of those 616 cleared mine facility his sake home has been renamed key facility and it remains within the plane dokey facility has been deleted and favour of key facility and so far as it relates to looking after elderly people on an on a daily basis without on-site residential accommodation the definitions of ugly person and elderly persons housing complex have both been deleted as a no longer required in the definition of that was elderly persons of the things that the requester was hoping to achieve by a new definition shown dear that's based on the definition out of the visiting Shaw sorry the retirement villages it the extent that it's considered appropriate to meet planning objectives within an hour made document so this new definition retirement village in conjunction with the definition of key facility goes a lot through that in terms of meeting what the request ahead hope to achieve I just aren't we've got support from a requester for the definitions of critical infrastructure and electricity transmission network so no changes their request has been made for a new definition for hazardous facility and this is one that's more appropriately considered and phase 2 through development of the his other substances in contaminated land chapter site at the moment there is no change recommended is likewise been a request for a new definition of the National Grid and no changes proposed Thea for the reason that National Grid refers to electricity related assets owned by transpower only and because there are assets owned by other than their particular to take into consideration all of those so that the changes there's no recommended change next one number eight again at the time of community consultation there were three somewhat confusing definitions all heard the word sitzt ER than the title one of those related to noisy sort of activities one of them related to electricity acid sensitive activities and a third was more of a spatial definition and that was applicable and the industrial and commercial zones only the request was that we combine those definitions just too so they were is confusing and considering those the host definition and the column to the right gear at it is possible to combine what were the electricity in the noise sets of the relationship and a single definition its which I've done so your heart is relates to electricity part they realize you're always the sensitive areas definition it's not appropriate that be included because as I see that as a spatial definition that Vietnam relates elsewhere 9 we've got support for the definition of strategic infrastructure number 10 again a new definition has been because the distance was referred to it unless international heaven fact be included with on the rules of the young subdivision development of new flicks chapters
Item there's-- aparte item and that is in relation to the Morrison Avenue bowling club so again I assume that counselor kata would like to move that and counts latina would like to second it would you like to speak to that and this tip how those spokes are actually very straightforward hi dice so the first once I get to the right minutes is on the morrison bowling club which was the extension to the to the lease we had no objection to work yep has anyone got any questions or comments on that I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carry the second item on the agenda is also part a and that is the Chevy road signalized pedestrian crossing and again counselor kata moves seconded by Andrew tuna would you like to comment on that one oh this is fresh football as well but obviously very important for that for the area to get that up safety any comment I'm David East do you think you I'd like to support this one it's a part town and the volume of traffic that does go past the school and the it's actually getting beyond well beyond the school patrol systems and we have a similar lighting system upper build school and they both work very well so I'm very supportive with this initiative excellent right thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there's a place thing opposed say no that's carried and and so now we'll have counselor Cotter and council a tuna moving and seconding that the reporters a whole be adopted was there anything else that you don't I just wanted to talk about 9.1 it was a sort of flood task force meeting never stops it urgently called in would be we all got one email the night before I'll understand the urgency of it but those two board members that did not read the emails and did not actually attend X dead meeting so you just want to sort of reiterate the importance of text messages I'm sorry on board advisor as a support staff there are very the message themselves in a can't get through to us yeah now will definitely pass that on to the task force oh I mean we've put a lot of pressure on them to come up with solutions and a very short space of Parliament been very effective but there are always going to be breakdowns in communication so thank you for raising me yani just interested in 9.2 the st. Albans transitional facility are you you're going out for tinder for the community to run the st. Albans facility is that is that something the board can do or do we need to do that as a council I'm just mindful though concern that was raised previous it I'll be able to get a pepper no way to get the key to use the local facility but we did get feedback that regular users had given a key so they don't have to go out to papanui to click the key it's only short you know occasional users that are in that situation but it has a thing being used like one of concerned about the lack of use of a have you had a usage rekha it is getting it on average about five hours a day use so most of that probably ninety five senators from regular users I'm so they have access to what the key so it's just a small majority that have to go to the paranoid service center to pick up here and the tendering process is we're still awaiting a report on that because we do want to look the best way to operate that the circuit court for the community and one other things is a ball we've also identified that as a train additional facility so we're sort of concentrated also on that the grand picture here of what we want the appearently as well do we need to do anything to speed up their process I'm just worried that they're waiting for well you've requested and up an update on the reporter so you've requested a report yes what's all waiting for that report and when did you originally requested it was requested also they did point of us a wedding for it so they'll be ranking so I think that it does need to be followed up I don't think you need a resolution from council to do that the acting chief executive has taken a notion we will see if we can get that to you as quickly as possible good okay so I'll put the motion at the report as a whole be adopted all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried and now we move on to the
Thank you thank you very much tequila me in councils I'm just got some extra notes all of a sudden right so we have first of all from the 16th of April again the citywide speed limit review proposed speed limits changed two of them would ever know it dies road there was a little discussion in the board at the time over the fact that this would mean increasing the speed limit through an intersection but the alternative because there is currently a clash of speed limits their weird eyes road as 70 kilometers in the wood editors 60 where they intersect but because dyers road as in GTA we don't have the ability to change that one that's what we were told at the time but we did agree that it should go out for consultation but the question is also how long have we got to add some streets yeah and so maybe next meeting but it does mean it does meet increasing it through that indecision and which doesnt seem sensible it would seem much more sensible to decrease it through the intersection actually relook at that I can't imagine for a moment how somebody could take that intersection at seven decays it's it's it's a it's the Ring Road addiction as a main intersection for that one there dies road is currently 70 and I think I want to get Paul back and we'll take do you want to grab and beg me sorry you don't do that I mean I way to find him no it's quite a hard ass kicked yeah he's needle in a haystack stuff and I'm not wearing my card wouldn't have to get anywhere okay we'll get real get to remove tags on Steve yes I I just can't_''_124.31 I don't me if it's not us saying that we think I should happen it's us saying we think that should be consultation on it which was the proposal of consultation the board would probably come to an opinion on that intersection I think so the German consultation process during the first meeting of the wrecks and welcome community board we more power than I think they actually do right I'm on speed limits and I went and asked NZTA whose authority who actually made this call and they said the council so I was really pleased about that and I think then we need to think carefully about what is the appropriate speed limits and our neighborhoods especially weird bikes and trucks and thick times I come out together because I just don't get 80 and 100 k speed limits and a city's own humphries drivers currently 70 when there's no roadworks yeah and thanks Hitler and so it will be leading into their 70 kilometres own but it will be poor for the intersection which just seems see if we can't find out whether you have to do it today whether you can take it back to the board right said okay yeah okay Dave and then Yanni yeah look I support the motion as it stands at the moment you've got a ring road that's basically got 70 k all the way through from the roundabout at Ravis road all the of actually get them NZTA to reduce the speed over this one intersection to 60k it makes far more sense with Lynwood a of coming back from from the history that's basically paddocks at 70 k there and you're only just swapping the the 70 k 260 k intersection over the on the northern side of the intersection rather than the southern side that makes perfect sense I boy I'm totally fine if the higley fair amid community board are fine with the speed limit but what we wanted to ascertain pool would you like to come forward sorry you thought your game so we're not fun this is really fine with the speed limit fine with it going out the consultation right but what we were trying to find out pool in terms of this heavy pyramid community board recommendation is this do they have to make this increase the speed limit to 70 at the intersection of Linwood and dies road is this NZTA controlled or council controlled and is there a time imperative on doing this dies right is controlled by nzta and NZTA do but the just the council's view is does taken into account correct eid wanted to could they reconsider this at the next meeting or is there a time urgency about this they have plenty of time to reconsider so okay over to you guys okay thanks very much and then in that case it might be one thing that though board might like to consider adding so changing the recommendation and possibly adding a couple of other streets where we can see that there are some issues if the board of the cancer local councillors want to take it back to the board then then you probably have that option and given that there's no time imperative so you might just like to look at your councils and see what they want to what to do danny is going to tell us I'm pretty relaxed about this one for the reasons that days you pointed out I just don't think this is actually the major issue that one that I want added is between fury road and linwood ave is albans road change from that if you're fine with this one that we pass this one and put that to consultation and then your community board considers are the roads that they would like edit we not do that now well you can do it with your whole board I think it's quite good that you're bored I will have a long but also make sense to do any all consultation at one point though rather than sinning one out and we can hear and then and so if we came back next meeting with some other recommendations are you guys okay with that I don't know what that's going to achieve well what you may find yani is that the community board have been trying to reduce some speed limits in some areas for some time and haven't felt that they've gotten achieved what they want to do so I'm just suggesting that if you've got the chance take the chance and then put the whole lot out for consultation I don't mind what you do on this one but you may find is so do you want to pass this one now Sarah and we might leave this one then you so you'd lay near adore all this and then come back to the next council meeting with with with a group with a group of other looking Dacians do okay you guys okay okay thank you in that case we'll withdraw that one and move on to
Thank you now your first one has got no parte recommendations so I assume that counselor kata would like to move thus who would like to second it Andrew tuna so is there anything that you wanted to comment on on the sixteenth of 84 meeting no straight forward straight forward so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried then we come to the 7th of May meeting
So perhaps the and I presume that fit we're going straight on to fiendish and omari Oh are we it would have actually been sensible but if the cherub Pendleton my mari would like to join us for this and then we're going to have to kick you off go go to go to Shirley papanui and then come back to you I think that might have been ordered a little bit more conveniently so the recommendation I presumed that Jimmy chin and Jamie golf would like to move him seeking that so we've got one from each of the wards and I'd like to hand it over to you both well this is a wonderful event culture grew and we've had it running for a good number of years now and we always get a greater team Tina's it's the first time it's ever been canceled because of weather but hopefully next year we'll be back up and running oh just like to concur with that it is one of the key events I thinkin enjoyed woods and it is does bring a multicultural community together and it's very very heartening EBD I think it's one of the best in a run and I pretended it many times myself and over the years but I noticed that the date that was set for it was Saturday the eighth of March we were going to liberate Kate Seaford memorial on that date as well and it was just three days after the we stormed that the city's head and a long time so I understand why the raid blink part would have been utterly saturated so perfectly understandable and very supportive of the recommendation Yanni just wondered because this is um quite a common occurrence of the phenyl to my Maribor to end record and welcome to carry forward project funding so can we maybe just find a way of rather than having this is having to come to council which seems like a no-brainer just enabling community boards to carry forward funding due to unforeseen six I actually quite like to deal with that in the long term planning because there are lots of decisions that we and things like that so I'd rather not do it off the back of one joint recommendation but actually get some detail or not yeah yep so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much and this mike davidson here yes yes
No and it's it's relatively straightforward it's really just providing a little bit of additional clarification in there around some of the aspects that people who had raised and commented on so I think this just really improves the detail of the plan and say the specifics about the rules which people will obviously need to look at in detail are dealt with outside of the plant at stowe dnes so this is really just setting the context and making sure people understand how how we see things at the city level and then that can be dealt with alongside the NES through well I was just going to ask you three madam chair and when I put the run sheet up at the very beginning of the day I did indicate that if we had time if you were willing we could go into the transport chapter revisions I notice about how us for though it's up to you whether we do that or with so few counselors here I wonder whether it's prudent to do that or whether it might be better to on how many questions there are but it could be useful to have the counselors who were here earlier who had questions on the ITA and transport parking matters so it's probably a good idea to leave it alright thank you yes so we'll see you on Tuesday at 130 you're welcome thank you let's go on thank you we know everybody's busy with other things as well
In lat this week last Wednesday I don't know where the invoices would have been submitted it would be good to get a total cost of what we're going to have to include in next year's rates the second one is probably the bigger number and I'm just trying to tot up here worst case what this might will cost and what I've got is so the 4.3 540 a street the potential capex and opex of 17 and a half with the variance the dredging which is not included in here which could be in excess of 18 million it's right the say 3 million for a little turn a little river even though it's not yet quake related and then if we go to the longer-term solutions option one or two which is going to be around 50 with a variance there yeah and I get a total of between 80 and 120 2 million yeah is that get worse case what we're looking at yeah that is that as better there would be worst case what you're looking items around the dredging I'm you know we've just got received the modeling information back it does show some improvement and water levels we're not convinced that that drop and water levels is going to protect protect houses so we're not sure whether we can recommend that we've spend money on managing the river in that way in that area yet so there's a much longer across the line on dredger okay really what was it so you're doing a cost-benefit analysis on each of the options as you go through absolutely yep so particularly for low Heath get lower and upper here thicket we had teams out last week measuring floor levels so that we can actually you know if we drop the water level by XD actually save a house yeah I'm clean thank you my question is just about I recognized obviously money this is about taste read-option but you have talked and this seems to have come up with creative provenance about the lower Dudley Mike how important is that still in consideration for is part of the through dell n'ton bank service different yeah that's right so how important in terms of the work the maintenance work we're doing now or just in terms the overall equation that's still a critical part yeah absolutely so if you remember an earlier slide that we showed and I think when we presented the longer term options and we showed a the network with two cubic meters a second coming in from above Mara how and surely stream two cubic meters a second and then you get down to Hills Road then another two cubic meters a second by the time you get down to down to the lower Dudley you've got a network which requires 10 cubic meters a second capacity and you've got a discount and I'm going to be out 4.8 so by removing 2.2 cubic meters a second we still have significant constraints downstream so all those properties downstream of Hills Road are still very much at risk even though we've got this solution but it goes a long way to improve ian is to clarify to taste look up the a street you end up and inside so it's actually a historical names and yeah yeah that is Pauline quickly as part of the the upgraded maintenance the channel widening and deepening and also the removal of obstructions yeah do we have insurance that all this is now embedded in our operational programme for the residents to know that there's going to be slight click addressing of this it's not a one-off it's going to be ongoing so in our program yep so what we're doing over the next two or three weeks is we're looking at we're very much aware that we've gone there's been a lot of speed associated with this work and I'm very much aware that there's parts of the business that haven't come along with us in terms of impacts on exactly that sort of that sort of thing how's this going to figure maintenance contract what is what could a new regime potentially look like so over the next week there's a quite a lot of internal promoting and then getting the operational side of the business to to challenge that work again and then it'll be I'll use weird hand shaped across so that we can actually change maintenance regime so it is if maintenance regimes have to change they will change yeah absolutely has it been done yet no because we need still need to challenge and validate a lot of our assumptions that we've made yep that would give people confidence to know that you're definitely looking at there and we may well find that the pump station combined with the maintenance and the clearing together des an inquiry positive impact on this whole situation plus the widening of some of the culverts what you're making yeah yep stream widening deepening and removing obstructions and loudly will improve the flow and that won't get us all the way the in terms of returning previous quickly was a flood risk right so um one more quick quick a very quickly I'm just getting back to the eqc stuff to my cuz I know that you've been working from work around lane damage and flooding and things and I see that engineers are on the ground from Inc you see now going into check land and so forth is there any doubling up in your opinion going on the other no there's a total sharing of information and you might have seen the eqc press statement that came out yesterday which said that if you see has announced its opening open to contributing towards offsite flood works as a way of resolving some claims and it's been working with the Christchurch City Council to identify where this may be an option so you know the I mean there are issues around who can pay for what that will be part of that longer conversation that we need to have but they were definitely sharing information and working together okay so engineers on the ground going into houses and safe lock done and carrick in those areas aren't going to be repeating or reinventing the wheel on work that's already been done by the task force therefore the slightly different mission right the omission is and whether that they have a liability in the court case has an issue around that because there is the increase flooding vulnerability that is the that the question one and the second is how do you compensate for that yep yani um just related to the people that unfortunately have had their houses lowered in the flood zone have we put in place at operational level a moratorium or a requirement for consents so that we people have foundations being repaired by eq c or the insurer it's mandatory that they get that's actually a very good place for me to perhaps raise the detail of the briefing paper that we undertook to provide to the minister last week and one of the things that is and so this is basically sitting out the temporary flood defense measures that we're asking the government to assist us with and it goes through a number of those obviously short term assistance for the worst affected households earthquake support coordinate coordinators temporary relocation accommodation support that's absolutely vital and urgent and invaders YB we need government on board in the areas of earthquake related damage we are very clear that on the flop turn area we are talking about is quite related damage so we we undertook to tell government what it is that the city needed as a result of earthquake related damage we've done that and but the other one is around and it's not just the the resourcing and collaboration which is obvious and has been a big part of what mike has reported to us but the other as the regulatory assistance of the ministry of business innovation and employment to investigate ways in which the building it could be amended to require the floor level of a building to be raised where their property is subject to increase flooding vulnerability as a result of earthquake damage to the land end or buildings so that's a methodology to get to the answer to your question but if I would actually quite like to formally table the recommendations that we made to government that the they be circulated to to all members of the council and I think that people will see assistance where the government needs to really come to the party earthquake-related a lot of it as alternative accommodation while these longer-term solutions are both resolved and implemented and of course some regulatory assistants are as well so I'm hoping that there will be a positive response from governor's hoping that there would be response before today so that we would have been able to you know jointly announced that as part of the total package but I think it's important that all councillors have this information so thank you very much for your question because it's given me a reason to to put it what on the table but that's great I think investigating it that's fine what I'm really worried about is the people that are currently getting repairs are about to get repairs that I get a start now don't Harry which is why we've asked to join the proceeding with the eqc and the insurance council so if we if we lift it so that our existing rules and that there was no because in the in referring to our exactly the cases that were at the back of my mind when I felt that it was important to proceed with the legal action is that if we don't have a ruling from the court that the fall and the floor levels and the increased explode exposure to flood risk is in itself damage that is covered by the eqc then we don't get to the point of requiring them to lift their floor levels so we stand them we don't get to make that decision because they don't have to apply for a building permit unless they meet the criteria of the building edge so we have gone through this and multiple layers yani and there's no point raising questions with the task force there's nothing we can do a look at me yes there is thing we can do about it but we have to get a ruling from the court on one instances the other instances to get the assistance of mb so that we can actually change the rules that apply in Christchurch in our flood management change ourselves we are governed by statute and the building Act does not require us to require permit applications or building permits for for damage to houses that is not that is that doesn't affect the floor levels or doesn't lead to structural change so very quickly can I just reiterate your comment about people in their homes and when that being so important at the moment at the flock to meeting the other night and I'm sure that my colleagues find the same in their own we had several people come up to us who not only were quite physically stressed emotional at the end of their tether single parent mum's having to live with family members on couches I mean this is I can't stress enough not only have they been going on through the earthquakes but they're now dealing with us as well and I know that you're aware of that but it's just important to say we had people in tears and it can't go on it's just not acceptable no well I mean you'll we've put to central government you know they've asked us where where do we help they're waiting you know for a report from us as to where they play a role with synthesis where you play the immediate role you have to come to the party now and assist us with temporary accommodation and temporary accommodation support so it may be rental assistance because their insurance money may be due to run out it may have already run out and we've got people who are suffering the health effects that are well known internationally in a post flooding environment there are significant impacts and add that to the psychosocial impact of the earthquakes themselves and the multiple after shox then we are talking about a serious problem so I'm hoping that the government will come to the party and desist with that temporary accommodation assistance not not just for the immediate term but for the longer term depending on what the outcome is and then to work with us about what those that long-term solution will look like because it may not be that the you know I mean and I kind of feel a sense of responsibility as the mayor of a city in the financial stress that it's under to say that that we would commit to spending over you know all tens of millions of rate payers dollars in terms of committing to engineering solutions when we don't know that that is the best option for the for the area and for the city as a whole so we've got to find the right balance but in the meantime people cannot stay where they are and they do need support and assistance okay so thank you very much for that and so the I'm just wondering whether I should put the taste street resolution first and and then the then the other one so I'll put the taste street drain dump station resolution the whole staff recommendation all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and we move back to the flood task neural flooding task force update useful we'll do that yes I did notice that and back to the those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now what I'll do is I'll put the resolution to I'll put the resolution to to exclude the public for the balance of the meeting but we will have the balance of the meeting after a lunch break so we'll come back here for the public excluded section at it two o'clock so would someone like to move the public excluded Andrew Turner seconded by Phil Clearwater I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's cash
Just um counters won't be aware but the issue of kennaway farmers come up at our community board because as I understand it developer wanted us to put yellow lines around the road so that they didn't have to comply with end of a pipe free consent not to do the traffic upgrades that they were supposed to do if they have a certain amount of the site developed which was baiting taking away a separated median and providing a pedestrian cyclist area around the rubber so I just wanted staff to very and very simple terms help me understand what changes we're making in terms of plan change 28 and I know if we've been giving us copy so you just try and help me understand what what this is doing in terms of their requirements for development in this area and whether it's going to make it easier for them to get out of doing what the conditions of their plan change work if I can take you to page 29 of the chapter page 29 6 15 point two point five point the same rule that came from plan change 28 which is the very issue that has come to our attention and to the community board's attention through recent proposals by the developer now this rule here essentially provides the trigger for results consent but because it's non-compliant to a non-complying activity it does set a high threshold for anyone to breach that standard so I understand that in the application having said that an application has been already made for resource consent which will be assessed against a city plan so whilst this rule reflects the current city plan we can't necessarily influence through changes to the draft industrial chapter what assessments made of that application ah there's no other changes that would affect their likelihood of non-compliance by being approved by resource consent then want the current city plan allows move on to cookie time the final plan to refer to in the package of maps map 5 map 5s the outline development plan for cookie time and just a key issue that was raised at a public meeting we had them templeton and also and today cooker time have plans to expand their Factory in the future to meet growth but arguably a good neighbor to date in respect of their business and want to stay there I want to stay in Christchurch but also want to maintain the relationship with their neighbors so they're proposing a range of measures to avoid impacts on those neighbors including amongst other things setbacks landscaping noise mitigation by use of acoustic fencing but in it in addition to that through the feedback that's been received they've decided to there's a two points of access from Trent's road into the site 1 N word one out words and the outward point of access as you can see on the IDP looks awfully close to the residential properties to the north and so quickly time have agreed to move any future access point to the south of that at least 25 meters from the residential boundary to at least remove the risk of noise effects as well as other impacts of traffic and so effectively there's there's been some change to the's a positive outcome from what whatever was have occur so finally on area specific issues islington Park which is also known as Waterloo business park there's been a amongst over comments made on this area there's been a comments that have sought provision for preschools for gymnasium and for commercial services such as a copy center or a bank and there's to recognize that this is the areas and the order 120 hectares and that there should be some support supporting services and so what we've done is proposed that in these nums and park and other general industrial zones we don't provide them for them as permitted but assess each one on its merits as a restricted discretionary activity and then in the heavy industrial zone make it fall discretionary given that this a greater risk of reverse insensitivity so we're we're acknowledging that those users may be suitable but we don't want to provide for them as of right so it's a good sorry oh sorry cafe is permitted isn't right but it is a pre school on to the general issues the first is really about the some of you we've already discussed this first issue which is restrictions on retail and office development in industrial zones and the Trina concern about officers being restricted and their activity status and a key message has been that the nature of office activity that's associated with an industrial company is different from an office that wants to location a commercial center or the central city and where as discussed earlier recognized the policy context that we need to provide industry industrial land for industry no not with standing there there's generally speaking not going to be a demand to develop large offices if that lands required by an industrial company so they were only develop officers as a zileri function or secondary function and we've had discussions with a company that owns two large industrial areas in the city and there's a memo and the package that came with to you which there's a blue coupled blue lines for it and yellow line so it's a one pager and this this of officers and irrelevant to warehousing in on industrial sites in this area in these two areas one being do people have this people find it okay sorry sorry sorry it's jumping here sorry carry on mm-hmm we got it Danny yep yes um just taking this as an example the first table as details the floor space and glassworks industrial estate which is off chance road and there's quite a new developments option of chance road itself of the common road self the main South Road intersection if you're hitting cell phone stands wrote at somebody fence up and you might be familiar with seeing catapult Harvey and fishing of Michael on the site and what this shows is that there's a range of needs that industrial companies have four offices and the proportions vary but New Zealand safety and downers for instance have a relatively large office components relative to their warehouse whilst others generally speaking have a much lower proportion and it comes back to drawing that line of ensuring that office doesn't become the predominant activity and so in drawing a resource consent we can assess the scale of that office activity and so what we're proposing is that the threshold for the maximum threshold for officers in an industrial zone is rather than what was in the draft which is 250 square metres or twenty-five percent which evers the lesser we're proposed to increase their maximum limit on officers and industrial zones to 500 square meters or thirty percent which it was the lesser and to explain the impact that would have and for instance in glass works it would capture all the ones that aren't highlighted and blue and yellow and the reason for it's obviously not just in response to this but it's to recognize that officers do still have an important component in industrial zones but again we don't want it to become the predominant use and the reason that we have both the percentage and a square meter for shoulders that for instance catapult Harvey have an office of 1,300 square meters which whilst it's only six percent of their total floor space 1300 square meters is still a stopped the fresh herbs are set to enable that assessment on a case-by-case basis if it exceeds those limits so the idea the approach we're taking going forward is to take a restrictive approach to officers but still recognize and allow for those offices that actually function as officers secondary to an industrial activity so they draft rule that we went out for consultation with was 250 square metres or twenty five percent which evers the lower and we're increasing that to 500 square meters or thirty percent I'm sorry in the operative plan and a number of industrial zones there's no limit whatsoever so areas such as y aki road have if you've driven up there recently there's a number of office buildings going up and that's because there's no limit and someone that owns an industrial site could tomorrow decide to knock it down and develop it as an office building and so the risk of that is that we lose that demand that would have always go to commercial centres and the city and and for the city there you which I won't go into detail on but it outlines the office demands demand for office full space across the city and I'll let you read that at leisure but that the key messages that indust for primarily industrial use and we want to direct the office and retail sectors to go back to the central city and to go back to commercial centers once once their time comes that they have to relocate so over twenty-five percent each year these two new zero safety and our donors is not a compliant with the discipline they lawfully established now so they wouldn't need to now apply for a source consent under the new plan but any future proposal such as what is on the ground that New Zealand safety has has would need to apply for a source consent to enable that assessment now it could be the outcome that that proposal given its given new zealand safety stall has a predominant use of the Landers industry or warehousing it may be appropriate and that consents granted but we want to ensure that a line is don't have a line as we've got in the current study plan there's no limit at all then you run the risk that these industrial areas don't become industrial at all okay thank you that's do anything to being allowed to have 500 square meters or thirty percent which is great yes and and I would say that that comes directly from the RPS in the loop in the discussion that we had previously about officers and the Tate site that's where the direction comes from to keep industrial and primarily for industrial purposes which is a big change of direction from the operative plan I should point out across those two industrial areas we're providing for all but three of those industrial companies if they were to apply for him to be assessed against the proposed plan and so we're still meeting that providing for that demand and by shifting on the threshold we've responded to that feedback but as to avoid other potential developers who see an opportunity to develop an industrial estate for an office park for instance'll show place for instance was historically an industrial zone and is still in the current city plan yet has become an office park and the greatest opportunities out there up to arguably where the land is two Pistons make the greatest gain financially so we need to take draw a line and take a restrictive approach and say if you want to go bigger than we want to make that assessment we're not saying no to everything we're just over that over that threshold but we just want to be able to assess what that the effects of that will be on other locations and the risk of not having a line at all at all as as in the current planners that the central city won't cover and our commercial centers that have been damaged and we've done a lot of master planning work for won't recover so it's really about scale it's allowing for a level of office activity that will benefit or that is necessary for these industrial activities to a cure but where the scale is simply for k acs or the central city we have that discussions with the property council about this madam chair and they are agreed to the principle that yes headquarter offices large offices should go back into k acs and city centre they're not looking for that kind of opportunity but they do want us to recognize that some of these types of Industry do require more office space than others and hence the increase from 250 to 500 square meters or thirty percent I place maker you went they are 13.1 percentage but they still more than 250 per square meter 358 your paper 439 so place makers would comply with the rule that we're now proposing under the draft that we put out for consultation they wouldn't have complied because there are over 250 but because we're increasing the free shoulder it would provide for place makers so that would be permitted as a right I should add in terms of place makers and we do provide for what we call you out based retailers and trade suppliers in the industrial general zone has a permitted yard based retailers such as car sales yards or even secondhand goods outlets like Turner's Turner's care options we permit those and no industrial zones because the most suitable locations amongst other areas so how did the property council view the price effect of this in what respects well obviously if you're required to establish your office in the central city at perhaps 400 square meter deuces at an southwest at maybe 120 square meter process is what we're allowing for madam chair is to make sure that the businesses that are locating in industrial zones as of right for example are able to achieve the office space that they need that this would fall within the other thirty percent ratio or the 500 square meters what what they've agreed there was any head offices or officers that are not associated directly with the industry they agree should relocate back to k acs or the city center we're not we're not telling them to locate the small amount of office that's needed directly related to their industrial business to relocate its what that well no the rule means the rule current plan allows you to have unlimited office space in yes this plan aleris trick sir that's correct restricted may be consistent with the RPS and lube the RPS being the regional policy statement which is which says that we need to keep industrial and primarily for industrial purposes and if you like my colleague here can I find it for you but I also mentioned that the loop talks about not using industrial land for higher value purposes ie office blocks in terms of that supporting the chapters the section 32 analysis and we need to consider the benefits and costs of what we propose and there's a whilst there's a value associated with what the market terms price points and so forth which is what lens sold for or at least four we also need to consider the impacts of the costs implications for the wider community and there's other costs that aren't necessarily reflective market costs so there's large amounts of investment put them to infrastructure in our commercial centers for instance public arguably there's a lost cost to the community of that investment and infrastructure and also that this if we allow for officers and industrial zones for instance there's a greater cost to the community of people travelling further to access officers that would have always be accessible by public transport which runs through our centers so there's it's broader than just the cost that the property council when it and business indicate to us so um but I can understand what you're trying to do and you know have a lot of sympathy what's ours but the ones that I'm concerned about other ones that had recent plan changes who are now having quite a dramatic change and when I look through the list is all the one that comes to mind is planned change 58 which was done towards the end of 2012 and 98 rights road so have you considered that you know there's some areas that have only just been resigned that you're going to have quite major impacts on because of the fact that you know they and now they're being told that you've got a whole bunch of different plans for you yeah certainly that that's an issue the difficulty is that if we start making exceptions for those that have recently been for a process then you start to weaken that position that we're trying to achieve of directing officers to the locations we want them if we allow for if we allow the officers in the reitz road location because they've been for a recent plant change or it opens us up for challenge perhaps print can add to this but the risk is that there's not a resource management reason as such for permitting officers in Wright's road and not somewhere else no but that I guess from a legal owner I don't know but from a moral point of view someone's been a whole bunch of money getting a plan change we agree with the plan change or not I mean I don't even think I supported this one button they've got the plan change n on a basis of what in and saying or a year and a half later we're completely changing it quite dramatically I would have thought that that's quite a unique situation as opposed to people who have had the land for a long period of time who you know have have kind of had the opportunity to develop it haven't developed it you know and now we notify now suddenly say oh well that's not fair to me madam chair through you perhaps are going to respond on the legal aspect of that the the RMA requires there to be a district plan review every 10 years so anyone who applies for the private plan change requests knows that it's going to go through a disrepair review within the next ten years that's the first point sets second one is that the plan change request will have been assessed under the statutory instruments that existed at the time and I've changed so since they went through their plan change process we've now got new provisions in the RPS and we've got the land use recovery plan within which we're assessing the appropriate notes or the council's decision the appropriateness of the plan provisions for a piece of land it's for this particular site it could be you could you could have seen it should be commercial why haven't you done that its current uses as still I understand part of the right way and they've made it they haven't advanced their proposals to physical works on the ground so there's there's no basis to zone it commercial having regard to the level of public transport accessibility the the context of where it sets its side a Raceway where there's a significant amount of traffic and so this potentially traffic effects of like adding a new commercial center there and also as part of the commercial strategy we've gone about assessing the future growth of retail and future demand for retail floor space and what is required so the future communities of that area and whilst we are planning a new commercial center in the North halls well greenfield area there's considered to be sufficient retail effectively there's not a need for a new center in that location which is what the commercial zoning would provide for what actually have that's race Wayland that they've developed all those like we're enable is and everything around rates road what happens to that now that's parcel of land that got razones a couple years ago their zoning would be subject to this proposed draft chapter going through the process the rules would has a min dizzam this draft chapter replace anything that's in the city plan and respect of that site once any appeals are finalized so are they intending to build more because they're obviously it's made a huge difference to their finances don't know and that are they intending to build more developments along it because they're doing it in conjunction with somebody else they could well be I don't have it there so are we actually taking the recommended if under them basically they could well have proposals for our office development of sorts but it comes back to what distinguishes this site and we run the risk of undermining our defense of the restrictive approach we're taking two industrial areas across the city so rights wrote is stuffed now in terms of traffic flow if you ever go down rights road it's not a good experience but there are major major officers on the back end of the raceway are we actually just ripping this out from them have they got any more planned do we know I couldn't tell you I'm not aware of their plans at the moment for the sites but absolutely three amount of care they can apply for a certificate of compliance they can put on the resource consent application now so they have the right to particular position knowing that this plan change is underway we could get some feedback for them but that's exactly why we have had the five weeks of community engagement and specific stakeholders and what have you that they have provided feedback and I can follow up by reviewing their letter now which may have more details about but from memory I can't recall what they consider it appropriate for the territorial authority to change what it suppose in current plan change when people do have those rights protected under the legislation and I did give you a list of private plane changes back at our last round of BL workshops right and might want to look at my I can't remember them off the top of my head I'm sorry and in the package of documents are coming into the draft industrial chapter there's an a3 document that has all the recent plan changes and the rules that have come through the plan changes and what we proposed to change the document is headed overview of changes in the draft commercial and industrial chapters from operative private plan changes to the city plan and rationale for any change that's a mouthful but that there are other areas that have been resigned through plan changes that are to enable officers as of without any restriction but in the same way that a landowner might have recently purchased a block of land in an area that hasn't been subject to the plant've free hypothetically I've recently purchased a block of land with the intentions developer for officers we've really really annoyed about this painting Eddington roseway can you speak I mean they people might be annoyed but if they've got their plan change they need to do something with it they can submit via the consents applications and they have up until these rules become then I don't have that information at the top of my head but that list of private pain changes that we gave you which I yeah yeah I I can give it to you again on Monday or Tuesday when we next meet the the provisions obviously affect those that have been through recent plan changes but they also they affect any landowner with industrial zone land and arguably there'll be landowners who perceive this as an adverse out adverse outcome because they lose the right to develop their land for officers but there'll be others that see it as a positive effect because they've got an existing industrial use them they know that this greater certainty of the arguably also going to be an impact on land values for those there's industrial companies that could be well paying a higher premium for their land because it enables officers at the moment and if a restrictive approach is taken then it I potentially there could be a lower land value which will benefit industrial companies in those areas so there'll be those that benefit as well as those that don't but we need to make sound resource management decisions based on the effects rather than necessarily an individual's impacts we appreciate that but this seems to be being made somewhat after the horses bolted so we've got these numbers for the central city their development that's happened in Eddington and elsewhere has made huge office developments outside of the central city and so post that fact we're now kind of closing the door but all the horses are down the track is what I'm worried about never a bit of cheer we are planning for a 40 or 45 you time project but we are looking a long way into the industrial areas that the question for the territorial authorities through this plane change process is what's appropriate for the future and in office blocks that are dear have existing youth rights this is this is not retrospective
Quite related damage so sorry it's about 2 I'll get residents to you lately know what they will flooding and get old food they don't yep I'm brave I'm going to move on because we've got we've got to get through this yeah Mike hi I have to ask you some questions about the costs have all this stuff two questions one is a quick one at the finance committee meeting the other day we were brought with a flooding cost of five million for the
The issue is which people have had very recent plan changes post-earthquake in an environment that is incredibly uncertain and you know I anyway I think we've got some solutions around that one to look at the other one that I was really concerned about is your rezoning of 23 and 25 more house air from living 333 which was PC to you saying the my recollection of that side the b3 zone while there was some quite intricate requirements as part of the plan change that went through in terms of I think provision of residential or some element of residential this is on page 20 sorry page five of the 10 changes rather than top can you just help me understand that I mean again it was quite a contentious plan change I think at the time hmm and one of the requirements was that there had to be residential and what you seem to be doing is removing that requirement the the current zoning in the city planners industrial which our business threes owners and that from memory that plan change was to recognize that those zone properties and effectively it acknowledged that that wasn't a suitable environment for residential there weren't from memory any specific provisions that was simply applying the zoning to those properties from residential to industrial so is this on the corner or is it as close to the junction of morehouse save and hagley air from memory can you just follow that up and see if it wasn't in specific conditions yes reason sidling okay thank you about the Orion site they're on some page two is that whole site being rezone commercial as it is we are now know that plan change resigned a part of that block foot new local center but the majority of that block is zoned for residential development support also its proposed to change no no it's a plan change they went through in 2008 and I'm sorry I won the side pc 31 which went from 2010 was resigning the land twin pack Street magic pack Street Madras street kirkus and Canon streets and it's been vacant for some time now yeah and that land majority of for already zoned business for a committal center and what we're doing in terms of the zoning is simply rolling over from what's in the current city plan so what does it mean in the existing business one zone becomes a commercial local so we're renaming the zones okay brother thats Sarah and um okay so nothing sexy hit in there there's been no other there were proposals for temporary workers a corner but I'm not aware of any proposals I've written up late so it's residential in his good of commercial hmm that's right thank you and just a final point on the slides there was feedback we received about for industrial zones that are currently offers parks and those office parks have developed to start Lee there's no place for example in addington which is a hope high quality amenity industrious park and so we've introduced in the grass before you and offers pack zone with rules to permit officers and not allow industrial usin those zones and that's to recognize what's in those zones and office parks in the future the policy direction is to recognize those but not provide for new and that's because that demand for new office officers of a scale as you see in show place should be directed to the central city that's the very nature of those businesses that they tend to serve a headquarter function and that's the very type of very much the type of business we want back in the central city or in large suburban centers so the office Packers owners is a positive positive outcome in terms of recognizing what's on the ground as directly they've been zoned industrial so a bit business for the rights road sites is currently vacant it's not part of the lens that's to the north of a salon rights road is outside of that rights road business for zone and the business for zone at 98 rights road hasn't developed as an office park this office park is owners to recognize existing office parks it's not to provide for new ones that's correct yeah okay the commercial sorry just to move on to the contaminated land chapter this is not such an intense chapter and I'm hoping that we can get to the end of it today by five o'clock I am aware that we have a lot of work to put in before now and Thursday next week but I hope you'll be with us as we push on
Force update if we could have our mural flooding task force to the table please yeah yeah okay yes please okay while you're putting the presentation together Mike I would like to take the opportunity to think you end members of the task force who have really worked night and day to put together a series of proposals that are going to really see hundreds of people benefit from the decisions that we make today and so I know that that people will be very pleased that the effort was put on to try and make this make this happen there are a number of decisions that we've got before us and I know that the some of the some of the additional significant decisions that have got to be made we are now really set up to to deliver the other thing that I wanted to do and it was just taking advantage of the delay and the and getting the presentation setup was just to advise counselors that I took action last week which some of you will be aware of and which I will come approval for undertaking and that is that we have been successful with our application to the High Court Court to join the proceedings that eq c and the insurance council are taken with respect to the declaratory judgment on flooding issues as they relate to land the question that we obviously have an enormous untrusting as what happens with the increased flooding vulnerability to floor levels and with the increased vulnerability to floor levels obviously being impacted and the areas that we're going to be talking about today it seemed to me that it was really important that the council sought that level of clarity around that particular issue at the same time that the court was looking at the land levels and so I think that that's a hugely positive thing to be able to announce the the other thing is that and the reason for having to come next week for retrospective approval is that I advise both well-advised eqc that we had an interest potentially and making application their lawyer did advise the court that we were interested and that we might be looking to court gave us until the 30th of May to apply to join the proceedings if we wanted to do so so I had to take action urgently so it's not so much that I would normally act without taking advice from colleagues boost but I felt that it was so important that we put our stake in the ground as it were that we proceeded down that track so we've advised all parties obviously the insurance council and in the government as well so over to you Michael lets you take over from here thank you and thank you for pass to your comments on the team the report today around progress really focuses on what we've achieved over the last fortnight since we reported to you we're going to I'd like to take you through the executive summary and report and perhaps and creation time more detail can be fished out of the body of the report the presentation that I've got up here on the screen really relates more to the second item on the agenda so we'll go through that set up to look for or recommend potential short-term solutions to the regular flooding where worsened by damage from the earthquakes and we've delivered our report on it in the 12th of Maine since we've done that and we established a set of criteria around finding out who was that who were the most vulnerable people in our community since we done that we've had over 330 incoming calls to our call center we've taken 308 of those people were significant amount of those people through it through a script to to understand where they were they fit within that criteria 214 with those we already knew about and we're now working through about a very comprehensive validation process to understand more about these people more about the risks associated with the flooding for them and that's going to probably occupy a significant amount of time over the next few weeks we've had a series of public meetings we have had five to date the report says for we had another one last night we will be having another meeting tonight in South Raven and here to get belly those meetings aren't crude will be valuable they are very useful for us to understand more about the risk understand more we're the issues online for us as a community and we are continuing to you get about 50 sometimes up to 50 calls a day into the call center relating to follow ups from those meetings one of the features of the phase one report was to design local area schemes that would provide temporary flood defenses we identified 16 local area schemes and seven maintenance activity areas we looked at little river and the earlier in the the task force Little River really has come out of scope in terms of the the effects of flooding in that area not being related to the earthquakes previous meeting of the council when we presented the report we talked about littleton we meet residents from milton last night the key thing about littleton is it's got a unique set of circumstances it needs a separate look effort and we'll be looking at that and more depth starting from next week have identified a number of maintenance items that we're needed to be done immediately those are I have either been done all they are progressing the best example of that is the work and examples of that would be the work in the upper and lower eighth get but more particularly at the lower Dudley a significant amount of channel widening deepening and removing of obstructions which will provide something a significant benefit to the ability of that channel to carry flood flows the we've also been working very closely with Sarah EQC and CDHP and understanding the those other issues particularly around cost sharing some policy work and data sharing with eq c and the health board and respect to the issues relating to waste water contamination overflows we are working continuing work and waste water overflows have been a significant feature of all our public meetings and a serious calls are consumed there's overlap with a number of existing council projects and in particular the work that skirts doing and on the sixth of June which is tomorrow we're working with senior colleagues and that that really is a work in progress around the waste water contamination issue we've identified that is stalled you know a significant amount of costs associated with temporary flood defences 16 million dollars worth of capex and about 1.5 million eggs as a council officer I'm I'm still cautious about recommending in committing or asking the organization to commit to that expenditure just yet a lot of it still needs to be validated particularly given that getting a lot of still getting a lot of calls we need to do a lot of work operationalizing some of these schemes and running them through some fairly rigorous challenge sessions with their colleagues and the capital program in the operational space so that will be ongoing work for us as part of the task force we've identified a number of issues need to need to understand the organization's ability to deliver these and just exactly where they fit and so that's going to occupy the next couple of weeks going through to the the recommendations we've looked at house defense as a viable option with Sarah and suppliers to identify where we might do some trials and some testing of the materials and also to engage the public acceptance of that so at this stage we're working with Sarah we've identified the property in the red zone we've got a supplier who is going to provide the labor and naturally do the work for us for nothing we'll be looking to spend money on the consumables to do that and that's in the order of ten to fifteen thousand dollars now we haven't still quite landed the exact house a number have been a number of just currently being assist but we'll be looking for a recommendation to proceed with that work to just really provide proof of concept to make sure that that that these tools will actually work an hour and hour in the context of our out about dwellings wait anyway they're built the the funding is as a serious issue for us of obviously and we've looked at the financial implications of any skip or any of these schemes we have infrastructure repair budget that's a twenty nine point four million dollars over seven years that is available for this kind of work if decisions are made to proceed with this work there's also the building and infrastructure improvement borrowing allowance that can also be used for for this week that was considered appropriate I've talked about the high level costs are 16 million capex the 1.5 million objects the other costs associated with this task force are actually the cost of running the task force at this stage the predicted costs for this phase will be around eight hundred and thirty thousand dollars that's that's a team of up to at times about 26 people but it equates to around about 18 full-time equivalents have that have been working over the last few weeks on this so there is a recommendation and near to retrospectively approve that budget to the gab to apply that to the stormwater Kim pre works program part of the council and horizontal infrastructure rebuilt program that's collectively known as the storm water eqix budget and the final recommendation was to continue looking at the vulnerability levels confirming Lee identity and locality of the vulnerability levels and confirm back to you the earlier resolutions of council around some of these local area schemes so that's the thrust of the progress report and now back to you thank you thank you very much we'll look I'll move the recommendation and Phil Clearwater will sicken dirt I guess that you've got a presentation on the next item on the agenda and I just wonder given the significance of the tay street pump and where it takes us I just wonder whether you'd like to make that presentation now I mean I mean technically I suppose we could deal with both papers at the same time because it seems to me that that's somebody looking at this would say well you know we haven't_''_845.36 we haven't made you know as much progress as we might have liked but actually the reverse is true because with this proposal we get to a point where we can protect hundreds of people from the flood risk that they know sort of storm event and but we you know and end it but it is part of both laid temporary and a long term solution whatever the long-term solution is and I like you do not want to be sitting here making decisions about you know 50 million dollar projects if I don't know that that is good value for the city as a whole because somebody's got to pay and I think that there are there's more than one source of contribution for that punitive is the better way to go so if you would like to talk about the pastry pom and what that would do and the position that that would leave us and I think that would be a much more useful basis for us to have a debate around the the actual flood task force report yet more than happy so we'll probably if you to interview all got the pastry in props and drain pump station reports oh that's probably go through both at the same time the first thing that I'll start with is around community a team of engineers and designers we've looked 222 focus around community needs and it comes down to us to a question of confidence to address in the short term the needs of the owners and resident residents of the most damaged invulnerable villains and really to remove the regular flooding from under houses now this has really synthesizes the the initial brief that we were working under for the task force and we look at the taste Street pump station drain in the context of that in terms of the short-term needs and removing regular flooding and that when we make a win making a decision on tape Street drain it really is those short-term needs regular flooding issues I'll say right now that the this option does not remove the the flood risk entirely that we still need to look for a long-term management solution for flood risk to us reestablish a fully functional sustainable and strong residential commercial area as well as a residential area so going through going through the report this this option is in fact a third option which arose as part tenaria it delivers partial relief to the more regular flooding in this area and is based on a pumping station and the taste street drain area to reduce flooding and flockton basin option is not a complete solution to flood risk although it will provide significant relief it should be considered as early implementation of a permanent solution that will integrate with two earlier options presented in march this year it is driven by earlier resolutions from the council a few weeks ago so it provides meaningful fat reduction in the Dudley area the scheme is located within the robots road and Kensington Avenue by the maya ho public library with a pump station with a pump station located and patrick street at the back of the library the pump station will go up Kensington Avenue and full pots road to where it intersects with the Dudley division will effectively it removes about 2 cubic meters a second of water out of what we call at a street drain catchment and scenes at north into the upper Dudley division there is capacity in this division by controlling the operational parameters and cranford basin so we've got we've got room in the cranford basin in room and the diversion to store two cubic meters a second of water and they're more frequent rainfall events it's important to understand some of the benefits I'm going to go through the presentation they're not going to take you through some of the the risks and issues in the report but just as just graphically you can see up there a some outputs of the modeling and the investigation that we've carried out they'd explain where the benefits and we're the scheme benefits where it doesn't benefit and we're a benefit some but they're still risks so we can see in the upper catchment around the taste treat drain area which is a very very flat cursor but it's not those of you that are familiar at a point in those of you that are familiar with taste Street drain and Mario held public library it's very very flat area very little grade has a very limited amount pipework and you the screen the an area of no benefit of this because that that drain will still at times over top and calls as a shallow surface flooding but significantly there is a significant amount of area benefited within flockton basin it drops water levels throughout the area but this yellow areas are where there is flooding is by and large generally removed and in the blue areas there the water levels are lowered to the extent that there's a significant improvement and the rest of your levels so I'll just before I go through the report the numbers to beer in mind are now restate that this is a good solution that reduces flooding and the more frequent events it benefits 129 properties in terms of removing the flood risk quite significantly there's still 214 properties with reduced flooding but that is still under the house there's 11th floor levels in the catchment still at risk of flooding during heavy rain so that's an improvement of around nineteen floor levels at risk what it tells us is that we've still got vulnerable people in place but it is a significant improvement in this circumstance 4.5 million expenditure for just a few floor levels they're actually not looking at the total picture and nor are they looking at the long term is that right yeah yes that's right so that the huge benefit of investing the 4.5 million dollars now is that not only do we get this immediate benefit but we actually get part of our long-term solution in place absolutely with this is an option just dial back a bit to November 2013 we looked at this this was sort of one of a suite of options I think it was around 14 options that we looked at all to hear that and one of them was actually behaving their catchment and sending at north happened to cranford basin why would the reason we didn't pursue this is one of your long-term options was that it didn't totally solve the flooding it doesn't totally solve the flooding or the risk for this catchment but putting this in the mix now with the other long to longer-term options allows engineering associated with with that design and incorporate these to incorporate this is something that will add a significant amount of benefit and should reduce the costs of those other two two options so you said it does provide us benefits absolutely not only to flockton but it also provides us with benefits to that a storied rain catchment which is still difficult to to drain
The next item on the agenda item 7 the plan 2014-15 work program for the city and community long-term planning and district plan activities would someone like to move the motion that staff had put forward David East seconded by Ellie Jones and peps has anyone got any questions to direct to staff or would staff like to make a comment on it fierce door thank you perhaps up just just by way of introduction this is a level of service to us and traditional would have gone to the strategy and planning committee but we considered that it was in the new structure was most appropriate to come to the AL we recognize as previous council has done that they counsel wish to have some input into what the policy work program of council was and it's been traditional that we've put up their program and council has has looked at that and made some adjustments we fully recognize at this juncture that given that the council still working through some of the strategy objectives that this work program at your request or direction will need to the raft of things that are covered by the work program that there is a full work program basically across all those dimensions of the policy area it's obviously able to be changed going forward in the year but just I suppose what we do need to be conscious of that any change will come at some cost to what we're able to put resources to against some of these existing programs okay I ask a question because what I don't want to sign off on as something that then says that we can't develop a resilient strategy when we have signed up to developing a resilient strategy this year as part of our commitment to the Rockefeller Foundation I mean obviously we'll have some external resource to assist us in that regard but part of the objective that I want to see delivered this year that we take all of those existing plans and strategies that such it well actually on databases I was going to say on dusty shelves but no longer and and actually do nothing other then well they don't actually I like the allegory of sitting on dusty shelves much better because they do nothing other than gather dust and and I don't think that that's good enough for our city and this is a great opportunity to actually reinvent ourselves and actually take those different components the healthy complaints are safer components the youth the child friendly that all of the different policies and strategies that we've got and actually talk about a resilient City and net wider context so I kind of thought that it would be in here but I didn't know the process for raising it nets because I'm you so know that I don't think that does I mean I think really what that does go back to my previous comment which really is that council can obviously set its agenda I think all that we're reminding counselors or whole raft of things that we do in that policy area which may not seem all that sexy or exciting or or obvious but there's a lot of work that gets done so we do have a resilience and adaptation where we've allocated almost half a million dollars to do some work in there and that's probably that the tool that we would use to do that what we also recognize is by say part of the resilience story though yes the sustainable City initiatives would actually be another one yes I think we could weave a lot of the work that we have in here into a bigger resilience package which is why I'd really like to see that weird resilient City okay the one strategy one of the things we could do if you're happy to adopt this is actually we can recast some of this to actually highlight that the sort of the resilience work area I think that would help highlight some of that so certainly quite happy to do to do that and I think it's probably worth just again reiterating that our experience is that while we set out a program at the beginning of each year the nature of what occurs during the year either from government or from the community or from Council means end of the year but at least we we draw a stake in the ground to start our year worth so that we know what we're asking our policy people to be doing jaani one of the really useful things for us to be able to know is how much resource goes into each of these because there's a lot of long list of things some will require quite a lot of resource others will probably not require so much and if there's other things we want to add to the list then we actually know what the trade offers so like one of the really important with programs I think we need to be focused on as a council that's really time critical as being ready for 2015 we've got major international events we've got the eyes of the world will be honest and we need to have some sort of holistic approach to ensuring that the city's really we don't you know kind of you look at what's having a Brazil with the world cup that's kind of um but you know I know there's a trade-off you've got ya other things that you want to work on so it just for me because we don't know as part of the report to council is it possible to get the budget and the FTEs associated to each one so if we want to move amendments we can do that we I suppose we do have a sort of a I suppose already written amount of value that we're putting into some of these and it really is a combination of staff time end where we identify some technical work that is required or consultancy so but if you're able to I mean we can go away and offline talk to you about what that piece of work might look like and then and basically look where that confederal just our budgets accordingly but I mean I think the other the other gets for me there's nothing in here about heritage where it is really important to hear it is a different work program that's why it's not reported through this overall tragedy oh then okay so as there when we see the big picture program I suppose you see the big picture program at LTP and annual planned time this is really about saying for that one particular activity management plan witches city and community long-term policy and planning this is the more detailed program on an annual basis under that sort of umbrella so that activity man your plan has a level of service that says we bring you our program the Heritage one does not have a similar level of Sims so I think it does because we've kept performance reports to say that we failing and that legal service available can I just the other three things for me the need for some planning around the future of woolston and in glenwood actually came up the community board the other day with the library so is this the program that's doing that or is there a difference this would probably be the correct program to do that it would have to I mean effectively that really sets as a I suppose an extension of the a significant increase in resource because that program is already well committed but this is the right place for that to be raised since I see that we're doing case management from walks done business area so I wondered whether that could be kind of you know possibly broader I think given this so Caroline I just wanted to pick up on Mike's point about um resourcing and capacity so the case management that we're undertaking is very much reactive not proactive case management as we we have given the demands of the district plan review we have limited staff availability to do anything other than kind of respond to queries we also through CDs yeah you know Lucy do you see we do we do case management around that industrial area we'll talk a little bit more about that suburban centers yeah sorry what worries me is you've got two arms accounts are doing different things you've got a district plan review at saying we want to talk about the future wolfson and you've got cdc doing case management of individual properties to get concerns it seems kind of you know a lost opportunity to come have some synergy around I suppose it's a practical reality kept businesses are operating in the here and now and in as much as we might plan for a longer term future that's going to take as in most planning scenarios some considerable years if not decades to evolve so we have to the author here and now we can't park that and I think the case management that we work with industry is reflective of that and a lot of businesses are in Wilson because they have particular resource management rights that they are very keen to process this is long-term planning yes so it seems we're that you've got the immediate case management happening as part of the long-term planning and no budget aside for the long-term planning for the future of allston well I go back to the point I made we've got we've got limited resources our focus has been because council has an existing suburban center master plan program that's being focused now us to do if you wish to add woolston you are either going to do that by taking out some of our other programs or significantly increasing the budget I think that we it's been a long time actually going through this and part of this is because this is not a process that I'm familiar with and I think if I were a little bit more familiar with why we're doing this now when we're about to start the long term planning process and the end signing off on the annual plan I probably would would be able to it will not be asking so many questions but there's obviously people have got some priorities that would be greater than some of the priorities that staff already working on so I wonder whether we should just let this report on the table and in have a workshop on it with with counselors so that we can actually one understand the process actually look at whether there are better priorities for some of the resources at the moment certainly got some feedback on the new could take a bit of a pause so what is the time frame that you that this is operating under I mean are you this is our annual program but nothing really stops will starts on the first of july so a lot of this work is ongoing so I mean certainly the sooner we get into perhaps having a workshop with council would be good yeah and I think I'm being able to discuss those trade-offs the same with these are our priorities what I'm not our priorities would be helpful so we're happy to some of some of what we will want the planning to be focused on now will be to set up for a new long-term plan which is quite different from the one that we currently have so yeah all right well I'm going to just bring it to move that at lie on the table walking over I can just say it's will lie on the table until such time as we've hit a workshop and then it will come back to the full council okay thank you right so now we move on to
The contaminated land chapter and section 32 that's right I thank your essence physically well thank you down here okay if firm just to help keep moving along out I'll just do a little brief introduction master we're getting those papers for you the contaminated land section for phase one of the district plan is pretty short and there's a couple of very good reasons for about one of the key things is recognizing that this is just a part of the hazardous substance in contaminated land chapter so there will be more coming to you as part of phase two so don't necessarily think that this is all there is to it but it's an important step to put in a high-level policy framework and the key reasons around that are to make sure that we can really give effect to the national environmental standard on contaminated land in human health and through that process the government has already established nationally applicable rules that control development around contaminated and so what the NES doesn't really do is provide objectives and policies and that puts it in a very good position to to keep moving forward with the recovery works it's also worth noting that contaminated land is dealt with through a range of different mechanisms so the district plan isn't the only port of call when you look to manage contaminated land I mentioned the national environmental standard regional plans deal with contamination particularly the discharge effects that can occur under as wider work that been done at a national level through the establishment of the hazards hazardous activities and industries list and more localized to a regional level the listed land use register and you probably familiar with work that has been going on with econ like that recently so the feedback we had from consultation was pretty limited really we've identified three main issues that came back to us had the first dealt with the identification of contaminated land had a couple of comments from members of the public I think one was actually identifying a piece of land and the other was just questioning how the process would would work we've also had some feedback keen to achieve a nationally consistent approach to how we manage and store information about contaminated land so that gives us a steer in terms of whether we should be looking to utilize the existing processes which he can have been developing and rolling out at the moment or whether we should do something separate and we've opted to stick to the approach that has been developed through the Regional Council the next issue related to potential overlaps between the district plan and regional plans particularly regarding the water supplies in groundwater issues obviously water is an important issue for the city and a particular potable water supply but also just generally in terms of Environmental Quality in regard to this particular issue it was something that's flagged up by the oil industry Environmental Working Group and they were just came to make sure that we didn't end up duplicating or conflicting with any of the provisions that are in the regional plan so that's a matter that we have given consideration to and as I mentioned before the original plan really deals with the discharge plan is more to make sure that we understand how land use and subdivision happening on a round contaminated land gets dealt with and finally the issue that came up was regarding clarification of what best practice and management activities are for contaminated land again the oil industry just flagged up needing to understand what what is meant by best practice and looking to make sure that it covers other methods such as site management plans it's not just about the physical development and works and again the feedback we've had from the minister for environment and Sarah was seeking to ensure that we have some degree of consistency with the national approach through the NES and guidance that the nfe provide so moving on to what we've done in response to that there's a small note sorry can I just catch up and just in between that in roulette records obviously the hazardous substances bites but just in relation to contamination is it only land so for example and where there was that oil spill in littleton and the bund and the thing that's be dealt with through this process so the hazardous substance provisions that will be developing will deal with how you manage sites like that and make sure that there is appropriate controls so that if there are any spills or leakage that they are managed that source and you don't then result in contamination of the land so that's I guess at the top of the cliff manage your hazardous substances appropriately then you won't contaminate land this is something like that actually we're the top of the cliff go away and this instance and holding on to the bond but the bond was not secured it was not okay what what happens and will we actually deal with it and our district plan as opposed to the regional so we would deal with the approach in terms of making sure that there are provisions so that we manage those sites appropriately as for hazardous substance where there's an incident like there was in littleton and it becomes a spill then that becomes a discharge so if the the oil in that instance breaches the be most likely an uncontrolled and consented discharge and that would be picked up through ECAM as part of their process that the area that's something that is potentially hazardous or contaminated citizen is actually safe to start with so that an incident doesn't allow for leakage somewhere their hazardous substance part of it according to review we'll deal with that so we did what we're looking at at the moment is when things have happened in the past that have resulted in contamination what do we do when we approach the contaminated land so we're not dealing with the the things that lead up to causing it at the moment that's dealt with and say really through how we manage hazardous substances we're now just saying kwan sits there in the land what do we do about it so we've made a number of small amendments to the approach that we consulted on firstly we've looked to include subdivision within the objectives and policies this just appears to have actually been an oversight it was intended that that would have reason or other eight didn't make it through into the version we consulted on and in fact we really do need to add that back in not just to make sure that it's comprehensive in terms of how we approach the issues but also there's a requirement in section 31 of the Resource Management Act that we address the effective subdivision on contaminated land so that's really just a bit of a correction there to advise council how does that work d well you probably need a concept for a subdivision but the national environmental standards basically say that if you it establishes whether you're permitted controlled or discretionary activity so if an all subdivision of hell sites you would have to look at the NES and I can't remember the the detailed provisions but they would certainly be a requirement on the developer to looked at those provisions if they're permitted obviously they can go ahead if they require a consent then they would need to lodge that with the council supposed to process so all those rules are established through the the consents manager and he's advised that when all applications come in we will be checking against the listed land use register to see whether or not that site appears on that and in that case we will then follow that up and say well what what needs to be done in relation to that it's not always going to require a consent the NES allows some activities is permitted but it would go through a process to come from and how do you property owners particularly new property owners know whether the site that they've bought or living in is contaminated well the listed land use register is a start point for that it doesn't tell you whether it's contaminated he tells you that you've had a hell activity on the side yeah and that may be something that could cause contamination and is that online or how do people yes the list of lunges register is now live on online and I would expect it this is certainly received quite a lot of publicity locally he can are still rolling out the and a part of a consultation roll out there doing is to various different professional agencies so including the real estate industry lawyers and people who would be dealing with conveyancing and sale of properties so people will start to pick this up just because you under listed land use registered doesn't mean to say that that will be automatically included on a limb so we we need to know there's a likelihood of contamination I think the listed land use register is one indicator but it doesn't guarantee that there is that there so what we've said within the provisions in in the draft plan is where contamination is confirmed so if there has been sighted investigations and we were aware of that that information cannon should be included on a limb so people would know if we're aware that we will make sure the test is closed obviously in some instances we won't be aware of it so we know you can't tell people what you don't know so say they're listed land use register is a start point a due diligence to do the research as to you know what they're buying now my understanding is that you wouldn't come off the register but you will be included as identified as verified non hail so the reason that they have indicated that they wouldn't want to take people off is it because if in future enquiry comes up and someone says well I seem to recall that there was something that happened on this site you don't want to have to go through the whole process again you just want to be able to go to one data source that says yes you know it looked like there was something that's been investigated and the outcome of that investigation is whatever so you are will be able to be verified non hail or if you are contaminated it will tell you more about that detail sorry top of it he couldn't but just quickly could to tell us how long it took two 4-bit register together did he he kind of been working on the register for a good number of years level so you know obviously it's a huge task across canterbury as a whole over the I think it's about the last 18 months it really accelerated work particularly on Christchurch so say it's mostly post-earthquake that they've done a lot of that research and the reason that they wanted to accelerate that is because of the amount of work that's going on either in land repair or because people are developing their their properties to fix them up there is a risk that you could start coming into contact with contaminated line so they wanted to make sure that people are aware of that and in fact one of the big advantages at the moment is that if you have some contamination say under your property and it needs work done too to repair the land and the foundation set potentially the cost of remediating the contamination could be dealt with through eqc so you know there's a real advantage of bringing this information forward yes it's another thing to deal with at a time when we've all got a lot ignore it and let people redevelop and then find out later on that they potentially got an issue so I think he kind of taken to view that it's timely to get that information out to let people consider it as part of the to rebuild and also to to ensure that people can comply with the national environmental standards so that's really why they've accelerated at work in that time frame yep
I understand that people have worked very hard over the tea break to come up with some agreed wording so yep so can we can we get that off up onto the main screen yep that's great okay so do we have a mover for the recommendations yani Johansson seconded by Paul lonsdale so is there any discussion on that Jonnie thank you I think this is one of the most critical things we can do as a new council coming in is to really have a good look at how scooter operating and actually respond to their quarterly reports we get a runner natural environmental recovery program which it's not our program but it's a program that we have where a member of em are involved in because I actually think it's really important when we identify emerging issues we don't just receive that information we actually take action so that's what these resolutions are doing they're trying to give a fit so the issues that have been raised and actually come up with a way in which we're actually doing quarterly report to come and highlight the same thing and I take take the example of a Swiss dose and you know this was raised with us several months ago and what we've seen is the situation getting worse becoming more and more apparent and so under number two sorry under number four it is good that there's a new approach that the staff are looking at and I think that can give us an opportunity really understand what we're doing and if we need to do more at that time then I think we should be really open to providing more enforcement staff providing more monitoring who knows but lived here from staff over what they need to address that issue because clearly our community are concerned as are a number of councils I would presume so it's an important issue it was raised previously with several months down the track and it's getting worse let's do something about it um first resolution is really just asking again for for that report to come back to us around changing how we could change chance to spend money with skirt we get one chance to fix our infrastructure and I cannot see the scenes and spending money two or three times on the same bit of pipe the same bit of road if we want to get a better environmental outcome or if we want to do something actually just slightly different that gets a better environmental outcome for the same cost at the moment we're seeing less for like being delivered we've seen areas that flood that don't appear to be taken into account in terms of their peers that are going on and we're losing opportunities and it is costing us millions and millions of dollars which we do not have so this is really critical and you were all be getting start with notices from skirt that that are coming in on a daily basis Manchester straight for example the one we've just approved earlier a Zionist there's no request and that team does it consider the stormwater network so we're fixing roads not looking at what's underneath and not looking at the with the sooner we get that report the bitter will be there's a few other things in there surge overflows I'm sure the environment committee is concerned about that having a report around you know what's happening there that is probably one target that we could have that we could measure that would be something to look at in terms of making progress or not and then the second point is from staff second resolution as our council service water strategies and and stuff and said this is one of the key differences with skirts approach so I think it's really important I just in terms of the staff resolutions the second one around the regular reporting to recovery strategy I did want a flag that I'm happy for the report on a quarterly basis going there but I do think there's a time lag and I think we need to actually get this report in front of the council as well as that committee having it so I just wanted the signal that maybe we could just a minute one slightly to ask committee so that we can all actually see what's happened thank you as there is there a recommendation that needs to be adjusted in that regard can you scroll up oh I see because I did speak to Chrissy Williams and the break and she did indicate that she will be providing the report to staff as early as she can in that sequence so that it can come to us much more quickly than it does now it's the question of how does that recovery strategy committee report to us given that that's got wider representation particularly from Sarah and from governments yeah but that's us that's that's internal I mean there are three of us who said on there four of us and and we've already raised the question about how we bring reports from that Advisory Committee back to Council so and I'm thinking that the way that we might do this is to introduce a as we have achieve executives report a mural report and all of those meetings that that I am involved in or other elected a whole could report back through that mechanism so what I was trying to understand is if that committee has recommendations for things to be done differently or in response to emerging issues what is the process for the incoming in front of us no no no we are representatives of the council on it and so we either seek advice from from colleagues or we come back to Council if there are issues but at this stage there aren't issues there are anything other than us representing the council's position when we when we feed unto them so for example we were feeding into the recovery stranded period visor II Committee on the residential red zone and we advise you know the position that we had on there and they that was pretty much endorsed by everyone else yeah there was one I'm just additional resolution and here which I didn't see but it was just around the flat water facility so number six just trying to get some advice over some clarity over time frames decision-making processes or a net flat water facility because around just how that process is panning out should it be from cyril or sarah and staff because we've got staff involved in it as well should be from Sarah okay alright so I'll put their motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much and think I do appreciate all that if a bit went under there
Any decorations of interest you to be none David lunch would you like to come forward and make your deputation introduce your colleague great somebody
Thank you amateur yeah um since you last saw this chip to become a 17th of April these three things that I just wanted to bring to your attention when was the requested changes that you'd asked for in relation to the definition of accessibility which I understand that you've already discussed in a workshop earlier this week and we're headed with they were too late comments from to public organizations arising from community engagement that I have included the responses to and the summary table that was distributed at the time that you received the chapter do you need me to go through that time line by line or you quite hit me with actually summary table the landscape summary table not the one I just handed out recently what does he know it was one item writer effectively there were changes changes to two definitions of rising for those requests one to the definition of retirement village which its prior to that it has been changed to the extent that the new definition is based on the definition of retirement village that comes out of around identifying the fact that retirement villages are somewhat different to a standard residential us and the suits that it provides for a whole host of activities and associated facilities etc not sure whether a can is able to elaborate on it into its a residential chapter related definition but I'm not sure if it can um no I don't_''_135.45 I don't think it's necessarily more liberal it the the definition from the retirement villages at 2005 on which is based is also largely around that these particular developments are for particular people retired people end or their spouses or dependence in one of the ways and which they are for particular of people is that they do buy into or have rights of occupation within these particular developments which is another us speak to know that's that's this one here no no no that was when I heard around Australia nobody's caught up no one's got us right okay I'll just well well will you bring some thank you while we're getting some copies taken I can move on just figured out earlier and basically all it does is just collect a number of amended or new definitions that I understand have been asked for in the last few days so it may be that you actually ask all of these but I just wanted to ensure that I had captured them all and that you were aware of them there's a new definition of density up left areas and minor change to public transport lenders change so very mind changes to the net floor area but as a result of the changes to that particular definition to others residential floor area and residential floor area ratio are no longer required so they'll be coming out an amendment to recreation activity that also provides for recreation activity undertaken on water bodies in as a result of that bringing through of the definition of water body from the RMA is a is a secondary definition cool right good and just the other thing I just wanted to mention is that there's still a few minor amendments to be made to some definitions on the basis of the don't anticipate any substantive changes but they will come before you as the council yes correct that's fine by us that there would be much more better use of time OMG yes I agree thank you
Oh she can't make it today mt r I understand the mirrors requested that matter be deferred to another day make the rest of us meeting and fruitful but from our point of view that doesn't raise a great issue in that we were suggesting putting that into the introduction part of the plan which as we've explained would be the non-statutory part of the planets an information section remember the discussion we had our concern about putting it in the objectives and policies yes and again that's something we can bring back to if and when we're ready to notify that's it from here the proposal was that if we'd got through all of these things then we would be looking to come to you and there was a tentative date I think of the fifth of June these data fifth of June we would bring the chapters basically for council to approve those being sent to the ministers and at that stage we would have brought to you any minor matters to deal with at that time as well yes that yes I would I would agree yes please monday look like monday looks like a good day I think that I think there'd be worthwhile because it is a matter that central government is interested in particularly how what we put into that vision statement is create create and I'm going to ask you a very technical question like we've had awards and paper and that's fine we put aside the drafts now here's the thing what with the plane when it's electronic okay yes so everybody will I'm assuming they'll be sort of cross links between the different parts korean fit yep so you can should be able to go from one plane part of the plan quite quickly to the other that is the plan and also technically we can do all that there is a timeframe in which we can take as far as we'd like to so in the first instance you'll be able to navigate across the plain quite quickly and easily then would be looking to try and put lots of additional links and a chapter and link yourself across and pull all your links together and just pull out the bit that you want so if you want the parking stuff as well as the activity status you can just click on all those and it produces it for you that's it that's the plan are just the definitions and then we had the university parking was the only outstanding matter sure if that correct yes if you'd like to do that that's fine to stay here janine that's fine that's it face too we're going to do phase two and we're going to get ourselves geared up for notification and submissions correct all right um so just on you just University packing what I've just um provided you is that the latest region on the other table that I've just we've just amended following our discussion yesterday so we've made it clear finally discussion how many staff parks that the investor needs to provide so there's a column for staff parks there's a column for residents visitors in 5.5 spaces for 150 students for staff and they will have to provide 20 spaces 150 students for residents and visitors and students so the total amount hasn't changed it's just was made it more clear as to how much will be allocated for staff how much we all headed for everyone else no I'm not on this table and we don't normally do that mostra plans don't do that it's really a management issue for the private landowner as to how much they provide this visitors this is yeah if a full-time yeah but it made about 3,000 spaces all that different they've got about that at the moment Oh give or take 100 yeah it's around 3,000 so these parking requirements will apply to all tertiary education research activities so that will be the the island site also the dovetail site and any other tertiary education so that is obviously not cpit because that's within the four ads but Ireland site and dubbed Oh a lumped is one yes so for packing what how is it treated so what they provide all the packet Dovedale yes yes so that would be assist through the integrated transport assessment as to because because of the size of the development they would need to go for an integration services minh and we'll be able to assess with a location of the parking is sufficient as a reasonably close for what they're proposing yes yes yes this is all all for future we can't_''_423.86 be rich beautifulness supplied on each part of the campus or over the campus as a whole so conceivably if I was the university of canterbury I could supply 2,000 car parks at dovedale but have 11,000 of my students at the island site so this doesn't apply to this can't_''_449.87 be retrospective so doesn't apply right so their current development their current development is this more carpets or fewer car parts well if they do any further development then they will have to provide more pop-ups Army in terms of course requirement under the operative plan how many capex per thousand students are there it is the same as that of the capex on their land or on our roads they are required for the morn on O'Neill an off-road off right is right okay it any comments gimme my concern at the moment are regarding to the poverty of street and Pakistan were they already know fully occupied by the student car in the area so it is a state-by-state you know to build a new accommodations for students but the likely based on your load and new law in here twenty spaces all over 100 full-time student or staff just 5.5 publish steel shifted to the you know they're cut to park in the on street along the the top tier and Pakistan and surrounding area maybe that is parking issue marketing was so how to alleviate at least the situation because as you are well in the area the Western Association individual they already make a bigger company yeah so we had discussed mr. ionized plasma information which model it on you this way yesterday and I can't apply to you if you don't have it that the university done a lot of surveys with to the University the rest are the cycle will walk or catch a public transport so we're quite confident with these figures that it will based on surveys will provide enough parking to to meet the demand cuz obviously not all the students turn up same time so so we're not going to provide for the thirty percent that's why we're providing for about twenty-five percent of the of the students made their demand for new development going forward it can't_''_603.62 be seen enrich speak respectively so we can't address the existing issues through these provisions so for new development we can't we're confident in the figures that they'll provide sufficient car park the amount of students the amount of staff but it's not going to get rid of the existing issue that you have a thirty percent in a skilled in unit hello loca but I'm constraints only that but would there these four tempest rather than the island Kipnis and Mindy's please yeah that survey was was taken over the whole the whole of the University drive to dovetail versus island but they're so close that's probably pretty similar because the public transports pretty similar they're actually not close until car parking if you park at the corner of dovedale campus it takes you a good 17 18 minutes to walk to the first part of the art on campus so you're never going to pack there and so the total number of car parks includes both which is kind of bizarre it's like the parking for riccarton mall being at church corner really an impact 17 minutes walks very similar well you might go really delicious I don't know um I I think I think these are pretty reasonable spaces for students to capo I know there's an impact on residents we've got a whole strategic transport plan that includes public transport and cycling we're putting their unity cycle way as I said yesterday through the and I get like that the research shows that students these current students are more affluent then then previously on previously and they will are like give more cars it have car packs for every little one so I totally buy that and I totally buy that you don't providers k-pax so that people actually are encouraged to do that the difficulty is that some of the car parks on the site at the University at present and I appreciate it's not an issue for the district plan review completely unusable and it would be really good if somebody would go and slept and make sure that they were usable and also that and also that what they're doing is putting both campuses together is actually meaning that their car parking is not adjacent to the end use which is kind of interesting just on that issue madam chair david has has a few preliminary discussions with the people from Council who are chatting with the University of Canberra about their travel plans so that that conversation has started so we made them aware of the issues that you brought to our attention yesterday so that will go on to the conversation around the treble plan and I really think that's probably the best mechanism because integrative transporter system part of that consideration will be the travel plan itself and it's probably the best mechanisms are trying to deal with that existing plus the news but the development plan for the Deaf del campus is part of their last round of funding yep Yanni you know I mean I'm not happy about this but I accept you know what you're saying but have you think about like this outside of the cv j and maybe some of the shopping mall this would have probably one of the most intensive types of activity in the city on a day-to-day basis yeah so I mean I phone the idea of having an integrated public passenger transport terminal is really important so what you know I just do we have any I know we've kind of had this quite yet we do the integrated traffic assessment but if if they don't want to provide extra car parking and I think the requirement should be that they do provide you know off street bus facilities for public transport there is in a closed you know we can do that as well ya like like you know you think about like a a bus lounge basically rather than just you know again us paying for the cost of providing amenities that they should be providing in my view run am a nice focus on that tavo tell tempest dragon either iron already Africa park I can place tavo there this my understanding school just focus on accommodation still come only in the poverty the first so when they come to do their overall their plan that we actually look at public transport set down points within the university campus so that just like we're putting bus lanes not bath lanes bike lanes out there that there is actually good bus provision in and around the university and maybe through the university report assistant manners and integrated assessment to look at that obviously he can control the bus routes so I think through the treble plan we will work with hmm with the University and lock on this issue resources yeah you can really diggin I'm assuming given that they don't that when you they can't do that because actually all the cats student cap at center visitor ones are rolled into one I don't think there's anything to stop your doing that through the undergrowth French school assessment to see bit of clarity in terms of what will visitor car parking and what's for students and what's fur for workers
Rixon last time I remember the trap to the residential zone meeting in a workshop you promised in Rick's annual nose and the teens F waste this will remain no change but I look at this one day looks like for instance I guitarist reaiah Streeter you become the rest ensure the medium density and also the from the mendo Nam in the wear waist and liquid road nose and current lease the Easter this area you become the residential our suburban density transition so this is a bigger change you why what's Visionnaire so the existing pattern of Zoning around riccarton is this large area of existing living three this this area here is zoned this area here is owned is living to answer existing this not existing living to and this area here is living one it's also existing l3 this area is existing the living three as is this area here yep okay the only change the only change in riccarton is a small block of land to the west of the mall the the extent of zoning suitable for medium density in Richter yes yes yep fairly consensus was at the last meeting that the extent of medium density is appropriate for surely that's it that's it I didn't see the church corner area Apple raked in the change you are no change I didn't see no change no change no change Steelers head okay thank you the the avulsion the engineers was that there's no constraint in surely in regards to infrastructure to support medium density so hit hills in Warrington that area is is well away from the area we've looked at for intensification around charlie yeah so that that wasn't an area we were looking at this part of this work it it's similar as the discussion with with Lynwood it's a similar process and I guess just on that point in applies to other data types of infrastructure is if you have a focus for medium density you know it's going to happen it helps you focus where a future investment will be to deal with any of the effects from intensification yeah all right we'll just there pager which has heated up further amendments to residential chapters so you've had John's just taking you through those intensification he's the matter for the green building and life stage requirements the instruction from the last workshop was for us to confirm I remember there was a flow diagram put up which explained how it would go through a building consent process and the question was raised has this been checked and the answer was no we haven't had a chance so the answer is now yes we have and so they're sitting out that is we can confirm that those minimum energy and water efficient standards or features are mad as they consider as part of building consent application they do not consider there's any additional resource time expertise to ensure compliance so what would so that's confused there so we're good on that so no amendment required the third point there is just confirming as John's talked about changing that overlay to the transition zone and then the last matter there was those requirements we are suggesting for rainwater conservation zones now just sitting out there on the staff response we've had a look at the requirements for the tanks and so the first point of that is the network is saying even if you put in tanks now it's unlikely to defer capital works by the council to improve the water supply in those areas secondly just over the page we did an analysis of the likely cost that would come with putting in tanks of course the main cost of course is not in the tank themselves but it's actually all in the foundation worm what have you to make the tank stable and connected to the houses so we've noted there is the payback time is really is not even optimistic even in the life of a tank which is 30 years our analysis purely on the basis of we were at the moment it would be about eight years for 13 and a half thousand litre tank so there are obviously some environmental costs in terms of looking after streams and water supplies that could go into this but certainly at same as we do with the residential with the energy things for the residential component we were getting returns within 18 months to two years here the returns are a long way off in terms of any financial opportunity mendation is at this stage we remove and that's andis third column is remove the objectives and policies relating to that the tanks there and that we continue though to advocate for rainwater tanks through a non-regulatory as opposed to the regulatory process at this stage so that was the recommendation thank you what the actual prices prices of a tank I silveira roundabout sort of 15k for a 30,000 litre tank and it's cool and pressurized that haven't got the exact costs here but as I said the main costs are actually in the foundation works and doing the engineering and earthworks to make the platform for the tanks and keep them install that's the foundation cost that takes themselves are a minimal sub part of the cost could they be like just today she need a better foundation or can they be buried in the then there's another cost added to that as well you still need to excavate just don't got we excavate still got to do something with the material you'll be excavated we have a lot of water issues on the peninsula and we have a lot of water restricted so if someone was doing a new house I can't understand what would cost so much to be done at the same time I can understand for retrofitting but I just I think we're losing a huge opportunity here to do this see I well I'm not sure it does like I do what can we get a breakdown of those costs because I just I struggle to understand what with a new build why that would cost so much okay oh I've a she had a quote from a builder for a 15k for a 35-year 3500 litre tank got the same price for a 10,000 litre tank for grey water which can we re utilized in watering your garden and so forth and 5000 for a freshwater tank it's a few exactly the report that was prepared to to do this and I suppose that is the difficulty is you're not charging for water so that's we're not getting those cost benefits coming in because essentially the waters the answers what is the factor when people actually when there's a water shortage in the peninsula what is the factor that you take into account so the analysis here has also looked at the where you have to fill your tanks and even that doesn't increase the cost to an amount that makes the cost-benefit worthwhile so there's various costs in this report and I'll make that available to the counselors so for example cost of purchasing installing a 13 and a half thousand litre tank is assumed to be approximately nine nine and a half to ten thousand dollars certainly men that's the end of that so then all we've got left and not just em in your hands I understood the mere wish to be involved in the discussion about the vision statement she does so we'll hope will move on I said these are just ones that haven't come to you as a result of other chapters dealing with those and you have in front of you should have a copy of the definitions chapter and Janine if you could just come and speak to that thank you cool I yesterday
Next centuries Mary Val the discussion at the last meeting was focused around the area to the west of papillary road I'll just indicate that now for you it's so this was an addition it intermediate the medium density papanui and the the consensus the Papen II was that the proposed extent of the zone was appropriate made no changes on the screen okay so this this this commercial area of Kappa nu is often small which is approximately here he also continues right down along along papanui road here they North Road so what we also have in this area is an area of business 5 currently we applied the same principle here as we did in hornby and we looked at having an exclusion effectually exclusion zone to avoid any reverse sensitivity issues in the future I know there is some question mark over the future use of that site but as it stands we have to look at what the current zoning is which is business five for that reason we removed this area from consideration we thought it appropriate we didn't look at looking at this particularly area is that the community housing redevelopment mechanism which is enables very similar outcomes to the enhanced event mechanism applies in this particular area here where there is a concentration of them some how's New Zealand sock so there is the potential for medium density in this area through that mechanism rather than rezoning to medium density through district I'm with you just to clarify we're not actually proposing any new Altos they're just shown the air for context yes sir this is quite a kind of sense bizarre so you've got on one side of the city you've got huge intensification in lynnwood so we've actually got l2 it's it's intensified it's gone from let's change yeah you know has it's gone from l1 to l2 over in the model well if it's not huge intensification then what's the issue you just said you're not proposing any new residential suburban density transition zones yes so as part of the intensification package here that John has been presenting all the areas medium density the only reason we have now shown in brown some of existing l2 is to give context is the waters around where we are suggesting the only l2 that we're proposing is going to be Linwood because of your decision now but you're not changing the existing l2 you're putting out right yeah and the reason that you're not recommending a kind of a smaller change to intensification rather than it a big change is what that's not what I don't understand there is already some additional ability that we've put into the district plan for existing l2 which is a transition zone and that is that now multi-unit development is permitted up to three units so we are actually enabling but by saying it has permitted to do multi-unit small-scale multi-unit and lt you know what I'm what I'm trying to understand as in terms of intensification obviously you've looked at the terror and you've gone well we don't think it should go to the yellow yep that why haven't you looked into well we do because there was an yep the existing pattern of Zoning around Happy New recenter we have l2 to the west of the railway line we have two pockets of existing l3 very close to the center which are these two here and this area is largely existing l2 where there is the greatest change in theory is in this area here where there is some existing l1 which we feel this appropriate to move to residential medium density so there's two blocks very close to Northlands more
From initial explanations didn't seem that there's a large area being intensified anyway and like the areas as you've you've referred to Vicki around resemble people like living near parks and supermarkets they like going me and being close in schools so it just seems to me and we've heard from the staff that you know there's not a significant problem with the infrastructure and it just seems to end until the cut the costs of of improve of improving say some of the streets I would expect that there will be in a pro rata basis with other new developments so it seems to me with it it's a good place to have some development compete with others now I have like if you've got the comprehensive development mechanism to intensify it in this area great because you know you're going to get hope well apart from what happened in richmond hopefully we learned you're going to get some nice amenity nicely designed units what you're seeing in this yellow area other future slums of the city they that actually contribute nothing to people's well-being all they do is put people in like sardines and provide more reasons for conflicts so accepting that this is already currently zoned and people are reluctant to rezone any of it I invite you to go and look at some of the developments that have been there they look like prisons they look like when you kick chickens they are hen houses they are dog houses they are not places that will make any contribution to a better city and so you know I'm really worried about the social disaster we're going to have the interesting thing about this area as the capacity exists for intensification now so by providing more opportunities for more intensification I think actually what you do is create the risk that you lose some of the houses that have been looked after probably first-time homebuyers many of them lower working-class families that have bought you know the first house done it up made it nice into you know six or seven really small apartment blocks that do nothing for a sense of community that you know not very good outcomes I want us to intensify around the malls I think that makes a lot of sense but I want it done in a way that's takes a holistic approach and provides good urban development and amenity not the kind of lowest cost lowest quality and you end up getting places that really don't have any connection to a neighborhood and that's what actually one of the nice things about that that Norwich street mcclain Street runner street area is it actually the fact that you can see people restoring those older houses and turning them into things that you know people do have a sense of product so you know I think there's there's some really strong social economic analysis that we need to do around the impacts of intensification of large areas in terms of understanding what that actually means well through you Vicky can I just ask what the only what what would you what are you saying this should be zoned or s intensive I can I add just a little bit of detail because I in our proposal for the intensification areas that are not existing medium density we are actually proposing the height limit to remain at 80 meters as opposed to the height limit of medium density existing medium density which is 11 so we have actually discussed in provided for that transition to happen with this tension where we are going from say L 1 2 L 3 and and when you bring the height down to 8 meters the difference between alto and those intensified areas is actually going to be a small difference the things like Gardens the things of loss of trees lots of plants lots of space for children to play that's that's the impact isn't it it's a site coverage as well as the height about your moving Yanni and Paula seconding if we have to do it formally and that this area in the McClain Norwich Pamela Pauline area and becomes l2 not medium density not residential medium density is that correct ok so can I just put that and see how it goes and then go from there is it ok that's fine so that's going to pass so really major change and all maybe not major change given models just been cleared ok so that becomes L to correct ok all right can we go to the next one
Right Thank You Mara and Cheer this is the residential part of the workshop now you should have in front of you with a single a single piece of paper which has just heated up further amendments to residential chapter arising from feedback to date and it's just a single piece of paper yes so as you'll see there's just four matters to run through and the first one here is about the residential intensification arounds some suburban centers and John scelan can take you through those maps and as I said previously was just to make sure we'd captured what you are intending from the last workshop make sure we got that right so I'll just leave that to John to take you through thank you niacin though I will go through each of the sensors just in alphabetical order so starting with Bishop Dale the direction from the last meeting was to include an additional area to the northeast of harewood road Bishop Bell I've just indicate on on the screen and this area here which is horizontal hash is the area time we were yeah you saw this map yes it was yes okay so horn be the consensus that we took from the last meeting was that the the area was was appropriate as it was so we've made no changes to the map there I thought one of the questions we head is around committed drive behalf around that area brenson intermediate that that was an area that could be intensified you've only got through very small places and porn bay agreed allow sum it up we do recall where she and reflection when we got down towards Linwood and the high intensification on the area's quite a distance from the key activity center that in a reflection we look back at what was happening here and thought it wasn't enough so around neil street around that whole area but I can't understand the justification for not having any intuitive vacation maybe you could just help us understand that again so that we know that there's shopping we know there's traffic access even it was horrible access on the 11 burn as can I just assume that you didn't know that wasn't your understanding John you you were seeing was it it should be just as it is you hadn't recorded with their way my recollection of notes senting record there was there was some debate around around this particular area last time but my notes indicate that the consensus was that it was to not be included so this is limit okay so you will recall last time that the area extended to to the north and to the east of the center and also to the south of Lynwood park so the direction we received was to look at this area again and we have removed this area to the south of them with park and again trailing the hash there these two small pockets here the west of Lynwood park we've retained within the residential medium density zone and that's largely to reflect the fact that there is already significant change in those particular blocks a number of them have actually already transitioned to a medium density billable just quickly else what the residential density transition is effectively a renaming of what was going to be the living to overlay so it's effectively covers the extents of the existing living to area in the in the operative crack the l2 is it the same as the the medium density is it like the same know so that's why it's called the transition area Alto is basically a transitional zone between l1 and l3 which now L 1 is the suburban residential suburban yep so and l3 is medium density so in effect l2 which we named as the answer to transition is the transitional zone in terms of density between the suburban and the medium density that's good good in terms of um pamela street pauline street chelsea straight why have you included that like it's got pretty poor traffic access and yeah I just bench to the new thoughts I mean I knocked around the mall but provides its own issues in terms of cars parking etc etc I can just indicators this area to the to the east of the mall here exactly nothing ok so correct criteria is primarily around access and the primary access is by walking so that's what we've looked at as the is the basic criteria for selecting the areas vehicle access to the center around these areas is it's not necessarily a high level criteria it's really around walking access might just go back to horny so one of one of the issues around hornby is the industrial area which is indicated here which is part of the purple area on the on the map we one of the things we'd be mindful of in looking at these areas for intensification is potential for reverse sensitivity impacts and as we discussed at the previous meeting around home where you have these b5 industrial zones which come quite close to the mall and proximate to the existing residential area and in order to avoid reverse sensitivity we thought it was appropriate to avoid increasing the density in the areas that are closest to these industrial zones these areas in brown are living too at the moment under the operative plan and would transition to the residential medium in these areas at the moment and will be in the future although not to the same density as it will be enabled in these areas up here to the west of the park then what are we Stuart home yep believe its mix of living one living to mostly living one correct okay the same aspect is relevant for all key activity centers so then we would need to not intensify around any of the key activity centers which all have which all have a mall as it stands now so there is there would be a small conflict and the objective of intensifying around key activity centers and your argument of saying while key activity centers have high traffic issues therefore we should this one looks incredibly big if you were going to cut it back which are the bits that you would forgo ah I personally don't have a problem with it but I'm aware that these guys have to represent this area there's actually a question I'm looking at the old city plan l3 zoning and and the designation of what that always been l3 so there's no actual change here the Zuni yellows are the new bar areas the l3 to the left of the Met basically is existing in Sicily that pisses Joe area Vera zorina sting else really the percy suffolk yellow yes that's a worse been so would we come under issues I changing it back if we've got to existing land owners who have poured border okay yeah fair point so the actual new areas of intensification are over here in Rowan and McClain round limit intermediate area immediately around the mall okay okay so that that extra bit of yellow on the left of the map I will call this now sorry was as already there my apologies okay right so if you take that out yani is relatively similar to most of the other character dissenters we'll find out and come flying up coming to know the brown is existing living to under the operative plan and again it has with this area to the west it has been for that way for some time right so the extra bit is nemikone Erick area that's it when you think about that limit intermediate schools that would make a fantastic about UTM there is some similarities between the extent of the EDM applies in this area and the extent of the residential medium density so this indication on the map here and you're right around with intermediate sight the EDM criteria would have high largely around this area it's a bit patchy which is a result of having a criteria based assessment rather than a map mapping approach one way to look at it would be by zoning to residential medium density particularly in this block between the more than the school you're effectively filling in the blanks where the EDM wouldn't apply which one potential outcome is more persistent over form across that block it's actually a fantastic area for intensification that area around mclean the street there it's got everything on its back door great park interesting more no there's a big median strip that you cross over quite easily even with class of limb with intermediate school kids were here there this block as well yeah that's right mr. wizard yeah um okay so have you got a proposal yet cuz so which part particularly so the both the yellow bits around them all which are the only bits that are actually changing hmm but those are the only new additions are they yeah so you're seducing that we don't do anything around the limb word shopping center is is that actually how much of a change is that actually now from el L want to go through an l1 and l2 or have their kind of gotten similar more similar l2 allows you to do effectively 30 households per hectare at the upper range of what's possible when living to l1 developed its full capacity would deliver somewhere between 20 and 25 very much depends on the layout of the sites and what you can do in terms of subdivision the big difference between operative living one and living tourism is in the site coverage and so it is the site size which really dictates what the density will be when you move into existing living the way that the minimum site size is calculated changes which allows you to achieve high densities of 30 households per hectare so it in terms of a change yes in theory there is less of a change going from resonant from living to two great sexual medium dead see them it may be from moving from living one to residential medium density and we don't need to know whether this is living mine or living too that's what somebody's finding out is that you yes okay hey Jimmy sorry yes they are yes they so just just just to be clear that the change in this area to the north of the mall it's largely a transition from living to to residential medium density this area over here I can't draw you the exact extent on the map but this area is involved some change from what is currently living 12 residential me do this right okay do you want to put some changes yani or okay you're on Thank well I'm assuming given that that was one of the requirements that that that's been cheap is that a fair assessment the advice from the the engine is is that there was not a constraint on me my dad see them in the same yeah and did you want to answer yannis question so I'm assuming that the area around Rouen and McClain etc was mostly living too and that the area around Chelsea Russell Pamela was mostly living one so trying to indicate as best I can on the Mac attack so really the block ball during the mall itself is currently living too yeah and then this area here quite small area is living one and there's also a strip of living to actually along the road frontage and obvious probably some elements of living to one just on some of these blocks at the far edge of this and the other side of the road all L to this this is all L melted okay right okay you want to move something honey because I'm going to get on the meta we've got it says p2p what does b2p it doesn't say old area so it's packing at the moment that's connected with the mall but it's chelsea straight that's it something's not right on the net that we've got what ya need do you want to move something this is as I understood the last decision was made do you want to suggest a change at this stage yeah offices to change that the area around them all the entire area yeah the entire area be not resigned is that what you may be residential suburban density transition so it goes from l1 to l2 you know including the area around them on intermediate because it can have the mcat it can have the cop I just get an indication so this is the just for those who've come in late the little bit of yellow on the right by a random word intermediate school and the bit round Pamela and Chelsea street are the only bits actually affected by the current change the big bit of yellow on the other side around Buckley and Suffolk and positive to see are already living three or under debate is the area right around the mall and actually part of the strategic statement talks about intensifying areas around could be activity centers so the only something favor of it can I just get are you in favor of it pull back Ellie the semi few schools go in here there are somewhat fewer schools going in the area then worthy so perhaps if I can ask David calculor from the transcript chapter to thwart the question for sure so the reason why when the reasons why we are trying to identify around system kid heavy dissenters and assisting malls is to obviously reduce the distance where people have to travel to to excesses services and if we didn't allow for education around these areas and the growth would have to go and a more remote location in the periphery of the city for example where that would generate even more traffic than what it would if people living here where they could walk to the shops so that's one of the rationale around while we're trying to encourage intensification to try and reduce the this area but the reality is is with the population projections that we've got it over the next 30 years the growth in the city is the equivalent to the man who live in dunedin so is that the city will grow by about 130 or residents a thousand residents so we need to accommodate that we're at somewhere we need to accommodate all that all that traffic so we need to coordinate in this traffic and with own crisis in the next 30 years the best place to do it is to her to be able to walk on cycle clip to the local shops sure be in the environment the area yeah look we will have to hit monitoring the situation obviously what we're trying to do is encourage people to use those other modes it's going to be a matter of funding as to whether we've got funding to build additional infrastructure and that will come down to a long-term plan discussion we in this area what I'm aware of is obviously we've got two major soft way coming through the big infrastructure or transmits are suspended in this area we have obviously the fury road master plan and that had some provision for additional bus infrastructure and potentially widening part of fury road to deal with additional traffic but whether the funding of that will come down to the long-term plane discussion but actually what you're trying to do earlier is take increased traffic out of there by making it having more people were living closer to the mall that's the whole thrust of the residential chapter of the district plan this area for example limit Intermediate School used to have a role of 600 so it's got resource in that space for what was 600 kids and at closure was about a hundred and thirty kids so it has actually got enormous provision but there is enormous land there is enormous roads and everything and around there and it's not difficult to get to that area most of the schools they're coming over on to that linwood ave and site and there's Linwood primary going into the new limb would ever school are on this side of the of the road and I've cross that road many times with actually groups of schoolkids and it's not difficult to do I'm not worried about that I think it's quite a good area to walk in I actually really like this part of town I think it's great and it just seems to me that if we don't keep consistency then we do have a big problem of if we want to intensify we need to do some of it I'm you know if you guys are really worried about all of it I'm quite happy to go with your recommendation on chopping some of it but the whole lot is just a wee bit
Yeah okay what's your next one just very quickly it's just an update we met with Alistair castles about the tanneries blacks and better understands his proposals for a psychopath Wharf bridge and there's nothing in the district plan that would create an obstacle to those proposals he may need resource consent from Environment Canterbury but there's nothing in the proposed plan we're in the commercial chapter or industrial chapters that and then certainly in terms of you know the area plan approach that we might look to do for the wall stones and various other areas who is very keen to be involved in that when that came forward in the euro size time so at this stage comfortable with we were at so he could get started now if you wanted to yes justice really a Regional Council and there might be some function for council as a road owner or some of those other regional council in relation to the river uses yes CSF there are discharges and those sorts of things associated with the bed of the river then that's the current zoning on his side being remaining the zoning with before de in the proposed plan is what was sought in part what was sought and has risen feedback on the draft chapter which is industrial general that's right yes yes yeah he was comfortable that the resource consent process had gone well for him that the things that needed to be dealt to were well dealt to and he didn't see any impediments for his future development with that zoning he was accepting of as some sort of process to go through and that was that was fine Lygia yeah cool thank you right hey let's check what time um if any with we're breaking later yes right that here's the next topic that's coming through to you is the residential which is about the the rezoning around suburban centers the the intensification and also the new neighborhood zone so let's clarify when Leanne said make sure they do that last what for them without you she was a provision to division statement putting that into the introduction detection so okay with you guys which way do you want to do it we're in your hands so you can you can make the call by the way a microphone on and effectively the new neighborhoods end is a generic generic new zone for new greenfield development areas you'll be aware in the past that green pill areas were released under a set of rules called living G and each particular area well I'll come on to there in a second had its own sets of rules it's at this stage really only going to progress to areas that are identified in the loop the existing areas of living G which have their own rules enshrined in the plan they will carry forward until those sites have built out and those rules will then fall away and become defunct so this is really a set of rules going forward so why is it needed was a needed to already eat a previous cream feel there it had its own flavor of living G rules and each time these morality and it added another 80 or so pages the and complication which yeah this plan is trying to weed out a little bit but so the rules would be you know you could look at them and you find it hard to spot the difference but there'd be small tweaks that related to a particular area that you know perhaps picked up a little nuance but is it really necessary some of the assessment methods when you come to resort no no I mean that it's sort of picking up am particular issues about local the way that a certain reserve might be orientated you know does that really need to be enshrined in a rule or good assessment matters downstream actually a better way of controlling that rather than arguing that out up front and making it too rigid anyway so yes I mean the plan changed process was highly complex very time-consuming and then further down the stream with when it came to actually consent if things had changed somewhere along the way the rules were so casting the stone that it was very difficult to achieve a different or better outcome and then minor but certainly perhaps over-exuberant resource consenting processes so alongside that there are policy directions and pointers in certain directions there is the intention to make better use of land by increasing density coming out of the urban development strategy the RPS and lerp this whole issue around promoting housing choice it's fair to say that the types of houses coming out of our subdivisions perhaps a little uniform and and and I think really carrying forward some of the directions that were already being pursued anyway you know ensuring that good development is achieved that connects to could transport and infrastructure networks as access to good locally scale facilities and amenities integrated with cultural and natural and heritage assets dealing with any residual natural hazards and stage two fit when infrastructure was going to be made available so those are all good principles that all the relevant should follow so those aren't new it's it's it's carrying on those and doing those better where we can and then in terms of the outcomes that we're trying to achieve I think this is the area as I've indicated the rules set some fairly rigid standards that really just drove compliance rather than good outcomes the rules also or rather the process of subdivision perhaps it wasn't really keeping track with what markets or housing needs really are there's a disconnection between sub dividing up the land and then the house that's eventually built on it there needs to be a greater integration of those and the way that's done also perhaps like stymied diversity and innovation if you want a whole set of cookie cutter sized blocks you're going to get to be honest cookie cutter sipes outcomes and then really there's this whole issue around creativity and place making planning is a is a regulatory function but it can also be a creative activity giving developers the opportunity to have less rules and more ability to bring paul good ideas that can be assessed rather than guided by rules is an opportunity that has to be made available let's look at some of these in terms of visuals is a I suppose a classic current subdivision bottle there with large houses and on the top of the screen you have sorry I'll point towards those so you've got your standard blocks down here a fairly large sizes with large houses on you know it's fine yeah those are on Team eating these but the ax livin g approach laterally is introduced to sort of higher density areas the point wasn't very good so you can see the smaller what's up there but it's still got sites they're the same large houses on so when you know you're what you're seeing there is a compromise on open space I know there are those the sorts of homes that are necessarily appropriate here perhaps in an inner city in urban setting where there are improved areas of amenity then sorry serve again I'd rather not say I don't want to embarrass anybody I mean there was for this area yes and identified density a dats d billion density see areas and you can see that you know the variants are here and now the one that was'm getting out the rules drive compliance so those were outcomes hit within the rules but was it really what we were intending perhaps not so moving on to perhaps I don't know an area that might be more reflective of what we're seeking building areas that are you know develop a sense of place this area here has got a mixture of back lanes there's a street here which is actually got a parked car play along uh I don't know actually somebody pointed me towards it and I can't remember the names of the streets but it's it's north of your first road before you get to the racecourse in that sort of part of the town I think the river runs along along the top of the of the image shown here but yes you've got you've got of streets here there are still access ways around and about here for cars to get out but this direct cut has been taken out this streets been turned into a park here you've got you know cul de which means that you know these people here perhaps of you know that's it's still a still a private space but those people can take a bit more ownership to that than perhaps a wide you know typically engineered street no I mean in fairness that's a more mature area but you know there I think you know the rules were perhaps not as rigid at the time obviously the area has evolved and in fairness and comparing the two clearly you know the previous one has yet to mature in terms of its vegetation and all the rest so it's it's a little unfair comparing in that sense but if we can encourage outcomes that over time start to look like this rather than being cast into blocks that are quite rigid and really there's no scope for change that's that's got to be a way forward so one of the key changes of approach that the new neighborhood zones going to bring in as I said there's a single generic set of rules and that they're far less and give some more flexibility however they will still control the basics how the structural layout of an area works how that fits with you know typical standards and requirements that would be normally expected but you know without perhaps some of the rigidity that was there before and also the types of buildings there will still be the need for setbacks between fences yeah the way in which buildings relate to the street and so on in terms of encouraging housing mix there's an expectation that within individual development particular type ologies are assigned to Lots so at the moment the lots are all cut up and you don't really know what's going to end up on there the aim is that subdivision stage there is an indication of the type of unit that will go on there and it'll be one of these four types it will be a standalone house which might have variance of one story to story or so on and so forth be a duplex not semi-detached or how you might want to describe that a terrace a group of at that stage you can be sure that there will be a degree of mix in that area the absolute form of the house clearly is for something for further downstream and that you know there has to be a degree of ability for the the buyer or the Builder to you know build so it's not pinning down the absolute form but it's least giving an indication and then in terms of I'm making that happen and dealing with this issue about control or creativity there are two different consenting roots proposed there's a traditional subdivide the land up first with some knowledge of what that typology of house that's going on there and then a consent for the building or there's this comprehensive route whereby there's a single combined land use and subdivision consent whereby the land really is cut up based on the building formats girl going on it the developer can look at an area and think right I could try to terrace in there and I could worry and take that I could get a few more houses those you know and helping to create something that's a bit more it's got a bit more soul to it as if that's the best way of describing it so that that second route really takes away a standard lot size if you go down the standard route your Lots guys lot size is going to be a minimum of 300 square meters or four hundred square meters on a corner and that's it you know there's no flexibility there if you go the comprehensive roof and look at it all together and understand the relationships there are no minimum lot sizes you've clearly you're proving that you know you're not doing the over shading that people's privacy have protected their a good amounts of open space and all the rest of it so there's a there's the the carrot if you like so you have lost to slide somewhere in hand so what that's okay there was a table trying to expand think I think the key the key thing within this is that under a living that can take you two or three years you then got a subdivision consent to be on through and then you've got your land use consent that approach is still available under the traditional route although the plan preparation process will be much more simple if you go down this comprehensive route there is a single stage consent for any given area and that's you know clearly from a bureaucracy point of view improving the speed of process see your hand up I squid around social housing part of the new neighborhood zones and if they are has its might of time today it might be well it's specifically social housing is not identified within them however that doesn't mean to say that you know the likes of housing New Zealand community housing providers couldn't fire lots within those you know I mean for example a terrace might be created that creates smaller relatively affordable units you know one of those organizations Asians could buy in and build those and they'd be there but in terms of asking that a development provides for social for this I mean I like that and I mean I like to look at this at first glance I mean it's break out that whole sameness automation can I uska me up we would information about how these houses will be as affordable as possible like my understanding is that currently a lot of developers say that they they'll provide the houses of course but there's no potential for people say to bring in and accept to shift and existing often perfectly good house safe from the red zone to be able to move there and into an area that a developer's developing in any way it is that because that they are able to you know keep them all step standard or is there a way say that council could ask them to waive their in order to make house that the houses affordable was possible in these development in the greenfield developments I mean the current current rules clearly drive things in a certain direction and there are some standards and sometimes well covenants are also applied which also add controls that we approach will go I mean in in theory you know if a sub divider I thought I was approached fairly early on by somebody or groups of people who wanted to relocate red zone houses lots could be designed to fit those and you know they could then form part of that Bambrick I think in terms of wider affordability the fact that some of these homes will be smaller you know and I don't think you know the term shoe box is always floating around when you say or smaller houses you know we're not talking you know studio flats or one bedroom house yeah I think these are just small modest houses that you know meet people's needs that are not extravagant and that people can actually afford people you know there is a housing ladder which people can't_''_1099.169 be expected to go into a 200 square meter large house from the word go sometimes you've got to work your way up I think difficulty at the moment is that the market is not providing that ladder of people to climb at this on means that these subdivisions and deliver a greater diversity of homes that put those steps in the ladder back in s than 300 square meters absolutely I mean it's worth I mean I'll carry on Justin finish the presentation here because it starts to look at some of that you've got the spray danlod scheme which you will have looked at the rest now as the exemplary you months ago as I said the new process still requires and outline development plan is put together but this stand of set of rules will then be dressed on to that and then below that there's the expectation that a neighborhood plan for the error is put together so there's an understanding of its structure but when you get into the detail and these are the diagrams are probably more interesting you can see the different colors on the different Lots up there yeah I could duplicate these and reply true provide these to you if needed but the top ones there are sort of defining the different sizes of lot so I think the light't_''_1173.39 you know there are some Lots there that are down to 120 square meters yeah yeah yeah and whereas the purple ones are effectively apartment buildings that you know Mike you know provided three or four units within a within a building and then there are variants of those and the work behind this that's to understand the relationships between them you know the shading the privacy you know different forms of access shared access by understanding all that together that whole block can be consented you know and there are variants of the house which could then build on to effectively brings forward groups of houses rather than cutting the land up and then trying to think how does this house fit into this particular lot and can I be a bit more innovative in how this is all about so and then I say this is also a company by the whole range of detail you'd expect you can see shading diagrams their access plans landscaping and then the ultram ultimately the treatment of the streets you know I think the standard subdivision reply it council perhaps in some cases do we need to be looking at can we create different types of streets that are not just for cars you know some of these streets that are proposed here are mixtures of still streets and cycleways but also you know having formal parts and play areas in them you know these aren't major roads that are carrying lots of traffic they are you know effectively the lowest denominator a road that serves the house or the individual street thank you my question isn't so much about the way the lady out on it it's more about selecting the areas for greenfield development and you'll probably be aware that last week council among a range of resolutions in relation to flooding asked that in fact yeah that the upstream developments be considered in terms of the potential for downstream flooding yeah and so like it is there sufficient sort of teeth in the plane that we in fact that it's pretty clear that an area had a history for example of flooding that in fact that subdivision not be allowed being progressed through this stage of the plan are identified in the loop and you know they've gone through processes to some extent that you know prove all of that in terms of the new sites coming forward in the future I mean the plan change process does explore all of the hazards you know other implications and clearly downstream effects on potential flooding is one of those I think counts there's probably a few chapters that have come forward to that address that particularly the natural hazards chapter and I think you've got there some policies which we're talking very much about avoid development and a non-complying activity and your high hazard whether that be a high flooding has a door or a rock fall or whatever so that's one aspect so any sub-divisional development would need to be considered against that sort of policy the policies also in the in the subdivision chapter and you'll find also within the new neighborhood provisions of the residential chapter that there are also provisions in there about managing effects a avoiding your natural hazards and the plan is about four or five different places that that approach comes forward see the outcome yes correct yep Danny um so I think one of the really important things is that is room for local convenience like coffee shop da so I think that needs to be really clear and also they're part of the problem with our developments is that development happens but the conditions or things and the plans don't necessarily happen so we kind of we have these ideals and they look really good on paper but then in practice what happens is the things you know the houses get built but the other stuff doesn't or it gets changed too bassy undermine the original and teen so what have you gotten here because I really like this approach the risk I see is that you don't have enough Susan tea and therefore what looks like a great concept could be turned into a pretty bad concept because it's enabled to kind of develop without being totally true to them and 10 I mean each feature is going to be trialing and testing at the moment you know is this pregnant emblem within that it has this designated KAC and I think you know there is certainly commercial interest in bringing that forward turn to those sort of neighborhood level shops stores and parades of activities I suppose ultimately the market is going to decide whether those are viable enough to bring forward at any time you know provided the area has identified given the best opportunity to be marketed and made available for that and there may be controls that council might want to put into OD peas or other other development agreements then what makes those areas identity and character Eddas corner shops on corner sites you have shops that kind of express perhaps what I call button terms of the belt for like it seems to me that the nice where special consideration around corners I think this topic got raised when we're talking about the residential chapter and think correct and so I think you'll find in this zone and all the other residential zones is that provision for the corner when we've convenience retail or anything that's it's a corner site and it can be used for a range of activities those provisions would apply to this area as well exactly the same provisions would apply as well as the specific key activity center and potential for neighborhood commercial area so the other thing is that some touch on the fells point so it would appear and we don't know we're still doing work that the prac that the current thinking about stormwater effects has been kind of insufficient to deal with the volume of events that we've had so in terms of looking at the community of effects are there any tool new tools that we're putting in place to have a much broader understanding about you know if you Betty turn all the soil all the all the wetlands into concrete you know basically what that means further upstream and actually along the river like house is it anything additional and here than what than what we currently do that can give us confidence that those issues will have more weight I think for provisions but then there's also the process to get the rezoning in place and you'll understand even to get to the states as being significant geotech and also stormwater management areas assessment I think you'll have had either Graham or my clearly come and talk to you about the whole overall plan for stormwater management and the southwest area which has come out of the southwest area plan back in 2009 if my memory serves me right so you start off at that broad picture that you then move down to this outline development plan which is putting in place the main structure shown in the green sort of network as a mixture of recreation and stormwater and then you've got a dotted green lines going through you the centers which is showing putting on place here the detail of what the overall plan for the southwest area is and then when you get down to the individual start getting down into layers you can see again that blue network is continuing through here you can see that this development here the blue network is heading whole proposed neighborhood plan area and then when you get down to a final level of detail you can see on this plan here where you're looking at swales stormwater management through the whole development so it starts at the broad works all the way through to the fine detail and then ultimately into how streets are showing if I could just add to that councillors we've done three out of eight stormwater management plans for the city which essentially map out what we're going to do and what we need to do in those areas and the mirrors for discretion in the subdivision section direct us to look at those plans when we consider and consent could I just say I think this is stunning and this is exactly the sort of thing that we want to have happen you seem to have confined this to to new areas is it possible that it can spread hopefully support the point made is this is I think the direction for the way forward so any new plan changes that may that bring new bits of greenfield land expect this type of approach will be available we certainly looked at the potential for to apply to the existing livin g a a areas there's a mixture there some of them of the areas are so well consented that there's very little left to actually that we'd apply this to and sorry haven't got the report in front of me to go through that detail but so there were some areas where the development was too far forward or the developer had already committed substantially towards a particular development so it was very hard to introduce this change and in terms of the ones that are currently going through like our tier and those ones so there's potential you know the alligator I said hi field which have just sort of commenced then that's something we would look to perhaps work with the developers to see whether we can put this development into those areas we haven't_''_1805.76 pushed that at the stage again for that main reason we're very weary that development has significant investment in a particular type of development for the district plan to be seeking to impose a different approach on top of that in terms of the recovery phase of the city and in one of the earlier slides you talked about a sort of one-stop shop for the resource consent and they're planning approvals rather than a one-stop shop I think it's a sort of a single stage process however in working through this spray tan lodge meadowland scheme effectively there is a small project team that is working this through end to end so that you know there is consistency of advice right through it's actually one of the things in the housing board as well yes it's not that was some practice and Tim thank you we went on a bus trip away while ago with looking at some leg room right through and looked at the retention basins to the islands field etc and we looked at the site as well and it's just he's from sparks road between sparks road in the hill there it's just things we've got retention basins we've got stops because if you look at this picture the top right-hand corner the paddocks Thea they do to it I mean the whole place really does turn into like I'm just concerned that it seems we've got a plane to splats road and then there's nothing and we just can let it just get into the river somehow and the southwest area plan identifies you know that area is you know stormwater management and there is the wetlands there and various other bits and pieces some in terms of development potential I think yeah it's going to be if it's not going to be available in that sense is that what you're going oh it's one of the comments that was made the other night at their flood our meetings as concern about the management of the storm water and the new developments and upstream from the etiquette and logic tells you it must be some effect and so it would room we've got the retention basins etc we go right through Island fields got them we come here we've got so I think there has the concern yeah it's a shame Brian or grams not here to give you some more of the more of the detail but in general I think as part of that bus tour we indicated to you that council actually owns most of the land on this side of sparks road and that within the long-term plan there is funding available and programs in place which would coincide as this development occurs that then the development on the other side would occur so I think the first one just sitting in here there's a there's a storm water system here which is already in place so that's part of that moving across from the Aiden field through to the Hendersons Basin area here and you'll see any maps that are that we have in the district plan show that hold Henderson base and basically as a flood ponding flood retention area so that's what Andrew was saying is that those programs are all in place those plans of the year as one of the differences between the head Karev silt Ashok Creek so are there any filters or aslam so there are on those I can't agree probably missing from here just within the site there's petite and this is a difficulty that you can plan for stormwater retention but until you actually know what the development is within the area there may be ability within this development to manage stormwater quite well so that the need for to deal with it at the other side is taken away to some extent so in this corner here there is proposed to be quite a large storm water retention pond and here similar to the our tier situation but again that will be just refined as the development occurs and you can work out how much stormwater is able to be retained and dealt with on site it's probably probably just worth adding on that point that this site you know it was included in the southwest area plan yeah it's also including some retrofitting so it will deal with more than its own store realtor you know it's picking up perhaps some of the you know which alan delude tips oh yeah thank you I think this is stunning congratulations I think it's really really the sort of thing that we want to see for all sorts of reasons not just the look and feel of it but the fact that people sort of come first and actually addresses some of their housing issues as well okay so excellent awesome um so we leave it there yeah very fine bias the next thing we just lighten after lunch was just to take you through those intensification area around the suburban centers and we just gotta I think the vision statement no you're not from done you're not putting any of those there are you okay I look at the maps after lunch there are out if you want a little bit sorry over lunch they are these a for colored maps but John Skelton will take you through the details of things as long as you haven't done anything around riccarton know will we will confirm that we meet the intent of what the discussion was at the last workshop so Ellen are probably a rhetorical question but in your idea time estimate for this afternoon what we would know not really in his hands what have you got to what have you got it well maybe you're just tell me what you've got those residential areas which we've done and large from you haven't_''_2159.19 changed them dramatically you haven't sort of done anything horrible there's no nasty surprises there right okay we'll make sure that it yep and then what else have you got cheering yep so bits of definitions and the vision statement yes okay so relay are now for that yeah no we haven't done it then poor guys have got to come back yeah yeah okay so we'll get through easily I think 13 is that okay is that okay with you term for your meeting
Just briefly there's a memo that you should have as data the 20-26 of May and it's from myself and it's titled green building rules for buildings and commercial zones so again you don't read it no Matt mark will talk you through it madam chair you won't need to find it or read it again yep yeah by way of in conveying what's in the memo there's a number of options that have put forward in the memo to up the standard for greener buildings and sustainability and new buildings and commercial zones and industrial zones the memo presents options including requiring new buildings to be certified by external agencies which Auckland Council has put in their draft the second option is that we rather than requiring external certification we include standards and the district plan and the memo has some draft standards now the third option which I'm recommending is ends not set out and the memo reflects discussions that we've had with staff in the building control section of council but also stormwater staff and with the introduction also processing but also for us as staff and putting forward these standards essentially there's three issues with pursuing the set at the current time one it the first is that to put standards in the district plan requires that there's a process to check that those standards are being complied with and it would be the building control function of council that would need to check new building and Santa applications against these standards other councils around the country that introducing or have standards in their district plan have specialist teams set aside and they're building control function to assess applications and at the current time we don't have that specialist team so there's an extra resource required I related to that is the introduction of standards particularly for industrial zones would be introducing requirements not simply raising the bar from what's in the building code but introducing requirements that don't exist in the building code at the moment so flow rates are toilets and showers for example the the third point I want to make is for any standards to get supporting analysis that adequately assesses the benefits and costs of those standards and unlike the residential chapter we haven't had the time to get that evaluation completed of what the benefits and costs are and not necessarily in financial terms but we need to quantify what those benefits and costs are and without that analysis the standard simply wouldn't get through the process so as a way forward we can investigate and look at how those issues are addressed so we can have further discussions with the building control functional Council to ascertain the extra costs of setting up a team to assess proposals like this to assist applications against the standards and we can also look at greater analysis to enable these provisions to be tested and taken through the process without being stopped at the first hurdle because any decision maker on this district plan needs to be confident that staff have adequately assess these standards and alternatives to them to date we just haven't had the time to do that so we're about to put our district plan that will last for 10 for green buildings on residential sector but in terms of energy efficiency in the industrial and commercial sector we're not going to put it there I'm suggesting that we defer until phase two at the earliest not saying that we won't address it but essentially there's a need for more time to supporting analysis but also additional financial resource to support the build and control function of counsel I think mangi the residential approach we've put forward to you is quite straightforward it picks up on things that you have to do for a standard house and I think that's the difference between sort of the residential versus the commercial and industrial it went beyond what you have to do first so what I'm saying is we've focused on those things that you have to do for a building consent anyway but we've up to the standards and it√µs efficiency what we found with the commercial and the industrial there's no corresponding standard say like an insulation standard and the residential there's no chorus band corresponding standard in the nature of the wide range of commercial industrial buildings when you think about their function and industrial building that's a warehouse as opposed to a factory in terms of those commercial and industrial buildings a lot of the building consent stuff is very much more whether it's ventilation lighting or whatever is more focused around health and safety of the occupants of the building rather than any energy efficiency type approach to them so that's what we found is that we really would have to start from pretty much from scratch other councils with the New Zealand are trying to do exactly the same as where we're heading with the commercial and the industrial they've come up against the same sort of issue and as mark says to make it work for commercial and industrial you need a specialist team of technical experience and ventilation lighting all those sorts of things to actually assess whether something is going to meet those sustainability the outcomes here after so not as easy as we had thought Yanni did I see and hear that auckland have required the going for our process and hasn't_''_385.35 been to hearings they have proposed standards but they have talked into our building control officials they have a team set up to assess the buildin consent applications against it getting your standards correct so they've done a lot of work around us they would have done all the research so we can just we could look at what they've done I mean I I just think we need to put it in there I you know I hear what you say yeah but I think you know this Bishop oast earthquake the opportunity we have that we don't take it now will neither take it as a city and yeah there's a bit of a cost to doing it but it's actually I think an important cost that gives us a long-term benefit and end yeah I just think we should be doing it so you know doesn't my view and if we can learn from Auckland maybe they could offer some expertise that other councils we really good with the consenting crisis that we had now just in terms of the practicality of doing that and how would it be if we put it in this one with an intent to introduce it in a year's time or something or is there no capacity to do that sort of sort of thing in a district plan my suggestion to address the concern is that we include it in phase two which to be honest with you is months of way rather than years we're well advanced in terms of preparing phase two chapters so effectively that the time lag between phases 12 is not going to be years and years it's rather going to be a year my other suggestion and council Johansson is quite right we are watching what aucklanders doing and we're what we'd like to do is learn from where that process gets through the hearing process and what sort of challenge cancelled the Auckland City Council sorry auckland unitary gets to this approach because there's no point in us repeating the same mistake going down the same line if they even here into a roadblock to head down that direction again it's one of those we're not sure we've got the mechanism right and we certainly definitely haven't_''_521.979 got the supporting structure around it to make it work and I say that particularly the moment when the building consent team is under considerable pressure already and we need to be very wary of the district plan imposing additional costs or time on that process at the moment good he is that a whole lot of new buildings are being burnt and I don't want to get into the situation where you get like a hospital boiler emitting coal for the next 40 years because he can permits it and in terms of the new buildings that are going so we're building entire industrial park at Southwest I've quite like them to actually be energy efficient just a minute sensible for the landowner it's sensible for the building owner sensible for the tenant we know the payback period is quite brief we're in fact putting money into it through some of that group work that cafe was any other but you are saying that we haven't got sufficient robustness about our process yet to be able to potentially withstand any challenge so if we do it now our chances of getting it through and not as high as if we delay it realistically I'm happy to go with the delay even though I hate it and because it just seems so bloody obvious there but I appreciate that the process of a district plan review especially this one will not necessarily be obvious and logical so just what will we realistically have enough information within six months when we come back to do this to to be able to do that give it given a given what we've achieved in the first phase I'm confident with have sufficient supporting analysis to support these provisions I show that I should say I agree with what's being put forward and the concern is you raising it's just that as a professional I'd like to ensure have confidence that they'll survive the last day and that there won't be fryin out by the resourcing of a building consensus is there anyway and that we can offer incentives for example you get your building consent go immediately to the top of the pie if you're a sixth a green building is that is that completely the install world is it well it's slightly outside the district plan you know I appreciate ya and I think that raises the issue is that for some things a regulatory response actually might not quite be the right thing to do all the time it might be a right at a particular time and we're just saying at the moment we don't think the regulatory response is the right thing to do at this stage yeah and I think when we can bring it back to Madame chair it would be more in a sought for way in a comprehensive way which actually brings together the other work that council is doing through the non-regulatory our building except people and ourselves to actually show you how the whole thing would work as a package so it's understood and sensible and the chapters go through next time is it actually okay to put it again in the next round certainly there's aspects of the commercial chapter for example when you brush them which has been dealt with in phase 2 but the frustration I have is that we did all this work for the Central City plan we've done all this analysis it's been a huge amount of staff time looking at tools and methods to get green buildings and the study post-earthquake so I cannot understand why we don't have the the information I mean we we've done a huge amount of work so I'm council staff consultants um you know we spend 12 million dollars doing a central city plan they had a huge amount of analysis over different options in green buildings was one of the key things that we looked at so that the consumer here with putting stuff into Phase two we have no certainty about time frames for Phase two we have no certainty of process for Phase two we have no agreement with government over how we how that we defer now I think realistically we have to think you know the chance of it happening were from the next year is pretty remote it's as far as far as we're concerned whether we get the truncated process or not we are continuing on with chapters the second phase of the district plan review and if we don't get the truncated process then we all go down a schedule one straight RMA process so from our point of view so that would be this this time next year we'll so we're looking to do phase one a notification within the next month or so and then the next phase would be its crew so because through that timeline so this one comes into effect the end of this year so if decisions are made on this first phase then those will have effect and come into being at the end of this year and then the same would apply for the next phase do you give me the up next year yes we I think those processes those timelines are fairly certain I think central city plan there were provisions included based and there was work done to develop what's called a base tool which but the was there supporting an hour and that analysis required for the central city recovery plan it wasn't if you think of the bar being here for supporting analysis of the recovery plan and the under the ordering council or even under the RMA the bar is much higher and so we needed need to robustly assist the alternatives and costs and benefits of that which wasn't done as part of the central city plan of increasing the bass slightly at this stage and then a bit more in the second stage just a sort of incremental creep I'm learning from the malls in there in the current draft any developments over 250 square meters triggers the need for an urban design assessment as part of the assessment measures for that as well as in the policies there's consideration given to the extent to which sustainable outcomes are achieved through energy efficiency and so forth so that already does feature in the assessment would be directly reason so as part of the assessment broader assistant ok that's the but I would worry about the urban design component no I'm not worried about it that's the but I fear for in the district thing personally so I guess that's a call we have to make but I'm just wondering if there's some because personally I do fear for in the district plan not not because it shouldn't be there because it definitely should but just because of the process it will go through is there any of those things that we desperately want in included that could come into a process that isn't called urban design early an answer your question just throw it you poke at it I think it's something we need to consider I think regardless of where we start in terms of raising the bar will restore our the same level of analysis is required so where we raise the bar just a small amount used to only attend the support and costs benefit okay you remember with the residential we to tell you within 18 months that's paid off we can't do the same for this will you at all okay okay well I can live with one year yani can't what about the rest of you you're okay yeah you've relaxed not seeing intense body language so I'm assuming it's okay no no but not realistic perhaps resigned a result
I can't see how the way around it that's why I'm trying to get to you I'm really keen to get to the endpoint if it takes a year I suppose that's did you lose all the opportunity with the existing proposed region Islands happening in I know most of the major areas and we are yani yeah I'd say sk record and I don't know what's happening in Northlands pro possibly ferry made in terms of the repairs barrington ok well there's one happening other felt so is there any way in which we can capture the redevelopment of Barrington it's not major redevelopment of recca tennis just continued north a mess of message block yeah you're under further out walls for um not not meet our needs ya can't just assure you that we are working very closely with a lot of the mall owners at the moment northlands is one example where they are president extension and we are working with them in still under negotiation but it looks at the stage one there might already worked with a MP who was working on the North website and the new development they head across the road which hasn't yet built its own the stock center and that we have got 4,000 square metres set aside for public transport on that site so that so once that's built that will be for a bus interchange in Belfast and we are continuing to have discussions with that wall roughly as you know with the but then change there so we are and background still having discussions some to change at belfast's we will have to pay for it but it's the point that these guys get huge leap from rezoning they get huge profits they buy up cheap land turn it into commercial make Achilles and then we have to pay for the infrastructure to deal with the the benefit that I've got doesn't seem right yeah yeah they will pay MDC's so let that I think the figures unfortunately the way to DC Paul is as weird and that's come from from legislation as it's Johnny's and more tighter at the moment only about three percent of the cost is collected by from DC's because of how tight the legislation is so yes paired with DC's it doesn't pay for what cost by any means sure l know I'm not might convict you on that one but I but we take it offline yeah yeah sure sure yeah it's fine we have already got this is medicine and transfer assessments a rule that would tell us with you yesterday and so that will be in place in phase one and so if developments come under Phase one we can still assists and and through conditions we can put requirements on a little bit asthma case basis until we have the planning that will come and phase 2 in terms of exactly where we want it to be okay and this is a weird question but if you guys were the advocates for public transport and active transport what would you do in the district plan that isn't currently there I think that the certainty is there's what we would's the outline development plan or the designation process but I think that's the key to making these things work is giving people a certainty as to where they go so that these are the mechanisms and methods with us integrated traffic assessment or whatever can actually focus in on where we're hearing without that it's a little bit unclear okay thank you so any more questions comments yani until contributions why won't_''_289.81 that work what we're recommending is that we look at financial contributions and phase two and why can't we do it now but it sounds pretty straightforward we can collect to mitigate the adverse effects we can collect a financial contribution financial contributions require further analysis to calculate how much just is required but in the absence of outline development plans issue is that you don't know we need to spend that financial contribution and if we have both the planning aspect the ODP as well as the financial side through the financial contributions then they can work well together if you're missing one of those then it's this is why we can't do the planning now as it as you probably can are reviewing all the bus routes at the moment so it would be pointless to say there's a be relevant changes to be when the bus routes could change in a few months time so we need to wait until that process you go through before we can identify whether to changes are so it's the
Yeah I just don't think the current approaches working so we need to do more and there's a gate there's a huge game that these people make through the rezoning of you know residential and the benefit they gear from having these massive developments they need to be giving something back so I I just feel really strongly that an ODP won't work because as we've seen you just apply for a consent and what the issue we've got in the cities were allowing far too much development without any requirement to deal with the associated costs to the environment to the traffic infrastructure or to the community infrastructure so we need to have a mechanism that actually gives us something that I was interested in your designation process you see the crown have done that through the central city they don't have money for half of it they've just come in and designated up and people will have to comply and you know so using that process could we do that as part of the integrated traffic assessment for these developments if they want to develop its site provide those facilities yeah that's Tiffany an option that would provide the site but not necessarily the funding to it and that's the issue with that option if we get alone and there should be reckoned as yes this field of the owner a large amount of direction commercial center but the only I only own one side of the road the south side a rough road you've also got the commission development on the north side or open road where a is and kept men do one more center you've got a whole one another landowners in their area we should provide a great facility on risk fields land that hold all the other end owners are going to benefit from that as well and so there is a missed field will say well done fear that we all the cost of providing a public transport interchange is formed by us when all these other businesses are benefiting from the fact that people who now catch a bus more easily to Riften so it's about find a a post on one of the more wasn't there and you just said the normal shops that you currently have surely the bus infrastructure would be you know sufficient I mean the reason you need to provide an integrated transport places because of the demand that the mall has created to go into that area so you know I I can't imagine that you'd want to have a really big bus terminal if you just had the existing old but this is done reckon really because of the way it's you know because basically you've got the consolidation if you like of retail into a very confined space with and rekelen as opposed to a whole way along the length of the road the mall is a big generator of demand but it but it's not a hand present generator the demand is and and and so it's the mall should obviously contribute that's fear sheer but it wheat aren't expected to contribute hundred something that's effect it has it doesn't and and doesn't contribute any so we who actually don't get the same degree of benefit as the mall do and it doesn't matter whether it's written on Ottomans or palms or don't any any major shopping center here we shouldn't just to finish that train of thought I wasn't aware that if we designate we have to provide the funding I thought if we designate on a site their option is for the developer to actually provide that they can do something cool but if you think what we've been told with the central city by the forsyth barr building that's you know designated but they can only do they cannot do activities and consistent with the ministers designation so so yeah just talk me through why they how that could happen here yeah so the same issues hit him in several cities with zero designated a whole other sites but then they've had to go and buy those properties so it's been a cost of government and and Sarah and obviously through the cost sharing agreement and we're contributing to some of the cost in all the convention site for example all been sold to Sarah and it's Sarah the government and of the US contributing that is funding that rather than the landowner used to own that land contributing to the cost well what we've been told us if you have a designation on your site you have to get consent from the minister to do anything on that side read the script and that it doesn't mean that you if you do an activity that's consistent with the designation then that's fine we that's what I don't understand sort of such as so there's two things to designate you have to be financially responsibility for the have financial responsibility for the work so for example public transport your you are responsible providing the physical place for the buses to stop he can has a role as well in terms of the network and so on so you have you you can designate there's no difficulty about that when you designate a piece of land you're quite correct is that the designation means designation and they certainly can't do anything unless they have your approval to do it the third thing with designations is that when you designate you are in some respects removing the development rights from that person who owns the land and there is an immediately a compensation or purchase requirement comes along with that designation so that's how designations work to the point where there is no way through the district plan that we can actually get to the point of having rid of insisting on really good public transport landings and key activity centers accept a new ones which is probably limited to one yeah the the issue of trying to retrospect merely put thing in two places is difficult what we're suggesting to you is that there's we're not disagreeing with the where you want to get to us how you get to it in the best way and we're saying two ways to give some certainty either the designation which tells exact people exactly where you're going and it actually puts a cost on to counsel to do something which again tells everybody exactly where the facility is going to go and then that allows those other mechanisms with their financial contributions or development contributions to come in what we're saying is at the moment without us having a plan inserted into the district plan that says this is where it's going this is how we're going to do it to rely on someone coming with a resource consent just because they've got X amount of floor space is not going to get us to where we want to get to him so that's the num of it okay thanks Paul I'm sorry and then Janine you it this seems to be though to me we're talking key activity centers and actually where these commercial businesses leather set up and I'll just use the example of the central city since we the rules around what has to happen essentially a very inconsistent with what happens in suburban key activity centers when we comes to parking access and all those variations that they are and seem to be allowed to do anything always been to the detriment of the central city so two and a half thousand car parks and Westfield there is no restriction of roads getting to them to those car parks and yet in the central city will we're making it hard for cars to get in hard to park and I would like to see a one rule apply so when you are making and creating restrictions for these key activity centers that they are applied in the same manner right across the city so one has not been given benefit over the other and I wondering how we can achieve that because I I remember a few years ago talking about the one rule applies and I use a scenario where what the council was trying to do at that stage was radically reduce in a city parking and I asked him at that point have you approached the suburban centers and asked him to reduce the epochal I and move the other third one block weight and the comment Lynn was yes we have and I said how do they go out panel Lewis so to that because we can't afford to destroy one over the I think they are all of relevant and portents thank you noted just he is noted and that we really need to if we're going to take this approach for one suburban center we're we're looking for a comprehensive approach to public transport and public space and these areas then you're quite correct that we should be looking at them as in a hole I suppose it's because I mean we do want to keep people safe as and my my personal view is it's far more dangerous driving down Main North rated Northlands or two down represent ride to Westfield as a pedestrian I would hate to try and cross those funds and so it would be good to try and improve the amenity and of course that would bring into line what yeah nice walk about this infrastructure around the public transport and I do think that these large centers have a massive responsibility they are the creator of this traffic problem because the fact that it's easy to they do need to give back and we know that they are all looking and making provision to expand in a much larger way than they carry me at the moment so with that and mind they haven't finished expanding and we have an opportunity to take one step to make them provide for this public transport so we can actually look at reducing the apartments that's spawned a bit through bit yeah that's our the innovative transfer assistance that with discussions today where we are ensuring that the new developments they will look at all modes not just traffic which was what we the previous city plan just focused on they look at public transport and cycling and walking so we will ensure that through new developments there'll be much more consideration made to these issues I think the issue that you may be trying to suggest is that the the previous developments going on it sure it should have paid more consideration to those modes and I totally agree the issue is that as in the past that we can't_''_667.97 be retrospective that to be able to say you should define the things definitely all we can look at now is look at the future growth that they're doing and how much that will impact on public transport and walking cycling and and how much and we can get development contributions as mark suggested from that future growth we turn unfortunately British people they do anything with with the existing situation and that's just it is just the accumulative yeah you say and what we want is a requirement that kick them if that for any a certain scale that's causing us problems and they're going to get bigger then there needs to be a trigger that they have to provide you know X amount of space for public transport group and that's exactly what we're saying is the the larger developments you'll have the integrated transport assessment and if we have in our plan where these facilities are to go then we can actually as part of the integrated transport assessments say and how are you providing for the public transport it's meant to your development link into that so the two things have got to go together what we're saying it's very hard to have these things when you don't know where the facility is going to go but we do know if we know that I dunno that's fine if we know that riccarton for example is likely to expand down Clarence Street can we insist that they provide some decent public transport infrastructure near to them all for public use to to do so would require provisions in the district plan to take financial contributions to offs but those financial contributions and the rules to take that land or money needs to be attributed to directly to the impacts of that development yeah yeah so you can only take it for the incremental impact not for the retrospective break that's right I see the problem okay so me okay thank you I'm just interested in hearing about a bit more help this comedian retrospectively and like the area the outline development piano is the case in point though it is the Barrington mall Edith Wilson of the car pack which is really nice and the more cars were wanted by the mall and so the buses are excluded it's account so Evan defined bus except it small exchange or hub outside and that is its number be problems too but the the I just think it's and it's unfortunate that for example when the community board asked the mall owners about even a little piece of lean for the bus to come and there was sadly they were laughed it and I just think into how we can require mall owners to actually play their part rather than just rely on the dominance of the automobile thinking it you know that's the only way s that he can function and so it just seemed to me that you have referred to a way that perhaps the outline development plans could be applied to existing centers I just want to hear that could and maybe especially but also though in conjunction with the public where it's a great hmm and that's what marks options say is there's you can end result relying on one it's not going to get you to you so we can we can ask for all those things to be go into the into the plane that's what we would come back to you with a yes yeah I think we'd take a lot of sorts strongly support yeah I think we caught in terms you know what we'd do is an undertaking to see whether we could bring back to you as part of phase two the outline development plans for the suburban for the center's showing where the public transport and I understand you know you obviously got very clear ideas for some of the center's we're that's to go so that might be quite an easy task for some great yes the problem is if we wait to face to these places will expand in the meantime and we have no we've lost the opportunity they only expand once every what 5-10 years Paul you would know seven years run up so you know we kind of get one chance to do it so I just I still cannot understand why we can't require and the government's changing the rules around DC's as I understand it they are and I don't know when that changes coming on this well they call development agreements so I'm really interested because I think that's a group fundamentally it's quite a good approach that you have a individual negotiation with the developer over well if you want to develop here's the contribution and so if we had something in a district plan that seed as part of the development agreement there as a minimum must be expert you know for developments over this sighs there must be X amount of space put aside for public transport as part of that development agreement that would be something I would see has been really important but I don't know when that law changes coming in and I don't know how much thinking we've done around what does that mean in terms of just a plant there may be a mechanism around the amount of car parking they have it should be an amount put aside for going towards public transport so if they got two and a half thousand car packs the cost of those two and a half thousand car parks that could be set aside into a funding model I'm just thinking we've ever laterally here yep and I'm assuming that you can't_''_1015.089 do that retrospectively so you could only do it for the new develop new developments so as anything expanded if they were required to provide additional car packs then we could put not only a car pack but a bus sit down group minimum and I'm assuming we do that with some we must do that with a tourist accommodation and things do we we've got loading special requirements yeah which-which you can even trinket for hotels and things but that's really for buses that are coming just to that site what really talking about as buses opposite for a referent for example during a long rough road and not necessarily coming onto the land but you could actually bellatrix so you put aside like it that we know that the people who get off there we know the percentage who are going to shop the rocket and more and that's very high yeah but mainly because they've done that work for that bus exchange stuff so we do know that people coming getting off there are actually shopping in their facilities yeah we could put something in the district plan the young I think my reputation would be put it as an assistant matter rather than a particular rule the addition of the role is that you can say say to the landowner you need to provide X amount of space and they say oh that's fine well we've got some dead space around the back here the huge area and it's not functional where the novel trans- week so it would have to work very closely with them too so what's your recommendation of the best way of achieving what we clearly want to achieve either at barrington or wherever could I can't I can't believe that buses go ahead to make way for cars like trying to get to this place would update with the central city buses do give the cows do get away for the buses the buses their priority but it seems the complete reverse in the suburbs tho out from the staff point of view ng a recommendation would be that this is something we bring back to you definitely in phase 2 which would be outlined development plans for each of the areas there would be assessment matters within the integrated assessment provision so that would capture your bigger developments we can capture those and in the third part of that is we've just talked about as the financial contributions which match up with the development contributions issue and that really needs to come as a package to unique and beliefs in terms of the next year the only one that's going to be impacted in big tunes is the Meadowlands one which looks like it's sort of developed this very well anyway yes so so the new one for the new halls will area little lanes that's we've got that let's stuff
We were to make some of the roadside parking that's currently sit aside for cars available only for bikes what would happen in ya the vetch also an option obviously that's not something we can put in the district plan because it's about how we manage our own road network and there's obviously gonna cost to that as well in terms of very performing our pattern spaces but that is also an option that's what we do in the central city we've got a number of areas where we have got soccer pattern and so that's something to consider if there is a shortfall and visit Osaka packing because of this situation obviously one option is to try and explore taking financial contributions from the the landowners but then we may also have to as a council a beast and some cycle parking to address the shortfall just in terms of how we do it I'm assuming then we could just do it we don't need any changes than the district plan it's just we decide that we would like it but there is process for the local government act through consultation on visitor to change partners places and but that's what I'm just thinking in terms of if we want this to be a backup or city we actually need to provide kind of the visual cues that that is the case as well and kind of interrupting the flow of cars with bikes might be quite a nice visual means of communicating change of strategy group perhaps anyway okay is there any more questions guys before we come to some of the points can I just get an indication and I'm getting the stinks J me that people are happy with but I may be completely wrong so I'm going to ask so you have a spice if you are sorry see if its ways of you are okay so you're cool with it I I think the one outstanding matter madam chair we will do is make sure that in the assessment of the cycle parking provision we make very clear that there are you need to look at sort of the for that cafe situation so we're making very clear that the cycle parking is not a dominant thing that's something to be thought about in the overall assessment so we'll just double check our assessment criteria to make sure we've got something clear and therefore you thinking energy the second issue is to come back to that an issue that thinking thank you thank you the second issue to come back to that is a previous workshop there's been discussion about the impacts of large developments in commercial centers on community infrastructure so public transport as well as community facilities and you would have received a memo in the package that came to you a day or two ago stifled options for managing the effects of developments on community infrastructure I just wait so madam ji that's a memo like this looks like the other memos it's got a date of 26 May yep got a few it's all right all right I just thought we might have had some speed vines around 26 of May it's from mark to the on community infrastructure and in the amar could sit out I think seven different options as to how we might achieve what was being talked about in terms of getting public open space or public transport facilities within large centers riccarton north from all five examples yeah they prefer the recommendation and the memos to is twofold the first issue of type of acquiring land or financial contribution or financial payments towards public transport over community facilities the recommendation is that development contributions are used so money would be identified in the LT long-term plan for a library or a public transport interchange and then development within that Center is charged development contributions towards that but in a just the second part of the recommendation is to ensure that we've got an outline Devon development plan for each commercial center to guide how it develops and to ensure integration between different activities and the reason for circulating this plan to you is that the issue arises in requiring developers to produce an outline development plan just taking the plan landowner for on the map just point into the screen landowner for came in with a proposal which is sizeable in the context of the commercial center so rather crudely in this context the whole commercial zone is bordered by this black line landowner fall comes in with their proposal to add a new building to their site a trigger could require resource consents by way of them minimum floor that proposal exceeding a minimum floor area or exceeding a percentage of the zone area but what we're interested in to ensure that this development all of the commercial center develops in the comprehensive and integrated way is an outline development plan really should be for the whole of the center rather than just land land owner falls site which is that square there and in order to achieve that the resource consent process could couldn't necessitate and out my development plan accompanies that application but they may it may not necessarily lead to a collab collaborative approach so we may we may request that landowner for obtains the rest of approval of landowner one two three and five the other for landowners within the commercial center if to for instance disagrees with the outline development plan that landowner for is produced then you'll eat your end up and the stalemate now council could because of that written approval not being forthcoming notify their application to land owner for but at the end of the process a decision will be made by counsel and that decision may not be what lanterna fall wants because the decisions gone in favor of landowner five so you could end up with an outline development plan coming through a resource consent process that can actually be achieved because you haven't got buy-in from all the landowners the other issue in requiring an outline development plan as a rule in the district plan is that if we prescribe there any developments of more than ten percent of the zone or over four thousand square meters should provide an outline development plan at this multiple landowners within that zone you potentially end up with a number of different outline development plans if there's multiple developments proposed the issue then arises of achieving one of them is is problematic if you've's it's recommended that council takes takes more of a leader in terms of planning of the commercial area to guide development and achieve a more collaborative process to implementation of that outline development plan so rather than putting it on the developer to produce the ODP Council in fact takes the lead but ensures that there's buying from all the parties and that Center so just to be clear the concepts the difficulty that was outlined was something like the redevelopment of halls wall or with Cindy and riccarton probably at the University where there is insufficient provision for public transport sit down safely so even if we build the bus stops around it there is there isn't a sort of safe place for the buses to park horse was quite a good example and but this seems incredibly complex because most of these are actually key key activity centers or developments that are generally in Christchurch controlled by one group or a large new industrial subdivisions or whatever usually worth 1 overall developer and I guess what I took from what we were wanting was beginning stage just the recognition of the need for good public transport provision just in the same way as we require a pseudonym or we don't require but we stipulate a certain number of car packs depending yeah I think Madame cheerio you quite Creek the halls for example which is a new Lee activity center we can plan exactly what what we're seeking to do it's planned it's in the outline development plan and that's clear with sean where the public transport facility is we've shown where the public civic square is going to be that's good because we're not the ground floor and as you say there's one person who owns all the land and let's put into the district plan what Marx described to you in this diagram is more the Riccarton or Northlands more situation where you do have a number of landowners and we're saying the resource consent is not a good way to get you to where you want to go because at the moment we're not no one said we're don't know if it's on land owner one two three four or five s bit of land and rely on one developer to do a development which may not even apply where you want to provide the facility it's not going to get you the of what we're saying is you actually need to have a plan in the plan versus this is where we're going to put these facilities so that when the resource consents come in there's actually something that they have to comply with beer it's where they are managed by one manager and every time they expand there is an incremental growth in desire to go there which is their point but what's happening is that the public are picking up the cost for the public transport infrastructure the area what I'm keen is that they pick up at least the land costs for that so if they expand they must provide for the public transport desire to go to that place just as they have to provide for the car parking desire to go to that that I mean given that they're managed by and I would have thought most of it owned by one outfit taking a record in there's an example or any Center that's built up there's a need to ensure there's a plan of where these facilities a public transport facility is going to be and we count or where council wants it to be and an outline development plan can assists an outline development plan can assist in guiding the future development of that Center and that the risk of Santa Wis field let's say we want a part of your land to be developed for a public transport facility and you need to provide that land as part of an application is that may not add that may not achieve an integrated approach with the development around that's owned by other property owners and you want to achieve accessibility to central facility that's served by a number of different paths through a center and in terms of identifying the location an outline development plan can assist and achieving that in terms of the public transport facility is so there's really two options of three options and the memo is taking development contributions which would require a revisiting of councils policy so council identifies in its long-term plan the need for a public transport facility and development contributions are taken towards that the second option is financial contributions which where the effects of particular developments including individual or combined effects with existing development reach the point where council and it believes that that development without a public transport facility is going to have an adverse impact so we can potentially require money or land to offset that impact and that's through the district plan or the third option is to have a specific rate rating of businesses or a wider area to require money towards that facility so the district plan does have a role on in one of one of those three options the second one which is to take financial contributions which could be in Land or could be in money to offset the impacts of a development
Good afternoon morning sorry open up early we'll get underway and I'm going to be here to cheer the draft strategic directions chapter work but that papers still due to arrive and Becky bucks going to take over for me as I have some other matters to attend to so if if we can begin what the reversion of the draft residential chapter well perhaps thank you madam ear perhaps if I just quickly run through the order with you that might help yep and so today's workshop is and there's a bit of a rats and mice 1 plus a substantial bit about the new neighborhood provisions in the residential zone but a lot of it is just bringing matters back to you that you've sought some direction or clarification on so we'll would try and was through those quite a few papers and things to be tabled all you should have in front of you the vision statement as you've just said is coming we've got some residential some revisions there will be talking to you about the new neighborhood plus you've also got the 16 32 so those would be already on your desk there's two matters and commercial to speak to one is about the managing of effects of development and the commercial areas and the one is the green building rule would also overlap since the industrial as well and then the definitions so what I thought we might do with your leave is to start off with the industrial and commercial because they're quite should be quite short I mean get rid of those quickly and then as soon as the vision statement arrives we can look at that the residential will take a little bit more so if you're happy with that approach madam chair will run with that so what what in terms of the strategic directions you may infect it be do you think at the vision statement yes do you think it might be better if I simply come back at that time so that might be better for you for ease of that'll be fine it's just if you're still here when it arrives that I mean none of us will have read it okay that'd be fine I'm in here so so maybe that's probably the best waiter to proceed and then that won't disrupt the flow cool think thank you very much the first two items are industrial and commercial and I'll hand over to mark stevenson to take you through those two things just make sure right I'll start with commercial and one of the issues relates to the relationship between the transport chapters and the commercial chapters one of the issues raised in a previous workshop on the transport chapter was the location of cycle parking for visitors as well as staff picky okay sorry guys no I gosh were talking about him I gotta get back max is going to talk you through some things you asked us to come back in terms of the commercial and the industrial chapters thank you to starting with an issue that relates to both the transport chapters and the commercial chapter and was raised in the context of a workshop on the transport chapter and that and in the drafts that you've received the commercial chapter requires that new buildings shops for instance that built up to the road fronts to encourage activity between the footpath and the private space and the transport chapter draft that you've seen required on those sites that shops are proposed a requirement for cycle parking for visitors and staff now that the difficulty would pass it is if cycle parking is provided it would be to the rear of a building and on a large block that's long and in terms of distance if visitors cycle parking is to the rear of a shop and someone has to walk around the whole block to get into the shop if there's no rear entrance it it's not attractive to park someone spiked in that location and arguably you park your bike on the street on the footpath and given the importance of urban design and the key theme that's coming from the commercial chapter to require build up to the road France and in discussions David fault nor a draft transport chapter leader we've removed we're building is up to the road front but source but still require that this cycle parking to the rear for staff so we're promoting requiring parking of bikes for staff to the rear and in those commercial areas we can explore options in the future as part of phase 2 2 for example taking contributions towards the provision of cycle parking on the footpath Rick I'm happy to be interrupted and yeah it does apply to apply to any buildings on on what we call key pedestrian frontages so in the core of a in the core area of the commercial zone of record on any buildings required to be built up the road from yeah there's a if we provided for that that there is risks associated with such an approach for instance if the what started as a cafe changed hands and it became a dairy you end up with a building setback which has dead space effectively because they're not able to utilize that space in the front of that shop and the retail sector that there can be quite the additional building that has to fill that space now that the reason we require buildings up to the road front is to encourage greater interaction between the street and maps shop space and potentially you can have cafes with open french doors which still achieves the outdoor flow but Hugh Nicholson a principal advisor and urban design tink and it's probably better place to comment on there because I know it seems you're on the face of it there's a there's a conflict but actually in the in the central city now works reasonably well so a long victoria street for example we have people who little quired to build to the street edge and we people come in and apply we've had a couple of applications for people who want to have a space and outdoor space for you know for cafes on the ground floor so they've got an office building it might be five or six stories of office then they want you know what was obviously going to be hospitality on the ground floor and as part of the we permitted it but but they have to they can't they can't simply set it back as of right they have to show what what sort of structure they'll be putting you know one of them's got a structure over the top of this this little burglar over the top of the outdoor dining but I think it's a relatively you know sensible way of dealing with it lets us talk to them about you know how they it relates to the street it's the the bearing in mind that there's a consent requirement to assist the design of new developments over 250 square metres and in a larger in large commercial in the majority of the commercial zones as restricted discretionary but in addition to that we've got a clause that doesn't that requires that that application is not publicly notified or limited notified because really it's assessing the design and to notify that to the wider public you potentially end up with additional costs and so by removing that consenting notification requirement you reducing the cost potential costs're required to process those non notified applications within 20 working days and it's not the costs of hearing and the experts to attend the hearing as well as process in terms of timeline so it's a lot shorter time frame so that can significantly reduce this thanos for Fears is in tues the frontages of buildings what just what you described in relation to bicycle parking it doesn't seem to me to cut the mustard all in terms of our city being a cycle friendly city and people being able to pad near bikes you know adjacent to buildings in a sensible place not that if yeah and like we here we have strong and conditions for consent for car parking what why aren't we doing applying the same kind of principle to bicycle parking where we're still promoting cycle parking but there's other options to address that demand for instance taking one option we can explorers taking financial contributions which council can then spend on the public on the paper paper paved area outside the store which could include cycle stands and have a communal Kim arguably you could have a communal series of spaces that is better utilized by a range of shops rather than each individual shop being required to as it would work you don't need one outside every shop of course major major shops I think there should be space for cycle stands preferably covered but um so are you suggesting that the same way that main way council could achieve that is through the financial contributions that that's one of the options that can be explored in principle I mean staff have to they have to provide staff bicycle packs everybody does so that's you know you know bottom line Italy just talking about the kind of the extra ones at the front it's right of the all a lot of the larger stores so when we see supermarkets and things so and I don't expect those will be built across a full street frontage you know they're likely to have car packs we were still like they'd have car packs and cycle packs you know associated with their car don't think it's quite as simple as we expect that nobody will be providing it I think most of the major stores will still need to provide cycle backing for visitors in a relatively visible area so that will be like a requirement just as part of the package I think there's three three things that sort of brings it to the conversation to a bit of a conclusion is that in terms of the say for example the Signum type parts of the city where people are seeking to redevelop and you have got those small shops then this rule doesn't work for those small shops secondly again signum and other areas of headmaster plans done for them and as part of that master plan work some of the ideas about what you actually do on the street in terms of making them more pedestrian and cycle friendly and putting in facilities for those miracles thirdly you've had David Falcon are talking to you about the integrated transport assessments so for those bigger developments that's where you can get definitely those cycle parkings three sort of key ideas coming forward and on the last point we do have a matter of discretion in the commercial chapter to consider the cycle parking provision and was like ensuring its integrated within a within a larger development certainly just go back to councillor Goff's question of comments there's a number of benefits that are achieved through build up to the road fronts who's better qualified to comment omnis than I but walking down London Street and synonym for instance pre-earthquake you had a sense of enclosure and a continuity of a street front which if it's broke if it's broken with building set back then you tend to lose that feeling that you as you walk down the street of activity and there's also benefits of natural surveillance from a shop on to the street but also buildings that get set back you tend to see car parking on the front so for instance there's a restaurant on st. a substrate which has got a car park at the front and its wealth set back and you tend to to walk through a car park which has issues of safety that is one option but um there's there's wider benefits obviously of having built up to the RO film and that was because they cafe that he's talking about which was the stray dog was actually a warehouse or something quite different on men on there were setbacks on Manchester Street I don't know whether you a call before the an earthquake sir buildings had to be actually had to be set back by a couple of meters and we ended up with with areas almost no no men's no persons land you know we're really the shopkeepers weren't very interested in it just kept people away from their windows and the yeah anyway Jeremy will have that debate in the women I just want to get through the questions first Andrew um yes so talking about um sydenham colombo street in sydenham london street in littleton would be another very similar example crypt where we've got a desire expressed from the community in the littleton master plan and from memory plan that they wanted a traditional streetscape with buildings built up to the to the pavement edge it's expressed in the the district plan review is sixty percent class at ground floor level down at her to have even so much as one building stepped back from the street would then alter that streetscape and certainly in littleton there's a requirement for ave around or over the pavement as well well that doesn't work with a step back building but there is an issue with where the cycle parking would go in those situations because with the building built right up to the street front there isn't space on the private land up front unless you are going to put it on pavements and of course a lot of businesses solution to this has to been to to lease land from the council and put tables and chairs on the pavement which has worked quite well so that actually addresses Jamie's point quite nicely with that leasing arrangement without the need for a building setback but the rear of the building how would you imagine the rear of some of these small shops isn't a particularly public friendly place even for staff to be parking their bikes around there there may be issues of safety with staff leaving late at night and that sort of thing and it is this something that you're and I may have missed the beginning of the conversation because I arrived late and I'm sorry for that but is that something where you would consider waiving the requirement for parking completely or would you require parking at the rear of the building however impractical that might be they proposed what's been put forward is to remove requirement the visitor parking on a site where the buildings up to the road front and staff cycle parkings to the rear but through the design which is subject to an assessment as part of a resource consent we can consider how that rare and environments the rare of a shopper's treaters because I think counselor again using your little to an example there are reused we r rear of shops where access is very limited and that's and open those areas up to four access ways and behind so those are the sort of things you'd consider in an application to say we physically can't provide it because we can't get access to the back of the building there was an example where a landowner wanted to build his building back for a tenant of these two have cafe seating at the front but the requirement from building them building back meant they had to put the cycle parking in the front this is where they wanted to actually have their cafe so it seems to be a bit of an issue in conflict that's what Jamie's actually asking and the parking requirement how do we overcome their to Azura a way we can get around it in the in the central city plan you're right that there's a requirement if a building set back then cycle parking requirement is there and there's something I need to raise is if we remove a cycle parking requirement where our buildings up to the road front then if it's set'm we're proposing that there is like the central city of requirement for cycle parking if they don't comply with this build up to the road front and that setback that they proposed subject to meeting design but there's literally against this whole actor from the site and cocaine right at the front of a building it's going to really interfere with a visual aspect of the background floor it's also going to fear with it to interaction on the space it seems to me yeah conflict and what we're trying to actually achieve great so having to do with a scale of the space I mean if you could imagine as a building set quite a long way back and with with an area of car parking perhaps you know in front of it that actually there you know you that's quite appropriate for cycle parking if you're trying to achieve a little sort of a narrow hospitality space than perhaps that's not appropriate I agree and really the only way to manage that as as we've talked about or not it's difficult for us to write rules for those sorts of exceptions the exceptions are better handled through that restrictor discretionary non notified no written approvals is purely a matter that allows the council to say okay this is a situation you've got what's the best solution is it better to have no cycle parking because it does exactly as you've talked about councillor ruins the whole frontage and that's really the way to manage we're suggesting is the way to manage that situation
You enjoy your coffee okay well are there any other thank you for responding to their and the other issues cast on that subject though it would like some direction as to whether or not you're comfortable with what's recommended and in the sheet there is always the potential I get the I guess the issue here is going back to the sea job comments the cross government comments and that we will continue to get and potentially in the statement of expectations is the cost unnecessary cost of development well I don't know that it's as specific as that but but it is it is so I'm putting it back to the people that are still here to give us some direction on this because you've understood from David what the potential costs will be okay so I and I guess Leanne seemed to take a view before just I like something along the lines and in fact we we strengthen that we take out the recommender but we just say that there will be even though we know that in fact there was sort of alluding to no it wasn't what would she give it I can come well well that's the words it is recommended below maybe then recommendation is a compromise so we have that that end though okay well that's what the recommendation is that was involved there yep recommendations that we have recommended David's nice if there could be thousands one of the things we could could potentially do mr. cheers to part of the assessment criteria we could refer to the standards themselves for parking cause arose guidance on parking spaces and that has the reference in there about blue being used as recommended that blue being used so it's not a rule as such but it's an assessment criteria so that that would provide some direction to people who are looking to put these in but it wouldn't be an absolute rule so you'd avoid the unnecessary consent activity and pizza costs but they would certainly be encouragement for people to do that and it'll be one of the things that the council could assist an application see you snitch now get into it we could edit with your editors part of the transfer assessment so it's those only one of those large activities and we can assist it there's no additional content and so it was requiring a concern but realistically who's going to raise a resource consent so that they can avoid painting a car park no that's what we're saying it will only catch those instances where a resource consent is necessary and and it's particularly on the larger the integrated transport assessment projects oh no he says and we can come to the University parking rates there's no changes just 110 meter on between yep it was a question about nonslip surface and with a wish every definition for that we've had a look at the requirement further since yesterday this was introduced through the life map standards and the LifeLock standards only require us to show you that it can be adapted for nonstop service I've got some requirements attached what shows is a table page and a half of on page 22 so it would be quite easy for someone to comply with that breeches they can say that old they'll put that in place when the need arises so we're looking at removing that from the transfer chapter and all be covered by the life map standards in the residential chapter so yes yes we know we could worsen I see was the two yep yep though those pages that David refer to were in the bundle that you would just give them yep okay read that once what I'm in so university parking rates yes you're suggesting no change and thank you for the information on that yep um no yeah so what I was asked this provides more information as to why we propose the rates that we propose so um the pages of the back started with Canterbury University pack of requirements outlines some of the reason why we're just in the rights we are one of the reasons is that over recent is canterbury university is actually the number of people drive into the other number of students driving to the university and catching public transport so the pattern plants yeah so the last one was done a survey but we've also got census data since then and the census data in 2013 shows and increase in cycling as well so it's but likely this trend has continued and in christchurch is it there's actually been a slight increase in values but there's been that that's more posters quite rather than a long-term trend climate this is a very big issue for all of the residents around the university because it's like memorial it's just absolutely chocolate with cars so they feel very strongly about this but then what you do is when you go on to some of the sites and on campus for example and I haven't checked at this year on dovetail campus apnea dove down solway pack stone corner there is a car park there but with no means at all for anyone to be able to pay the car packing church which is just stupid and so what would be really sensible it's a very large car park they tell you that you're supposed to walk to the cafe which is some hundred meters away get your car back and coupon walk back to the car pack put it on your cat before you go and have your coffee which is a really novel way of enforcing parking this for visitors Vicky is presumably students have their all the fees are here for no students don't always buy their 230 dollar or 345 dollar fee that they're required it's a dollar a day of work get all these great yeah but their natural inclination because they're supposed about at the time they're paying their fees is not pay it because it comes as a bulk so the idea of you know a dollar a day or two dollars a day would be much more useful at some of those sites on canterbury but they don't have any provision for it so what I'm what I mentioned is today and and this is sort of container and then the second page which shows the patterns of packing charges at the University the university from charging for parking that's the economic right to to make money off the land so and the same accusing the airport net swipe we've got issues of immoral Lev so the district plan is only one tool to manage parking it's not the silver bullet there are lots of other tools and in this case a lot of the parking issues we have round the city are cause people charge for parking and obviously people choose to park on the street where it's free so the only way we're going to solve that because adding more parking spaces are not going to make it any cheaper as to start charging for parking on street so what's your suggestion in Vicky well they are that David mentioned yesterday they are preparing a travel plan for the University and that would be the mechanism where we could encourage them to make better use of the capex that they have so that's something that would that look to work with us on and we've got a team of people upstairs so rich user-friendly the insolation I think that he happy the mechanism for so we do encourage I see some of those issues I wasn't aware of their and no you know that's a problem being at something we can raise through because what the other things that we were saying you say Vicki we wanted this to fit with the with the other parts of air cycling strategy in might the we've got the unicycle going in finishing off any day and public transport use of that for that there you know we want to encourage that too yep yeah yeah well we consume the race it was yep because the previous numbers were taken from a survey of a holder of universities and that was the average parking demand the information that's now been provided by Henry University shows that the number of students that drive to the cannery row is a lot lower than not above the university's example look of Waikato University the location of it means that people come from far and wide and there's a lot more people driving there't ask where did you park it asked how did you get here so with you parked on street or part and the car fact it's the number of people who travel there and so and so Kennedy University is doing quite well and reducing the number of people driving and obviously we're trying to encourage that by boarding this awful way and they've just been a public transport a net one of them Sir I suppose in the questioning it got a suggestion the staff thing that held that be done through the annual plan apart from ask them nicely to make it more user-friendly what else would you specifically want to have required but I think the issue is we think the ratio reflects we're currently reflect the numbers that the demand for car parking going forward but what the district plan can't do is address that current issue which is a retrospective one where where they probably haven't provided enough car parks up until now and you've got lots of people parking on the adjacent streets for the district plan's put in the plan is going to pick up the number of the demand for parking that they will use going forward but what I can't do is address the retrospective issue so we can't kind of go to the employer there's lots of people parking on the streets now so therefore we need you to build a big parking building so these people do that and that's really about the development going forward add some 22 to 25 1.5 to be upset here hundred students fit 25.5 happens to be the ratio 450 years year and a different one for um staff I promote engine stuff oh that includes the staff writer so that's the averaged ratio yes they are many car parts per hundred students yeah it's just 25.5 no that's staff and students so that those parks are for staff and students it's based on a number of this tea they're not stuff in there okay oh it's 20 parts 300 students for visitors and it's 5.54 for staff so I have 2.5 I for quiet but Pierre hundred students alright so the ratio is based on the number of students not on the number of staff okay okay so we assume 5.5 staff for every hundred students this is obviously the philosophy department as opposed to any other department we've based it on and but I'm wondering what we can do about it like this would be I would have thought one of the areas that there would have been a lot of public consulate comment about if people had realized that the number of cap happens at kemper university was being debated a part of their deal with the government is that they need to increase the number of students by X thousand four and locals and another X thousand for international students and we know that the students are now much more dispersed post-quake than they were pre quake have we built that into an enhanced parking requirement that they have to provide well the payment requirement is based on the number of students have the number of the role increases then the pattern requirement will likely follow and so always going to be a fine balance and we've got some met for the back of you if you want to read maps from transport models but there's always gonna be a fine balance between providing enough car parks and not divided into many that it encourages more people to drive and then we have more traffic issues and so we've just shown some of the maps the red line the white of the line will be the more traffic you'll get onto these roads around the university if you require more car park so it's quite a complex sort of situation where we want to cater for the man but we don't want to oversupply that we that we the sky from cycling discourage people from catching buses then we add more add more traffic so it's a real sort of what I'm in it thanks to have it looks like we haven't got any kind of right of it it looks like we haven't any sort of solution at the moment what well that but it's not have to depend on the section 32 we have to have robust argument as to why we're producing the objectives policies and rules that are in the plan what david has shown you is his reasoning for the ratio that's in the plan and for what's being suggested here in the plan we can't anecdotally say just because people don't like car parks outside their houses the road is a public area and people are entitled to park there so we can't change the ratio on the basis of people not liking something necessarily there has to be good robust reason for doing that on the basis of that ratio yes yes that's that's that's a good question about the way the current plan operates because the interpretation that the interpretation of the current plan the legal interpretation of the current plan is is that it's one campus and and so it doesn't matter where the car parks are is still a car park as for whether that's been addressed and the district plan review it they certainly be called special zones will be calling them specific zones the University will be one of those and we will be looking at those kinds of factors we haven't_''_1149.63 we haven't done that work yet that is part of phase two chapters but I did we'll know this this this parking chapter doesn't yeah however if there is seem to be a problem with it in that next phase potentially we can do as we've just decided we would potentially do with the natural hazards chapter if there is a further indication as to why this should change we would bring that to the attention of the Hearing Panel only the new development so we get one chance to do this can I just ask that just a very quick question the definitions on page 24 20 spaces for 100 ft students and 5.5 spaces for 150 e students is that right it seems really confusing we've got the two different ratios and so I think you need to amend that yet it's a little bit unclear so yeah the staff parking requirement a as a formula that you have X number of help staff per student so that's a way it's been careful if you look at the top staff and students are in one column and residents visitors earned another yeah so I do think there's probably an issue around just that table you're giving clarity yeah it's those you want here so it's 220 spaces for a hundred students let's visitors for visitors well that might be a historical issue we have a respective on it okay I know it's real now but it was it was contented previously under different rules of the visitors and residents or other lives all users at it so you could obtain the counter though but from foreign air on and that we can clarify at the moment we haven't counted them but this is not retrospective this is this is going 41 I wonder if away is that you you sort those ratios and especially ones around the visitors in free and next District plain discussion perhaps give us those figures and I don _''_1369.76 all this again is that is it a way forward Vicki and Yanni so we'll get the figures clarified and just present those and hopefully we won't to relitigate the those are the same numbers that we have in the current operative plan yep so we could have been that pack terrified all the rules require is that the staff parks our map differently that they don't require the student perhaps then beam out differently all the visit of parts throughout differently so yes they are at the moment but that's not a redistricting requirement but I think that's accepted Vicki but because the point has been made that it can't_''_1428.41 be done retrospectively this is on the plane I think though what is reasonable is that the the ratios that they they be clarified in the staff will bring them back you do an exclusive a meeting thank you very much sorry can't counselor back to Justice League I you you raced a question about the location of the car parking and how that works at the moment with parking at dovetail parking required for students if you do have a concern about the way that operates in the current plan I think it's the transport chapter which is the place to address that rather than special-purpose university zone because the interpretation of that car parking requirement comes out of the way one of those transport chapter tables operate in the current plan so if you do have a concern about that you won't address I think now is the time to address it well I did say that for a next meeting we would come back okay Miami yeah it may not be for tomorrow though it may be as part of approving the whole plan sweet ok well we all look out for it I'm sure counselor buck and so another counselor isn't here this afternoon was illegal bring it back to you and one form or the other thank you
I know well some people take a go and some people would doing other things and some people being very naughty and not told me that they're not coming well whether they're coming back waddup but anyway you know yeah that they they had to get all the way out to South brighton for a meeting at four o'clock so that wasn't their fault that's right most of this is information that was asked one that we would receive we'd bring to you yesterday right well if you just have a meeting with yeah sorry I don't need to be me but I wasn't here yesterday so that's hot so quickly leads quickly run through this am I thinking get it done in five minutes then right be very pleased alright so there's only three matters is that we asked report back on foot first of all was a pushing about the color of disabled parking spaces so you might have in front of you the what obviously trying to cheers or business and the tea break so the first raised yesterday and then we've also got further information for your information and pick this up so you're the shooter sure about the color of sable parking spaces it was a question about whether we can require that disabled parking spaces be painted blue and the the district plan we've had a look at the the standards for this matter and then there on the first page of The Young of the emotion that is attached to this table currently there is no actual requirement that sable parking spaces be telling blue it is rather as a recommendation and the usual in transfer agencies traffic control device manual and so what we are suggesting is to continue the same as what they have done in the this manual and put it as a recommendation but not here a requirement because of the costs and the difficulty and enforcement such a requirement so true we can't enforce the these are disabled or impaired drivers parking spaces that we can't we can't actually enforce them on private property so in the supermarket shopping malls yeah I very difficult unless you get a proactive center manager who has I mean we know neither can the counselor they'll know no jurisdiction over every probably seems to me to be pointless that we require you know shopping centers to have parts specifically for impaired drivers and then we don't have any role and unfortunate I think it depends what you mean by the foursome with so cuz it's in the district plan we can enforce that they provide the part you said okay but they don't have to enforce people using them so the reason that I want to blue put it is because the research shows that we're they are cut painted blue the chances of abuse of those spaces are a lot this so it actually means that you know the enforcement as an important issue but actually what it means is that you get a better outcome for what you're trying to achieve which has provided space for someone's disabled to park it was and I know the disability sector has been looking at the same Christchurch I think't think I just think it's outrageous that we that we have a plan that says you have to provide and they don't actually have to enforce it it's just crazy it's like saying you have to build to 12.3 meters or whatever but actually as long as you're living point 8 no one's going to notice yeah I think that's it's largely lift to the good will of the people who park there and hoping they don't jump into the disabled spaces if you either heavier there I don't know no it'll be a big camera well I'm for a friend of mine a friend of mine who's had a lifelong disability she she went round putting you know sort of leaving notes on people was one screen wife is saying if you need my disability as well you know it's kind of makes the point yeah usually you know if I mean what's the point of having them if people don't respect it I mean I think the issue that the counselor to be painted blue and I responses to to you is that now if someone came in for a resource consent and we were making them get a resource consent because the car park wasn't painted blue that's something that probably wouldn't you know 1,500 bucks for that sort of thing is possibly not a good look for Counsell there be issues in terms of enforceability of that the paint itself that's not the type of thing that the level of detail that we're normally put within the district plan and requiring someone to paint a car park a particular color but it is still seen as best practice and there is kind of encouragement for them to do that but it's not but if we eliminated of parking spaces public space for the purpose of ticketing people who packed them if ppl park it in a disabled parking mode that not they don't have a mobility thing with your honor when they're on the street our car parks or car park see decide on one of our car parts we're't we make them public spaces even in the private you know in the shopping centers and the mall so that we can just make sure that that we can actually go in and took up people who do their own well I don't_''_352.729 I don't say that we need to leave it to the to the mall owners to police why don't we just police it ourselves it's two different enforcement issues we can force that they provide it and they must put all the signs up the side of it with your partner no I understand we don't have the legal obligation no my diamond property and control how they use the map and if an hour an hour plane we seed that the parking that we require them to provide for people with mobility issues that we will that that that that is something that we can enforce why not a lot of the center's now eventually are using Wilson parking to manage the car parks you might find that regime about the enforcement around the disabled parks now actually they Rosen that we put a recommendation yeah rather then I'm sorry this is a piece of paper so yeah yeah so anyway but obviously the answer to my question is no can't_''_454.94 do that so no we haven't quite answered that you madam chair one one suggestion that that you were flagging was that the car park space itself they deemed to be public space in some sort of way the only way to achieve that would be a subdivision of the of the development land the answer's no so they also say so that one that one's no but but the other way of addressing that sort of thing as cecilton and send conditions or detailed requirements for permitted activities that require record-keeping of a particular type now that doesn't sound like much but but if you've got a requirement for I don't know that back there shall be enforcement by some very well specified mechanism of the disabled parking and there is a way for the council as authority to monitor whether yeah yeah number of how we had super we had the management rights for was the landowner had done I'll just signed a contract with us to do it so yeah we could do that but I was it is a cost implication of that would have to sort it out with the itch leno numbers up to the landowner to give us those yeah but they yeah but it's a cost so anyway it's not going to it's the point is is that it doesn't work so we have to accept what is recommended on the issue of blue though aside from the cost issue a new new new new provision for new developments there's no reason why we can't do that where weary meaning that we don't because it would be very difficult to enforce very difficult to to previously have you had someone apply for a consent that they want to tell her in a different color or have no color and then if we define different its or charge them a fifteen hundred dollars or whatever it is for a consent that this was probably not why don't we make it that the that the identification of the disabled parking spaces will be in accordance with the nzta traffic control device manual that blue be used to better identify etc etc and I mean leave it like that so it's a it's a kind of a direction to go down that track it's not you know you end up not being enforceable but it would be pretty pretty strong recommendation more than it is recommended blue be used to help better identify but that said to what we're recommending cousin it the odd translation said guide on the standard stone to actually say you must use blue that's the wording from the standards that has raised me but I'm sorry there's no actual only one it's raising no extra cost it won't hit them it'll be like one of those things that people don't do because they go well it's not really that important so we know we got an issue was enforcement we know we've got an issue with disabled car and we know that one of the best mechanisms to stop that from happening is to have a cut a dedicated blue colored car park so I personally can't understand why we wouldn't do it or maybe if if you're worried about cause the developments over a certain size so we're there providing more than and I don't know what the trigger would be but we're they have to provide more than to just disabled car parks or one disabled car park you know then maybe there's a trigger there but it just may say they'll be slow on this is a reason otherwise I mean that would be leaving too much discretion anyone reading the rule has to be able to know including countless planets have to be able to know on the face of the rule whether someone complies with it or not so something has to be certain and measurable at the moment does it say it has to be marked or has to be painted so no you're not it lady that does it already required blatant when it requires got to knock linen and max by neighbors same way once but it would impact not get mad for the cycles what's the difference I would have thought yellow ones would have been just as a factor but we come oh I really refer to the first page of butternut sample this is the picture of what has been recommended right now just just enabled it that would cost in the range of a thousand dollars per path to to just have that paint and then you've also got their ongoing maintenance of that paint because obviously with mirin tier with visuals going up and down that retires it did we're at quite quickly we've got thousands of disabled parks throughout the city so if we reported private events to do it then we wouldn't have to do it ourselves really all will be double standard it could be millions for us to do there yes on our pub on a pap so there is host and the patient but its decision of Luther I'm actually going to give up at but I've got a meeting at quarter to four yeah but it's only going to take another few minutes to finish me
Those are all of the slides that we have and the matters that were raised in the previous workshop on the natural hazards chapter I have to be made aware that afternoon tea is in the foyer if you wish that we have just a very short process to finish off the transportation chapter well I'd rather just finish off the transportation chapter I'm feeling weak and owning that person through that should only take five minutes yeah well people grab a cuppa and bring it on yep yes I know yeah so you do have to go
We've only included the Syrah red zone and these mex for your information so that you can see how they relate to the rockfall management zones that we've got in the plan right closing in the plan so the actual ones that go on the plan don't refer to them at all there is the series and its crime they don't know okay so it's a different situation from the phrygian I I do understand that but which made them mice but just in the legend on the second page and I just to show you it we're in the flat land use we do have for information only the serial residential red zone for the flat land and perhaps we should be clear about that too and maybe you should put flat land on here exactly yeah but the port hills zones or overlays are all on the left-hand side and we don't indicate any Syria but I didn't know that because of the map that you gave us said Sarah residential red zone so I didn't didn't go pointing it out now right they were simply to illustrate a situation yeah well so are we going to ground truth these because we can't write that into a plan if we're not gonna do what we need to do is come back to you with an assessment of what the cost will be and whether that needs to be public or not will be up to you and when you take an assessment of what it will cost and how long it would take and then on that basis consider whether or not to move forward but well but there is the desktop exercise to start with isn't there and that then gives us an idea of the it's still not ground truthing though effects no I know dear but but the desktop exercises reduces the area that needs to be ground truth doesn't it yeah it's a starting point we may accomplish everything we need in a desktop with available information but I don't want to say that category now without going back in and then we may have to check than trying to go out and map everything in it and every individual properties yeah we just don't have that understanding it so we can come to you with an understanding of how long the desktop study might take what that will cost but we won't know whether or not these for the ground tree thing to do until that exercise is finished well that will identify if there is all the specific areas foreground tree thing that's my understanding yes so the first call would go back into the look at the specifics of the gns model with the information we have and see where they're at a desk level we can drop out these fringe areas and basically make decisions based on that and may have to just go out and spend a day or two just to check them down so that's what I'm hoping so it shouldn't be an onerous costly exercising like slant I like those words very much all right so so you'll come back to us with a proposal on that because that seems to version of the of the plane reference to through the work that's being undertaken I feel much more comfortable about that all right okay before we move off this immature just like to do the council's attention to the mass movement one area up in the top left hand corner yep and that was one of the the other activity in the in the rule table 5 point 10 one that has had had a proposed prohibited activity status against it and we're also proposing that that a non-complying activity your be aware that there is a report pending on these nests movement one areas and I understand that while there was not a risk model use for the mapping of the mass movement areas as they are in the plan and honest image at the moment a risk model is being developed so at this stage we can't basically tease it apart and identify wristbands and attach different activity status to the more risky more intolerable risk parts of that map area so we'd have to keep that and consider that possibly as part this report is finalized so if I can now move on to the the other end up of the rock hazard area got on the top council workshop graph lock for hazard area bone vale avenue your this so again as part of the last workshop we were requested to consider because of the the council's not being comfortable with the non-complying activity status across the whole of the rock fall hazard one area we've developed this image to show you the purple areas are where there's a risk of 1000 1000 or greater one and 1000 or greater and then your individual and your individual fatality risk and that's per year on the niche site in that area this scale here is one to two thousand and four hundred so again fairly small areas slightly wider about you know 20 meters and some parts of that area so in terms of interpretation of the rules a little easier to apply and when compared to the cliff hazard example but if you go over to the right-hand side and you look at some of those little back then and look at the relative planning map which is Matt 46 you'll see it's going to be fully hard to to apply those rules using that scale again you know that risk as I said with the previous example that the model is an absolute it's not reality it's an estimate of reality and so to start teasing pulling the rule apart isn't generally supported you know hear what the counselors concerns are and but all I can say is that you know in terms of the existing operative cleanse the policy guidance there is relatively weak and so as councillor Johansson suggested you know there's a possibility there that knowing complying activities rules will get approval proposals under that rule status may have had a more lenient interpretation and passed because they haven't had the policy guidance we've got very strong policy guidance here and we are confident that where we say avoid and we've got a non-complying activity status that there's only going to be unique and very few such where approval could be granted dense the moment well a lot of undeveloped land as you can see they're down to this area here there's a little blue line zigzagging through here this is largely living hills except from down in the back base of the valley largely living hills and that's the existing zoning and then rural hills fear the South ear and this big pink these big pink things are they have trees or a bike right it's just sort of seed through the image and so as I said that's largely undeveloped land probably being used for pastoral processors farming and that sort of thing that's in private ownership is that I understand the living hills will be I'm not so I think a lot of the rural hills could potentially be in council oak ownership but I haven't checked there is there public access on to that land there is a walk ways you can just see a little bit of a little labeling here or to the left is clipped off so there's certainly around about this walkway nearby they're people read in this pink vet no I'll tight you're talking about blank ad everywhere it lines up to the trip doesn't slow down so sorry to health and safety and if you have any hazards on your property do they apply to the private landowner or to us or to whom we've let photo you enjoy yes the obligations under common law foreign land owner applied to any landowner regardless of whether it's the council or anyone else so this person who's the proud owner of this has to sign that this is a potential rock fall area well assuming that this is publicly accessible land and people go on regardless of whether they're welcome and presumably these guys who own this land are required to work sign that there is actual rock fall hazard or what's the requirement for their public safety just to make things a little more confusing those are the risk zones for rock fall they're not necessarily the source where the hazard is sitting at the moment they may be on the to the left of notifying the public that there's a risk and going on that land well well the council has a responsibility through exactly this process 33 if it when we passed us who puts the sign up is that the owner of the property or your owner of the source property the owner of the property on which people could be affected by the risk said earlier all that is the the owner of the of the property on which the risk originates has duties under common law to do what's reasonable to stop something at skating from their land and harming someone else so there's obligations on the owner of the land on the risk originates there sundar just common law liability that the help and safety aspect of it and the exposure for a landowner who has something on the land that harms someone puts an obligation on them to tell people to try and manage that risk and comfortably so does it mean we have to mitigate against the rock fall risk anyway no why the common law our obligation is to do what's reese's not reasonable in the circumstances to protect against people's using a walkway well I don't in this particular case but it takes a lot of work to look at what would be reasonable in the circumstances but well I'm trying to get it is if you're the proud owner for example of a wind farm you are required regardless of whether it's private property to explain and reasonably do it so reasonably the dangers that there are and going on to that property I'm assuming since we now have whole new risks that we didn't previously be so clear on that the owners of these properties where the rocks are actually potentially going to fall even if I'm straying trespassing on his property mmm I'm assuming that they have to tell me that I am in danger of having a rock fall on my head if I go to you I've need to do a little bit more with myself counselors know whether landowners obligation supplies to people who are trespassing on their property I'm pretty comfortable and who the landowner so let's do it will be appropriate and fights on to me properly I'm not so sure about trespassers all right I just like to in response to just to clarify that we do have a new policy five to seven that is about promoting awareness of hazards and make this whole mapping as a way of promoting their awareness Oh
It's right and the previous council should have thought of that when the when they operationalize variation 48 on 31st of january 2011 because they could have changed the rules back then and they didn't so it's kind of been a bit of an oversight we're playing catch-up fully admit that but as a top priority it's part of the flooding task force response which is to get we're getting urgent advice on whether we should be intervening on the eqc they just say declaratory judgment with the insurance company and if we are to do that we have to do that by friday so that people are working under enormous pressure to try and get a solution to that and answer to that and the second thing is the building act itself doesn't require people to apply for a for a building consent if the foundations are not being you know sort of well if insufficient of the foundations are affected by the change we have been utterly appalled or I have been as you have utterly appalled to find that people all their flaws right by the head cut river I mean it's absolutely outrageous and so so we're working as fast as we can to get that information it will be part of the suite of solutions Brent knows more about this than I do because he's one of the ones that's been working on it the same issue is the vessel yeah the flood management has got the central city it's the lip perfection maps that don't is it my reading of it yeah well did you look into that thank you I think it is useful I mean I loved it you know in terms of days and I thought what it's just it's hopeless you know not to have our central city included on and the may pang well central city is included and the operative city yeah that's what I thought but if I live in the overload and this new plane goes through and it's got new flood management roles and hides what does it meant for me in the Oval loop or on green have to comply with the new city plan baton please do that yeah the Central City chapter is going is coming to you as part of the Phase two stages checkers that are going through and the reason for that is because there are most of the rules that we through the ccrp contain the operative plan rules which we won't necessarily be able to change because they're now in place through the ccrp they recover soon however we doing what we can do with Sarah to try and make things as consistent as possible so the natural has I can't_''_235.519 see any logical other natural hazards should not apply that simplicity so what we're just looking into there so if we can do something on that now we will definitely do that and they'll come back to you as part of the overall report for when you need to approve the it would be our preference to a natural hazards elements there will certainly be some that we probably can for example the flooding I'm just not sure about liquefaction rules and things I'm here all we're talking about the air is climbing though isn't it because it is going to be in the face to chapter four central setting all the necessary provisions again being proposed by officers and that chapter and phase two but but if your request is that timing ways that we done now rather than face to but that's all we're talking about if that is although we are it's not as easy as it would appear I mean there are some differences between the two rules and we're just speaking with Sarah about how far we can go we will put in there what we can however we don't have a lot of time obviously to do I think when it comes to natural hazards like what concerns me is that you know you see the pace of the rebuild picking up in the central city prone to being rebuilt new major projects are going in and if they going in on the old assumption that we have as a city when we know we've got a new got extra liquefaction tests that people need to do I cannot see any valid reason not to ensure that particularly the central city where you've got a hive of activity that that takes that into account it just ya know and I mean just two words that's jord f you know I mean I mean it was built putting back what was there before and it's just ridiculous so look I completely accept your concern we'll do what we can do but with the timing that we have at the moment I'm not sure how far we can go so any changes that we can make before we come back to you it will be in the plan we've done the work but these also the ccrp currently in place at the moment and what we have to understand is the legal possibilities around any changes here yeah but I also think that it's actually quite a strong case on this chapter overall other chapters for us to get that consistency and embedded now so but yeah we can do that we're then David just like to ask and it's a handout night question if I can and my question is this is there any reason why I council throats district plan when it comes to the floor levels and you have to ascertain you know I think major foundational damages whether it's using our own guidelines or mvs is there any reason why council actually can't go in to bat for its constituents with insurance companies and say you must look you know so that we actually act is some I mean our rollers advocacy but you know in the pH you take that position and say I mean good luck to anyone trying to compel insurance companies to do anything but is there anything that is there any reason why we can't actually take the position and say we want our constituents to be looked after to their houses to be lifted to you know X level once they from what's the foundation of damaging seeds with its twenty-five or thirty percent you know I understood council the council has decided on its community outcomes what it wants to do for its community at the council through that process has decided that it wants to advocate for community results in particular areas then of course there's no reason why the council can't_``_471.68 do that the the best initially for the council though quite separate from a district plan review process so yeah but but the counselor could refer to the pain obviously in arriving in a position I don't know how if you do with it formerly resolve on something or I just might make a couple of comments green there's there's two things that that we are doing of course the district plan has policies that support the the floor level rules so that policy support is clearly stated in the district plan the second thing we're looking at doing is updating the floor level website which at the moment defines the floor level according to the building equity or outside of flood management area and according to the district plan appear within a flood management area to also give people the information for the proposed flood management front of them so if they want to to make a more conservative decision if you like and provide more protection to their house they like the information here immediately because that that website is used a lot by builders and planners so we are we are proposing to provide more information to help people make those decisions and a number of people are choosing to do that even though the rules don't require them to now yep okay in relation to these flood plans that you've got here did you come across anything while you were mapping all these of rebuilds happening in a way at particularly perhaps community owned facilities or government owned facilities schools for example happening in a way that wasn't going to be appropriate post district plan well not not that we're aware of now
Right we'll get underway um I've had apologies from um some councillors uh some not so well and others who aren't here today so I don't think we need to record those so um would you like to fire away on the natural hazards chapter is all of the workshops that we have concluded to date and that was yesterday's one the 27th unfortunately you'll see there's a date mistake today is wednesday the 28th not the 29th we're doing the natural houses chapter and just bringing back to you a little bit of information that was requested yesterday on the transport chapter and of course there is tomorrow's agenda uh you should all have your natural hazards chapter and natural hazard section 32 in front of you that's what we're discussing today and of course that's what we're doing so I have with me janice carter senior planner and helen beaumont who you will be familiar with from various flooding issues we'll start with the flooding natural hazards and then we'll move on to over what came out of the previous workshop with you so I'll just move forward to your vote right there at the previous um six of may meeting we looked at the flood management areas and explained how they had increased from the operative city plan and we also debated the issue of modelling whether it should incorporate a 0.5 meter or one meter sea level rise allowance within that modeling so since the meeting we have since that meeting we have updated the planning maps which you have in front of you which is the the black binder um to show the one meter sea level rise on those planning maps and they have been incorporated the one meter sea level rise and it's also in front of you some a3 flood naps which look a bit like this that she saw last time and that is an updated overall map of the city and the aerial extent of the flood management areas updated one meter yes the level rise not to to my knowledge there still isn't a national um direction to do one meter maps now we will have the standard planning maps which show zoning all other notation and the natural hazards but we're also having a series that just shows the natural hazards so you can see them quite clearly so that's not too complex when you look on the planning map so there will be exactly the same information but some another series of maps that shows just the natural hazards as well okay so will these sorry through mediumship will these be available online so we can make them available online so in a google maps type sense so that you can drive into them or drive down into them or this that wasn't generally the expectation that this map itself would go into the district plan but we can make it available in some way I'm not sure whether it can be a google map or not it doesn't matter what sort again it's fine thank you the other um I'm sorry I'm just going to ask on that because I guess as like as lay people I find the flood difficult to understand now I don't know if there's any way of simplifying them or um I'm just really giving you some feedback about um I guess especially yeah so it might be that with some learnt training we can get our heads around them but I'm just thinking too for the for the general public they're pretty I think they're probably pretty difficult to actually find the information that people want I would agree with you which is why we're having two series of maps your standard planning maps which has everything on them including the zoning etc but then the second series of maps which simply shows the natural hazards because they are quite um complicated particularly in some areas like the port hills where there might be two or three various hazards showing that's what janice has handed out to you today is the natural hazards series of maps what's the impact of having the residential red zone shown in the maps will they be in the actual plan uh in the second phase uh right so there the first phase apparently in this first phase it just they're they're red in there and they show as sarah red zonings um they're not given any kind of land use zoning or anything like that but because we haven't done that work yet but what the map does show as opposed to last time when we came to uh the red zone sort of blocked out the flood management areas because it was an overlay yeah this time we've shown the flood management area shown through the red zone should things happen in the future but it's not a zone and you know there's not that's right the thing that bothers me about that is that it um it just adds to the um to to the misunderstanding that this is a legal zone and it's not it is simply a method that has been adopted by central government that's correct to provide the basis for an area where they will make a voluntary offer we are now in a situation where we we're going to have to and our you know all the various uses that we want to make of that before there can be a public consultation and I just I'm really worried about us having anything in our formal documentation that gives it any form of status and it and in a way when it was covered by the by the flood management area it was actually quite beneficial because it does it all fits within the flood management area there isn't a single part of the residential red zone flatland that doesn't fit within there you're absolutely correct um perhaps I could just show you to the second page in these planning maps that we've just handed out which shows the legends um it may be that we need to come up with a better name for it but it's these these two types of notation on these maps and you'll see that the sierra residential red zone which is just depicting the area of land that we currently haven't done work on yet to before any kind of land use zoning is under the that we prefer to put in some different wording other than residential red zone well I I've I've always just excluded all together yeah well when I've referred to it I've always referred to it in quotation marks because it isn't a zone no that's good you know we can do that it certainly doesn't have any in in this series of maps the phase one plans it has absolutely no legal or planning status as such it's for information only but we somehow thought we should show in this first series of maps of phase one just the geographic area I understand why um I worry about the implications of you know this the potential status being given to it especially with supreme court because I think that's the inference you take actually at first glance if you looked at that you would think it actually has official status now alongside commercial industrial sector well no because it's information only it has the official status or the um planning status is because these are only the natural hazards over there but potentially we could either delete it all together or we could come up with a better or different name for it yeah I mean I'm happy also to put it in quotation marks or even have some wording underneath to say exactly what it is and and to remind people that it has no planning status as such yeah this has no planning status um with the quote marks around residential red zone that might be the the way to do it we can do that yeah okay okay so that did come to my second point on the slide so we've covered that this is just showing the previous map from the last um workshop where we showed the 0.5 and the one meter sea level riser we quickly flip to the next slide and that's what you've got in front of you that's the one meter map so that's just showing you the changes that have been put on for the benefit of those listening and the one metre and the half meter relates to the sea level rise we adopt one meter yet so why are we actually correct I got the right maps in front of me you don't have the one with 0.5 and one which you've got is the one the new map they imagine that just in a practical sense what what does this mean with these practical sense um sorry were these in our offices the area covered by the flood management area so sorry these people did one of these yes you should have everything was carried out actually no I missed the man's table oh good thank you have you got this all right have you got this yeah I've got that but I there's a there's just one map by itself on there but that's what I haven't got yeah sorry no no that's right now I can see the other two maps that you've got attached are just showing the extent of the perfection maps in a bigger scale because on the new planning maps we've only printed out selected for the majority of the city there's quite't shown in some of the banks peninsula these maps are a selected number of maps so we've given you a larger map of the liquefaction areas so that you can see the aerial extent of them laa2 the front liquefaction assessment area one yeah and the contraption assessment area yeah yeah I know I got there what's the difference in terms of in terms of the rules in the plan we're requiring more information on subdivision and resource consents if you're in liquefaction assessment area one because that's the area where we think there's more likely to be damaging liquefaction fashion area two is an area where you might be able to have a lesser assessment to your technical assessment because it's in that area where damaging liquefaction is unlikely so more assessment required in area one okay thanks and the other revisions that we have um if you've gone to the next stage because we've increased the increase put the 1 meter sea level in the model we also have to amend the rules and put in the default was in page eight of your draft chapter um it was picked up going to one of the councils at the last meeting that the 11.8 would now have to increase to 12.3 that's exactly correct so on page 8 of the actual chapter there's a red notation there showing that increase to 12.3 is the default minimum floor level page eight or page seven I've got it on page eight of my copy it's the actual chapter five natural hazards in the permitted activity table the what's the sort of point we admit where it's measured from I understand it's um minus nine meters below sea level so you take it from minus nine up to 12.3 so it's effectively 3.3 meters is it so longer the point under the cathedral is this something to do with that is that that's the bit I'm not sure of is it a a set point that has yes it is a set point that you measure all of the land use yeah and it's apparent supposedly under the cathedral somewhere unfortunately we don't have our expert no that's what I'll tell you but we can give you that precise information that has been measured as well that's amazing thank you sorry I should have asked that last time and then the only other um revisions that we had from the last meeting was what's in this chapter is some minor wording changes from as a result of comments from gns mb and sarah and they're quite minor they don't change the actual intent of anything that we have but we just tweak a few words for example the liquefaction definition we switched around a couple of words so that it makes more sense so that localized flooding was at the end rather than in the middle of the definition so it was just very minor in terms of where to from here um there is some amendments to the land repair rule that would affect this chapter and they're currently being progressed in a separate process and the idea would be to include them before notification if they're all agreed and the operative city plan land repair rules instead of the updated one so just I'm giving you a heads up on on that and then mb that has also requested that through this chapter we use a more consistent terminology for the word geoprofessional when we've asked for various geotechnical reports to be prepared a particular way and we we have got some amendments to that which we're just checking with some of the other scientists before we insert it in but by and large it doesn't make any real difference to the chapter it just means that we've been more consistent with how we use the word geotechnical engineer chartered professional engineer and geoprofessional and I think that was just a very sensible suggestion from mb to do that that's another minor thing we're looking at last time I thought one of the other things we asked for was that we would prohibit certain activities in some of the no-brained areas um what we've got is fiona's coming after me and she's going to talk about um quite extensively some extra work on that to show you so and we'll switch the cool the order around that's coming okay and then just in terms of the flood management stuff like is there any chance given that we know houses are being lowered without consents and we've now seen the thing about asbestos is there any chance that we could we we've been talking to the minister or mba around doing like a fast track plan change just on the like this issue like all that those issues because it just seems to me like people are rebuilding their houses now and they're using the old district plan and if they're lucky enough to have to get a consent they might get raised a little bit but if we've gone out with a meter then obviously we want them higher so it just seems to me that this is the one thing that is completely critical to getting in in place as soon as possible yeah I'm happy to answer that we changes to the district plan can can only take effect that's happening with respect to houses and some rebuilds and repairs is that people are getting around the district plan provisions if you like by using existing use rights and so we can't we can't change that we can't make those changes retrospective and and make people do that but what we have also done is we've got some a stream of work going on looking at what can be done with respect to the building act and potential changes to the building act just for the repair and rebuild process so that's in train but that's separate to the district plan stuff it's part of the flooding task force work I don't know the answers to that because we're hoping to have an initial report in the in the paper that's coming to the council next thursday
And Andrews finished the significant issues that were raised through the public engagement exercise and also meetings with various stakeholders but you will note there is a lot of red lettering throughout this chapter which means there has been a lot of additional work done on it and it was mentioned that it was cut from about 150 pages down to 50 pages I just like to invite andrew or Ellen to speak to that a lot of that I understand has come from through the clarification and and really am making the text tight but also bringing it into consistency whether the chapters to but Eleanor Ivan Eleanor Andrew if you'd like to make any comment on that sure I guess the last time you saw it the format of this chapter was much like the existing city plan and through various reviews we were it was recommended to us that it'd be more like the other chapters for a number of reasons that's this really the key changes just a lot looks different looks quite different but the the standards and the activities in there because a lot of the bulb has been able to come out of that Sun City is referring to assessment matters over and over and over just refer to them once and written them down once and so there's lots of pages of the same stuff that's come out so the content really hasn't changed a lot of this just helps it out and removal of their duplication and I think that comment also applies if you look at the objectives and policies it seems to be a lot of red in there but again that's been that exercise of going through quite lengthy objectives and policies or repetitive ones and what you're seeing here is a rewrite of those making them very succinctly meant to say deleting ones that we don't need in incorporating three or four policies into one so again the same comment applies the intent of what we're seeking to do in the objectives and policies is the same that the Reds just indicating there's been quite a rewrite of those to get them quite just so substantive done we've been more concise and precise and the presentation that's correct mr. chairman and consistent with other chapters and the alaya so there's no known there's no real material change that we need to address that's correct any questions thank you what so that brings us lovely thank you very much
Final thing and is really just to note in relation to land repair earthworks which is not part of phase one but will be part of phase 2 and that workers talk is continuing on that to make that rule a bit more easy for people to use in and to continue to aid recovery site and that Brooke is still continuing for for phase 2 of this chapter which doesn't will include earthworks so the earthworks we've got quite a few issues there at the moment particularly around asbestos and I jolla fluid going into the soils what's the current thinking around it I personally I think that's something we can wait for another stage 2 what I want to be satisfied is that we've got sufficient control with people are disturbing the earth to ensure that contaminated soils to ensure that things like a special sort of hydraulic fluids and oils that are being left actually we're mediated of taken away safely so I'm also in flood zones and again I don't quite know what the thinking is but surely or to do certain things yeah until you for your first point about timing I guess this one thing that we've been the group that's working on this rule has been looking at the issue I guess as we get the alternative to doing it through the district plan review and phase 2 is to have the minister use its powers under section 27 of the Sierra Act the problem with it is having an election and breaking for that period so probably it's it's just as fast to do it through this process I think as Sarah is still trying to push it through but and that's just sort of running out of time to get that data minister I think know if I could make a comment the the land contamination part of the contempo of the land contamination and hazardous substances chapter came to you on Friday and you discussed there how these matters were going to be dealt with the actual hazardous as part like how we try and stop the land becoming contaminated site will be dealt with in phase discussed already this morning you know are still discussing about a final deadline for any process truncated process but my understanding is that all parties both the ministers and Amir and and the council is trying to come to a conclusion of that process so that it can be applied to these priority chapters when I'm making is that by the time we wait for the stage-two duffel have already happened which will have negative outcomes particularly in terms of earthworks I mean we're already seeing it people in flood zones are having their houses lowered into the flood zone it makes no sense it's that's outrageous quite frankly that this is happening in a modern you know 21st century city in country so there has to be I mean we have to deal with this was so much since Laura thank you talking about the natural hazards which is coming to you tomorrow that the issues that you raised the one that you the one that you just raised as a part of the natural hesitant it's an example of why just leaving things current vulnerability room if around flooding around the space stars around all the other stuff that's happening in terms of contamination that earthworks is a pretty important thing to be dealing with in terms of flooding the existing role in the operative plane deals with repair of damaged land does control earthworks in the flood management area the controls in terms of volume of on that side and height above amount of fill above ground level there was a section 20 CBS doing works for example and the wolf's turn the area and they're basically leaving the land as low as it was before it seems like unthinkable but I know but I don't know if they need to consume I don't know if because they don't know the works that they just and it's a route you know response that they just bypass all the normal rational kind of logical things that you would do to improve it or to do it differently to recognize the increased risk you have both quake this is just hurrying up going as quick as you that make sense us right three of us the mr. Jarrett's it's pretty hard times that with our hands the effects of of what exactly by doing and what what are the consents they needed to do it there's all sorts of possible scenarios that might apply one is that I don't know it some reliance on existing use rats well even if these three lines I'm existing use rates generally the building act requirements come into play over how high floor levels have to be if the building act requirements haven't come into play over how high four levels have to be then the works been done as an exemption under the building act if it's an exemption under the building act we can't do anything through the district plan review process good will accept that's that's about how the building act operates but that's just canceled that's just one one example of the type of factual situation you may be describing I'm not sure whether that one applies or not so it's pretty hard to answer questions about what's happening under the building actor and the existing plan and indeed this is why there are eight priority chapters this is why we are seeking with the ministers a truncated process to try and get these new rules in place to replace the operative those parts of the operative plan which are currently you know and guiding resource conceits the autism visit there was a second second question there about control of earthworks on contaminated land the chapter proposed for the district Landry beautiful contaminated land has objectives and policies that no rules and that's because this national environmental standard pour contaminated land and it's that national environmental standard that sets out what has to happen at landers contaminated what investigations need to be done what the council's discretion is as consent authority what sort of food it needs to think about in terms of conditions that national environmental standard that that that addresses any issues okay the riverbank and 7 a-7 what deals out tomorrow um the final push and I have in terms of or two questions there's etc just help us understand that and then the other thing that has previously been raised what we need to look at and I think we do it through subdivisions is private right aways are we limiting the ability for people to have private roadways and if not how can we do that the first first question relations that comprehensive development is around the new neighborhood zone and I wasn't the writer of that chapter and so we're open tabs cough where your first day to to talk to you about those those issues I don't know enough about them to community and in terms of private right of ways no we're not put them to prevent people from doing that do you have a certain question then is how do we do that because we've seen that if really they aren't working they're creating all sorts of problems post is quite in terms of infrastructure appear they're all tied up with very legalistic body corporate structures and really unclear rules around maintenance so right of ways and gated communities is something view and so how can we do that and I think this was raised um work all right at the start here I think it is quite an issues it's a number of number of lanes particularly in your ward yani that the suffered quarter quite a lot of damage in the earthquake and the the argument of who was liable for repair and Good Counsel come and do this but all that but in body corporates it's not not one hundred percent clear so there's an area that does need a tortilla it's also things like um people can't get waste collection they can't wait elections all got to go out to the main street account they can't_''_541.31 be elected by the latest they're just a nightmare I mean I don't I don't know why we've agreed to let them happen in the first place but any rational assessment of them probably sure they haven't really worked and it's pretty good to have clarity around who I was war so that we have less confusion in they're useful things to have in the plan private right of ways and advice to me is it would be that they are useful things to actually have I know there's issues with repair and maintenance of them as you see it but I think in terms of getting good ribbons on that sometimes it is is useful to have those in the ability to to include those and if you think about some of the new green fields areas where a row of townhouses for example might front a front of street they often have a laneway behind them for vehicle access and that can be a private right of way or a laneway that prevents you know double garages and not much else to facing the street where most people would be and viewing those properties from or perhaps facing an open space area typically this is something that needs to be covered in phase 2 sorry Andrew and and you'll notice that this is a heart chapter subdivision development on earth work so that would come through and phase two with regards to private property if you're down a private laying the lawyer your legal team should have identified whether it is public land as in the driveway or as it's part of a body corporate as a private plane said I'm not quite sure where the confusion is because I mean if you've got a private driveway when you've bought the property you would be a member of a body corporate therefore the counselors no responsibility with regards to that if the public driveway is an owned by the council then I think it's fairly clear but I'm just not quite sure we were going with this because if people haven't done due diligence as their responsibilities but there comes down to the owner not the root there's two da you talkin to do and things are these it what they call the league in which is a section of the back and then it's a sushi Texas way there are some situations we have on the portals of some of the areas there with some people created whole subdivisions mmm with one by the don't issue and you get situations where people don't own it but have right of way of it and all that but that as the individuals responsibility sort out the council can't_''_708.66 be held responsible for if you're renting or if you've bought a property and you've got right of what you know there has to be a limit to and it has to be very clear know that is to be an agreement for an under steal or however that's worked with that pilot probably if it's a private property and there's an issue with it how is that the counselors responsibility I'm not quite I mean that's well shouldn't that be that we sort out the confusion but with the force but the land that the idol and owner has got an obligation you know it's as simple as that you know we might as well say odds it's difficult creating rates why do we charge your ship or why we I don't even ever count you know there's a a property and the part of a body corporate the only has obligations is up to them they can sort their they can take them to court but they're obligated to pay it and it's not actually our problem it's really simple all right Glenn it's simple for us because the fact is if you've got property owners that you know I've got the shared access or a right away with a part of a body corporate that is their issue but it's it it's not necessarily for us as a council to involve ourselves and I think you're actually right where you signed up but you only are you coming from the point where week is there an opportunity do you think that we can clarify for fourth start so we should tidy up at district and I think we have enough benefit private right of ways actually give to the community what I see is they get they cause a lot of headaches unnecessarily that we could probably prevent by being proactive and this time can we just draw a message down there there's been understood and we maybe just need a bit of clarity on a couple of four I think I'm moved to glean thank you probably this debate is a microcosm of what actually happens up these private rights away and what I've experienced but is it the council's responsibility through the district clean not to sort these arguments out that actually to provide clarity in the first place over the smacks of public and private the three three of us the chair it is the council's responsibility through the district plan to identify the resource management issues in relation to the difference between a public road and a private right of way now if there is a reason source management issue there that's appropriate for the council to deal with then it is appropriate for the council to tune their mind to what are the provisions you want in the district plan and why you want in so if there's a mess you do that you see happening in the community a resource management issue then it's be dealt with and decision making on subdivision consent applications because through that decision-making process on a subdivision consent application it can be conditions or plans approved that showed roads rather than private right ways and I think there's that so that the parity which would most help out we have heard the concerns taken a note of them that's correct however week that's not a part of this particular phase of chapters maintenance on their own private right away I think in terms Brett's I canna sister's a few things we've done in terms of the issue one we've moved subdivision from a controlled activity to a restrictor discretionary so actually has some discretion in terms of things like right-of-ways and how they have managed we've got subdivision design standards and that will be looking at particularly in relation to the new neighborhoods area which are your new subdivision areas basically the urban design approach to that is to not have back sections that you actually have sections which Front Street so when you look at design of subdivision now you four or five properties coming off them so that's also happening the third thing that's probably happening as well as council practice and this is throughout New Zealanders that previously the older rights-of-way were created with very limited right away easements or documentation going with them the rights of ways which are created nowadays have require you to have legal documents going with them that set out exactly the responsibilities for people with those now we can't deal with historical rights away because that's that's what they are we can't go back and revisit those but the new rights-of-way standards come with a whole set of requirements as to who's responsible for what and those are set out in the easements that go with the right of way so quite a different situation than previously so what happens with old rights-of-way they just have to exist as they did exactly and it's you know the council encounters this for a number of things whether it's retaining walls on the port hills that have been damaged and who's responsible for the moment and there's nothing you very much you can do about those existing rights away thank you that's right moving forward
Thank You mr. chair so we had been there long here who's been there chapter leader for this chapter I'll invite him to talk you through it good afternoon councillors it's been a while since you've seen this chapter I think last time you saw it was 150 pages in the arts 59 so it's changed quite a lot in terms of format in particular but there's probably three things I've note to talk to you about that's come up through consultations I'll just run through those three things and first one is we've had some people come to us and say we know repair and Laurie building units and they need to change the unit plan or the Crossley's plan and our plane at the moment makes it quite difficult to do that for subdivision you need it will be non-complying activity to do that and for land use and there's a raft of bagram location requirements that you would potentially need to look at and get consent for and so we've tried to we have activity status which is still simplest to do and there's no standards for that so if you turn to page 11 of your document eight point two point three point one rd2 so this is not much data to actually look at and so really all the counselors doing as saying and yes we're proving this new Crossley's planner units plan so that the people who go off and getting new titles issued there's nothing really more for us to do at that point but it's a bit hard to hear just what page were you refer leavin as you'll ever eight point two point three point one in sardi too so as it's just a technical change of ownership right here what the council doesn't require consent it's when people have changed the physical building and then the cross Lisa unit plane does no longer match that generally when it's old people will come back and they want what they want the plane to look like what they're buying basically so then they come to us and we a new title issued for that unit just so I'm clear it's past all the other tests that it needs to go through yep by that stage it would have gone through any land use consent to building consents necessary and so following on from there there are occasions where you need leaned you can see as well so sometimes those repairs might mean that the wall of the building needs to be slightly thicker or the building needs to be so one meter to the south or whatever that might be that's not quite it doesn't qualify as an existing use and the Resource Management Act but it essentially is the same the same buildings going back very very minor changes requiring land use consent so there are yeah I think in the proposed plane is 14 different Vulcan location requirements that would currently apply and so the proposed rule would limit that to just the ones that we think are important in terms of I guess a building that's going back almost the same so we still want to control height front setback because it's almost the same as what was near before we don't need really to look at those things into much depth so there isn't a residential chapter another rule that sets that out so there any questions on on that Tula are restricted is discretion rtvg or is the discretionary which one amazing a solar page page 12 you mention it page 12 all supports magazines or so no ditson in the residential chapter so that it looks at all sorts of publication requirements and built form standards and so for example one that we're not interested in looking at as site coverage because it's almost identical so there's no point in us reviewing that having label and go through all of that and ask considering it there's also one about landscaping and gainers visited almost established thing so there's no point down back over mall blows things for a second time some of these things will have been presented in the password will be permitted activity in the past and so they're in there something that sort of in's changed since this chapter came to you last and in the residential chapter of the existing city playing the minister included 3333 rules the first is that you can divide an existing house into this you can run is that you can allow a family flight to be used for non family people and the third is if you have it house that's damaged beyond repair you can demolish it and put two houses back and the issue with that is that there were no corresponding sub-divisional provisions so once you hit that you can really do very much with it and other than maintain it in your own in your ownership so the changes to allow those to be subdivided and sold separately so where we make the provision for that and so that's page 13 and 14 Don page 13 that's their rd3 that's actually an existing rule just carried over from the city plan on page four teens is Table three with those specific instances overdressed and table 3 it's the three three rows with red text with the yellow highlighter situation no I don't_''_383.39 so Betty this basically roll gets around the residential medium density requirements minimum size requirements for sections yeah it's the these present in the residential chapter are limited to which zones there and I think it's l1 and l2 and that's not it's not all those owns and it's not what has now become residential medium density and if you look at the table their residential medium density or so here's no no lot lot limit and most of you will all this change in a subdivision chapter is doing is he's taking one step further from what the minister has allowed anyway so that the actual physical effect is already there what's what's being added is some lines on a piece of paper and ability for people to sell those properties how do you know if the infrastructure wool coat a worldly infrastructure will get to code 33 what the minister is already included in the plan and is operative currently but wouldn't through the subdivision prices you have an ability to assess the that they would Howard generally be existing uses already but we could include conditions on a consent to say and to cover those issues should there be any will let things like parking and in traffic generation and you know there's trying to think of you get an asset it's two houses on a very small site you've now got double the amount of cars double the amount of people double the amount of the existing rules in there and the residential section do address a number of standards like fit it does doesn't say you can go and do this this is you can do the subject to various controls though they should have already been addressed before we get to the subdivision stage and they general need land use consent to do that through the residential section of the operative plan and in a they could then come back to us for a subdivision consent so so so through you must be don't just clarified that the minister has put the land use rule in the plan so the Landry's roots there three examples the house has been demolished because of the earthquake damage people are as a right able to replace it with to providing they make things like car parking requirements and I think pro memory that sees that you don't have to meet the minimum height coverage requirement that you still have to meet make some pipes recession same-sex sort of them and I recall it does expressly for that one anywhere does expressly refer to the car parking requirement so you still to provide the car parked on the side so so that's a change that's already and the residential chapter that can't_''_557.769 be controlled in any way other than the way the minister has has written that rule in the residential chapter this is just bringing the subdivision provisions in life so just explain why again why we have no minimum net area because the minister decided that the earthquake recovery objectives of affordable housing and increasingly housing supply what's more important than the minimum coverage area in those cases where a house has had to be demolished because of its wreckage we handle these situations is that sorry I don't going forward a few years what happens then with these sort of developments so they well while the houses are there but about the only part of the cities and viral but sorry I don't understand just how long does the minister's overriding the situation provided okay well the rule has been placed in the current plan by the minister as up to this council to decide whether it's going to be consistent with the recovery plan by putting the same rules into the district Landry beautiful and I think so far the council's decided to be consistent with the recovery plan by carrying those rules through so they will be part of the subject to this council's decision they will be part of the district plan they will remain there until this council decides to change that plan okay any further questions on their SB Jimmy that on page 14 regarding to the role let's tential suburban the corner Henderson and thus passed all the minimal one hater there's not a new's essentially a rural area that it has significant storm water management issues so that there's really just a carryover of what's in the existing city plan and to to require or to prevent development in there until some works have been done all case you mean Denise while he could kind of keep that the lifestyle you can it does do that but the intention is to bring the types a lot more houses going into somewhere it's not really appropriate at the moment for them to be because of storm water issues thank you um and I may have missed this but in terms of subdivision size is there any way we would look at smaller than 450 square meters there that work was done through the residential chapter and they considered a range of different options and came back to 450 right which is what ironically what was in the planning all along is what what what is all clins minimum I can tell you that I wouldn't know after took my it's okay I just had a guy call me I Crescent that's one of your neck of the woods is it my ghouls who's you know who's doing a lot of work in social housing and what an affordable housing and he was saying that it would be a much better idea to have smaller I guess section sizes you know to try and get great intensification we've got like what about for just general well this is where we've had the medium density zone your call it's already been to you so I mean we have looked at the residential types and and where further densification could have here and that's come to you through the residential chapter this might be a question you might like to raise on Friday when when that chapter comes back for its final revisions yes no yeah thursday sorry it's good friday sorry sorry not doing anything on Friday Saturday okay any further questions on that SP sir okay more than three
I've got on the summary here I've got Road district pen road classification and rope estephe occation the central city are we going to deal with that too so yeah those those those six times are just highlighted other other here is where we've made changes there are some other comments that were made previous the previous session and the this table provides the comments that staff have on those issues but we haven't proposed to make any changes unless they were the sub songs we've just talked about so it was always really for your information as to the responses to some of their previous discussion that we hear the comments are on on this page you mean yes I did and the table there's a column for staff coming and they favor refer to some of the tables look there are there n equations around there yanny just um so the government in GTA I've got this one Road classification that they're doing when is that likely to come into a field that's still been development the moment so then but this is there will be a period of time where we can consider it and this stage from what I understand it's not the intention that it will be a legislative requirement that will have to put it into a district plan it's more of a small going to be requirement round funding and around the applications for funding it that we may in the future will work be consistent with the new not well we have to if we acquire for funding busy say well we've got a major arterial but it's really your classification x and therefore fun though yeah I saw been developed so so we're not entirely sure exactly how it will play out but that could be aware that it played in the central city again just this complete confusion about the accessible City chapter and the rest of the city again I don't quite I don't quite understand why you would change have different bleeding but surely it's best just to have one classification so people know what types of roads yeah the reason of the rules that are in the simple city a different to us in the district plan review so we didn't want to have the confusion that people automatically think that the rules that apply outside the the forever news automatic by applying wasn't the brave reason vice versa obviously through this is a plan review we're not we can't_''_190.3 be inconsistent with what's in the for Eve's so so we can't change those so at the moment it was it was simpler to have different terminology to avoid that kind of confusion but the future we may be able to sleep but at the moment we can't touch once more how safe my half is a arterial and the lips will City chapter so the ones that go around the for abs are all central city well that's about really super-sorry yes they're included with an inaccessible city roller rink so they're just called arterioles yep and those are tombs where for money worth so yep they fell okay any other questions alright we're just with it the subdivision development and earthworks cryptograph chocolate and you should have a package of papers relating to that chapter this is the first time you will have seen this chapter first time around and I'll invite andrew long which year so in the package of information you should have the draft chapter the section 32 summary of feedback on chapter just well I just want to if it's okay if we take a five-minute grabber copied stretch
Next-- who can do yep so yes it's the life mart parking requirements so that's also on page 24 and near the top under number 5 so this is come out of discussions I understand it's been head on the residential chapter to consider the life Matt requirements and to ensure that houses are built for all stages of life and so one owes requirements is around parking and so that's why I put in the pan the transfer chapter and that's that each house provides at least one part one car park that is suitable for a person with disabilities and so that would require to have a non-slip surface and also requiring wide enough and with what dimensions and the plan so that a person for the wheelchair can Dinda access the vehicle so just to clarify are we saying that every residential house which is built must provide a car park which meets the criteria for a person with disabilities is that what's intended yes it won't because that's in line with the life mark requirements from coming so must provide such a car park yep yes yep over so that's already your apartment of the building it that the only addition that we have put in is actually about having a non-slip surface so the boarding it already requires that a minimum of one car path is sufficiently wide enough for a person with a disability in each House what to the only addition here over and above the boarding yet is that the surface will be non slip so that people are the it's not written I suppose it's not hugely different to what is already required yep that's just just a point of clarification then are we talking we talk about residential units are we talking about a private residence here or as well yeah so the difference I originally residential unit as a as a dwelling a house private it's bizarre with doing here so I I'm thinking for instance of a person living not far from us just build a new drive the ability to put two cows on it along with two cars in the garage see she's got a granny flat earth bank so that means it must be too good parking spaces that are yeah so it's a nice one it is one period central unit so it depend on where the very nice letters Scott got all the forces facilities to be a standalone residual unitl or not but if it is then two bases must be fun oh yeah yeah this one here wizardry not so but emphasized prayer with social housing how are the rules there is that yes yeah thank ya ok little hefty of car parts today social has so the you're not currently so is it something in future there's naught root root of speed of its if they are providing what what only one car back it must be signed for a person with a disability I so it's a minimum of one it's just that everybody must be food isn't a disability so what's the definition of a non-slip surface there are no I don't think we have a competition non-slip surfaces eshe felt a non-slip surface or the driveway that is designated for disabled non-slip capability so many to building a standard house now do we have to actually go to extra lengths to provide in the driveway some special bit of non slip but a surface alongside a special designated bit of disabled parking for every house that gets built you can't have ok the 10 minute exposed aggregate driveway does that automatically get you around that sort of obligation I mean it's pretty wide and varied that and I mean a lot of people in the whole lifetime of the house may never have a disabled person visit yeah it's not a there's not a strict definition for it more around a hospital common sense kind of rule in fact that if someone's providing a park that they must provide and its actual way that is it's not the razor is easier for someone to slip on not a question if you're providing the wording says she'll provide if yep so so I'm just asking what is what is a non-slip surface through you mr. Jarrett deposition in the plan that's easy going like non-slip surface includes concrete or whatever I would say okay made it clear so you might be to add that just to assistant of it what on what I'm potentially hearing as I suppose that you you what what's currently being provided and house houses now our buildings will probably comply but the way I read this this is this a new addition to the plant if yeah and it sort of may throw a few alarm bells and make some developers that somehow or other they've got to have a special sort of small area we against we you park a car that if someone turns up in a wheelchair with a specific disability that you've got to have a specific surface on the driveway things day I think so yeah the stuff we're going to check out like a definition to add to it and Jamie you but yeah it's just following orphanage look by and large it isn't a tire Norris I do understand what you're saying though I think because in all honesty like whether it's grass concrete Greville all these are non slip and this you've sort of got polished glass I canna we can't actually visualize what would be a slippery surface then I think perhaps them the wording on page 24 with the rollers at the top and five and orange it says people differ get on slip surface to enable safe access in wheat or icy conditions so it doesn't mean to say it's slippery all the time it's a surface that will become difficult for a person with disabilities and wet or icy conditions so that's really just politic on creating their stuff which does that fine tum my brother thanks you know like see quite often I brushed concrete finish you know like this it's rather than polished in all honesty with developments nearing that listen you're seeing it more and more as long as it's not ridiculous because we every now and again you do come across the automatic this one this isn't it but something is that is accessible for that's exactly correct and it's example if it's in a garage that's a perfectly suitable surface because it's not going to get icy or wait yep but the issue here though is that even bitumen can be slippery if it's wet and the water sits in the air can I sup so it's a okay we might get some clarification by further definition if you're able to find it okay so we are through with life mark parking requirements is there another there's another section we now need to turn two on a transport
And just as I'm Richard on Friday when we're talking about the industrial chapter we are increasingly discretion under these transport assistance from what was under the current plan so and the current plan we only had to consider really the way the exes was designed we couldn't actually put really consider whether the development was all over appropriate scale to put them with the transfer portable so we've now got more assistant to consider that so so we should be able to have more ability if we choose do to be able to assist with the development is all this different size or appropriate size for the corridor and whether they need to be changed so we're hoping through this review we will have more teeth in it okay so in terms of them who had transport assessments we've had some more consultation with landowners and with transport consultants and we're working closely with them to ensure that their assistants and the reliance of assessments are workable when fit with their needs but also give counsel enough teeth as I mentioned before well one thing that we are looking at it make it quite clear on the plan is there was a consumed by some landowners that every time they down an extension to a development they would have to go through another transport assessment process so for a shopping mall for example if they added an additional shop and don't have to use reference in process that look at the terrific effects every time they added an additional shop so what we've made it quite clear is that if a landowner developer decides that day what wants to avoid having to go through since impresses every time they put additional shop and what they can do is they can apply for a integrative transfer assessment for their entire site and for the all the future development they're anticipating and that will cover all the stages of the development and so they don't have to go through some constant prices if it on their entries a new shop and what we're hoping is if that will encourage a lot more of a sort of hints of look us like may look look at so we can look at more hybrids of Lee some of the wider effects rather than just looking at each shop individually and it just sort of builds up and suddenly the the fixer much bigger than what we anticipated so so hopefully we can look at a much larger scale and be able to assess the appropriateness let's they'd show that's the change we're looking at making thanks David any questions on those I TAS pulling except that they don't have to do it that way do they they could still do it the other way that's right over it's just an option and I think it comes back to what yannis saying and if they do do it piece by piece how do we get that whole concept when we when we realize that stretch to trigger point where it's going to adversely affect air transport system because I know what happens and we end up picking up the tip don't_''_190.56 we putting in lights and yeah that's I think it's they look at whether then anticipated growth of the city for the next 30 years and so we can feed that into and we do that at the moment for feed that into these transport systems so so I won't just look at the individual slide also look at what's anticipated the right it's anticipated around the site obviously you know there's a whole lot of sometimes they have to be made about what will happen over the next 30 years but but there's air biscuits and so up through these assistants by increasing the amount of discretion we can look at the these wider effects at the same time thanks David can I just come in we error Environmental Committee this morning had a presentation from see top which showed us the technology which can be used in clearly at Scott you know great great potential yani so in terms of doing those integrated assessment assessments do you have the power to say you should provide X amount of space for public transport and X amount for roading and X amount for active transport that have actually provide the public transport and for the cyclamen and cars so and is obviously also pack and refinement and soft pack animal parts as well so yes we have got the descrition around that and it'll be up to obviously the Commissioner if it's Commissioner and makes a decision on the consent or hearings panel ways to what what conditions that they put in place and how much space there you have to those different modes but which is me about discretion to have a look at it do you think we'll get better outcomes around the bigger developments with this approach so things like you know if you think of some of the dimensions of car parks think of the the lack of safe crossings for people the length of public transport facilities lack of cycling's that you think these will make a difference yeah we definitely got more discretion to love that it ought to be up to the decision makers to whoever it is on each 14 years today and actually apply those that those that discretion but we didn were at at the moment is that we have these traffic impact assessments and they basically focus on the private motor vehicle and the the whole thing about integrated and thinking about what that means as we look at all modes and so we look at the cycling a look at the pedestrians we look at PT and we look at the private vehicles so that's the benefit to them and there's a whole raft of things that people need to consider as part of that process so yes we certainly do have the ability to get far more directive in terms of ensuring that we provide for pedes PT and everything else in terms of conditions and in the final question ahead on this was um so you you get a development you put into place a traffic assessment type resume becomes part of the consent when it's when it's done so there's a checkbook plan at what stage do do a safety order like who dat who is responsible for looking at the safety of it and auditing it and ensuring that it we avoid the noble subdivision issue again if I mean like if we can we need to learn from that yeah so what what kind of safeguard can we have so that we're looking at women bid the policies in the assistant matters also require that what's been proposed that the safe and so that will be part of consideration when is this distance comin it'll depend on the scale that as of with it appropriate to do a full safety audit on the development but term it is part of the consideration and we've also got infrastructure design standards which requirements are safe as well and so as well as complying with the district plan the development side also comply with the church the song standards for which we shed their specific details as their widest thumbs are from what I said and printing treat me from wrong I think if council is going to take over their infrastructure so if it's a new road for example and council has the ability to them to refuse to take over that wrote google council has has issued so if the council has issued a resource consent that sees the roads and the infrastructure shall be built to a particular standard it would not be wise for the council to then say well no we're not going to accept that infrastructure that does comply with those consent conditions so the yeah that's that's what I just need counselor so it's so if the resource consent has been issued after after there having been expert opinion evidence that satisfied the councillors consent authority that that infrastructure was appropriate filter those standards you then have a resource consent and the council gives effect to that resource so in effect that becomes a requirement of the plan yani well I understood from what Brennan said that the plant we are saying it but well complete so the infrastructure design standard is made under the local government act and was adopted by the council in 2010 or thereabouts-- at the moment the provisions of the district plan haven't caught up with the infrastructure design standard partly because of the earthquake happening in between it was of that were adopted by the council under the LGA in 2010 would make their way in some sort of lay into the district plan even if they do make their way in some sort of way into the district and people are still entitled to apply for resource consent and get departure from the rules or the requirements and the plan if the council as consent authority under the RMA besides that it's appropriate to do so so in effect that leaves that area open to appeal does it answer your question Annie what the current thing is what I'm saying is I think we should have awaiting a plan to stop that from happening where possible is there it creates all sorts so I guess the question is is there is there a way of nailing this down further with a network from the plane bc it as far as the drafting has gone so far to the provisions of the lure what's than the infrastructures besides entities so the the specific issue of the mobile sub the noble subdivision was around robots and they nothing gets for me to you either later this afternoon and so we have the ridge what's in the ideas of what's in the with the draft subdivision chapter this adesh above nobles that preceded is your plan hadn't caught up the district plan was 95 and the IDS was written in 2010 and it just hadn't caught up and time but of the there is a review we're trying to catch it up and so hopefully there won't be that bad issue where one ones and some of it with the other which is what which mean it were noble sort of it girlfri the correct but as Brent said we can't the limit people's our right to larger content to to to put angular that day they kind of such and such a safe in it that's so things are a little evil yet and there's more on that on the subdivision chapter really okay so we're all you up to now I hope to just jump back to university parking this is the fourth one down around the parking rate which is on page 24 of the draft chapter we've had some time together this more research into that and so we've amended the parking requirement for the University for tertiary education and research activities it's called and etch actually aligned up with what we had at the parent city plan cuz further research has shown that actually what we were proposing previously would have required a lot more car parts and what they a heavy at the moment which was can be far too onerous for what the University require and so the University of La contain a travel plan at the moment to try and courage more people to spy for and public enemies rich university and the road soft lines are part of that so I'm we're we've changed the power requirement back to what we had previously to to be more realistic group and so what was the basis for having an increased number and what was that number it was based on what what looked look looking at some situations and overseas and we hadn didn't have the time and so now it now we've melted round trip and realize they'd actually no it will not be real problems party I'm not I'm not a local councillor for that area but I did go to university once many years ago and I do go through that area quite frequently yes and on just about every street around the University there's signs out restricting car back into two hours it's because there's not sufficient car parking provided at the University so those residents are having to pick up the cost of the shortage of parking so why would we be going back to a non problem because the the University at the moment heaven because cortical it was built in the 1960s and 70s when the pan or emotions were quite different even if don't um don't well the new development that their proposal will require more more perhaps a lot apparently hip so the new develop will will increase the number of popups you put on so much what was previously proposed was about a much so so we are quite confident with one of the research that they've shown that this this will provide a fax for what what they require but what we can't stop through the district plan because it remains only one children to deal with parking and then this is an issue across the whole city that the district plan won't automatically solve all their parking issues one of the issues for the university units initially for a number of other sites around the city is that if a development but for parking or put some restrictions on who can use those packs so it's what time limits and there are free packs on the road outside the development obviously people kind of part where it's free rather than having to pay on the premises and there's nothing we can do to stop a landowner charging for parking that's the economic right to make money off their land so that's just something that we continually have to battle with and that's why in some cases we have to put upon restrictions charging for on-street parking because we're going to have to compete with the fact that the landowner is charging for on the parking so their issues the realities the discipline is not going to solve all the parking issues it's going to help hopefully by refined more parking but there are other tools they have to look at and stylish actions are just a reality unfortunately because they wouldn't wouldn't the argument of concurrent of making them required to provide more parking work against the idea that people would go and park on the street because it was free because surely if they were having to provide more parking that have more of an incentive to use that space wisely to encourage people to use it so why well that they I mean it just seems to me like I'd be really interested in getting some more information around us understanding what your projections are for the car parking numbers at University what local assessments you've done Afeni with the local community board because I have to say I'm quite concerned about this the Achaeans proposed bus routes that they cater for this area and currently are doing very well in terms of patronage so I guess they're to be part of what the information we might get too but it just seems to be quite a complex area to resolve I'm not sure what if the staff are more real so you've got 20 spaces here per 100 ftes of the Union how many was that before so thats before and it's always been that way well it was that like that in the obviously the previous city plan it was written on 95 prior to that we was under the why Mary District Council Planning Council from what I understand which would have had a different moment I'd I mean see if anybody got twenty percent of students driving to uni that's what you're saying well shared via course as well and others and you have any data my muni about what that percentage actually is sorry do you have any data from the University because the I'm sure they have some trouble version so that's what we've pasted on which is about right of course people don't don't opportunity at the same time with different lectures and difference that so the what whilst there's 20 spaces per 100 students obviously with carpooling and with people having different lectures at it does cater for the number of people driving we are also obviously looking at we've got major cycleway going we've already built part of it on island road we're out of the trying to encourage people to talk to the university with the one from the city to the university as well of the eternal resting in the bus routes so there are a lot of travel options to the University and so that reflects the choice of people have yeah but they people do end up parking all around ricktum bush all the way down there and then sort of walking into unit I think realistically would be difficult to bribe before all the parking on site because the university would end up being a car park and not much else well they a proper car park in there yeah and that raises cost issues with them but the feedback we've had from the university is this is a realistic you know that the SE of a show the 20 spaces 150 years is about right so I think the provisions that David's put in there reflects the surveys that they have done but I think for that site and with those number of students would be very difficult to cater for it all on so on I mean you'd have you put why still the three so you like a marquis building babe I mean having been there myself seven times I can assure you trying to get a car park in there is an extra impossible so I think from the university is perspective they should be looking at building up two or three story car park yeah doc tend to grow the sea and take the parking issues streets right down through the Hamilton and the more like that far out to go to university so it is a obviously a major problem and to get there the road restrictions they moved us further away so you can disrobe restrict everything anelia has actually put up parking fees but I mean that doesn't put people off because a lot of people actually that is there any way together okay so the the changes are in orange but it's councillors overall agreeing with it there seems to be some debate around it or are you asking for it to be changed it just seems to me too can I just add though that kept student park student parking as sort of like needs to be part of the city's strategic transport plan to and the residue site we've referred before too you know active transport and that needs to be taken to account so some of the students are walking a fair distance but but basically as accounts is wanting prepared to leave this as it is like another point as well is that twenty five percent of students these days of mature students so you have the idea that well students are young and they're all flatting and they can buy call percent on mature students so they may be coming from all over the place they may be coming from jobs or workplaces or whatever so it's not as straightforward of population as it probably used to be um so just clarify though counselors accepting of how it is given there are some difficulties with us but the changes that have been made we okay with it well what do you want it to be changed could I say that I should worship seriously I can't just change a figure based on anecdotal evidence and what David has told us to date is based on the evidence that he has from a number of different locations this is the figure that's coming up I want to do is really get an understanding of the assumptions and the information around what's currently happening what was happening at the time of the earthquake or you know before and what the new changes would do this is what the changes we initially had in yeah I mean I think if you're saying you've done through the work and should be able to see and understand what it means yes absolutely we can bring that back for you and so sorry officers that information in the section 32 report no not the back detail but you'll bring what you here for vailable will bring that back teach early tomorrow and if their spare time I think there might be able to address is chapter thank you so are we now looking at disability disabilities life mark parking
Bring it back mmhmm yeah doesn't matter alright yeah ok ok alright alright so moving on to the transport truck two religions I'll hand over to UM so clear water do you want to concert up here or do you want to achieve him here Kenny speaker off just my computer yeah in the overheads that were just given to you before we started this meeting this one with the blue stripes on it you'll see that there is a page the revisions to transport chapter on page three and that's simplifies the issues that David will be talking about today ah and I just like to introduce Richard Osborne unit manager transport and retrace image welcome Richard mr. G thang alright so what you what you should have in front of you is the this is a couple pages sort of a outlining the dishes in more detail and table format is also those that the latest version on the chapter on the transfer chapter flew have enough officers at the slide Bruce transfer cheapest I'll just take you through this life before you pieces I just want to make sure to his own yes yep does everybody else have them is that David let's hit it up summary of this Kate recover each many homes so this is heated comments on the transport chapter this is everyone got wine or can look on the label there are some extras if you don't okay thank you alright so I'll just take you through what's on on the slide which is just highlights the changes that we've made to the check for your consideration so first of all the road test vacation or the road heroism simple bullet there was a request last time I think by Councillor Easter to slip through that Mary high road between beer wood and Martians Road be changed to from a clip the road to a minor arterial roads or so it will have a increase in status and we've looked looked for that further we've decided that is appropriate considering the amount of subdivisions that are in their area especially that the Preston subdivision the increase in traffic in the area the future so we had made that change the first 10 run through these or if you want to come in and you go sure okay so the second change was a change to one of the definitions that was requested with the detonations chapter I was brought to you last month I was and that's the definition of accessibility which was only really used in the transport chapters let's while bringing it to you today there was Justin that the word acceptable and the word money be changed to reasonable and to cost so it will now read the ability all people including people with disabilities to reach a location or service within a reasonable amount of time cost and effort so we've made that change is for the last the comment to the last session or net alright so moving on to the third point we've had some further comments received in the last month since we last what the transfer chapter to you and based on those we've made some changes to the jitters and policies so that's on pages 34 of the big document here okay so you'll see an orange some of the changes we've made to realize night our values more than what we had realize them previously and we've also streamlined a lot of the objectives and policies so there's a lot more system and precise than what you saw back in April so but the same direction is the same as just a sort of words nothing to to make it more clear exactly what we were just two questions one is it can you just tell me what night are who manaphy noir values are what that actually means and practice and also in terms of the accessible car parks is there any way we can through this plan required him to be painted blue rather than yellow I know that that's one issue in the disability sector Veck as problematic that yellow ones tend to get ignored blue ones tend to get noticed I don't know whether we do that through here or some other mechanism so to question its monofin you at night ah who values what how does it relate to transport and second one can we make that really simple change from yellow to blue so the first question the manuf in with values so there will be a definition for for nighttime interfering with values that will it's been put into the destination chapter that were coming to you on Thursday it's also the values that are pronounced and the Erie management plan which we have to have regard to in the in the Resource Management Act and obviously we wouldn't want to list them all here that's a quite a large document can you put your microphone on you any please Akane what but you know someone getting apply for a resource consent what does this actually mean in terms of what we would what effect as we take into account so yeah so there is projecting their we management plans quite a large got two minutes for a lot of different policies so there are a number of different values you could include but what we've done on page sex and policy eight as we've listed to torino is nota who values more and that's around use of indigenous planting stormwater management and the protection of wiretapping and why utama so there's the three examples that people can use but the living management plan here it has a whole list of our values that that people can recognize and the second question yes we could consider that I'll have to check what the regulations are around that and whether it is appropriate to you on the district plan or whether it would appear to be a change to a boil or or maybe it's national stand additional regulation but we have got requirements for disabled car parks and how why they must be where we haven't gotten requirements about the color of them so oh I'm not sure which legislation requires a sitting teller or not but we might need to treat that just super the river with a net can be honest your plan or whether it's needs to be changed to some other building so you'll bring that back to us so you better thank you we get to with the whole integration of big community space sorry I'm commercials but we're commercial space becomes overwhelming that it starts to impact on the traffic network public transport active transport where do we kind of end up with with that yeah so that that's over by OC aids so it was good integrated transport systems which I've gotten point sex at the bottom the table so I can come to that when I talk about it yep okay okay we throw it with objectives and policies you know yeah in what the final push and I had then on on there as is there anything that recognizes that traffic lights are not not the solution like how do we deal with this issue of the current thinking that the only solution is a traffic light if you put a traffic light on so in terms of our objectives and policies is there anything there about doing some sort of assessment over you know the community of effects of the traffic network from a city point of view rather than just a very localized one on page three for example and under I talk about transport system that is accessible affordable resilient say stainable and efficient so under efficient with it let someone we can consider whether traffic lights in that situation what will be more cooking or not it's just that too seems to cancel that one out though yeah it's always going to be a balancing it and some cases of trypsin or may actually make the little bit more more efficient and sometimes doesn't work so it's probably under their catch my face to do we need like an objective that says you cannot have more than five sets of traffic lights within the kilometer or you know three within three blocks as too much or I mean is there do we need to be really blunt about this um well that's gonna be on a case-by-case basis it's do you understand that's the issue everything gets assisted by a case-by-case basis so if you go down lincoln road at the moment ask yourself are those traffic lights enhancing our traffic network probably not a number of places are good for the local development but they're really bad for our traffic network yeah so we have made it quite clear that there's this region knit river that's what they wrote eric is really about is the the key roads that we want to protect and lincoln road is what I want to go to a road so it's very much those quiroz we want to try and keep efficient as possible but we've always about balance how many people were trying to access a onto a road and how many people I going obviously a long road and through a road and whether the traffic signals give more benefit to the people coming onto the road there outweighs the the disc benefit to the people driven along the road so we've always want to balance that let up and it's going to depend on on how many people are accessing the road as to whether also I needed that case if we if we said no to Trevor tunnels what would happen is it should have of the road or the access points in a record of roundabout is a classic example yeah well you might have actually least development because the infrastructure the writing network can't actually cope with it like people could actually instead of making you know millions and millions of dollars off the development they might make a few million rather than 10 million because they do Alyssa sighs because the traffic infrastructure can't cope does anyone want to come in there because it just seems a I'm not sure how you define there or are you able to define that within the plane I think you through you mr. chair I think you'd be struggling to put something in there which is blunt as what the council is looking for which can seduce that you should have X number of traffic lights road there because what we're looking for is that the efficient for some of them like lincoln road is you're right we're looking for the efficient through movement of vehicles but something like traffic lights and specific locations might be the best approach that you could only say you have X number per kilometer or whatever else because that might actually be the best approach so I think that the issue is teased out when you look at the overall flavor of the objectives and policies which are thinking in terms of their the road hierarchy which sexy efficient through movement of vehicles and and that's where it needs to be decided at that sort of level but I think it would be problematic for us in terms of end council as the the road controlling authority if you had something which specifically stated X number per kilometer but he's on you can't abide us yes sirree saying we can't redefine any fear that was specified any further than what we have I don't_''_865.91 I don't think so not incorrect me Richard if I'm wrong but when they're looking at the efficiency and effectiveness of putting it another set of traffic lights and the cumulative effect of across that that road would be considered as a part of that equation yeah and that's that through these integrated transport assessments and I know that's a an issue David's going to get onto it the but it's all about not just looking at the development per se it's looking at the wider area and that's probably one of the things we haven't done that well in the past counselor as look at the wider area and the cumulative effects but that's the whole reason why we're trying to get ITA is introduced so we can do that really what I'm talking about is giving some giving sufficient weight to that community of effect yeah so that you can actually say to a development actually sorry the community of figures is too great so you have two down down sighs I think I think that the ITA is of the best tool and toolbox for doing it and this practice throughout the country that's what all Condor and Hamilton have introduced as for the New Zealand Transport Agency recommends us to put in and that's what we've developed guidelines for I think that's what to go do you want to move this next one I've got his university packing or do you want to move on what are you moving on to David and we were we can move on to the variance of assistance that's the top okay yep
These will expect a report big good right strategic outcomes the vision statement the vision thing you think you mad amir this has been a matter that's been talked about in relation to our collaborative visor e group people seeking to have something in the district plan which sort of sets out what the outcomes are going to be when the district plan is implemented here so what I've tried to do is give a bit of an introduction the year and three point three point one so this is a piece of paper that's got orange on and has heated up strategic outcomes for the district plan you can so in the introduction the tried to sort of set out the role of the district plan I can't do everything for all things sitting out the see you uncle my god it friday I'm going to how many people are missing it carry on okay the second part and three point three point two is just identifying the urban development strategy did have a vision for the greater Christchurch and that's it out before you before we've also set out in section 333 there are some community outcomes and just identifying that those perhaps a little bit older but the number of them are still relevant to what we're doing in terms of the district plan in three point three point four just sitting out that a lot of the things we're talking about in terms of what the district plans seeking to do are already in the strategic directions part of the district plan which is section 3.5 and basically saying those strategic direction sets out a number of requirements for the district plan they've got to either give effect or must not being consistent with other documents and I've listed a couple of those there being the recovery strategy the land use recovery plan central city plan and the regional policy statement so then leading from the sort of overview of where those various documents are seeking to direct Christchurch and the wider banks peninsula area I've been developed under section 335 what I've called some strategic outcomes which is about the form the's really the sort of thing that a district plan does is the land use tools I was telling you about what's the form how does it work and how does it set itself out what I've tried to do is just sit out some basic principles there and those are listed principle one is about the extent of the Christchurch City component of the district and those bits are that we're within defined urban edges and we're integrating into our new greenfield areas the second part the urban form basically setting out what the role of the central city is neighborhoods around suburban centres and a network of commercial and industrial areas third principle is the balance the district in terms of its urban form which is our rural and coastal settlements and basic setting out there that those to continue to function basically within their existing boundaries and for the purposes that they're carrying on at the moment next principle for is about housing and these will be very familiar to you coming out of the residential chapter about sufficient supply types and all of life higher density around some of our commercial centers and our new urban areas and traditional lower density residential in our suburban parts accessibility principle five this is coming out of the transport chapter that we've talked about some strategic corridors providing the gateway and linkages to some of our important of the structure particularly the port and the airport I'd suggest that that first sentence doesn't read particularly well and I'd like to have a crack at rewriting that a wee bit I think I have read it again and it doesn't make particular sense I'll come back to you with that also we've talked to you about that the transport network is integrated and we're looking at promoting active travel public transport so that's the other principle about accessibility principles six natural hazards coming out of our natural hazards chapter basically about development being in places where we can manage those risks from flooding tsunamis earthquakes and land movement principle seven is about equality environments and this goes back to looking at ensuring the places we build and their places where people are wishing to live and work on principle eight is about respect for the past and healthy environments this is probably going to come through to you in the next chapters which are about heritage and natural environment also a number of the general stands there are noise and various other amenity matters for those principles of the year about looking our to the natural and built environment and also looking at the role of no Tahu and recognizing that so they've those are the ones that I pulled out I'm not here to write a vision statement for you I've had a bit of a go at that but really that's something that comes a little bit more from the politicians rather than from staff so happy to take comments and amendments on that and Glenn he'll think you occasionally will hear the argument over housing affordability of building on the urban fringes including over the line having seen is now in capsulated as principal what in just giving you all of you what would that do you know a a plan if those even boundaries aren't so well defined well I think we've got very clear direction coming from the higher ordered option is particularly the regional policy statement number of clear things put your urban development within the boundaries very clear directions about no rule residential on the urban fringes of Christchurch City so I think we'd have some real difficulties if we wanted to move outside that specific direction and FL going to ask you under the principle accessibility and the promotion of active treble in public and public transport does that kind a lot that being a principle does that in fact give those forms of transport some sort of priority in planning or that they be as no essential components of any road no I don't know that it gives it a priority because the first part is making sure it's an integrated approach so I think you know always we're going to have that fundamental need for managing transport the park the private and the public transport what this is about the same we want to move in with the cycleway development of the city's putting forward and also the public transport infrastructure so it's not making one more importantly other indicating where you wish I could and because it's a principle though it would be fair to say that my tongue residents could expect those components to be the great thank you yes yonni yeah I'd really think I'm around the issue of help we need to have more attached about public health as well so things like determinated soils things like asbestos there's a whole bunch of stuff that they're post-earthquake has come up I just think that adds a bit more work around here and the health on it um I don't know from our workshop or a little retreat that we had whether you guys have seen what came out of that we have has they fit into this thinking at all no not at the stage I would I would be honest and we're actually having a meeting about that tomorrow women the SPG group and there is a distinction here I guess a district plan under the RMA versus under local government aid so no I wouldn't say that that has been included in here at this stage to what so what does this actually mean like if people go through trying get a resource consent and they've broken team roles but they come and read the strategic directors and say well you know providing housing high-density housing with and around a larger commercial center so your strategic objective is to do that so I should be given consent don't worry about the rule is that basically how this works you're correct that's one of the reasons why we haven't_''_617.18 from the staff point of view been actively promoting this vision the district plan the matters that you need to have regard to objectives policies and rules that those are the guts what the district plans about when once you get into things like vision statements and what have you you are dealing with matters were dishing out fundamentally required and a district plan and I mean it might like to comment on that but certainly and if they're good and clear then they won't move outside of those objectives and policies they'll focus on those that's a best that's the way stands that law they leave urgent statement as an objective that's not a policy so when someone applies for a resource and sent application under section 104 the RMA you have to think about he fix on the environment yet the have regard to objectives and policies of the plan you have to give effect to the regional policy statement you're allowed to have regard to other matters and so the vision statement stands as one of those other matters that they can send clarity as regards to but I wouldn't expect a commissioner or the court to put the weight on a vision statements that have would put on objectives and policies in the plan essentially yes that's right great as you might recall their overarching objectives and that chapter anyway strategic directions chapter they have far more weight than us they had wait this doesn't it wasn't this some what Sarah comments as well yeah whether there's a joint multi ministerial yes agency so given that why why wouldn't might why's there no enthusiasm from staff for this from a legal point of view Marla it does create some risk for the council and that if there's been detailed consideration of the objectives and policies has been the most appropriate way to get to to achieve the purpose of the RMA and then you have a vision statement that's kind of beside that if I can try and use the vision statement in the way sir undermine or change the reading or the interpretation of the some policies so it creates a from a legal point of view it creates a an unnecessary murkiness to the interpretation of the core objectives and policies in the plan Wow I mean it seems to me to be the opposite really against the re this is a risk of it kind of like not having a meeting which the council would like to have been like an example was this morning our environmental committee had some informational bit from industries and the chemicals that they're trying metal clean up if we would have incorporated ention of an industrious for example prevent you know to ensure that land remains clean and that polluters pay I feel like all clean it clean up after themselves should we not incorporate some of their concept and this is strategic outcome or could we not something like that even that might be an example well I would look if I take your point totally that it would be good to have the Council wishes to incorporate something like that in the district flare and the question for you is we do you want to put it do you want to put it in a vision statement or do you want to put it in the strategic directions chatter which is supposed to get that overarching kind of version for the way the plan operates or what do you want to put it in another chapter that deals with natural has a second have an agency I would like something that speaks to ordinary people and I think having a bunch of principles saying would be far more readable and accessible to them and as you say the court might have regard to it but it won't be ultimately guide about pulling oh but perhaps as an example counselor you know that the hazardous substance contaminated land you go to objective 366 which is about amenity health and safety and be there is the protection of people in the environment from the adverse effects of contaminated and hazardous substances you know it's there already in the strategic directions and we'll get reinforced in the contaminated land hazardous substance chapter so from our point of view we we don't see the vision is actually adding any more than what's already in there and the plan yep because I were just so agree with them lens point that in fact some of these things which you know we we want to be proactive earn and effective on that have it having them clear among you know along side our strategic outcome I think would be useful for people to read it also means that we mean business rather than having it it's as long as we could do that legally hmm yes there isn't there none of these principles deal with their a show of contaminant know so that's 1 I've taken that you want added in yeah yeah um I just think you need to listen really clear feet of what stuff or say which is the risk for our community is that we have a set of strategic outcomes that have not objectives that the legal people and the experts of the people that were breach our rules breach our policies breach a strategic directions will then argue for as excuse to get around what they need to do and I think what you need to understand was actually power the problem with the previous rules and objectives and policies that are so wide that basically like how long is a piece of string you have these ridiculous arguments and the resource consenting phase which mean it's really hard for the community to actually ever challenge some of the rationale behind things because you know depending on what part of the district plan you I to me that I kind of hear the staff saying well there's a real risk that the you know the Lisa definition you have around what you're trying to achieve and abroad since the greater the risk that people can argue to get adverse outcomes that you might not actually want to you better to have more Tyler definitions so that people have that certainty and I for one Yanni don't want to add any legal liability to us as a council so if it's not there's no way of doing that Chris we can't but I just want a good staff might be able to I don't know if I might just add to that madam chair one of these sort of underpinning guiding principles that we've had to this whole district plan review the approach is to create a more slim line document so under the Act there there is a section that outlines what must go on a district plan and that is only objectives policies and rules and then there's a whole screed of other things which are currently an hour protect plan and in many other plans which adds to the bulk and the excess material that needs to be read I guess to understand the objectives and policies we've tried to get right away from that slimline it right down and have the beer objectives and policies and rules there and nothing else that could create interpretational complexities that that may not be necessary you rely on the section 32 for that so the slimline factor and the certainty factor are two of the reasons why whoa you know we hadn't considered having a vision in there and we are promoting this on the basis that it's been requested tell me why they requested it well you had a discussion with them I can't remember I had a piece of paper that used to tell me all the reasons why they put up but I've haven't_''_1122.22 brought it down here so just remind me why did they want this and here they I suppose one of the reasons was they because we're doing this perhaps in two outcome or the shape of the city was looking to be mmm so they were looking for a statement which sort of see is from a land use point of view what's the city going to look like rather than having to read all the various chapters to form their bed overall view so that was really the base of sport we would sort of say you know the zoning maps give you a very clear indication of what the shape of the city is going to be we've defined this commercial centers the suburban centers we've shown the industrial areas we've identified those areas we are looking to intensify residential so the text of the plan along with the map section to me and I'm sorry I'm a planner and being involved in it all the way through is the shape and what the form and function of the city looks like it's very clear we've got a rolling hierarchy which sets out the strategic transport routes so all of those things are very clearly set out we've identified all with the policy about hazards indicates where we're looking to not encourage development so that to me that's all there it's in the plan but what was looked for something like a one-pager yeah this is what it is yeah we Adam sure if I can also just add to that can't we just brighten a statement that says this doesn't this isn't this is you know actually read as part of you know I mean well it worthy Wieters as part of having any actual legal effect but yes we can write that kind of rejoinder own why not just establish it I mean rather than rather than verse I mean I always imagined that we would have a set of principles that is that's the Overlook overarching glue its what binds the document together but it's a simple summary of what it is that we're trying to achieve and I know I would say that there'd already is there in the strategic directions chapter which is not a long chapter it's a chaser I mean in a principles whether whether one or two edit but but essentially a clear statement of Wonders we're trying to achieve we're saying we want well to find urban egypt itches I think that I'm inside these principles I know that you've taken them from some of them come from the loop and I I think that Sam yeah but well this is why we have brought this to you in a sense it's almost like an executive summary document and it is written for people who don't want to read the rest of the plan what I would hate people to think as they can read this and think that it's going to give them everything they need to know because it's illegal to what you might be okay I mean seriously I mean no one would would think that that read the rules that they were required to do to me you might you might be right we've got it for you for your for your consideration well maybe maybe if it is if it's our vision statement we should another ever have a go what we're trying to achieve I mean I actually think that is worthwhile having something that introduces the plan in a way that describes what the plan contains but doesn't add to the plan anything by way of you know a guidance tool I mean I remember the recovery strategy the greater Christchurch recovery strategy that it's has two no three introductory chapters but states at the end of chapter three that it has only chapters four till eight or whatever others that are the recovery strategy under the legislation so I mean there must be a method of I mean I mean I just call the whole thing with just the introduction and don't even call it well indeed there is an introductory we call them chapters but there is an introductory section to the plan which is for information only which holds no rules within it potentially this vision could go into that part that makes more sense to me yeah because then it addresses the concern that you're raising your legitimately raising that's obscene because you so I do get and I've never the planner so and I but I do like max because I'm its kind of visual there as well so but what I'm worried about is is that and and and being right well risk averse and that regard about the potential legal consequences we may miss the opportunity to make what is a planning tool for professionals impenetrable for the ordinary resident of the city who actually might quite like to know what principles of God of the development of the clan given their what you've just said that it could go into the introductory chapter for want of a better word do you switch to take the self line in to talk further about it yeah I care because we're get will get the wording and play around with it right but yeah can I make a suggestion by way of process for that please the legal risk is as avoided the work was put down for the principles where is the key objectives and the plan okay efforts efforts the same objectives threaten of a way the other that reduces that risk of someone using the vision statement and a way to expand the objectives of the roster so so so perhaps abscess we're able to come up with what the draft of what they see is the key those key strategic objectives pulled out of the play and then if the council and seen those think that will hold it it's not doing geeks or why yep then that's the problem not only with the vision statement it's a problem with the plan yeah that's right okay so it would would would start be able to pull together the sort of thinking of each of the objectives is under each of the chapter absolutely as points of principle and then that will identify if there are gaps or in fact if we've got the wording of the plane ride it solutely and we'll try and get that done within the next 24 hours so that we can actually bring it to you but we'll just indeed I don't know if you wanted to have the deal with it
Welcome to the workshop district plan review continued I have to give an apology for my departure from this meeting early and so we're going to deal with the strategic directions and vision statement the two of those the strategic directions changes to the chapter three and the vision statement chapter 3 we're going to deal with that first and then counselor clearwater will take over to cheer the transport chapter and the bernoulli depart he has Reeve so r 3 30 and David Lee David East will take over from there for as long as we need to go I thought we had a briefing up to 30 with Sarah over the red zone hey yeah but the problem was that nobody told us that it was going back to the district plan review when the residential red zone briefing got keen so yeah I think that the system operated automatically but nobody communicated so as a result I sort of said well how come we've got the district plan review back and our Diaries now that the residential red zone meeting got can and so's as it is we've got afternoon tea available at three o'clock but it may not take until five o'clock for us to complete all of these it may not although I know that you haven't yet been through the subdivision development chapter so that's your first and site and dollar the you know the final draft you might say okay all right so um so if we would you like to start with B thank you madam chair and just just in front of you just for your benefit you've been handed a hard copy of this because just before everybody arrived the length and the projector blow up so we can't predict onto the large screen there although I know that the mayor and I headed in front of us what we will be looking at is exactly is what you will have on this run sheet that's just been given a copy to you and without going through it all been I just take you to page to the top of page two that will give you an understanding can hand over to Peter Eamon then to go into the revisions that came out of the workshop that we had with you and April on the strategic directions chapter and then we'll move to Ellen person on the actual proposed vision statement for the district plan to go into their strategic directions chapter eater so I'll start off and probably easiest to refer to this landscape summary sheet of the changes that are proposed in respect of the strategic directions chapter so has everybody got a copy of it the kind of familiar question that I asked every time we sit around this table to do this do we still have any certainty around what the key dates are and do we have an agreed process we don't yet have a signed off process notes so what's the I guess what I'd really love to know is what what is the deadline for getting in a great sign off so that we know that the work that we're doing is you know unlike the central city plan which jamie and I spent a all this time doing something but government just came in and took away from us anyway so I'm just becoming increasingly concerned that we still have no clarity or certainty over some of the key assumptions behind this process so what like can we give government a time frame or is it as it up to us or we're the ones who've asked the government to provide us with a process to implement our district plan review and a fast-track basis otherwise it will take years and years and years to do so so we're committed to that they have I have written to the minister the relevant minister has not the minister firth quite recovery in this instance but the Minister for the environment in order to seek some changes to the government's position and to extend the date for reporting but I've not yet heard back versity operate to give and pay for but next week we sign off the full plan and we give it to the minister yes although I understand that's yet to be confirmed this work that has to be done with garden is a process is used so it's just that but when we did the industrial chapter or not you know s you run Wolfson for example if we had more time we would do a different planning mechanism because we would actually look at a holistic plan rather than just doing a chapter-by-chapter plan as expressed last week we don't actually have more time because we're going on to the 13 chapters that still have to be written and developed for the district plan review post the district plan review in 2016 or sometime thereafter there is time to undertake a more detailed and urban renewal type process around the whole woolston area but not as a part of this district plan review far away okay so I'll just quickly just go through that table starting off with the first one relating to natural hazards and just fine up on the comic made at the previous workshop which was essentially to move the natural hazards objective which if you look at the pages on titled that look like this entitled everybody got a copy of the fence anybody need a copy because we do next is okay we're just turning to them the very last page of that which is at the bottom right hand corner sees page 21 or 29 which sets off with objective 3.6 point to development form and function and you'll see some changes there in purple so you'll see at a support too we've moved natural hazards up in terms of the listing sequence and we've also incorporated the wording more closely to what and the Resource Management Act using the words avoid remedy and mitigate so then the people were generally happy with it I think that's good okay moving on to the second issue which was in relation to urban design and the need to just clarify that all that design quality was important throughout the city but that issues the relevant issues with differ for different areas depending on the environment and the function of those areas so that amendment has been made and that can be seen on the first and second of these sheets a page 9 29 so you can see in three point four point three subsection B the purple wording at the bottom of be there don't have people waiting on the copy that I have I don't know if others due east mine's got people wearing on at you maybe maybe but you printed it out on us I is continues on to page nine okay moving then on to a couple of issues that have come up from further consultation responses that we've received both in respect of or both seeking greater recognition of strategic infrastructure the first were seeking a number of amendments in relation to giving that greater recognition but particularly you wanting it and respect of electricity transmission at the electricity transmission network amendments are proposed to reflect that but within the wider term of strategic infrastructure because the issues that they were raising in terms of the electricity transmission network where is equally relevant to other strategic infrastructure and likewise the last one the year which relates to recognizing the regional and national significance of some structure again although there's it was thought it's considered that it's worth adding an amendment to emphasize the importance of strategic infrastructure in particular so those changes if I just take you through the in though physical exciting with clause three point four point four point three which is the third one on your block which is a tip page 10 of 29 see three point four point four point three a and you can see put some additional purple wording and they're reading including strategic infrastructure of local regional and national significance and also in terms of the directions you look at the next page which is eighteen or twenty nine in clause three point five point four point three both in a your similar wording they're recognizing importance of strategic infrastructure and then also mb just adding in the national policy statement on electricity transmission to make sure we've captured that national policy statement and then the final one and this will have been attached to the summary sheet which is a another copy of object of three point six point two and it will just be a paper clip to the summary but it's still got the the purple amendment that we made in relation to natural hazards but then down in six it's again adds particularly strategic infrastructure to give emphasis to that because they need the policies that follow on from the subjective give greater protection for strategic infrastructure theme and structure generally no there's actually a definition of strategic infrastructure and it lists exactly what those pieces of infrastructure which is one of the reasons we didn't really want to get to the point of putting in electrical infrastructure because we've had from every every single infrastructure provider I think has seceded specify our infrastructure and we thought a much easier way is to talk about it as the strategic infrastructure and we've got a definition of what their strategic infrastructure is so that's all the amendments and I'll leave the vision to ellen he pulled it all together while I was away I unfortunately have a meeting with my insurance company about the rebuild of my house in about ten minutes and why is it's Reyes is at least they're talking to me so that he stays right
Sorry ended today all right no jaani it was sorry well I had concerns because but I do think you need one of the lessons from the old plane is that be 3d and the buffer zones weren't actually adequate at all so you get a lot of activity happening right up against people's Vince's 20 meters doesn't sound like very much doesn't sound like very much when you're talking about big huge buildings going out I I do I do wonder if you're trying to get some of those cycling and pedestrian and greenfield amenity that firstly made it seems pretty reasonable otherwise I don't see you get it so and I'm concerned that also that we went out with 50 and now we're coming better from it that the the risk that difficulty we've got is that we're talking about size of wearers of land whilst these green fairies our lives there's a need to provide for the use of that land and a 15 metre deep buffer is significant in my mind's and the proposed plan of 6 meters between buildings and other zones and we can achieve adequate protection of those properties through a range of rules not just setbacks and to have a 15 metre setback as in my mind crude because it doesn't necessarily address the issues it's more than just visual effects and you can control noise for standards and the plan maximum you know as always well I appreciate what you're saying what we know unfortunately is that the monitoring of conditions of consents enforcement of things that were supposed to be done and follow-up of things like odor air pollution in reality it's it's not a very effective method so you know if you look in philipstown if you look and more Stern if you do what you see is this kind of constant cycle of compliance and it just seems to me if we can't learn from that and say actually having a adequate buffer actually reduces the opportunity for those issues to arise I would feel more comfortable and I think I mean what's the total lameness in area is 170 here to 17 hectares bups so out of 170 if you had a 50 minute buffer how much would that take up I don't have the patience but I mean that is not just about the circumstance the risk is that we set up we have to manage a consistent apply a consistent approach across greenfield areas and for instance in north Belfast we've consulted with the community and got feedback that something that 15 metres is as acceptable from their perspective the Commodore hotel for instance source a 20-metre setback and to impose a 50 metre setback creates a risk of other resident people having the expectation that where wherever there's industry there's going to be a 50 metre setback and on smaller sites that will create issues and this is a big industrial basic step but it's time it's not all on the same ownership and say effectively one land in the southwest area there's multiple landowners whereas the north side of the block there's one landowner and so 15 metres might be the entire depth of but they can't because of the setback so I need to manage amenity effects it has and the issues as you've explained them councillor are ones of enforcement and monitoring but if that's the case and that's where the issues need to be resolved it's not a reason to unnecessarily put in a buffer that's 15 metres wide especially when they issues that we're discussing like the amenity issues noise any kind of obnoxious dust or what have you can be dealt with through other rules that they don't get dolls which is the problem which is that is the problem that's not a district plan problem that is a monitoring and enforcement issue that then we as an organization leetle okay actually a design that part of it as a zoning issue well so inadequate buffer has lead to issues I I mean I don't know how others feel but you know I I guess his concerns here around things like stormwater the cycleways what I can't understand is if you've got a new development why wouldn than us go through and put it on the road when we had land that was being resigned why not just add that land and at the same time on the cycle way that that's a some planning that's been done anyway by our asset never planning I know but it would seems to me that the better opportunity the more sensible thing is rather than us go through a huge process to acquire land to spend a lot of money is actually when people get the huge financial gain from getting the rezoning that they actually put back some of the infrastructure that we think a modern city should f which is cycleways adequate stormwater exeter XP I can liaise with colleagues about that cycle version and and address that issue but just going back to the setback there's a range of rules that address the effects of industry close to residential there's recession planes which are intended to limit shading of properties as landscaping which is to address the visual impacts of and the challenge the difficulty is with setbacks is that they tend the risk of that setback becoming almost a lesser quality than what would I've always take place because we can't impose the landscape and requirements above across the entire 50 meter setback which comes at a bar there's a significant costs costs with that but it's also efficient and so the point though is that there are some existing residents they aren't there the the 50 meters setback that was put forward was only for one property which is present within the industrial zone so this episode does a residents and as a house was in this and obviously they feel not pleased about the fact that this is all becoming industrial is there any other way of mitigating the impact Don him short of a 50 meter sit back we can have a reduced sit back but have potentially denser landscaping required to retain that's here's that would be cool if you could plant about 50 or 60 fruit trees that would be exact I guess the issue too is that an end I have no idea what the what the future this person for instance chose to sell on the basis of being at being his own business industrial then you would end up with a 50 meter setback for no reason at all it was it was proposed by the landowner and was to be honest the draft that went out there was an error what it was intended to be reduced in the consultation version that we put out for public feedback just touching on a wall still an industrial area map 6 can you can I just confirm who hasn't got the map instead of map hiking just briefly there's been feedback about the future boundaries of industrial zones and walston and on this map there's marks the tennery jelita skeller up sites and we're proposing to shift the boundary between the general and the heavy industrial zone so effectively increasing the size of the industrial general zone to include the skeller up site which is previously been heavy industrial by resigning it as an industrial general zone it does provide greater scope for trade suppliers in the ad Bates retailing and other uses that provides greatest greater flexibility to ensure reuse of that land because otherwise the risk that it remains and remains vacant and derelict so we're providing greater flexibility and parts of woolston but still protecting the industry that does remain there by retaining a heavy industrial zone looking and doing and Mostyn and how they wanted to change the entire area around to reflect the history of that area at which I thought was stunning is that going to be allowed and this because if somebody's got all the energy in the world and the desire to transform the area around the tannery I would love them to do that there's a provision made in the chapter to consider where a sites unsuitable for industry in the future set of criteria to consider the appropriateness of mixed-use or residential where our sites not going to lead to reverse since the sensitivity affects on existing or future industry in the area so we can consider on a case-by-case basis suitable brownfield sites but also and the second phase were going about identifying suitable brownfield sites from xu's retain areas for industry to recognize that there is still a lot of existing industry in those locations and we need to enable them to continue showed us what he wanted to have happen around the tannery I thought it was stunning and I think most other people did too and have made what wasn't one of the most desirable areas of Christchurch at the moment and to arguably one of the most interesting I would love for that to be able to happen if somebody's got the energy and drive to be able to do that I don't want the council standing in the way so what I want to know is when he comes back for stage 2 of the tannery continued can he do that I haven't seen their proposals for around the tannery but can I can I admit them cheer though that this is an industrial area in the proposed planners is proposing to maintain it as an industrial area albeit change where heavy industry can go veces general industry and there are a lot of existing factories manufacturing units there areas and I don't think it's appropriate to simply change the zoning on the basis what the tannery wants to do what Mark has said is there are rules that for allow us to look at a site-by-site proposal on the basis of what they're proposing and amongst that industrial zoning but at the moment what the proposed plan is doing is maintaining the area as it is I do want to enable the tannery to do what they want to do so that's why I'm being pedantic about this Andrew and just to add to that certainly the comments that mark made around sensitivities and in particular reverse sensitivities when we consider the proximity of for example jelita to that site it sounds as though the plan that Vicky just described maybe wouldn't find it as easy to go through that process as we might hope because of the reverse sensitivities particularly around that heavy industrial use putting aside jelita who have non-compliances with their consents they there is a wider view from industry other than jelita and that's represented by the that the area should be protected for those industrial companies that still operate in the area so it's a real issue putting aside chulita for a moment that those industries are concerned about it won't be useful for us also to see what the tannery are considering for stage 2 we have net been shot would it be if those guys come and see you go you and actually explain what they want to do because you're probably going to love it and look at before we adopt this part whether it's possible to actually put a little bit around the area so that they can do it they appreciate that they're an industrial zone but but it is a very different concept that I think people in Christchurch would love and I don't want us through our district plan to prohibit it very gay to me within we need to know what it is they're proposing because they haven't been to speak to us so that would be useful but yeah we would need to look at what it is they or against them okay I would like us to do that before we adopt that component if that's possible sorry yonni then Pauline but there's a lot of uncertainty in Boston at the moment you've got independent fisheries with their issues you've got the skill of sight that's being vacated you've got the tannery and you've got some of the other industry you've also got a lot of mixed-use residential on here as well which I just be really interested in understanding what IG or I H provides in terms of residential does it allow it to what level how have you looked at what's happened over time in this area to influence the zoning that you've put in place the the residential that's gone in two parts of woolston has been understand the proposals have been full of working and it's so there's a work component to those units downstairs generally speaking with the residential above and the rules at the moment is allow for custodial or a residential associated with custodial security purposes and that come forward and been developed for those live work units we're proposing that any future residential developments in industrial zones is assist on a case-by-case basis as a discretionary activity there are some brownfield sites that are no longer appropriate for for industry which will consider on the merits for residential or mixed-use but we don't want to run the risk of allow for messing residential and industrial zones if it's going to potentially erode the environment around our cause issues with the users around it so for instance there's abrasive blasting businesses and walston and if we were to permit residential there's a risk of residential go next to this business complaining about the business and the business has to move or if it's a small business consider where they whether they can continue so what I wanted from the start and I don't know if we can do this but I'd love us to do we need to do some kind of planning exercise in woolston because there's just a myriad of issues a myriad of uncertainty and actually sense of what is different post-earthquake what is different you know a hundred years on in the world that we live in in terms of environmental outcomes in terms of the cycleway access there's a number of issues in here that you know I just don't think a blunt it you know its industrial act or industrial G or really really kind of catches it yeah there is and this has been raised before also by the mere the need for what we might call I don't like to see I don't really like using master planning but a renewal urban renewal type exercise happening over this area but this also needs to be weighed up with the issue that was raised previously about having all industry moving out to the west and there are people who work in this area and these factories and businesses that are located in the east so you know there are all sorts of issues here about weighing up we should have industrial you know how I want people travel to get to the workplace and vs simply taking away and not just by the tannery but by other other organizations so there is a there is a bigger planning issue to be done here however it can't_''_1048.22 be done within the timeframe that I understand that we have yet to finish this district plan review and it's a more detailed as you as you described a far more detailed intricate planning exercise that needs to be done which is outside of the district plan review as such at the moment anyway I can't see that that can be done without other things falling off falling off the router from now and the what happens as a result can I suggest that are you okay if you meet with the castles yes we will do our best to meet yeah if they're available use and come back to us on the tannery component at least it's actually not about putting residential or anything in there it's bless you it's just about our bridges and maybe tourism and things would work in a heavy industrial area certainly we're happy to make the time just add that in my understanding was that it was particularly in relation to that area around with Henry is now in the river but and what they're really asking for to was enforcement or of for example the pollute the pollution issues for Julia and things like that weren't asking for a big change in the whole understand industry across the area and I guess we have noted that part of the bow likes Keller others cut currently empty that's right in the jelita and forth she's lie with a cane thank you um year following on from yonni in phila phone it's got such a lot of special features in here and one of its the historical nature which we would like to see protected and the other one is the river and looking at the map I just want to keep going is there any seat backs from the river for landowners order the landowners own right up to the river and whose responsibility is the river in how much can people perhaps like the Cassell's do that's a good phase of the chapters we will be looking at that I believe there is some set back now and the operative plan and I'm sure that will continue there's um historico the potential is building is closed or right up to the river but there's provisions in the subdivision chapter which could things we deal with estimated reserves it's just coming to you shortly it might give us a tool to it to protect it might if it's in the subdivision chapter now the subdivision chapter is split into two phases unfortunately because of the two phases of various chip types that we have going through so yes sorry I just say to that some of us are not necessarily royalists would like preps the Queen's chained to the trek into the city yes why this one was sort of eating too and part of the Cassell's version was using the river and maybe reinstating these boat rides back down to the easter and god we wouldn't want to be like to facilitate that and so there is private ownership of course from a moment well useful we need to meet with him to understand what the proposal is they haven't been to see us should be a cap large rule around all our rivers because they're all our treasures you know and we want to party I agree and that would be down and use them as an acid in
Just briefly on tapes which on the summary of feedback that starts on page five and reared text we discussed previously on the seventeenth of April the provision made for officers and the take campus and we've proposed rather than a percentage of the total floor space a figure of how much floor space could occur in the zone we had a meeting with Tate and the one of the issues with prescribing a percentages if there's no floor space there at the moment then what's the percentage of and so it's making it an absolute figure I should point out though there's three industrial park zones proposed there's tapes there's the mail site and there's our tier which is off one was road and the difficulty we've got is drawing a distinction between why one of those zones should have provision for office some office space and others shouldn't so we have applied that same provision to the other industrial park zones yeah at council led a plan change and number of years ago which resigned land for housing also zoned land fur industry and there's in the provisions essentially one of the last sub zones and the chapter there's specific provisions to and a number of outline development plans to ensure that interface between residential one industry is protected so industrial office basically we've deliberately put a cap on that a quantum of office floor space that I've become a mixed zone they are still primarily for industrial use but it's recognizing that the industrial park zone as opposed to a heavy industrial zone does have a stronger element above us and there's potentially a bless of a firm line between white and industrial users and what an office uses and how do you distinguish so for example if you're an office doing cad or something how do you distinguish between that and an office with people are using their computers for different things it's an assessment on a case-by-case basis these are quite tricky actually isn't it this will be a rule that will be open to scrutiny I think when it goes to the Hearing Panel given about industrial industrial zones being used primarily for industrial so or just have to see how this goes it's industrial Harris that classified I cuz if definitions to hand but I can return to that I just looking at the Christchurch industry and how much of IT is coming out of Christchurch industry here is probably not manufacturing as we used to know it and like that's probably a relatively small percentage isn't we're just looking at the definition for you okay I'm just sorry just to recall though that as a sit in the past the industrial land has been used a lot more openly in far less restrictive leaf or uses other than industrial land and so of course there is a reaction to trying to tighten this down just for industrial activities the definition of industrial and the regional policy statement is that it means the manufacturing assembly packaging wholesaling of storage of products or the processing of raw materials or other ancillary activities from memory our definition in the proposed plan is broader than that and in my mind would capture for the loss of ICT called high technology industrial activity which does catch other at least the computer side of the high tech business but is still Gordon an industrial activity and Tate used to have more of a manufacturing side to it of course you know which would have fitted this industrial definition however it's chosen it's changed its direct I guess output so just to clarify in the industrial park zones high technology industrial activity is permitted and I can supply the definition of that two separately just the question to you guys is our definition of industrial still appropriate I'll bring it to the table but is it is broader than traditional manufacturing for instance with unclear has been close attention to making sure that the definitions use mixed are appropriate for the way we we intend that to him to be used for the zone so so the planners are proposing to set up an office parks only you can't set up Papa's park yeah I think I mean the fact that Tate's recently made some changes within its own we were talking about previously but this whole sector is changing all the time and so to allow for some I guess what we'd call traditional office actually just takes into account that there may be colocation businesses that want to be around this space and it may kind of be office see but they might be high-tech at the same time so that whole sectors quite sort of changeable so it's quite difficult to be prescriptive so and I think this is a good good solution I think um nobody will deny what you're saying but I do need to bring us back to the loop where it talks about industry and if I can just find the page not yet this somewhere it talks about industry in industrial industrial end not being used for higher purposes or higher value purposes so office land for example and that's where we have to be very careful or could draw submissions from various parties about this type of rule it's um it also shows how difficult it is these days to be prescriptive in a more that's right I tech wise and now it's all starting to break down that the challenge for us is we need to draw a line otherwise if that line is not drawn then there'll be others take advantage of their line and that's right or the absence of a lion and will potentially develop land that's intended for industry for non industries so for instance tight or high-tech industries perhaps do go into office areas rather than industrial areas in the future sorry what was the example feature through 3d printing some product am I in high tech or an industry you're manufacturing products so you're potentially in the industrial definition is it click well there is a home and enterprise rules in the residential chapter it's a matter of scale here this is a matter of scale more than anything but how about a healthy product they belong to industrial for instance that placenta is kind of biochemistry here here's the ESD protected this for athletes camano healthy ghostly product more than more popularly in New Zealand made then exported whether is the belong to LA in touch with us wrong oh it's a city manufacturing still in the budget yes can locate on the industrial you want to know whether have a separate shall we move on south lisa warn be right just just so you're aware in terms of that where we're going I'm just taking you through some of the area specific issues and then I'll come back to the issue of offices and retail and industrial zones and and touch on the generic issues that came through and just on on the next slide pages six to eight of the summary of feedback relates to an area that we're proposing to rezone called Southwest hornby I mean if you look at map free of your package of maps map free is a large area 170 hectares of proposed and industrial land and in the it's got frontage to myself road and then the y'all got there in the in the top left towards the top left corner there's a small area as part of what's Templeton on the original outline development plan that we went out for public consultation it showed them this main spine road running through the industrial area and then continuing up through the residential area where that dashed line is drawn and we've removed that dashed line from the ODP on the basis that doesn't need if if there's any future spine road connecting with main self road to provide access for this industrial area to the state highway there'll be a need to if it were to go through that log it would need to be designators and the be a need to consider alternatives to that so to address the concerns that have come through from feedback from residents in that area with effectively deferred consideration of where that route goes and meets main sorrows after the water loop and archaea park and safety no the water lip industrial park is on the north side of the railway line and state highway so that's on this edge of the mat I've only yeah part of it just touching on another area specific issue if it's a future industrial area that's proposed for resigning through the industrial chapter this is 100 hectares and is bought it you might excuse me it's bordered to the west by main North Road state highway 1 and this site there was feedback about providing this outline development plan shows a spine road which runs right through the ODP area from Maine's North Road and the north to get down to Belfast road on the south and this land is effectively to the north into the east of the existing civils and farms freezing works in Belfast and there's been feedback that is sought a link a link road that runs between main north road and the spine Road as a secondary point of access and we've not included their access road on the ODP deliberately book to address that feedback because there's not been evident we haven't had sufficient information to demonstrate that the effects on the state highway of another intersection won't affect its function or the safety or efficiency of that state highway so we haven't added the area that's got the red lines through it on that plan simple there's a landowner there who sought residential zoning of the land but this is a greenfield business area and part of their concern relates to the extent of the setback that's required from residential properties to the south and that setback because it's 15 metres it does take remove potentially a significant area of land but that setback has to be at some point in the ODP area so we're proposing to retain that Landers and industrial zone twist one and sams road sort of area what what sort of soil type is there at the moment whatever so what's oil is that is it good for grown or is that not I understand that storm water can be discharged to ground through infiltration subjects treatments but I couldn't tell you the soil type off answer but and just geographically looking at the number of new business paths and the amount of industry in the southwest particularly around this area which we've got the new Waterloo subdivision of the aren't all coming from the east to work in the West or from the north to work in the West sort of thing have we actually look populated the southwest with industry basically this area and the other areas in the southwest came about through much earlier work then proposed change one the council had developed a southwest area plan over a period of ten years and that identified future growth areas not just for business but for housing and with the sheer growth and population in the southwest then there's going to be obviously demand for business as well and it appears that there has been some business relocation from the east so skeller for instance has gone to work room and this land that's been developed by quarter stuart there's significant demand for land in this area so we need to ensure that there's adequate land that's suitable on suitable grounds and greenfield areas such as this close to the southern motorway stage two as proposed or near the existing southern motorway and so they do have strategic benefits there's a looking to retain existing industrial areas and the east such as Wilson and Bromley to recognize their base all have a role for industry but you're right there's a metre sure there's business close to where people live and and the southwest with the significant growth of population we think they're still going to be that's for some shorter a short commute because of their proximity to these areas like geographic spread of industry or anything we really concept with it these are these areas reflect the language recovery plan and pcc one before that which identify these areas as green filter is and generally speaking those growth areas of the southwest and the north around belfast the same for residential the Northwest's as we've talked about has more constraints them that east obviously is built up so at some or not built up at the moment so in this one likewise good off-road cycle Road route says a requirement we can review the provisions around that but this is close to the area that I commented on the earlier which there's Wadi drive which is currently under development at the moment sleepy head of a factory being built there and it's that area that there was a rule requiring a cycle way through the landscaped area but because council's planning a cycleway on marshes road on the south side it doesn't necessitate a cycle way that runs parallel to that on a short distance away um madam to peps if I can just respond to your question about the distribution of industrial years it's a good question and you'll be aware that some of the factories to the in the eastern areas have been badly damaged destroyed or even demolished some of the areas in the yeast but and I noticed that most of you don't have your meps with you today but there are still small areas for industrial land greater and signum area there are some still and woolston and there are some and bromley so if you like we can give you a large map of the city so so so there is still some distribution there however some of that land this like these road around here are terrifying for cyclists to go on literally terrifying actually they're quite terrifying for cars unless you're a buggy be truck it's quite scary out this way so I'm just really keen that that that we actually make sure that unless there's a cycleway sort of you know 10 metres way or something that we actually do ensure that cycleways and walking exits is there like it's really important I think that we actually integrate these with the neighborhoods around them they've tended to be quite exclusionary and the way that they look and the big heavy roads of huge trucks around them and I'm sure that's what the others would like for the Belfast area as well in relation to Southwest hornby and your point 6.2 on the comments on page six you may or may not be aware we had a number of submissions to the annual plan process on exactly that issue and we heard from a number of residents of Foreman's road in particular who came to speak to their we be assured that you'll be taking that information into account as part of your considerations as well even though it didn't come in as part of the comments on the district plan process because there were some of those submissions that perhaps would have in fact been more appropriate to have been put into this process than into the annual plan process as the unit manager planning a number of annual plane submissions were sent to me that we're directly related to the district plan review and we're really relevant to the annual planners such and and so yes I am very aware of those submissions I've read them and you're sweet we are with them regarding to the Maple Street location why is on page six the Southwest for home be okay to say word regarding to a six-point are the five the identification stone water facility on the OTP is not necessary as we tension infiltration base are not proposal I can understand what's the region there and also this one is is also in a Sir James the way issues and issue can you explain to us yeah the summer proposals for this block and for the neighboring block rather than the traditional approach which we often see in Greenfield areas of a large pounded area and we have some water is treated there's also the ability to manage stormwater from each individual size and for the stormwater infrastructure to remain as the privates assets within these areas and that's what the owners of developers of this blocker proposing at the stage to have individual treatment and infiltration of that storm water from each individual property and the road environments as well so effectively it removes the need for a large pondered areas that you traditionally see Sir number of sorry yonni I've had a number of emails from people in masks road you've gone from 50 meters to 20 meters there's the setback adjoining marshes road along here it's a being reduced from 40 metres down to 20 meters 50 to 20 4220 sorry I'm readings I'm so sorry at 6.8 there's a there's a residential property within of properties along Bieber the resident there has some sort of 50 meter sit back and 15 meters setback from those boundaries is a significant area and applying a consistent approach to setbacks from between industrial zones and residential zones we've proposed some consistency there so 20 meters is considered to provide that adequate buffer as opposed to 50 which would be a sizable area of land and would sterilize that it's 50 meters deep so at multiply that by the length and it's a sizeable area so it's a felt that a buffer and other controls such as recession plains to avoid shading and also use of that space for landscaping can of what impacts on that resident
Catchment which there's being consent granted from the Regional Council for there's been a lot of clowning done around Greenfield areas and ensuring that there's storm water facilities for detention treatments and drainage of stormwater from those green filter areas so and respect to Greenfield areas stormwater in my view is being well-managed it's really the existing urban areas where there's a need to retrofit some of that with stormwater management and so as part of some of those Greenfield areas there's what's called retrofitting wheres instance and workroom there's runoff from existing urban areas which goes into the same basins that the Greenfield subdivision drains into because those facilities have been designed not just for the new subdivision but some of the existing so I understand this purple work to be done on the Haven catchment which the site fits in but it's a similar principles there was a very clear request to from Council the other way that in fact the downstream effects from any developments that they'd be checked out thank you I just clarifies is there the second phase of the DPR likely eight the area 3 I'm not a hundred percent convinced everyone's actually agreed or understands what we've agreed to he's my question would be what by deferring it there's obviously additional time but with we're in a comfortable position from a technical perspective that's what what more could be I'm telling that time when we do have it for example with area through we have specific work with that we're doing no it's no negotiating leverage unless unless you want to see potentially what the discussions are between the mayor and the minister however my understanding was that that was on area 3 I didn't understand that that's on male site we've ensured that the first food places are actually not on Memorial F but sort of based internal to internal to the site and there is obviously some concern about the amount of car parking just because of the pressure on car parking in that area and because we can't see the magic formula we are kind of going ahead with the male site with that with those restrictions and the area 3 is in the next round that's correct and obviously the council's preferred view is with cancer laws preferred view is that not be industrial and at the moment since it's in the loop those negotiations need to be with the minister let's correct because it is currently zoned for greenfield business in the regional policy statement just to say that I mean I are the reason I think it should be done as part of Erie three is because you do look at the community of traffic and parking effects in possibly the storm water so if this is going ahead today I'd also want a route possibly and I don't know how we do this a different airline development plan limiting access on two moro f so but I don't like at what stage does that get considered so the the council's desired outcome is that the area 3 does not become a greenfield business zone at all we don't want that to be industrial cemetery or something if we get our way so the the combined traffic affects won't be that great a bit symmetry but if it's you've agreed to not put area 3 into this round of notifications anyway there will be further discussion around the ITA rule and what it can and can't do and its benefits in relation to or in comparison to a set number of car parks required will be discussed when we go through the provisions of the transport chapter the revisions so there was the outline development plan is now the time to change it if we're in couple for which side the male side there was the time but I don't know that we could just make a decision outright because as I've described we're using different ways for managing traffic effects and the ite a is a central part of understanding that but what's the point in having an outlined of it I just want to get another mobile subdivision we get the you can outline development plan the new your traffic assessment and why about 5,000 you know safety issues and the developments already started and suddenly the community say hang on a minute that's there's no cycle way or there's no good way I mean this I'd love to see cycleways going through here that was again some of the community feedback for the outline development plan we seems to indicate yep what to excess ways in tomorrow I have not no clear pedestrian or cycle ways impossibly sufficient storm water maybe not depending on what we decide so is that something you guys can like if perhaps mark could explain to you how we got to this outline development plan and then if you can take you late for us what what concerns you still have after that for any green field area is the traffic assessment itself informs the outline development plan and guides what the road network looks like on the outline development plan and where the access points are so for instance a traffic assessment can consider the impacts of traffic signals at two points on the more aware and look at the appropriateness of set of signals is more appropriate now if we were to explore other options such as there be no access to even head road then potentially would need to do further work to establish what the impacts of all the traffic going on to more aware would be I'd need to review what's previously been done in that respect but it's like if we're looking at the central city being very pedestrian-friendly bike friendly public transport friendly how have we kind of transposed those concepts for a citywide transport station and plan on to new developments so are these guys required to put in because the easiest time is now clearly are they required to put in cycle ways and things the the outline development plan identifies the cycle route joining on the site today so is that now standard practice that they have to create sort of Road cycleways through a number of outline development plans to identify cycleways through sites and when assessing the appropriateness of a cycle we're going for our site as considering where do the cycle routes around that sites head to the Sun so in terms of that the roads and with the soft loans are not on their way we have got that in the draft so subversion chapter which I understand is coming to you knew Wednesday limiters so there is a table and the southern capital which which outlines on which which features should be on which road and it's a season all key roads they should be soccer lines should be footpaths so it should not just be for traffic but consider the detail that on Wednesday so just to be clear if we're looking at putting cycleways off-road and so that you know the cycling population goes from three percent to fifteen percent how have we implemented that in our new district plan into new Greenfield residential and commercial and industrial subdivisions so we aware of require a land development plans to show the cycle routes which which they have here with the the off-road route along royal avenue and we require all all all roads that are collector or arterial roads to have on roads are lines as well so why roads to have them too well it's um because there's that 2,000 kilometers of local roads if we required all greenfield areas to do it then then we would have to do it on all our network as well which is cinnamon cost well otherwise I would try to potentially dealt a double standard where we require own developers there is something that we don't do in our current network but for most local roads are there so few traffic on those local roads that so I class look some of traffic normally not a problem it's the safety issues are occurring on our arterial on our Clint Darrell I have big to differ and with due respect there's not what the cyclists would generally say they want safety everywhere they cycle sure and that's why we're building the major software network to schedule it as well one thing we can consider as showing on the ODP a cycle route running along one of those north-south routes between memoria when avin head is that what you're suggesting appear to say that I plan review workshops that you actually want some outcomes and to be fair to the people around the table there's a reasonably sort of cycle conscious group of counselors here so it's they're quite green even though some of them try to disguise it and I think what one of the outcomes that we would like to see is actually a higher standard than what's being created in the past that that yes the double standard is fine I mean if it is much much easier to construct off-road cycleways and a new development than it is to go back and retrospective retrospectively fit them and so it that they're cheap then they're not a major I mean this has increased the value of this land dramatically so at the very least they can do is put some decent cycleways in there you really just we really just supporting what I guess started off with sheer an idea but those concepts but also the strategic transport plan of choices for people including active travel start there I'm clear I'm sure there's as mark has indicated there can be some changes made to this ATP that reflects the concerns that are being raised right now that it doesn't have to be detailed knowledge of exactly whose thank be operating on the site to be able to make some changes to the ATP that are indicative of what needs to be contains and the development plan when it comes in so for a recycling you can indicate on an ODP that there shall be a north-south cycle lane connecting even head road to memorial air and leave it at that and that is the requirement that's the impart of the OTP or you can be more precise if you want to be it works my mind better like that but it does showing a heart attacks fixed line on a map either way it's not difficult for us to add a cycleway in with is an ODP in my understanding they all have cycleways on them but if it's considered there aren't enough where we can discuss that when we come to each one the yeah just on's a green field area councils planning a cycleway that runs along marshes road so hence they wouldn't need to be need to be a duplicitous cycle route running for a landscaped area that runs directly adjacent to Marsha's road which is why we've taken their out of the rule just on that point but I'll come on to that later shall we move on to take campus thank you
Breakfast and welcome community board Mike cusses the proposed speed limit changes since I've been set here I had a chat with Paul burden but Paul Burton had a chat with me and suggests that maybe after some consideration from from Paul's comments there could be some amendments made to the board's recommendations that make it a little bit more sense I just wonder through you madam mirror whether you would like to accept that adverse that's I just wanted to know if you would accept that offer what can I ask mr. burden to come and explain what they are I do howdy I'll do my best thank you I will I will I'm quite happy to move the recommendations from the board and then I'm quite happy to to invite paul burden to coming that's what I was asking down through you met a mere but if you would ask and be willing to invite mr. burden to the table thank you now with that in mind we did have the proposed speed limit changes proposed by um staff and that the development did in those areas that are sort of semi rural happening at such a speed now that the by the time virtually the speed limit proposed speed limit changes goes out for consultation and comes back and actually the signs get put up a hell of a lot more developed move would have taken place so what we what we felt as a community board is that instead of instead of acknowledging or accepting the City Council stay us recommendation on some aspects of the speed limits that we actually knowing what's happening in the very near future that we actually reduce those speed limits now rather than later on what's the what's the the developments have taken place and people have brought and built into an area and the speed limits are seen to be too fast and too dangerous yes thank you made a mere staffer a little bit concerned with with that approach that's my first point the second point is that there are some recommendations that have come from the community board that going to be impractical for us specifically about those walls of Junction Road wooden cops road alliston drive the border wanting us to make that 50 kilometers an hour well that would be but that would be between an 80 kilometer an hour and a 60 client or our existing speed limit so that wouldn't make a lot of sense we would suggest that would be 60 wooden cops road south of queefs road the border recommending that that speed limit be 50 kilometers an hour I actually believe that's an error because when cops roads south of closed Road as a wholly rural environment there is no residential development existing or proposed so I think they're actually in error making that section of road 50 kilometers an hour would be that particular section I don't accept Paul's advice on that one Kashmir road happy home road 20 Doran's nursery border recommending that that speeding have been reduced from 8250 given the rural nature of that road we suggest that that is going to be impractical for us to manage operationally and we suggest that 60 would be more appropriate think it's a big improvement meta me on what we've got now and I think if this has still got to go out for public consultation as well but I think that's a hell of a lot better starting point just going back to my first point about proactively lowering the limit in preparation for development occurring and it relates only to our te road entire length with a border suggesting that be reduced to 50 kilometers an hour now prior to development occurring we would find that difficult to to operate and manage as well we would prefer to do keep an eye on the development once the development reaches the level where we believe the operating speeds can be lowered and the police force that back then we would suggest the lower limit and can I comment absolutely no I degree correct yes edition my Oscar stuff about how about a week window in the Manteca rule that because the Cameo with reviewing here they prefer the 80 change it to the 60 80 change it to learn 50 this tool I did you agree were challenged in drawer in the wink of the law and also the case miracle to follow your recommendation okay thank you those changes so can I suggest that we moved us that counselor chin moves and I'm happy to second with those changes and you are happy with that much okay okay can I put that Clause 10 Yanni can I just ask a question of process um because it was interesting looking at this report versus the Hagley pyramid one I wasn't aware that we could add streets them to get considered but this clearly seems to be what the sport has done um so is that okay for us to do as well because all available have some that we would we would bring up what happened point of explanation what happened was the the speed limit review came came to our board we asked for it to be expanded to cover a wider area so there's actually two processes happening and they've got a little bit mixed up but I'm sure that if we pass these this resolution today with the great issue be clear on that Jonnie and that these were issues that affected quite a number of areas obviously this is a very fast growing area in the city there it was a view from traffic engineers that that we can't could should perhaps wait a bit longer there was a clear view from some residents who spoke and from the community board members that it was really important that the speed limits were lowered as the city expanded and that they were dangerous where they currently were and so they have added to the list and as we understand it that this is quite legal to do and I would suspect that many other community boards would look at doing exactly the same in terms of the roads that are dangerous around the areas that are worrying them so I would expect to see more of this from other community boards especially around fast-growing subdivisions such as Preston's road not that I want to suggest anything ever again just a question to make sure that what we've got in the recommendation has been moved and cops road south of crisis road there was a discussion there where Paul put up that that was more suitable to remain as a tea and Michael's asked the question would he be happy with that nan said yes we've still got 50 on the recommendation there is it's one cops road south of quotes should be 80 not 50 yes its halls of Junction Road wooden cops to alvaston had to Paul to see with his aging eyesight but so we changed him halls or junction road to 60 yes yes yes comfortable with that although Junction deke wife's is at that 61 cops road we talk about wound cops road correct that's correct as it is
So this is variation 12 Environment Canterbury proposed land and water regional plan it's a supplementary agenda item tip number two and it's page 542 all good okay move to cancel our Clearwater seeking did councillor chin okay have you found it Ellie can you punch cleanse or hidden he found it okay we just get wait for a minute while everybody makes were there they have it mm-hmm can you give you a ginger to someone let's do somebody here who's going to give us given how late this chem and give us a once over lightly on what this actually means Michael Teela how does he manage to escape for the day is busy doing other stuff so there's no one here Oh Helen Beaumont be good as yours a question Yanni I'm just kind of puzzled why this is just suddenly appeared and whether it can just be taken in two weeks I think it was um submitted in March anyway so it's already gone over jus so you can squeeze in another two weeks ok so we'll find there anything else in there that we haven't found in the public component ok gotta minutes break for pretty kitchen yeah yeah all right on the spot yes stinking too long thank you one a once over lightly on what it actually means and two is there a time urgency with it can you tell us exactly which report Europe which came as a supplementary agenda item quite late I'm and its variation 12 environment carry supposed land and water regional plan this yes okay so this is this is the submission to the proposed landing water regional plan and we are asking you to retrospectively a firm the lodging of the solution that the time frames are such that these comments have to go in very quickly we are able of course to withdraw them or amend them no other just sort of further explained that the submission period has closed for this and we don't normally have the opportunity the time frame between receiving the documents and be able to respond and present our submission to the council and have approval for that before the what the submission suggests on behalf of the council I'm assuming you're looking for standards that are generally higher than what Environment Canterbury currently operates are not necessarily higher in some cases we in many of the cases with our submission we are simply supporting the variation and I've outlined that they're from two point four point two through to two point four point four and the report so in some it's a variety it's a variety of supporting the variation and in some cases opposing the variation there are a lot of issues around natural resource that the land and water regional plan deals with a lot of issues around natural resources and Canterbury and our main concerns here are around groundwater issues for the christchurch city and protect particularly the protection of water supply zones amongst other issues as well correct it's maintaining and I suppose enhancing or increasing in some cases that level of protection around water supply maintain Lee at the current level or trying to actually improve that protection and would be to improve the level of protection of protection this certainly always that fine line between trying to balance land use provisions for some of these areas against the with further development of these areas at the same time ensuring that we have a good supply or adequate supply of high-quality and adequate quantity of water as well I would have thought that issue of balance was somebody else's actually that our concern was the high quality standard of water for Christchurch and that that's what we would predicate our submissions on we have generally these provisions generally make a much tighter framework and protect the resources and we've supported that move by Environment Canterbury to have greater protection particularly around stock and improving the management of storm water and integrated approach to management of storm water and improving the number of discharges of sewage into the into the through the storm water and the water supply it's pretty as follows off of that see again this will be all around the farming practices and perhaps the raised level of nitrogen found in the water imma try to maintain that it includes farming 4.9 halsell River her a teeny captain flooding it says that you've recommitted oppose this and we're supportive of the policy but seek to ensure that land-based stormwater treatment and detention systems are not included in the policy given the concern we've had over the recent flooding in the failure of what the perceived failure of some of these storm detention systems that are on land why would we oppose having just taken out why will they oppose us so I could you just right so my understanding it but I'd like to know why we're opposing this and why we want to ensure that land-based stormwater treatment and detention systems are not included in the policy when we've got community concern that the existing systems that have recently been consented are not adequate um particularly in the halls Hall basement now I think that's in the separate report so that's that's are you looking at the report on the Canterbury proposed land and water regional plan no this is the variation one submission okay decision is so 55 14.9 we as you'll see in the third cop and the third column in the third column sorry but what I'm trying to understand is in the comment that you've made you're seeking to ensure that land-based stormwater treatment and detention systems are not included in the policy why are you why are you recommending there and have you taken into account that concerns that the community have expressed recently over the flooding where we've got those sorts of systems that there's a perception that they haven't been adequate so what I read from your submission is you're wanting less control over those things where I canna saying you need a consent and I guess as a council we need I mean again it's hard because we already got this some of us this morning but what I think we need to understand why you've what the rationale is behind what you're asking for as I understand it the the what we're not we're not opposed to consenting for for inundation of by storm water what we're trying water detention event facilities so the the amendment to the policy is really to to maintain the ability to have appropriate inadequate treatment facilities it's that's what outcome was seeking I'm just around process this needed to be lodged on the 21st March it's now the 22nd of May when are the hearings taking place I haven't_''_664.22 been advised of any hearing dates at the stage okay and is this the first opportunity that you've had to present this to counsel this is the first opportunity to have it in front of the council meeting use yep thank you well we've got a submissions panel so I just want it and that pennell has I think me and this time and this wasn't put in front of it so I'm really concerned if we don't have a date for hearings I'd like to suggest this goes to the submissions panel so we can actually understand what we're saying as a council this is incredibly important particularly in light of what what's happened recently and I think it able to give it today we're happy to to have to hold a workshop even if that's what you wish and to work through these and explain them long as we all know because we can go along as well
And would you like to do here's a choice guys would you like to do the accessible City or Ellerslie international flash show next okay will do them in order then accessible City item number 26 capsular clear water moves and cancel our East sickens the recommendations that are here okay shall I just put those just testing Yanni did you want to speak thank you um obviously we've seen a major announcement today about a new car park going into the central city we heard at the briefing in regards to the hospital redevelopment plans that they have quite an extensive car park going in so we've also got some changes of having to some of the anchor projects so what traffic will update up-to-date current traffic modelling have we got to support these changes in light of the new developments sort of happened since as accessible transport plan was introduced and how can we see that as counselors I think what we do is that we continually update on modeling as these things continue to change so it's never draw a line understand and happy to engage with ccd you and get them to come and explain and give you an overview of the modeling that has been done they're quite happy to do that so are we not doing any of our own modeling but they're basing on the modeling that we actually initiated for the city so we have a core transport model that we created for the city and other other consultants and other agencies around the city use the same model that is fundamental so yes we also use that model and updated ourselves as well so what is the impact of the new developments that we've now heard about on the traffic modelling through you madam chair as terry says we continually update the models to take account of our best level of information as to the anchor projects and as they're gradually developed a particular point in them in that respect is parking provision associated with a number of developments in the central city and the anchor projects themselves so when as soon as we get a sure admiss around the levels of traffic projects we adjust the models accordingly to take account of that so have you adjusted the model to take account of the expanded crossing car park yes and the big car park plan for the hospital yes great thank you and does it work yeah but that was simple thank you so okay so we can get copies of that provided that would be welcome um yeah we're glad we can certainly arrange a full briefing on that madam chair you have a lot yeah great um so in terms of the funding the financial position that we're now on as a council what work have you done to rationalize any of the spending in light of the the horizontal infrastructure review that's that's currently underway well the funding for this first phase is covered in the cost share agreement so and we the changes that were proposing means that we keep within the same financial envelope that was signed off in the cautionary agreement so from that point of view there's no additional money be booster my understanding we've got horizontal infrastructure we've got anchor projects or central city projects they're all competing for funding so we're looking at all those lists and working out which ones are the priority which ones can we do more efficiently or effectively so have these projects been through that process they have been through a pros in terms of determining what are the best projects for the first phase to support the accessible City so those projects are primarily geared to support the anchor projects as we know them the skirt program is all about repairing and renewing the damaged infrastructure but we work very closely with skirt to ensure that the two projects or the two pots of work are aligning so for instance the skirt rebuild program is currently they're currently in tool Street dealing with all the waste water and the water supply systems so that we can then come along later to change the configuration of term Street on top knowing full well that all the underground is already completed and finished so we're working in that way with them when we hear things well I had that the tender for Manchester Street doesn't include stormwater does it does it strike you as unusual that 22 million dollars going into Manchester straight given our flooding experience would not include an upgrade to the storm water and how other projects being aligned posts flooding to the issues that we have as a city I can't really answer that detail around Manchester eeks I've not been familiar with it but if anything is required on the stormwater emerge the street it in it's purely a renewal it will be done under the skirt project and not the roading project and the final question as one of us previously is just to understand if we agree to there's obviously been no public consultation over over spending money in a different way as we normally do but in terms of the consultation that we would have around a street that was two-way going to one way or a one way street going to a two way street what are the what are the opportunities for public involvement consultation meaningful and genuine in this process but what an inner-city residents or as this is or others in this process so that through you madam chair the council decision making process must comply with the local government government net requirements so and those require counsel to seek the views of those who are both interested and effective affected by the proposal so it does have to be genuine consultation and that's what we're seeking your approval for is to go out and kick start that it's going to be for a month and I've got a huge list of you know basically user groups parties that we're going to have to see effective part affected people when everything else so it's it's comprehensive and it is genuine yep said that so that's the intention will go out and do the consultation accordance with the local government at requirements also also been speaking to all the community boards and then we'll be coming back to Council with the feedback from that consultation we anticipate that around late september-october walk back with you I'm paragraph 5.2 the additional 15 million us that a report would need to come to the Finance Committee and council around that 15 million dollars but where is envisaged that money would come from would it would it take away from existing projects or is envisaged it would come from betterment fund or you know where would that come from through you madam ji art in terms of that 15 million would you need to be careful about that we're not actually recommending that option so what we're recommending is that we defer some projects and keep within the 72 million cap and but if council did not decide to agree to defer some of the projects and decided to increase include other ones within that I salisbury street and the Coolmore to way then that would cost the 15 million dollars and we would have to seek extra money from council for that so we haven't worked out where that would come from but it's certainly not our recommended option that you do that yeah thank you I won't be supporting these changes I actually think that we should be community we were elected on a man date of I think strengthening our community boards and involving local people and quite clearly in this one of the real concerns is that there's no guarantee that kilmore salisbury street will be ever to wait there'll be no money on budget for it and we've basically deferring providing a level of amenity to our local residents if we approve this today without any conversation with them over what impact that will have but I would suggest that actually the focus is wrong the core of the central city is going to be construction and demolition zone for a number of years what we've seen is that the damage to the infrastructure is continuous from that sort of development and destruction so the footpaths get damaged and then we have to come along and fix them at a later date so I think actually it makes sense to look at doing what we can in the residential areas within the four avenues to provide a level of amenity and access for those people rather than creating an unaccessible city account the stages of development that is happening I appreciate that the bus interchange is something that people see is really important and I agree but that it's really hard to understand the value of one weighing chew em straight when you've got major developments happening at the hospital and major car parking developments happening at litchfield street and two sides of it so I'm really concerned about this I appreciate that we want to get things happening but I do think there should be really clear detailed traffic modelling done so in community engagement done before we make these changes any other projects that we would just add to a lust or take off a lust we would go through it out and your plan process but we're not doing that for this and it concerns me so people have had no right to make submissions as they normally would over what our priority should be the final point I make is I'm really concerned it just seems a complete lack of alignment skirt and our capital expenditure and I know some of that transport plan but what I can't understand is given our financial constraint why when we're doing the skirt repairs we're not putting back what we want in terms of their outcomes as a city to be more sustainable and more accessible what this is telling us this report is that we're not doing that that we've got no money to do that and we're just going to fix the street and then at some stage in the future possibly win there's money if there's money we may come back but we have no clear time frame along that I would have thought it's better to align it so that we only dig up streets once and we do it properly to get the better outcome that we want rather than being able to afford to come back so I'm really concerned that with all the other financial things that we're doing as a council this seems to have escaped any sort of scrutiny and just because it's in the cost year we seem to be being told that think it is prudent to look at this and it is not the sort of amendments that I wish to be making today I think we should be asking for it to be deferred well from my recollection we've deferred this I think three times already this is perhaps the fourth time it's come to the council I actually want to get these things underway so that the central city is about quite a different looking central city so that it's great for people to walk it's great for people to bike and it's great for people to use public transport in and what I would also really like to have happen in the central odes tilly go away eventually so that by Christmas next year I can come in and do my Christmas shopping in the center of town just like everybody else will be able to and as we get more and more developments happening we have to look at the the way in which transport accesses the city that hospital development is major the crossing development is obviously significant and a really a few more that are going to be announced soon and the absolutely has to be some real translation of the plan that has a 30k a city with really good public transport biking access and walking access actually happening around and highly visible in the central city otherwise we do run the risk that the central city becomes a place that you just stay away from and that's exactly the antithesis of what I want for the central city I want people in there and I want to encourage developers to know that there is certainty and actually things happening in the central city so that they continue to put their money into their developments to make this the sort of city that we want not just the anchor projects because there are huge gaps between the anchor projects actually want the sort of interesting quirky developments that people will do off their own bets in the central city all over the place and a different-looking central city that's aimed very clearly and it's probably one of the things that takes that share an idea that different this is probably it so I'm really keen that we get on with it at can't sake water look I support Vicky's comments the the Sharon idea process that worked people gave really good ideas about how its led to an accessible City as part of the recovery plan and there is consultation around this part is built in and I think the staff have been really clear they've given us the up-to-date information we can't go on forever that they'll always be things that need need fine tuning and in terms of the shape of for example the the traffic the the one way in two-way streets there's no doubt that F at this stage we were to start tinkering with changing one a two-way run into sorry a 1 way 1 into it at a two-way like chew em street that clearly that would have an impact on all of the rest of the traffic flow and the rest of the plane and we just can't_''_930.509 do that we cannot we don't have time to go back and recommendations look as a community board member I supported the action to look at this little bit closer but as a counselor I cannot actually vote to if you go back through and relook at this any longer I'm with 30 of us here the central city is at a point where we just start to get some positive things happening with this morning's announcement and we're going to see a domino effect of a whole lot of building taking place the majority of the demolition is complete there are still a few buildings left but the majority of is actually complete construction should not cause issues to that to the land and if they do they will be held accountable I'll be voting to issue you move on with some of this recommendation you
Thank you item 27 a ella sleep last row Peter um would you like to just give us we heads up on what should be in public and what should be in public excluded because I understand that there are issues of sponsorship the management contract venues and staff issues which should not be discussed in public okay correct when the report was put together clearly the staff had a long conversation about splitting report and I think the way they've done it is appropriate as much as possible can we put in the open part of the meeting for the public to see and of course the reason the primary reason why the council or the information has been put in public public excluded is there are obviously still ongoing negotiations to be had with the council's contractor in particular there are flow only fix from that depending on what the council decides and it I think from the staff advice bespeak definitely it's a decision of the council you and decide what you take them up excludable you do not but the staff strong advice at the moment and to give you the chance to debate that and decide on that then well depending on your decision you can then have a conversation about where do we go to from here about communication from that perspective is thank you Peter fully appreciate that obviously we're elected reps responsible for ratepayers dollars so my question is what does have the higher claim I mean I understand that contractual obligations to deal with that and private but we're also dealing with rate payer dollars yeah I think the art will that line I think that that at the end of the day is a matter of judgment for the majority of you when you vote on the resolution to go in public screwed it always is from that perspective I think that the balance could be perhaps that you have that discussion of public saluda because having it an open it may potentially prejudice the council's own negotiating position in particular with its contractor going forward and of course the trouble that is until you've had the debate and you know what the and I think and that's why secondly and pick up the comment that the deputy Emir made to achieve the balance you're looking for in terms of yesterday's ratepayers funds have the conversation today around well how do we communicate in a timely manner what the decision is from that perspective so people can see so yeah there's always a there's always a judgment issue there and people will say I want to go to watch so long on the camera live versus the ability for the council to be able to negotiate like any other party does on any other matter I'll be back I think I think they know that I'm Carol me Catherine harbor hours finance manager corporate finance who's been working on the LZ show for the last year any probably know chris gilbert easier legal services unit manager heroin robertson acting general manager community services and on which it's takes unit manager marketing of instant well I give a quick summary of the position as I say it's a and just the information is in the 2014 as Lee show exceeded as targets for delivering further the content the quality of the show the quantity of the show those things that we needed to improve from 2013 clearly that's come at a cost that cost sort of falls into two areas when there's been a significant decline and visitors to Christchurch for the show he compared to 2010 in there were about nineteen thousand eight hundred visitors came to Christchurch the show this last year when there's been 6800 so a significant decline there which leads onto attendance income and from two thousand thirteen and fourteen there's been a decline in sponsorship so those two elements contribute the primary contributors to the financial position so we've had a great show in terms of feed bed but we're at a position that financially it doesn't yet the basis of the financial basis to it doesn't support the delivery of the show and there's the dilemma that we have going forward to look at how do we get this a financial basis to support the show on an could start with questions and then we'll need about Rick thanks Richard I mean obviously there are some contractual issues here which preclude some of the more public aspects of the conversation but is there anything you can tell the general public about the options a high level that were able to consider without going into specifics I'll defer to Christa advise on it under the services agreement council has discretion as to whether it you can specify the location of the event the time of the year and nearly anything shall be held whether or not to hold an event in any year or postponed pencil it's very sad a termination sighs are we allowed to know those publicly or yes capital K can give notice and cancel for a year that would have to do that by one June this year and we'll have to pay the service fee pro rata up to the date of cancellation in addition to that there's council would be at risk of paying a figure of up to thirty thousand dollars for any redundancy that flower show thanks I'm just with regards to the economic impact that you use you I mean these are very numbers that you can use at cetera 2009 2010 is a difference of 20,000 18 days of this page three twenty six point three point three and that equates to seven million on your economic impact study before I'm 2013 we have 40 just under forty four and a half thousand people just around forty four and a half thousand attendees for 5.5 million impacts economic impact but 2014 which I do have to say was a fantastic show they got 45 and a half thousand but only 4.4 million economic impact now sponsorship doesn't affect the impact so I'm just wondering what meds or what the first point is that with without five shows three of those shows we've had the formal research undertaken by I limited from Melbourne the other two where we haven't done it I have looked at the numbers and those reports because we do our research around them so we've got the numbers of visitors and I've done for this year like point out that that is this year we didn't do the formal measure of it but I routed the information and the reason why I put it down lower than last year is again that while the attendance held up the visitors to Christchurch numbers were down so and clearly though become competes from vs Christchurch India's been so that the numbers are tended me from outside of Christchurch fell from 2013 but this ain't over yeah move that down but I clearly put out the other though that she has figure as an estimation based on other criteria from research rather than the direct measure of economic and be okay with air over all of the in strategy some time ago was the four seasons or shoulder months etc so we've got um so we've got a garden show which I mean suddenly is just kind of launching deers in September what are the thoughts and I notice here there was no mention of looking at a spring timetable for garden show ominous seems logical to me that you would might think so Beckett time of when Counsell purchase the show so that was following on from the event strategy four seasons the icon event in place was New Zealand cabin showy in the spring so the what we were looking for was that autumn event shoulder season you know summer autumn and so the decision was was looked at fit you know in terms of that strategy but also there was feedback at that time from the industry that it would put too much pressure on them in the spring because that's when they are really yeah their business is really at their people so that they yet the majority I have to say that the others probably split views on this was the that will was better for christchurch those regards to visitor numbers how did you measure people coming in and how many people coming in that that's a combination of special ticket sales pretty much so so took us but an addition to that there's clearly no sponsorship arrangements which have tickets as part of that so that's all added to it that we access to the tents of the show as well so no you didn't actually sort of counter counter p there wasn't a counter at the gauges might understand I can just quickly through the show manager that is ridiculous sales counts isn't it yeah okay thank you you you
Much of declare the meeting open just to remind members and those that join us at the table that we have a that we're live streamed so people are aware to speak clearly so that it can be picked up thank you and the first item of the agenda is apologies and I have apology for lateness from Council of F mangie with someone like to move that that apology be accepted Thomas Kendra seconded by David East all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you excuse me um yeah I do need to apologize for possibly leaving early to put on la the counseling goes that you have to go to Wellington for the LG ins in special media you duties so um thank you for can we use give it can we ate him ed Jana Johansson for early departure if required because I'm hoping not so um and so the next item on the agenda
Number 24 which is the facilities rebuild demolition of the heath cap voluntary library building I guess yawning your hands would like to move there yes I'm happy to move the staff recommendations for these next three reports I just wanted to draw your attention to at the local community board one of the concerns expressed is that we are demolishing a lot of facilities with sometimes probably not the most sustainable method and you know this is a community that really wants to work with us and be involved in what's going on and so we have made the request around the demolition that we're materials that can be either recycled or reused into the local community that that occur and that there needs to be discussions worth around the community center Cricut the Cricut club and the place in 20 I quite immediately affected by of what's being proposed but the other point we should make is that some unfortunately we're council have demolished sites previously we have left them in a pretty bad state and I just think you know it's were demolishing facilities we should actually take some responsibility to having sites left in the tidy and pleasant matter rather than just tuning in to sort of light gravel pits or mud pits is some of them previously have so I I think those the feedback from the community board can certainly go to staff and I hope that they will what they expect that they will take that on board so um yeah okay don't see so let's deal with them separately we've got the demolition of the head cap voluntary library building and so could I have a seconder for that alley Jones sorry Paul I've got here first and is there any discussion on that on the demolition ya ali oh sorry I'm gonna see him I just I had this really there weren't were there issues about information needed or confirmation from the insurer that this can be demolished without affecting claim for the repair is this one with the work on the suspended ceiling hang on here anymore he's a community center no it's a different one's pretty it's what I have a question on alright so sorry this is the heath kept voluntary library building watches that has been well we have spent some makes so money on it but I'm just kind of find the actual recommendations Darya they agree to the demolition and yeah so the community received feedback on this report from hagley theorem of you that's what you've just said so it might be actually helpful in the resolution to have there's something agreeing to the demolition of that he's got volunteer lied we're gonna look at eight Martin does the road and request staff to give effect to the community board feedback we're we're possible all right okay just say that it's kind of recorded in the resolution yep yes there are those poor things yep that's fine and that staff given feet to the community board feedback you happy with that Ellie okay I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and then the second resolution has been demolition of the head cut community center located at bridle path Road but someone like to second that Paul lonsdale and again we've got a hagley ferry made community board feedback and and I think we'll just add the same words there so just copy and paste excellent so is there any discussion on that Kelly this is the one that I want to raise just before sorry and I know that you've got mentioned there's a staff give a community board feedback but I don't think it's actually that clear and in the community board feedback it's it's clear from the information here that there was fifty seven thousand dollars worth of repair work done which relates to I think it was suspended ceilings and some cosmetic repair work suspended ceiling replacement and minor appears and that was our sep tember and that amount is currently being negotiated between the council in the insurer I just want reassurance up there with that this will not all demolishing this will not in any way prejudice the claim or affect the claim for significant amount of money throughout um yep Darren Darren Moses facilities rebuild manager and we have received the total sum insured so in a position from the loss adjusting team on behalf of lap for that property which is why we can perceive of competence to hear that includes all of the work done to date is part of the total sum insured so the the repairs which were undertaken as emergency works are part of the total plane so there's there's nothing outstanding that we're seeking from insurers on this one so this information is incorrect you refer me to a car I yes I'm sorry page 190 it says the summer 56 we wasn't under me okay in which case they can't these entitled actually Caribbean if we're still chasing it down you're saying sorry doing this is correct what I'm looking at you sorry yes right so there's another 57k hours usually on top of it you're right so on on on production of and voice for that group sure okay sure that we should have we expect to get yeah and but my point is still that if we go ahead with the demolition of it that shouldn't in any way no because it was a great previously essentially what essentially we've we've done the work we have the invoices and destruction of the evidence won't jeopardize the total why haven't you got the money think that's probably an answer question I get asked a lot in this regard um we're waiting on insurance okay so I would say to you again until you have that money no we're previously agreed yet as long as there is no reason as long as we have it that we don't require to keep the property for the purposes of confirming so the the only properties that were required to what we've still got outstanding issues around of those with the stressed concrete don't they am I right yeah so we don't require to keep the building standing in order to prove the claim we've got the receipts for the work that we do that that oh but you did but does the building need to stay standing to prove it it's very she argue that what I'm asking is can we have something and writing from them saying you may demolish the building we have no further need for it to be standing in order to progress or complete the claim that's what we've asked for on other occasions a little someone years four years so said are we able to are we able to get confirmation from our insurers that they don't require the building to remain standing for this purpose yeah we could do that but the reality is they have agreed that it is a total loss so what was it wasn't done it in September which is the 57,000 which we have receipts for is irrelevant why's it arrives oh no sorry in terms of whether the building is now demolished or not they're not going to say keep the building up because you spent 57th no no no it's not Michael I'm not saying that what I'm really in addition to the total sum insured sorry it sees an addition to the total sum insured I think I understood come back to us and say that they don't accept that we ever did any suspended ceiling replacement and minor repairs will clarify that don't you for demolition that's all Ellie's asking for is clarification that they don't need the building standing for what we are claiming and what we did at little too there's exactly along the lines of what I'm suggest we do here too and just by the way point of clarification it's highly unlikely we are actually going to seek to demolish this building until sep tember we've talked to the cricket club right that adjoins I've said we'd prefer if you actually you can either do it in April which is in three weeks time highly unlikely or September so the building will be around until September yeah and it does say to to consult with the cricket club so that's good the voluntary library would be one that we're seeking Russian confirmation very major from the insurer's confirmation from the insurers yep we all know what that means thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried we move on to the next recommendation which is a staff recommendation plus the community board addition around well here I'm in 7.1 year but will come we'll come back to that yeah I mean we will work on the actual wording of this so that's moved by yanni johansson who seconds that one paw lonsdale so the question that I've got on here is that none of these options say what can be built with the money available so it's all predicated on the basis that we go ahead and design what we want but not no recommendation says what could we build with the money available from the two facilities and I think that there should be something that we get advice on because we are required to look at more than one option and you know under our legislative framework and it seems to me build that would provide us with the replacement for the voluntary library and the and the community hall instead of saying what could we build with the money available and because otherwise requesting staff to report back their findings at the conclusion of stage one including any shortfall and funding assumes that we can make up the shortfall and funding so I'd like to know what we could build with what we're going to definitely get and then what we would build if we were able to use the enhancement money to improve on it so if I might matter me I'm thinking that we just need to be a little bit careful about rushing off into a major community consultation and raising expectations on this so I wonder if we should come back first maybe to the committee with what he bought can you get for 700,000 as a starting point to have that discussion I think otherwise it'll it will be a bit more difficult to to manage community expectations which are very clear in this area yeah um yani then clean my understanding around you know what what could happen this has been ongoing for a long time and I accept that the money that we could possibly get today in real terms is a lot less than what we would have got a year ago had been able to settle with our insurer over the community center the reason the two facilities were looked at jointly it was because the library accepted that the because of the low level oven sheron's that was on that building that obviously there wouldn't be enough to for a hundred thousand dollars put the library back or 150 so that was kind of how we got the agreement that you have to realize that there's the library and the community center in that too there's been to quite discreet groups distinct groups that have been using both of those and ever sense of ownership and connection so the community were keen to look at raising funds and look at creative solutions I'm just not sure if we hold this up I don't quite know what other information you're going clear that that's the money available for this facility and previous resolutions then why are we asking sir a shortfall and funding to be identified is that specifically for community fundraising but I think it would I certainly think it would be useful for the community to know what the gaps were and it may be particularly about seeking other funding and they'll need an amount but in making that decision if we gave the community what we could build for that amount of money I mean we can build a facility for three-quarters a million dollars I mean we can but what size facility what could it be used for I mean I'd rather give the community that option or say if you want to have the option that you want then then there is capacity for you to fundraise that might be possible for them to go to the community trust it might be possible to you know do fundraising events which would would give them a sense of real ownership as well so I I'm not opposed to what you're suggesting but makes it look like the short form fundings coming back for us to consider to page 186 3.4 actually we all the stuff is sort of being asked will provide costings repair rebuild options to account submitting 24th or April so he needs us page 186 under three point four point three and three point four point six so you know I guess the kind of you know we I mean I'm happy for you know it did work that needs to be done around coming up this was almost a year ago things have changed fine let's if you want to spend a bit more time updating those costs updating what what possibly we need I'm open to that I think at the end of the day the community want to know that things are happening and be involved in a process to get something replaced and repaired or not repeat because this is a new development so we need to try and get a signal that we are moving for I've met that I don't know the history of this and I don no respond to the section 38 notice of the plan to make safe I mean this could have been demolished last year the way I said so I mean I couldn't understand why that delay was made and I mean how much did we spend on that that on that makes safe it was about thirty thousand dollars so I mean do it there were there were decisions made last year their impact on where we are now that's absolutely true but I don't know that we'd made the decision to actually demolish the library last year it looked like we were actually going the other way yep that's right the original staff report was that it was to be an owner initiated demolition supported by section 38 notice from Sarah in terms of unsafe to be demolished it was a report report hence the dates of April last year which I guess set us down a course of the previous council saying do not demolish that building set to do make safe works and work with the community at sea to that process essentially looking to demolish it so we can enable the finance to build something new in there in the area right and I mean it's a it's a great idea to bring the community facility into the heart of the heath capelli I mean where it's located at the moment is crazy really I'm you know it might be suitable for people that live immediately in proximity but actually the heart of his cut I mean what was that nice little hotel that used to be on the corner there you know that whole area is just it really is where the community has its hard sorry then I've cut you off tonight it's okay I'm just in the costings can we please also make explicit breakdown on how calculations in 2.4 page 1 point 1 4 4500 per square meter are arrived at so this makes this one point 125 million if you go for 250 meters all up not comparing apples with apples with with housing we know the kitchens and bathrooms up the square meter calculations with housing but I'm come to that figure so if we could please have that calculations are done this issues come up before across other community facilities so sorry that's right yeah it a bit love it things we can comment out that if you wish Darren yeah with everything we bring the council they're supported by a independent professional quantity surveyor that brings us those right so that rate would include a total out to in cost of project management possible consenting fees etc etc so we apply that the entire building at four and a half thousand a square meter but I mean again we'll be looking now that we would pay as we're closer to knowing what the total project budget is we'll be doing some value management or many and all of that so if the direction when councillors to go back do it with do what you can within the budget and see what that looks like that's a very helpful direction to see how quickly could you do that I mean could you get that back to us next month you know I'll give it undertaking okay so so we'll have a report back to us that will hold it up for four weeks and and we will just get an analysis of that but I think that giving the community that you know that the clear options because they might say well actually we'd prefer to have that and not have to fundraise yeah so that the council that of its staff report back to the council on on here that the council report back to this meta on April the whatever data does no cheat me whether that will include a breakdown of the the cost we arrived at their to squeeze yes madam ear would you like that directly back to Council yeah I think they all know it will do on it just yonni do you want it through your committee what I mean I think we don't know what's going to come out of it I think it's pretty useful to have a joint committee community board meeting and then just bring up straight to council after that okay so joint you can you put and that the the staff of staff report back to council on this matter after consultation with a joint community committee hagley ferry mead community board meeting or after yeah okay after incorporating feedback from a joint how's that after incorporating feedback from a and then take out work but further information ya know know that you can make them the next four weeks kind of you can meet in time for that report back date yep so oh sorry shouldn't screw up the facial doesn't carries on the camera but queries and carrying the vocals it's it's sorry that the sequence going through the community board in committee does certainly add another probably adds another couple of weeks to the prices I would think just the way that the world work moves at the moment so it'd be fine but probably by the if we did it by the council meeting on the whatever the second one is and I probably would be helpful helpful well okay so relieved it the tenth of April but will change it to made community board okay then they can do it independently or together or whatever and feedback to you all right so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried I just bequest that we adjust those figures on page eight and the financial implications I put one circuit to they don't include the 57,000 back and 5.4 wouldn't we envisage will be added to that in it Sorry Sorry page what I know but they haven't_''_1424.739 included with 57,000 on the previous page that we're washing through from the insurance company I think I think it should be complete yep yeah because the updated report all yeah okay and then I think this is the last item before we get to the public excluded and we'll break for lunch at that point so the council resolution trekker and the would someone like to move the recommendations term scandrett and Andrew tuna is there any discussion I think there's just one thing that I want to raise and that is that it's great you know that we can refer to one of the one of the things that I would like us to be able to do though is to search on a subject so rather than the report title as it might I mean the report title might be the report of a meeting of the spread and head community board but there doesn't tell you what the issue is so I think that I mean with some refinement I think this is really heading down the right track and I agree that taking the yes items out of the next bridge aight as useful but we still need to be out of search the document as a whole so yeah yeah it'll be yeah it'll always be there but the printer will be those items yani just wait a little bugger of mine it's not even in my ward but um we're all affected by it and that is lincoln road so um the staff response commentary is it will be covered by an eddington parking strategy review settings of September 2011 the council actually requested with urgency and a traffic and parking strategy so you know I just I'm not satisfied with the commentary this is you know 2011 dealings of the timber I need to have some colleges hate is this I page the first page oh I I just I need to have some confidence that that resolution has actually been given a thick to around the traffic issues at the community of traffic issues aromas area because I just cannot see any any visibility of anything other than consents being issued and traffic lights going in in the traffic getting worse and worse and worse yeah yeah FL yeah I guess is as the young businesses keep developing down lincoln road that's the problem a lot has been done and other reports were being called for two and maybe they just need to be put together somehow to give us as accounts of insurance and maybe they could come to the environmental committee but a lot of work has been done and there was a court also for an extension of the parking plan beyond what is listed there yani so and I thank you I guess I've learnt from bit of recent experience to about putting dates to things and if we look through these resolutions a lot of blanks for the dates so I think it would be good practice obviously both for staff end us we can't attach dates here and at committee little too and you mean when that completed so instead of just saying pleated know we had juice well then that you is put yep yeah yep now that's true alright so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and oh now if somebody could move that we what I'll move that we resolve to exclude the
The substantive motion those in favor please say aye those opposed carried right sorry guys item 25 oh you probably do need to stay there for 25 anyway unless you want to pass it on to somebody else the item 25 lenders recovery plan evaluation of ccc exemplar housing projects okay we know well Glenn told me not to yeah took further advice that seemed quite logical that Lee rescinded be four existing pro decision so that we could then move to this good looking right so 24 we're now doing 25 okay right Landis recovery plan moved by Glenn seconded by Pauline ok any questions or anything of stuff not you need to bait well simply sorry if this would go to six point one point one in favor of Kira street okay yes so it will have to be six point yeah six point one point two and six point one point three come out okay right it's easy okay so with the deletion of six point one point two and six point one point three moved by glee and seconded by pauline and think okay out as a strong candidate you want to leave it in there okay right we are happy to oblige you okay put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried right
Council has an X in class moves clean and you wanted to change the slightly yes please that seeks to revoke that resolution on bro we will know that across the line amongst the elected middlesex fine so a few of us have had an informal conversation over seeking carry as the second exemplar after Andrews present there are various positive reasons for that including the fact that it would yield a greater number of units potentially than the other option of coals so it would yield say 30 to 40 you would like to move as one point to endorse Andrews Kristen and Carrie is pleased at caring place or street street cary street as the preferred candidates okay so this is actually an amendment that's moved by cancer Livingston and seconded by cat salon style any debate about that again I just asked we haven't been given any rationale why Brown village is suddenly being revoked what's the reason given that we've already agreed to but I keys from my perspective it just didn't find even near unanimous support by the elected members chair I don't want this to be reiterated again it becomes very Missy of rather we were decisive just got on with it councillors were open to looking at the exemplars if there was a clearly identified process for something to happen with the braham site so can I ask that acting chief executive efforts not chosen as an exemplar what process of any is underway to look at future use of the site and I would have to get advice on that maybe have an additional resolution added to ask for that information to come back I just think you know it's incredibly important if you're talking about getting people together that we asked for a report and do future options for brown village to come back to the council as soon as practical what well possibly but I think we need to have a process and train so so may or may be actually why don't_''_162.68 we ask why don't we ask the acting chief executive as part of the next update to provide us with some options for progressing it's just decision but touched on this last time when we were visiting grown and requested that is there any way because there's only one unit inhibited as far as I know how to baby nine of sitting there empty and a lot of people have wanted it gone is there any way that it could be ring-fenced and the insurance so that we are able to put a bulldozer through it and look at options for it so I support Yanni and what you want to I think it's run the process for future option foot for the future get a report on a process for developing future options in regards to the brown village side I just want to say that I think that they're the reasons against from village being an exemplar or meeting example of criteria the stage have been well traversed really and like you'll be aware that they include the the number of social housing units in the area and on brown street and certainly the noise and air pollution all those things have been real trivia so I just want to why I'm supporting their their carry streets up here it's not to it I'm having to also support that we have a report around the future use of brown village to this thus the amendment moved by councillor Livingston and sickened by someone that I can't now read Yanni can I put this amendment those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and it becomes the motion
It's six and three point seven do we need to actually nominate a counselor and a fourth person destination Christchurch trust yes yes you know well it this might be a short-term appointment do we want to nominate that person does anybody want to be on it Andrew drew did you say you are happy to do it read as I thought I heard wrongly Andrew thank you a fourth person to the canterbury museum trust I don't think ref is agreeing with it does anybody ask one that was his cool I'm assuming you don't want any we're very grateful for the opportunity but I must decline Bryce's yeah I'm very grateful slightly minutes his council can appoint any person does it have to be counseled it can be not it I know but actually given the need for what the museum has to do over the next few years you might actually want this to be a counselor I think does anybody want to be honor okay so at this stage we'll just move a point a fourth person and going to the local government conference I think might be come with it okay well in would like to do it thank you falling Pauline would love to do it and Andrew would love to be the only destination Christchurch trust okay then I would just like to point out a change to the staff recommendation as listed in your agenda under 3.3 with added a third bullet point so at a previous council meeting we're recommending and upper limit of a hundred thousand dollars to the community committee for heritage incentive grants there is currently not a delegation of up to 15,000 so what we are recommending is that you delegate that amount to the chief planning officer to approve grants up to that amount of money there has been a history with that previously but it wasn't as done as part of the previous decision and there is precedence and that's the another the community support manager has delegated authority for community grants up to fifteen thousand dollars makes a lot of sense I just the deputation we heard this morning the issue of hagley some stage to turn our mind to I did occur place with an evil within the committee structure where hagley park is specifically mentioned so it can perhaps we are staff to go and do some work on that and come back or maybe we can we try to do that before but we did we didn't really come up with it okay here in response just I'm following up on that I mean whereas it council really have to look at the structure of what's going into hagley park and prioritize in limit because without that it's just going to continue so just briefly we just need to have a time for the current committee cheers to meet to look at those those areas that are lying between the compare different committees as well as some other meter so it's making a time in the council diary thank you
Yeah known delicate sayani myself and Jimmy I think do we need to nominate the delegates delegates at this point since a relatively minor point that we could sort out later as the main point that one of the counselors is the alternate delat and vote it with voting rights is that what we need to do just don't go 4.2 I see so presumably on 4.1 and such other elected members as may be nominated at the council meeting so I so does anybody actually want to go the local government conference really sorry sorry ok so so there are can I just get a show of hands of how many people would actually like to go Wow 1 2 3 sit right 144 yeah nice goes 555 and it's a limit ominous no it's in Nelson I think they can take a minivan yep the Kent you can generally seen fight in the passing 526 counsel to the conference's so there's two things this is different from attending the AGM which you are required to appoint the voting delegate and the ultimate and like to go our councils Cotter Jones lovingston East chin and end yani enough people going I'm hippie not I think there's enough people going I think it's important that these people that have attended some of the zone meetings that do attend because there are issues that come up that people need to be aware of so but I'm open to and I understand that the mayor will also be attending to point to all about the innocent are those people are already going to point to that's a specific requirement under the rules of the annual general meeting of local government New Zealand that you need to appoint the mirrors the presiding voting delegate because you can have a certain number of people on the floor of the 8th annual general meeting so you can hurt you you need to name an alternate voting delegate and up to two other councillors who are attending the conference as the viewing delegates you can then have other councillors sitting around but not as formerly part of the meeting this which is obviously a cost attached one person unless you vote from the rest of the squeeze sitting around the to these people I mean that's a total cost of 1500 I think purpose and also assuming they all go by plane about three of them are tracking the cost the registration is fifteen hundred dollars plus accommodation and oh my goodness okay and flights or transport which is provided in the can I just let the mayor plus three go and that you go and pay Paper Scissors rocks and come back and tell us whom yeah okay thank you somebody else want to read the notes yeah you didn't really want to go did you the issue is that there is a major issue that's that's been happening over the last few months around this that's why we're not to Wellington for the special meeting but I think I think we can sort it out amongst ourselves okay so that some and what website three maximum of three others from Cotter Livingston East chin and your heads and who will sort that out amongst themselves can can go out and let us know yes you do just need to go name a counselor as the alternate voting delegate okay and I'm I 4.3 and who wants to be the alternate voting delegate one of you will decide okay so that is a separate one do you want to have at him as well well he's dead he's authorized tony but he doesn't invite no he's not until we do oh we get it so our maker saw a chip maker he's kinda off the local time and you'll see tender no I'm in an additional one at an additional cost it doesn't matter what he is its massive same amount of money so do you so we've got the mayor plus 3 do you want an additional one on top of that or do you want to sort out with them as well well that's three go all I support might make more as the zone 5 representative and I think the community board should ever represented the attorney they usually do well that's my suggestion to be your alternate voting delegate at the AGM one of those okay
We'll make a start item 20 of resuming in public and we are on item 21 yeah item 21 environment countries proposed land and water regional plan moved by Councillor clearwater signify councillor chin any questions of the staff yep item um ask Peter don't don't don't worry Peter okay jaani yeah I just I just found this quite difficult to understand we're joining the appeal do we we're becoming a party to the appeal but do we have specific concerns or are we just supporting the others concerns yes counselor the officers advice is that there are significant concerns if those appeals would be successful or unsuccessful so they cancel the recommendation is to remain join to the appeals and order to protect the council's position now what that means is FN appeal if successful would not be in the council's interests as being opposed so we're opposing effectively the appeal from federated farmers around around the environmental impact basically we're saying we want more safeguards around environmental concerns great right the federated Farmers one was the appeal was one point and that's to do with the activity status for activity within an area which is very important for the city's water supply the activity would be could be consented if the federated farmers appeal was successful and then thank you for explaining that one um the night ah who appeal what's what's going on there just in simple terms but what is the issue and what are we appealing the Lord appealing and support on the night ah who appeal raises the point of law that the night ah who submission and relation to the objectives and the plan seemed to have been accepted by the commissioners and that submission was that the objectives should provide in a more comprehensive way for protection of cultural values so the submission appeared to have been accepted but that didn't seem to be reflected and the actual text of the objectives as drafted in the commissioners decision so the appeal point of law is that there was not a logical connection between the decision and the result and so no tower who basically wants specific reference plan that's that's slightly separate part of the air appeal so the council position on that would be in support of the appeal in relation to the objectives but not supporting their relief sort which would require getting night ahoo approval for particular developments it was saying we basically want us to have cultural values be explicitly expressed in the document but not night ah who gives has the right of consent correct Marshall correct
So Sheldon is here for and that is the order from us committee who is the new chair welcome to and so we will do while you are here will do your public section and then there's a section of ordinary skill public excluded which will take immediately before lunch as well so that you don't have to come back some unknown time this afternoon okay so this is item 16 on page 23 okay item 16 the orders and risk management connecting okay welcome sir so anything you want to say thank you I just like to highlight to council that the audit and risk management committee with its new independent members has only met once quite recently with a focus on the duties of financial reporting external and internal audit insurance and risk management so I think we're quite early in our process considering the schools that have come on to the committee in that respect so levels of knowledge still getting up to date about happy to take any questions that you have on the report and and then to speak to the recommendation okay so Part A I item one internal audit status report no questions okay and that's that's item struggling to find real excitement there are we Part B and C okay the report is a hole in the public section be adopted those in favor please say aye those opposed what we're going to do now guys is just take the public excluded section of waters and risks so I'm going to need to go into committee for that item and then we're going to break for lunch and tell just so people know what's going on and how long do you want have now no I don't think isn't over now 130 130 130 okay okay until we will reconvene the council at 130 but we will take an item in public it excluded and we will move the requisite motion
I do have a point of clarity and a couple of changes we'd like to make to the resolution pass over to Steve there lad quickly please all quite minor hopefully if we turn to the resolution six point one point three the original idea when we drafted it is that we could get applications verbally or in writing given the contact the task force have with the affected people is probably going to be easier to manage if we do it all in writing we've drafted up a standard form that's basically the same sort of design as we use for the earthquake remission that will be available from through the task force team from our service centers or online I do I just I long silent phemus had a question around vulnerability and in its really if people are not if they're not in their homes they can apply but we know and you might pick this up too early at the meetings that there are people who are soldiering on and houses that should not be lived in do we have a ability either by council staff or by dhb or is there another vehicle that we can use to find those people because there's ones who don't come forward yeah I do know what you mean it's a fair question the short answer is from a rates perspective no that is a good question to ask the flooding task force though because they may have a better idea I've got to say that generally the way we treat the earthquake damage is on a reasonably rigid sort of a basis it requires people to actually get out of their houses and it's exactly the same situation happening there people are living in frankly awful situations but they for whatever reason can't or don't want to move out of their house and they're living in their current home the purpose of that remission when it started was to compensate people in a small way for the disruption of actually moving out and that's why it's not applied to people still there however unbalanced that might seem thank you I'm just concerned that who have literacy issues and their city something quite illiterate that you're not withstanding their written recommendation you're really asking for that to be changed so that the applications be made only in writing but can you just comment on hell for us if we're just to accept that help people who have literacy issues and fet will be able to apply well as I said they they'll be available obviously online but for a lot of people whether they litter or not that might be very available too they'll also be available our service centers and from the task force team themselves my expectation to be honest is it a bulk of people affected would have their initial contact with the task force team because this hospitals team have already been in contact with them that would be the first port of call the service centers would be the second border core and our call center will be briefed as well and they could be helped through but this is this is for them that would help give them information about it but in in to say to assist people to write fill out their applications I think so yes especially given the numbers involved again it's the same approach was taken for the earthquake damage there were several thousand to those thank you my questions about six point one point for getting a measure habitability what is habitable and what is and how do you define it because that's quite different from a dwelling which may be able to be occupied or not and the reason I ask this is that this was a part of previous councils debates over red zone houses yeah and I'm going to support this but I could never get my colleagues across the line over habitability so I'm really keen to try it nothing says I'm open to suggestion that the earthquake while news day as a parallel again with the earthquake one it was reasonably strict in and quite straightforward in that there's an expectation that there would be some correspondence from either an insurance company or an independent engineer that could give us comfort that yes this was genuinely really practical to achieve that reliance is going to be placed on the earthquake task force again to identify clearly if the house has been flooded more than twice or twice or more over the floorboards and it's been difficult to affect repair because of the delays people are waiting to do their apparent all councils done it to radiation then it'll be a judgment call it's a little bit less rigid than for the earthquakes but again given the relatively small numbers given the clear damage caused by the number of flooding events given also that the incentive for people to move out just you get the write submission is actually pretty small then there it's a risk I think that's the most practical way to do all sorry could I interrupt your weekend because that's I'm glad you raised that one other change we wanted to make to the resolutions if that's the right time to mention it is on six point one point four we should probably specify a backdating limit to the first event for the March yeah couple of quick things what is being done if anything to engage insurers who quite clearly are important in this at the assessment level I think you've already said yourself that there is I'm paraphrasing but some degree of reliance on the information coming from insurance companies and I saw I wonder what engagement if any has been secured with them none from the race team I don't know what the task blooding task force have done I'm sorry okay thank you four point five point eight remission should be set at a hundred per season rates and then forgive me as I read the rest of that it could be actually Mandarin could you explain that to me it's me more than anything I think would you mind um okay to earthquake rates permissions we give there's two principal ones that affect residential properties the the one that we talk about most of the time is the uninhabitable one where it's really just the way it's evolved it's trying to treat owners of uninhabitable damaged houses in the same way in other words it's ignoring the improvements it's just writing but it is still rating on the value of but you're writing on the land and they it's such a gratitude right yes and so in that case damaged house not demolished damaged house demolished equal treatment but still pay rates on the land the other earthquake remission the section 12 fours for the port hills is where the council has effectively forced people to evacuate because of the danger of rockfall and so on one hundred percent commission has given to those people and at the time it was considered that that was more appropriate because it wasn't really something that they could remedi eight if you've got a problem because of a rock above your house that's not on your property you can't do anything about it council is taking an action to force you out of there you've got to wait until a third parties remediated something before you can move back into a property that might not even be damaged thinking was that this situation with the people are out of their house because of the damage but it's difficult for them to fix the damage their property until after council has done it immediately because either themselves that their insurance company isn't comfortable about making those repairs if there's a significant risk of refloating prize of that was he saying it's likely that one hundred percent remission allowed the s 1 point for application would work would be applied in this situation as well that's the proposal yes I thank you here you have great thanks okay no further questions Yanni so like there will be people that have hardship because of the flooding that don't move out of their house for whatever reason is there any process or policy that we have in place that we could actually consider some form of remission for those people not at the moment no and that that's the same for the people living in damaged earthquake houses if they're still in their property at the moment there's no remission for end of it is very difficult unless we've to bring back by the end of May so that's outside the scope of this report actually I think this was one of the issues that was raised at the time and one of the reasons for this coming back was there was concern that there's people that have been really adversely affected financially who have financial hardship because of the flooding that that we possibly would want to consider some sort of Rights permission but you guys haven't obviously done that work so focused on the rate remission element of the request absolutely it was a direction to us to come back with a proposal around rates remission for flooding affected read pass so my understanding that council actually has a it has some form of process by which a people do have financial hardship regardless of what caused that they can actually seek some sort of form of rates relief there are there's a government rebate scheme based on income there are arrangements we can make for for instance automatic payments payment schedules but there's there's no part of rates policy that financial hardship but they can currently apply to the Me's Welfare Fund they want to also okay they can't currently apply to the Me's Welfare Fund isn't there restrictions that were on that fund have been completely limit lifted so that it's available for any form of hardship and the limits been slightly raised as well I should say as well for elderly people in financial difficulty we do have a postponement scheme where rates can be postponed and interested we charge as if it alone would it be fair to say that because of the need to make some decision and apply something like a rates for mission ASAP it was the terms of reference were kicked to what was considered around the earthquake rates remission so that we weren't reinvent in the wheel I'm just looking to respond a little bit to what Yanni was saying and although there may be other issues that's what you were looking at and basing your recommendations on so that we could get something in place for people as soon as possible in part also the precedent which is very useful I think to be honest even if we had more time it will be very difficult to come up with a robust regime that tried to effectively what we're talking about is trying to quantify a degree of hardship and it's such a difficult thing to do in a robust sword away and the resources required to do it right particularly that was equitable across the city given the state of some people's health resources quite a blunt installation yes I totally understand I've got Jimmy Paul Pauline van cracius that we got into guarding the issue the other flood-affected areas if outside the mail fraud in pasco false report you know for a couple weeks ago for instance the last week during the annual plans review Templeton you know resin association on behalf of the community in my host tree in a run in a street in case they have any dream foster to coastal flooding and settle or in host work area where we close to LA henderson basing these candle coaster the flag whether nor can the rights remission policy would apply in circumstances where people had moved out of their houses they are uninhabitable due to flooding and from memory the templeton one was more flooding outside the chemists and the local store them into their houses so with that particular example it's probably not applicable and people probably wouldn't have moved out of their houses but this is not defined by a geographical zone more than more the events I think also there's an expectation amongst the task force team that the publicity around this will actually prompt people who have been affected and not previously identified to actually come forward and contact them and that's why in the financial analysis 5.3 there which is really put in at the eleventh hour in this paper it was an acknowledgement that well the initial expectations we might end up with more for exactly that sort of reason every fair to say that if we open the band width of eligibility to this this relief we could therefore cause normal rate payers who are actually struggling to pay their own rates to what those problems caused so would that be a fair assumption because we don't really know exactly how big this is going to be it could be a million there could be three million which is in for therefore a percent of the rates race got one percent affects a large amount of people so the question I'm asking is the white of the band with the more problems we could cause for existing rate payers to apply if we open the bandwidth her that's exactly the trade-off with this this type of rates remission policy and you'll see in paragraph 2.5 and 2.6 that there's been some attempt to quantify what the impact might be on on the overall rate space based on some expectations of other size which of the stages is still reasonably still reasonably rough in terms of an estimate might have a large degree of variability around it but you can see in there we're saying point 14 seen point to the scene type of range at this point that been into the wedge to the concept is a reasons why this along with the earthquake ones before it tried to make the criteria sufficiently narrow that it was both clear without too much subjective judgment and also not creating that sort of affected talking about just a quick technical question around six point one point four so if somebody was to some in the gray area somebody is living in their house and it's actually not habitable they now go okay look I can go this is good they still be eligible to have that back dated to the date of the flood which caused that audit be from when they move out so he's still living in it now this they go okay actually this is going to make it okay for me to go and stay somewhere else and they go now and it's a genuine reason because they have been living near and they shouldn't have been are they eligible to to back date for the flood the proposal as it stands is only from the date that they actually move out the logic of that was one consistency with the compensation is small part of compensation for the disruption and difficulty in costs divided it be clarified in thee and the resolution near if the public are reading that they might just think will I go now I can backdate my to the date of departure from the property but in any case no later then no earlier than the fifth of match excellent yeah yeah only to get that comes what would have wouldn't last year of course anyone to leave not that we're aware of but it was something that we were sensitive to any game on techna pastor Phil improv every concept here if someone had been in a particular house that for whatever reason was flooded by a freak event or a storm water or whatever else and they moved out for six months while the insurance was done we don't get involved on that kind of very clear on dinero no no okay Andrew and then we might put it um one of the areas identified in in the original resolution that set up the task force was littleton and it's as some peculiar issues regarding flooding which relate to the relationship between flooding and landslides would of the way that the staff recommendation has been framed cover if somebody was out of their house because of a flood related lenslet would that be covered by this or does it need to be specified probably but I'm thinking it's possibly better if it is specified not being considered is the honest answer today what are typically done in in previous situations is moved amendments to these resolutions to to have put in there or flood-related landslip page just suggested an instant judgment and I agree that it I don't think that will be included by by these the intention is for direct flood damage so water entry into the home okay are you happy with six point one point four is it narrows just slight movement to take into account Pauline's I think so yes sorry are you guys okay with it because okay okay can I put these before you do I'm sorry six point one point six and very minor technical adjustment but before manager okay we can do that so can I go back to the point Andrew was raising because with people in literally say whether the flooding affected leaned in the will end slips and it this excludes them from being able to have any rates rebate and I just seems to me that in fairness of because we're including other areas that we should include that component that I did know Peters consumed but I minus ten years is not a lot of properties currently affected but could we have some comment about there now I think to cover the issue of a further report and perhaps we need to ask for that though would be a fear we're doing it because we you're right we don't have any clearer understanding of the number of properties set little and graffitied yeah yep do we need to change this one for ya sorry literary advisor quite right to six point one point for the wording just doesn't quite make sense can we change it so it's any remission will be backdated to the debate date that render done it how to thank you ah you're quite right delete that one as well hey thank you laughs
And the item number 19 the report of the Housing Committee gleam and Pauline moved clin seeking to Pauline right thank you if I quickly just give you a rundown on status of our social housing we have eighty-four percent of our units open 306 on our waiting list unfortunates continued to grow I'm coming to the partay item paden eighty-four percent yep that's 2219 units open 290 units repaired I think we're over 300 now just given the time leak with the report our DS are completed we opened 12 new units last week as you know sqc negotiations continue we have various tenders out at the moment or in the process of it one includes that for red zone houses with that trial proposed to shift them open tender anyone is welcome to to go on to tender link if they wish to participate the main thrust of this report is to endorse staff preparing a report on prioritization of the social housing se prepare in rebuild programs that is the part a part of this report which 16 councils agreement the lumbering here the kultur all separate I'll checklist our number over there if we can just does that latest number include the Morris Carter court 12 additional units just with the time Megan reports between council meetings to me okay but the number open Jimmy is to 219 not 2663 that's the total portfolio but that includes the ones in the red zone and the ones that aren't yeah but they're not not all of those are open okay and more questions sorry yonni ref is next sorry I'm can I speak to start never about the insurance claim on the social housing Dara Moses facilities rebuild manager Darren and what's the latest status of the insurance claim with eq see the latest status the technical negotiations on both parties are still ongoing with a view to refining the final Delta between both parties probably within I would imagine the next month with a view Devine leaving net delta for the negotiating teams have been taken into negotiations okay now I was under the impression that we were going to get another 10 million dollar check from latest on that is I've left a message within symptom of eq see who's left a message with me a couple of weeks back talking about the 10 million coming through in a week or so so I'm chasing a week or so from when from about two weeks ago okay the money has not yet been received right so would you be able to follow that up today yes and then I can chase that up okay thanks thank you um you know this is obviously taking longer than we would have hoped I think at the committee we were told that we've done our word we're now waiting for eqc to basically do theirs finish their work when we understand there's there were an amount that we have a difference on I think you call it the delta but the money under there is intention that that money will come to us I mean I heard about the 10 million obviously there will be more than that is it a process for us to get the transfer of that money up until becomes outstanding as the difference there's no requirement on EQC to do that and in fact the the additional 10 million that they're talking about returning to us comes close to the to an area into which they might become uncomfortable around the delta so I do think the best path forward like it is for the some of the other parts is to try and get agreement on their overall sum that eq seen and us can agree on right and then the second question I have is at the committee meeting we really quite good reputation from former councillor David close and we have asked for a full financial breakdown when can we expect to get the detailed information around the housing so that we can understand the essence for those councils that weren't there of his reputation was really questioning why there's no money in the housing fund given the issue around depreciation given he had some quite simple calculations that would show that we should at least be may have been making a profit we will be submitting the financial report at before then because I think it's relevant to the consultation we're currently out with our community and one of the concerns it was raised by um dead mr. David coast was the fact that people being asked to make submissions on a on some assumptions without understanding that underlying financial reason why we're in that situation so I think it's really important we release this information as soon as possible so that we can heaven submissions to our social housing consultation I think we could do it sooner but I'd still do it through the committee if we could have a special committee meeting if you want I think it's messy if we go out I'll get committee process sorry to cut and I just thought I put my yes so the information will be ready for the next Housing Committee the information that's gone out around the statement of proposal and the summary of information contains a lot of information about all of the 20-plus options and their impact on the housing fund so there's substantial financial analysis and also the impact on rates as well appropriate would you be able to confirm that the money that is outstanding from eq c and has been for a very very long time are we also seeking interest on that not an easy question although it sounded you know reasonably easy the the money which gqc has that they're willing to forward to us isn't a requirement at this point it's not an obligation on them however as with many many claims as your individual claims escalate through time and cost escalation you reach particular kept limits so there will be increases in in the claim that are inherent within the time frame as the longer it takes to close it out thanks Vikki I just wanted to pick up on yannis point and I think what were you coming from yonni creep me from wrong but that was the consultation around the housing this seems to be a perception that it cannot function social housing is not working and what we've called for is the report of the accounts to that may show that something has gone reason why it's not functioning thinking that light of that is part of the consultation that some information that should be known because people may have a different response if they believe that it's not performing that it cannot perform an actual fact historically as David close spoke to us and said it it did in the past so is that we were coming from yeah in consultation close the consultation closes on the twenty-sixth of Jane yep it was the only item the other items that for infant information
Thank you this is the community committee removed yarny seconded Ellie just say councillors we've got a workshop scheduled on the twenty-ninth of May to look at the priorities around our community facilities with the new council so really this is just a continuation of their reporting against progress on some of our buildings but we are going to have a really good look at the prioritization shortly so just if you've got questions or detailed comments around it I think it's probably this to hold off until we've had that workshop and raise questions at that time can I just also say that the bishop Dale library report has been worked through with staff I know that the phenyl by Maori community board came to our annual plan hearing expressing concern that nothing had happened actually a lot has been done by our staff to ascertain the cost of repair and versus the cost of rebuild and weighing up the different maintenance costs that just fixing an old building what would have versus if we made it may be made it a bit more modern we note on why Mary community board it didn't go on Monday but I have been told by staff it's you know just delayed by about ten days so they can get that detailed information so yeah thanks okay this appropriate just to talk to 5.1 as part of the committee report and it relates to the vote that we've just taken on the Lido pool I just wanted to make really clear that despite many people thinking that I don't like swimming pools and don't think that community should have facilities like swimming pools back ASAP that is absolutely not the reason for my vote on that what I'm concerned about is what appears to be a trend and coming back for not you know in significant amounts of money for projects and I do wonder whether we are looking at the front end of these facilities repairs and rebuilds enough to really look at getting the best bang for our buck and my pointers that should be able to be saved or even not asked for in projects like this it in able to get their facilities repaired or new facilities sooner than is currently budgeted so I just wanted to make that clear and I think the point of the workshop on Thursday is to go through the prioritization so that there isn't any more of the ad hoc ad hoc approach that's kind of thurston be stressed yeah okay thank you that the information we received move cancelo moved and seconded le those in favor please say aye the report as a whole be adopted those in favor of plays police say aye those opposed carried that was moved by the sand castles and second it and there's that pic
Kept you to move the committee recommendation moved Gianni seconded so was it okay so we're on item one while some lighter pool with here put that those in favor please anybody want speak no those in favor please say aye those opposed carried weren't recorded yeah facilities rebuild plan to repair a Victoria Park Information Center moved yani seeking to fill those in favor aye aye those opposed carried item three Canterbury Earthquake heritage building fund change of trustees if I can move this and just speak to it yes you may um thank you this is really I've checked with our staff and this is our staff are really comfortable with this we've had a memo in response to some concerns that that were raised I think the key thing here is that this fund is really coming to the end of its useful life but it's just washing it up and making it a bit more streamlined in terms of how its administered so I know that council Livingston's on this trust and you know he might wish to give our pragmatic response to some money that was put aside for heritage I think is about a million dollars remaining in the pot and the government and the Heritage New Zealand have agreed to work through our staff in terms of any disposal of that money through to heritage project so I'm relatively relaxed about us I think it just removes a layer of it removes a layer of external oversight that probably at this time we could do without and so I can't see any harm in agreeing to the changes as requested ah you
I'm moved clean seeking to david and I'll put that those in favor please that the report be received those in favor please say aye those opposed carried that takes us on to the council resolution check out on page 25 any comments issues concerns not sorry Dave just the fact that we've got some of them thats it back in two thousand eight and 2011 and we're good to see those off the system they've been repeatedly coming back on on things month after month but we don't see any great progress about them actually coming to an end I think staff would like that to happen to so perhaps will ever look at them and suggest for these ones are weight forward or I think it would be beneficial if we didn't have anything that was more than a year old
Sheldon here no not yet ok so the Air Care Committee the earthquake committee of the whole I I'll move it and enjoy see conduct from the CEO and psychoactive substance a I'll put that no discussion put that those info place here I those Pro carried and the Sumner road reopening project moved probably by Andrew and seconded probably by Paul okay any debate that's quite a long for the next not I'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried gosh the land is recovery program and all of its and all of the rest of the agenda Pat be put the report as a whole does encompass a I as opposed carried sorry I thought we did have a sorry button from felon ten secretive thank you thank you yeah okay so we might leave audit and risk because the new chair is coming at twelve-thirty and go on to the community committee on page 219 that's okay with everyone item 17
Um write the report of the Acting CEO what you've got sim and we need to resolve to include the supplementary reports with this you've all got it okay we'll resolve that way any discussion questions yanny dis on the acting CEO um yep can can we is it possible to get a final copy of the avon river plan with timeframes and budgets I'm just have repeatedly asked with us for both the accessible transport and for other things that we've considered and I'm constantly told that there's a a confidential concept plan up on the counselors lounge from jun 2013 so how can we get as a council an understanding of what's happening in the admin river project the money that we're spending which is I think six million and what the timeframes budgets and finalized planners thank you for the question which you did send through yesterday and yes Lee part of the answer is the plans were shown to councillors and the council made available to councillors and quite some beat that a year out of dying done you're quite some time ago that's correct so I've picked up that question will come back in the next report can we get it sooner like it's pretty important to some of the decisions we're making today to actually know what's happening do you have a copy of the plan we don't have a copy as account no we don't have a copy as a council we got into the South friend I have a two questions the first 1i based on the other information source friender consists of three de are part of name one is the middle three blocks seconds innovation precinct last one health precinct what's the main function purpose for middle three blacks because I can't understand you here only mentioned I supplied with a sector or the public sector by your privacy the innovation precinct to cover health precinct to cover the kind of the public sector lots of main purpose I'll pick that up that question up and included in the next report thank you second question you said in here particular land is owned by private the piece laying on a search for ever I'm nachos Council of Sarah engage with name to a solar equation ax passes if they refuse protect how to alleviate this effect yeah and chain thanks for attending to all these items and like the one for example on the traffic management plan for Eddington I'm aware that that's difficult in terms of pulling it together and I just want it all together if preps though because Eddington isn't the only suburban area can just said if we the Environmental Committee preps decide on a process to deal with these issues our head head considered say a working group but understand perhaps that needs to be more discussion about processes because there's a number of these I think that's a good suggestion and staff will talk to you as the cheer about how to make that happen and I just like to ask one as well and it's the rubble at the corner of Colombo and brawn streets which are noise annoys me intensely every time I see it the agenda with what's happening on it so that we can actually get rid of that powerful okay thank you just on item 1.32 so many oxford terrace sale and purchase agreement that's centennial pole you say that the insurer's reinsurers have included their investigations the resolution was subject to set especially resolution of the insurance issues have the reinsurers and insurers agreed that that's a total economic loss and that we will get the full sum insured on that building I can't answer that one but I know that there is a yeah yeah it's you've done all the assessment they require to reach of you and then whether they agree it's a total write-off for anything else is subject to further negotiations so what they've done is they've completed their system but it concerns me because I think at the time it was a concern was that if they don't agree thats a total we cannot write off which is what we were previously advised then we actually might want to fix Centennial because actually within we's flexible for two or three this is giving us this even ordered 60 that's actually got so you need to give a further update on insurance and the publican student section of the agenda so can I ask really a sequester for the acting CA how can you approve the sale and purchase agreement when we don't have satisfactory resolution of the insurance issues I think what we're seeing is will brief you on the PX session about that this is I mean this is but the actual and was subject to the insurance investigation being complete as well it was subject to resolution of the insurance because there's a violent and difference if we wait for the actual resolution of the insurance nothing will happen in the city for a long time or at least the next several months which is not the situation that we want to get into but the difficulty that we had was similar to the a number of other buildings where they were saying that this was repairable and wanted to do their own engineering investigation so the engineering issue with this site it's been made very clear to us by Sarah that will be a compulsory acquisition if it doesn't happen like this so we but the issue for us is that we're supposed to be a prudent watchdog other facilities and we were we were basically given the impression for a long time that the insurer had agreed that this was a total loss we then found out fairly late in the piece before we discussed selling it that the reinsurer didn't share that view which basically means we're leaving a lot of money on the table so we might have chosen to Centennial Paul if we'd known that the insurance position was a certain way and I thought we were pretty clear when we debated this that the counselors were only keen to approve us effort was on the basis that the insurance issues had been resolved they haven't been resolved so you know I'm sorry but Sarah can change things all the time what we should actually have a right to get what we're properly in the resolution and I took legal advice on this hence the we moved it forward yani we looked at the cost of repairing or rebuilding Centennial early in the year and it was around from memory about nine point nine either 9 million I'm going from memory now have got it either way in terms of the repair will rebuild and we know that this land is going to be taken by compulsory acquisition either way the difficulty that we had was the actual inspection physically by the insurance people my hunch is that we will probably get to a situation where the individual sites don't matter that much anyway in the insurance deal but I don't obviously want to discuss that in the public section of the meeting so I think Jane has satisfied everything that we asked of her in this one and it will do it in regards to the the issue around sort of on the page was around the alignment with the skirt work on page the cushion Appendix A information on skirt alignment with city plan and suburban master plans so was really around the central city accessible transport plane we're making decisions today around the head so what um clearly I mean clearly it's there is no alignment at the moment so we know we're going to get that report to be able to look at at that alignment that's pretty it's pretty urgent is there something can we get a sense of what that report is likely to say this is being prepared for the next earthquake recovery committee which is means that excess sorry I was the district plan Yan tomorrow yeah yeah first of June but what I can't understand is because we don't have this information how can we vote on things around the central city without understanding what better lineman going our financial situation we we advise skirt that we want things aligned we're going from the position that workers aligned as much as it can be not the other position which I think you're probably coming from what concerns me as we've got this huge financial hole about you know half a billion maybe plan projects that we've agreed that will do without community but in the meantime we've got skirt happening that's putting that like-for-like in some cases less for like that isn't taking into account those plans and I don't think we're going to be able to afford to come back later and actually do those plans when most the money has already been spend I'm putting it back as it was rather than what we've told the community it should be so I mean it's pretty fundamental to our stealing with our major financial situation and with we found with salisbury street for example we need to improve extra money to do enabling works even when previously were told that skip works had taken into account the future plans I do take into account all these plans yes design and over into the area of the accessible cities transport which is coming up later on so crossing and over to the master plans that we're going to approve today the muscle is that we're engaged right size when we come the professor problem the money has been wasted now we'll have the experts at the end of the table to help you through these questions just thanks Jane on an item for the flooding task force stage two and the second bullet point the shedule face-to-face meetings with the residents to establish the preferences can you explain what they're actually the preferences for what is that the long-term options or initials short-term options and it'll be face to face interviews with people to see we could do this or we could do that what do you think rather than imposing solutions on them okeydoke so that will happen at the public community meetings or just individual individually and these are happening no they're happening now oh yes are they yes very good thank you 22 comments as well on their Belfast freezing weather influent so I'm assuming that that will improve by June this year is that a fair assessment to make this is where the freezing works gets to dump this their stuff into the river which just seems very 1930s and and just would you like to have an update I would love to have another believe we put a ring up maybe for a month awesome thank you thank you anything else on the CEOs report if not
Clearly pepper now a community boards exit for Elian pauline of course so Pauline will move and Eloise second item one on speed limit changes and we taking the report as a whole loss or Road by road no excellent I'll put it I have an issue with marcin throat right okay tell us your issue with Nationals road actually the next one ha so are you on this clause or the next clause Dave no you're not on this clause then why are you speaking to vote again on this clause unless close and this course or the next run wanna vote on five point one point four I just don't others but again oh those in favor of the community board recommendation please say aye those opposed and now moshlings road deep it's greater thanks I'm happy with the status quo commotions road so I'll move an amendment that remain as is all rights 870 it's 8080 Beyond prisons right I'm happy to leave it as it is I know they do yes the reason being at 3.14 is the it's really it's come about from a safety reason as the fifth highest risk corridor for fatal and serious injury crashes so you know that's what's the staff recommendation and the board supported it click the other issue is that it's the location of it to that it's the moving of that change that is important because the distinguished not very clear that that on the road where that speed change you know should happen so that's why we're looking at bringing in a little early because it's safer and people and actually see that there is a change there so that was the other thing that ties in with the road safety the recommendation moved by Pauline seeking to play Ellie and yours is a negative so you're just going to vote against it okay so those in favor please say aye those opposed do you want your vote recorded Dave Dave would like is vote recorded thank you it's carried and then the next item that you've got is on page 119 so write some more please say aye those opposed carried the report is a hobby sorry one no sorry Dave yep yep that's right okay and we've done item number 13 and so we're now on item number 14
Do that and the so now the motion as a whole this extent of motion I'll put that goes in favour as mended those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and thank you and the park the items be received that those clothes ok I suppose carried thank you that concludes the finance committee report and we'll go back now to the Shirley papanui community board on page 113 that we haven't dealt with yet and we don't have anybody
We're hearing a lot about actually utilize better utilization of the space and within the Heritage framework has there any been any thought given to perhaps how we can actually make those spaces better and better better use by using an architect or an interior designer to forecast how these rooms can be utilized better that way there doesn't necessarily need to involve a at least lessee to actually do that but it must be certain ways you've got staircases certain places doors of certain places rooms at a certain configuration and actually getting the best use of those I'm not a hero today heritage expert however from the stuff that we've got the information we've got from the heritage people is that this is a category one very very highly valued Kendra building with a lot of history in each room has its own history and for that reason they would not have considered moving any walls or any staircases because each part is part of the fabric of that building and so that's our concern in the concern of the program want to change the fabric the way that building is designed then you get extended periods of time which adds to cost so that is up there is a definite risk so natural fact there's no way we can change the interior this building so the tender process is the length of the tender process is quite irrelevant you can in the htc's somewhere in the program managers report there there is a clause that says you can when if you can hang on half a second yes accepted that minor alterations may be made in heritage buildings to be code compliant or meet the operational needs of tenants however in the experience of people and the business in the industry it's unlikely that you get that ok and so and to go through that process adds time so that's just a word of caution but that is really important it's very important and that's why it's really important that the operator has input not just the heritage people that this thing actually works well um andrew is going to suggest this melody if I can put them to Peter first of all just to get some staff at rice and then yeah then we'll talk about the amendment so we've had this deputation and as a matter of process and as a matter of respect for the deputy I just had a couple of questions Peter for you relating to the issue of perceived or actual conflicts of interest and there's a suggestion in the deputation that the V based directors should have sat back from the table at the Finance Committee and that the V based directors should not be involved in the decision today can can I get your view and some advice on that place I I don't_''_192.54 I don't agree with that view I believe the V base directors are entitled sit around the table today and discuss the mona vale as you I think the the and it seems to be the the allegation of a conflict has come up because well v base got this in terms of a five-year contract in the Botanic Gardens a few months ago in there's reference extracts referred to from the auto general around conflicts of interest pieces put together I think of more interest when you read that whole report that the auto general wrote back in 2010 they talked about if you've been a point of the council's represented so far our council controlled organization which D basis and you oughta general makes the comment that role not usually prevent you from participating authority matters concerning the other organization especially if the role give you specialized knowledge with that we're here today talking about does the council publicly tender this lease or not and in that regard to the very style of a process and while you may say well yes there was a conflict it is a very minimal low level conflict and also to the courts have taken the views over the view of the years that when you're dealing with an elected member bodies such as a council you need to have regard to what are you talking about if you're talking about a thing like grant and resource consent or liquor license the issues that the council deals with eg publicly Tina release then there is not the issue there around conflicts of interest the same degree so my view that a su shun is is unwarranted as far as the B base to read as I can see they are entitled to vote on this matter today this is my amendment up there now I've seconded the motion as it stands I think so I don't know whether that leaves me not in a position to put the amendment but this is some wording for an amendment that I suggested it's free ok is there a second a bullet thanks Yanni okay she loves any discussion on that actual discussion we finish with questions yeah discussion thank you um look I you know I I actually thought it would have been more prudent to go out to as to consider negotiating directly around the previous tenant I was concerned that at least was terminated quite quickly after the earthquake when we didn't actually have any timeframe for repair of the building and so we didn't know that're learning a lot along the way but I recognize that the majority of my colleagues today wish to go out to some sort of open process and so rather than going back to the committee I think it makes sense to put a very strict time frame on that process so that we can get try and get that synergy between the operator the design they're consenting in the repair um personally I think this was a unique situation which would have merited going out and negotiating with the previous tenant had been there since nineteen sixty eight I think I would it would be hard to see in my view even if we go out for an open tender another provider being able to provide the experience and the sorts of service that this one had but I accept that you know this is a good compromise I do think it's important though that counts us that we do take a consistent approach and the lieutenant garden centre is very relevant because that was didn't a process it did not go out for tinder that be involved with and I do think I've heard the advice and stuff but I do question you know I think the v based counselors need to think clearly that if you're if you're going to participate in this vote effectively depending on if it goes out for an open process or it just goes straight to negotiate with the existing supplier there is a benefit to v base and tombs have been able to enter into the tender process on this resolution so you know I think we do need to be really clear I appreciate the vivos councillors didn't take part in the botanic garden center and rightfully so that was good that they stood aside from that but this is really around a competitive prices that would enable vivos to enter into into it so I think we do need to have some caution around that I'm going to leave the v base counselors to but something for them to take legal advice as they will and they may prefer from the city solicitor rather than from usual so but I just clear as a council so you know I welcome the fact that we're going to go through this open transparent process we need to apply this to all of our things going forward whether it be car parking buildings whether it be cafes and botanic gardens whether it be other facilities and I think that the main lesson from me from this is that when we're rebuilding facilities we actually need to think about the use and the tenancy at the same time and probably that's been the gap that you've had Finance Committee doing the leasing community committee during the repair rebuild report and I think we need to just learn and and have those aligned so in future we get a more seamless process thank you at the time of the promotion of the council's procurement policy the key driver was transparency obviously that's one part of the overall procurement equation whole of life cost savings at the end of the day are a part of the whole thing the reason I wasn't_''_574.15 at the October the sixth meeting last year a family crisis my mother-in-law died after correction that day so but I wouldn't have agreed so I wasn't_''_587.23 at the meeting but I want have agreed with this and would have voted similarly to councillor Johansson the factors we have to have openness in Finn's Piron see of fully support us I don't buy the argument about Vee base directors not being able to take part that's just drawing too long though for me I can't see how that sticks up and I agree with the staff advice vers I fully support these recommendations your attention Andrew is that your actual wording what's now been put there delegate authority to the Finance Committee so what you meant right at you are you comfortable with it yani are you comfortable with it okay great it's just a slight change and Tim and in Andrew and I really want to clarify what ya need the V V race directors did not take part in the decision with regards to leasing of the botanic gardens and I do get sick of tired of it we have to look at what meetings board members consultant sit on a relevant of CC hlv base of whatever because I mean we are here as councillors we do step away when advised with regards to to legal possible land conflicts etc so you know let's just get over that one place and personally I think that it logically I would have liked to have seen the cat their current or that previous arm lessee kept on for slightly longer to ensure that it gets up and running because Mona Vale is a feature of our city and it's going to be with us and hope hopefully functioning extremely well and profitable for the next 50 to 100 years so to spend a little time now I think would have invested a lot of time later on so that's personally my do I think andruw's amendment as an excellent one and a way to move forward so thank you great thank you certainly on the issue of conflicts of interest I mean the very reason I asked the question to Peter was because I'm and it's been handled in different ways of various committees and various meetings I've been passed off so it's good to have that advice today and certainly I'm happy to rely on the advice that peace has given us in terms of participation in the in the vote I'd certainly like to endorse the comments of councillor johansson and council Livingstone around transparency and and open process the reason for the amendments is essentially the need to expedite the process to allow the new tenant to have them maximum input into design and fit-out outcomes and that's what really needs to happen to to get the best result for this important facility the reason for bringing the matter back to the Finance Committee if we're doing everything we can to expedite the tender process then my thought in bringing back to the Finance Committee is that that allows us to also then speed up the decision-making process so that we can get a new tenant in place as quickly as possible to get the best outcome for this facility so I Doge colleagues speed and efficiency things um and I just want to quickly just touch on just to remind everyone that we are voting on the amendment here so that's on speaking to which is the addition which is around the six-week time frame for the tender process and then bringing back the recommendation from staff or finance committee for final sign-off just so I can only speak once I will sort of encompass the substantive with the original one though their toe obviously be best readers took no part in the Botanic Gardens there was a council decision so that's aside from this the only way that I would think that there could be any conflict would be that if the V Bay Street is set here today and put an amendment that V base was given the contract to run the botanic gardens so putting it out for tinder is probably the complete opposite of any form of conflict because it's saying it's just have the best operator there and just FYI vos doesn't tendering for it anyway so let's just have this person put the best foot forward and then we can set it and if you limit your options you're going to ultimately limit your outcome so we want to have the best possible people in there and and the staff will go through that process and will ensure that we'll get there I'm actually gonna vote against the amendment sorry Andrew I understand the intent behind it and respect that but for two reasons one is round round one is around speed and the other one is around governance and management the six-week time frame I I just don't think with us really governance as place to tell management you know how hard to manage this they they hear what we're saying that we want d expedited as much as possible and and I feel that that's been captured and too I think I just think it holds it up to then once the staff go and do their management job and then to bring back a management issue back to governance I just think there's a real crossover of governance and management we a good recommendation there it's gone through the committee process steam come to council we've sort of stretched out again now we're changing it again that's saying basically that governments want to involve ourselves and management so I trust the staff and that's why we have stuff and the ones that are actually better qualified than all of us around the table to make that cool so I kind of want to back then I met them do the job so voting against the Amendment because I think it's a crossover of governments management and slows things down and doesn't really alter anything respect the intent of it dose if things don't take anything personally well if we're discussing the amendment I understand what you're saying Jamie but I think that the wording lea captures it quite well when it says employees best endeavours so it's not saying you must come back in six weeks in 6.4 really is a stimulating 6.2 but in a different format so I don't think it's going to change very much I'm wondering whether we can actually put the amendments secretly 6.3 and 6.4 I'll hear what Jamie sang with with the the time frame issue and and I sort of noted before hearing staff saying was probably going to be fairly tight to be doing this sort of work so I don't really have a lot of support for 6.3 and that respect but got regarding the sort of sensitivity of the thing I'm reasonably comfortable with it coming back to the Finance Committee for approval I respect Jamie's point of view that there is a guess there is a crossover between them governance and management but I'd be happy if those two resolutions for put separately and concerns have been expressed around governance management separation and and so on I mean my view is that this is a question of governance setting the agenda in terms of the timeline we've questioned staff to make sure that you know I mean my original intention would have been to put a four-week timeline on this which I understand now on the advice of staff's going to be a push but we we can do that I'm sure if staff aren't capable of doing that they'll be coming back to talk to us but what we're doing is sending the strongest possible signal of our expectations based on staff advice of how quickly this can be delivered so yeah just to address those points okay thank you that was nominally a right of reply um alright just very quickly I don't understand the 6.4 so we don't make decisions on tenders is that correct not normal is what we're suggesting in this case that comes back to you because this has gone to university place okay so I'll put them separately as per the request so the what you're currently voting on is 6.3 okay if you won't clear what they're doing can I put that those in favor please say aye those opposed to clear that carried you can if you if it's requested you certainly can yep right to clear that one carried thank you and now you're voting the finance committee for their decision rather than being delegated to the Corporate Services Manager okay clear on that I'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed to clear up carried you want another division you want another one of those or do you just want to record your vote against it well it's hard to do it before you press the button right do you want to do you want a division okay so you've got your things in front of you if you can just press that as well and to clear it carried right okay
And then I promise to move on to the Finance Committee in response to the deputation so that is item fifteen page 141 rare you want to move breath moves and Andrew seconds okay item number one the rod run with banks peninsula trust that those in favor please say aye those posed see CHL report on the performance of council control trading organizations you need a mover for each of these okay ref and Andrew again I'll put that coefficients those in favor please say aye those opposed carried item three move the same people the corporate finance report any questions okay Jimmy we didn't actually record that action from the meeting from my memory so apologies for that well we'll get on to that and return the question to you we did record a question from camp counselor Johansson regarding some of the debts and the PX section which we have responded to but I'll take away your questions thank you I note that a wash-up payment was expected from the crown in April I'm covering costs 232 jun 2013 that we lodged million and it's almost over a year ago nearly a year so can you just advise have they paid us the money if so great if not when can we expect it I can advise that they have not yet paid us the money and that I have mentioned this as recently as Tuesday morning again with Laura Kozak's of zero who is expediting the appropriation process to try and return and to us that washed up money but there is no at this stage ETA on that all right so can I just ask like you know clearly this is 26 million that they owe us have they given you any reason why they're not paying us this money it's been since a team at 30th yes they have difficulty with the appropriations procedures and the ability of Sarah to pay under the current appropriation policy roughly right to Jerry or what we don't but well it's kind of where we've been the lutsen from the committee to now so I know that it doesn't seem to be work I mean it just I do wonder whether given it's obviously an issue with appropriations that it's something that needs to be raised with the minister just a quick question on it is it subject to interest year sitters into that pasta regarding to attachment five these are building infrastructure improvement allowance fun I'm still concerned even we particular mention here three pointer to pointer to you know any other insurance procedure for these the project will be credited to allowance as fun as receive I just want to know whether is there any ler council-owned committee project has already received any you know the insurance can firmly ensure all this candle is fun looks like the volume but neat-o quality to this fine is my concern here and thank you counselor the is there's a couple of questions and then I'll try and answer h intern we have received some payments for insurance mainly around where indemnity has been accepted and we've received those payments not with respect to any of the amounts within this improvement allowance balance as such so those Esther X amount is that it is or was initially set up and 11-12 year with 150 million dollars was added 25 million dollars in twelve thirteen and a further fifty million dollars in the three-year plan which is why the notional value of it is 225 it's not a fund of money that is readily available in fact it is quite the reverse it is just an expectation that we will carry this as additional debt as we draw down on it and I think with that view around it that we actually need to relook at what's commonly known as the betterment fund and the appropriateness of the level of it and the allocations within it as part of our overall financial strategy and so I'm very glad you picked up on the bit on the allowance the improvement of enhanced balance can I just ask a question in regards to I'd be really keen to put a very tight time frame around does so that the tender process can happen quickly so I just want to us staff can we put that we get this done on this tender process soon oh it would take three months for it to complete typically but we could start immediately is there any way yannis question is in order to go through process but actually get the input of the person who's going to be occupying thus into the redesign or the refit of mona vale is there any way in which it can be done faster than two hour or 12 weeks I'm sure there is however there is a requirement to put Tinder's out to make up for a certain I think it's four weeks and the other point to make there is that to be involved in the fit-out it won't matter to me so the fit-out can start anytime between now and maybe 12 months away so it isn't so they've done their designs but the foot out itself takes place at the end of the repairs and strengthening work design its concern is around the fact that Mona Vale had a number of places that were completely useless really and what we're keen not to get could be so bold I mean it was not designed as a cafe and or used as a cafe originally and there are some spaces that don't make sense to replicate exactly well we have the limitations are on the heritage obviously yes although I don't know that all of those internal walls are necessarily the heritage items Tim I'm an example would be the young is that the staff club at the University which is a historic house and it's been done extremely well but I mean it just seems logical that you would have the previous tenant giving some advice or input into how to improve the function because at the end of the day we want the best return and a sensitive environment and I mean we've got to get a good return on their investment so as that as a part of the process or they was Italian dependent of the previous user at the moment the designers been made independently based on the intention I guess to have it as a venue and to but to return it to the state that it was done before and spend a lot of heritage and put into that moment the design has been done without consulting a this is my understanding of it I'm not the project manager has been done without consulting a future tenant further to that I does that mean then that for example the council's own sort of catering outfit if you like V base to your knowledge is not involved in the design component I'm not talking about any financial or contractual arrangements absolutely not no I build most certain of that it's been done by the heritage people and the engineering companies so there's been no as far as I have reasonably editors because of the town hall will MV base I believe involved in it so I'm just one minute and again heritage building me too yeah yeah not thank you so to get a specific answer to yannis question um I appreciate that there's a need for us to go out to tender for a specific period and you were suggesting that was four weeks is that months for the whole process from end to end yes but the actual over time the advertised tender process is over a four-week isn't a clip yes okay I would need to check on that to be absolutely certain and what work is needed as either end of that process how could that be condensed to bring us to a point of less than three months and what realistically would that length of time be yeah I mean I can say something but I can't_''_699.76 be absolutely certain because that's not my area of expertise however the work that happens prior to the tender going out as around making sure that the evaluation criteria is well set so it's understanding that what's a lot of discussion goes on with all of the people who are potential players in the market and they're young and the process so the pro the program manager the project manager and also the what the venue is going to be used for and so understanding what the right evaluation criteria is and a lot of that stuff's talked has already been done yeah yes it has yep so if we were serving for argument's sake if we were to pass a resolution today that said that we wanted the whole tender process concluded within a six week period would that be possible thanks really tight yeah there needs to be a lot of thought put into the criteria around the leasing to the potential tenant I mean we're talking about a very specific building here with you know very few potential operators I would suggest yeah I mean the point of view from which I'm looking at it now I'm sure this was the spirit behind cancel your answers question as well II but we want the best result out of this and the way to get the best result is to get the operator involved in the development as early in the piece as possible and that's why I'm suggesting that you know if we were capable of doing that within six weeks if we pull out all the stops taking into account the importance and the uniqueness of this project'd love to say yes and I mean I can say yes now that I'm committing my staff to something that may not be possible and so I would yeah I can't say absolutely yes if it's possible absolutely yeah thank you my question Sue's about procurement practice and I think I know the answer to this but isn't it understood the good procurement practice even if there is a an existing supplier involves the fact that you would benchmark against that supplier so that you wouldn't simply roll it over and why I'm saying that is this is all about good practice whole of life cost savings which is what procurements about so actually you don't simply just roll a supplier over good practice and they may end up with the being awarded it in the end but you would at least have that by which others you know can be a much so are you asking if if we directly a point which is certainly a potential a possible if a supplier is directly appointed then we do need to Mike and we would expect them to put an a proposal basically and against a set of criteria rather they basically follow the same process run and simply rolling it over yep thank you um sorry to harp on about it but following on from ya ya knees point going for the other way we have an operator the operator the building probably around about 30 years they refitted at 15 years ago they know the place intimately could was it possible to contracting is consultant to advise on the best way to it that the functional to improve the faults that we had before that seems if we don't do that that one option is Android pointed out in the Army is that we we we speed up the process to get someone there who's going to go to is going to and run it but the other way to do that is to bring the people that hit it previously as a separate contractor or a consultant to advise on any issues because where you could be in danger of rebuilding and repairing the faults that nature mean as I said the record and at the university staff club as a historic building they managed to do it surely we can work around some parameters as well as long as we knew what the false worry I think they would be because if we're going to go to market for a new tenant then there's some probity issues around actually having that tenant involved pre going to monica or wallets it well it's actually out in the market so don't think we could do that pretty wise but sure any advice from a consultant and an eerie like a kitchen or running a space like that one the advice that they would give would suit anybody that's running it and improve that function of that Center it would however it does give them a perceived advantage technically we can't give any advice really on how to improve that fetch from anyone that's used it you could probably get advice from another external contractor and wouldn't necessarily need to be the previous you know that I understand we go think I mean basically I think that you know the opportunity to work around the design with whoever the tenant as is really the key thing here so what we want us is building to have you know a future life for at least the next hundred years if not longer and the only way we're going to do that with a heritage building is to make sure we got a sustainable productive use so working with latina as the key thing so I think you know certainly if we can speed up the tendering process then we actually the sooner we get the tin in place the sooner they can work around the design elements I just wanted to ask staff though the comment was made in the deputation that the V based cafe or the Botanic Gardens cafe went through a closed tender to V bays but in your view what how's that justified compared to not going out for an open tender versus this project you just helped me understand why staff have recommended that this one goes out for open tinder but the V don't even know if I went out for tinder that was one question raised so maybe you just explain if that went out for tinder or even if it was closed hinder or whether it was just selected him what the differences we're not the best person well it was was it wasn't wounded but um it didn't go out for public public tender to my knowledge in fact I'm certain that didn't go out for public team de it was a council decision yeah it was based on staff advice you started to but the snow stone it was why stuff recommended what I'm trying to understand is what it was there were there was a lot of rationale behind it at the time but it's being a new building in yeah thank you yeah quick comment on that and well we're talking about irrelevant things just in response to then I just did want to say them that exactly what you said this other issue that we're not debating was a council decision made with the V based anyway back on track I just didn't want to make comment because I think what's being inch and it is extremely pertinent and of course we want to ensure the best outcome for the community and have a functional building throughout this repair process the repair and refit the motor though this is more a comment for the four colleagues than anything else but is a long haul game there's not going to be done in four months it's going to take a very long time in mind are saying is that staff are extremely cognizant of having the tender process expedia its speedy Asians as more truncated as much as possible to have them on board earlier I'd prefer that we're not paying consultancy fees that we have the tender process done dusted and then whoever wins that and again may I say that probably the track record of the past operator will count and their favor but that's again aside from it so you'd want to have them involved at the start but the tender processes is a very small so I will it give you comfort if even if we had perhaps just a point that you know staff provide best endeavours to expedia eight that the tender process because that gives you some stroke and we've got it we can't bind you to things you know or timeframes that we're actually unaware of and your best place to make that call but obviously you know you want to have the tender one early on and then have that operator without paying consultancy fees you'd want that person that's not a vested interest because they've been selected to ensure they have something functional to work with to be able to operate it effectively you
Discussion I'll put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and counselor kata will move in Council Livingston and more second the minutes of the twelfth of may I discussion those in favor please say aye those opposed carried and we've had yep pulling I did have a point about the minutes on page six item 11 the facilities rebuild of the north beach community crash the moved that the report be referred back to the community committee I'm just wondering if that's come back yet not yet take these we have a number of community board chairs who are in the audience waiting to present various parts so what I'd like to do is take the community boards and then we'll go on to the Finance Committee ahead of the earthquake recovery committee of the whole that's okay

Okay what I was just going to seduce david if it's okay is that while Sarah and Michael here we do the next item which is a joint one of these then come back to yours said okay okay great okay in that case the item 13 is that the item 13 which is a joint report by Ruxton Wigram and Hagar fairy meat and both of you are suggesting that the staff recommendations be adopted great thanks I totally agree with ya it's a really important that we make this city really cycle friendly and this will go a long way to helping with it connection n considered disabled ability is well to use crossing cycling um just to highlight um we need to be really clear about the resolution so the community board had a lot of discussion that was quite like that submission we heard earlier from hands off Hagley but parking as a major issue in given that we're tuning a huge eyesore into a nice green space there was real concerned that cars will just simply park on it and ruin it visually and very supportive of us looking at during some sort of floral planting in some sort of art sculpture and then that grassed area so that we actually act as a deterrent for people to go and just partner with their vehicles on it when they go to higley park which seems like it would cost us a lot of money and rather than spend that money on reactive maintenance why don't we be proactive put some color back into the central city and actually come up with a solution that as a positive rather than a negative I think that's fine you only accept that we want to look at that board than just a floral thing and sculpture I think in terms of its great location for something interesting yeah yeah like we're really open but the idea was that if you just put grass there you actually just waste money so if you want a wider slightly wider resolution but it just needs to hit on the side well it is a great location then that site and something that's a wee know they're really lovely but they're not very active recreation and I I think the potential for that site is stunning yes and so I just like us to be a wee bit broader so investigate the hips the use of this this area of this green area for I don't know let's go park but I mean that the reason that the flower was kind of like yeah increasing it does give a call so you know mindful of councils financial situation I think the idea with flowers is that it was seen as a kind of low cost effective solution but happy if we can just get something happening at the same time well whatever day so yeah feature that might be a water feature that's fine and then just finally just to say that it this has been a real eye sight I saw and it does raise a question around our conv contractors and what their responsibilities is to live sites and a chi with the same level of immunity before and it also does raise concerns over whether actually this debt budget should actually be fixing some of us you so you know I just wanted to make those points because clearly if we can learn from this that is we can't have sites left like this for the number of years that says and we do have to have I think some quite strict requirements on contractors who make money out of our contracts putting that things to a certain standard rather than living us the huge repairable hostler Mike regarding to a communal polar recommendation regarding to the teens f just a new cycle in T teaching the facilities no ty tuner to add on the handrail for more safety considerations you request the environmental committee to engage with the skirt why just to see if they can be done as part of I didn't think I didn't realize that we did actually Jimmy oh yeah well that's to do this there's quite a lot of repair to be done in that area from the from the sewer system that was being put on there through the roundabout and it kept on syncing a lot of issues around that area that that were damaged as the earthquake and what we were but we were signaling as can net can some of that reinstatement be part of the skirt project yep hmm yes ston that look we do have to be careful how we spell must have Phillip poor thing Hawthorn's way its name she was got a nice alert and he's quite and he does when he's so passionate about what he does know you know so if we can just keep with it I said I'm I'm really supported with yanni some idea to I wondered if you know people like keep christchurch beautiful or some other organizations might want to get involved and something but anyway I'm just wondering when the cycle know you crosses deanzie does it have to be in cross the railway line on the western side yes how does he really um control see you not at this stage in that just accesses the other side of the cycleway that then goes up to straight up north doesn't it no road but I think that's and there's some flat there's bud the money in the budget for there I think we should bring that's the Environment Committee and get because it must be on you about 300 meters it is yeah and it's actually used defector now some of the residents and Brock birthplace actually go out there and mow the path and maintain the path the informal path through there so is it a concern for cyclist crossing it railway line without signal ISM there is not there is beer but yeah there is a chicane there is a chicane toy I think near so you're not just going to go blat straight across okay that's great thank you yes all right I'm aware guys that I've taken you over your coffee break and I'm really sorry what about the half an hour I was going to seduce that we do finance next for planting of credit but I'm also aware that your coffee for anybody will be nice and cold by now so how about ten minute the Finance Committee so
Helen bourton on Elysee just I just want Kim for town and you're obviously acutely aware of what can be said an open meeting at you cool okay thank you for this opportunity to speak to you I felt it was important I did come and address some of the issues which are the background to the formation of the ellerslie flower show I'm the only counselor I don't think as a counselor here who was aware of the of the background I was elected to council in 2001 and at that point the council was very keen to establish a garden show and there were two reasons one is because christ church is the Garden City and it seemed important that we had the garden show for New Zealand in the second reason as that council at that stage had a wish to have four major iconic events one in summer which became the a.m npv and the show won an autumn which was the ellerslie flower show again the data but not quite right but then we go that was the theory the one to so I haven't haven't_''_104.04 got those and quite there right order but that was the intent of the council at that point and a garden festival trust was formed in about two thousand and two I'm I wasn't directly involved with it and in 2004 as you all know we took away committees which my view is you know it's the wrong thing to do I'm very pleased you have them back but council worked between 2001 and two 7 on trying to establish a garden show through the establishment of a garden festival trust and there were a lot of difficulties in that trust and I think that one stage there was mediation but at the end of the day nothing came of that and 500,000 had been spent in actually sticks in my gullet the five hundred thousand five hundred thousand and no show so and after they had election of Bob Parker and 2007 within about two months this proposal came to Council Councillor Johansson was on the council then and council unanimously approved it or approved at bar one councillor has concerns at the time now I'm not there was not enough financial analysis on the proposal and I've you and I'm normally a non-issue people who worked with me down for sending things back if there's not detailed analysis on this occasion I approve I was one of the ones we voted for this and this was really because of the history I felt we just had to take a ready-made show with a ready-made contractor if we wanted to have a garden show we couldn't we had the council as a whole had failed with that previous attempt so I guess what I'm saying is that if you decide not to continue with the show in some form I think you're going to have difficulties getting it reestablished the history would show that it will become a problem if you don't continue in some way with the show as it it's I do have a personal view which I've circulated to people as a possible suggestion is that maybe you broaden the show and maybe there's a with a private contractor maybe there's discussions to combine it so you have a garden show which also has Canterbury food and wine so all I'm all I'm saying is that I think you need to look carefully at what the show has achieved it has got up and running and to be just aware of the history of trying to establish a garden show through a garden festival trust so that that's really all I have to say the events planned for the count of east will come up with the four seasons summer went to autumn spring and I know some of the conversations and my prior to come out accounts with regards through my events with regards to canopy in christchurch being a winter playground the skiing etc but just seemed to me and I'd love to hear your opinion on it where you have now but excuse me from a winter festival and spring we now have a garden festival and water and A&P show is not a council event although the cup and show which which is absolutely fantastic as through counsel from doesn't that's really dangerous when an organization or camping what it has an original vision and it adjusts slightly and adjust slightly and we end up with something else so we've got a wonderful and spring as a garden festival and autumn autumn and I have to say that Sid Lee has just been promoting its new garden festival and September which is Guinness spring so I just like your feedback on their house seems off trait so who's promoting it Sydney Sydney outlets across the Dutch is consonant is a covered bridge lovely flowers well I think those seasons have got somewhat have changed to I mean I think you've changed the LSD Flower Show bringing it forward in the year taking a couple weeks very close to buskers I think there are some issues but I don't think one can sit that I think you've got the comms the concepts right and I don't think it matters too much that the dates don't quite fit but well I think you've got to actually get for if it can be done without too much loss to counsel or maybe counsel changes its approach to it and says look we will Thunder I mean I'm just saying that I think it's important to act to keep it if that's feasible and you will have other things and PX to discuss yes yes thank you um Helen when you looked at these festivals aligning them with seasons and was there any consideration given to and I know things have changed since the earthquakes any consideration given to hospitality shoulder seasons accommodation assisting that would having a festival at a time that would be considered a low season or was that not part of it no I think it was at the start right and there was an emphasis on shoulder season I think when it was established and match mid-match it's the borderline of that but I think probably overall it's better to retain the garden show as a major event if you can if in fact that's possible yeah things Helen district because of your wealth of experience I have a fest in the arts fest that are every second years do you think that would be feasible food Ella's Lee in your view yes look that's I've probably got there's two other things I probably wanted to say you could look at doing it in every second year if that works and I do think we'd had a disconnect between councillors and staff in Ella's Lee's development I remember rigging up event staff member and saying why did we drop Jenny gillies and I was told it was too expensive now I know she's back but I just think feedback that counselors have should be much more linked them to be events team yes I I think if you work more closely together on on the festival I think it's that's healthier because everyone gets lots of feedback and and so if that feedback goes directly to the events team we had some issues and not going directly we didn't seem to be able to influence them okay so ill and but its historic well in yeah I had councillors site the management contract at the time I can't recall if we cited it I recall us being briefed on it and what's your recollection of that I I think you'd have to ask me something specific honor actually and it may not be appropriate and the open meeting but we were aware there was a management contract we were briefed on it whether we actually cited it I cannot recall Thanks yes I think I mean you know I've always had the view that we often tend to be over-optimistic and in our approach to a range of issues and I do think we were aware that we would be the cost if it didn't work but there were probably all sorts of predictions bet it was going to be viable and there would be no cost to counsel so so I think though we were aware that that cost was kind of open-ended sorry were you aware that that cost was open-ended that it would continue know that it was open-ended and that you under wrote it yes you were Lou but be a problem if you know I mean that sexist sort of prediction saying look we know that's there but don't worry we have every anticipation that it will break even let's not make a profit and it did the first year yeah okay thanks he had you been given any other options as opposed to just this particular management company and the allottee flower so was there any local event organizers it gave you a proposal that would actually deliver the same result and if so why wasn't it as she year taken up no it came in as I said because we had struggled to get a garden show off the ground then there was an election and anemia and then suddenly this proposal came in it came and out of left field there were no other it wasn't lobis was being carefully thought of and submissions coming in sure from my understanding is there was a local person that did submit they spent considerable money putting a proposal together and it was overridden by the elders the Flower Show don't know I can't recall it but it may have been it was 2007 right there was the election and then about two months after that just proposal came in a year where Helen that some of the changes by government on councils in the LGA have been caused by events and one of the main HD it can be attributed may need to the Hamilton v8 sign up which cost that council millions of dollars without a contract let alone citing a contract are you aware of LGA changes brought about by the no not not totally clear on it I'm aware that they did change the focus of council I'm aware that this council previously was concerned about would that affect events and I did understand that from the Minister of Local Government at the time that events were seen as okay now I guess this is a sure do you have an event at a loss that BS I spoke but haven't really thought thought about that and I guess I'm just coming to to say just be aware of the history and when thank you good thinking
Next one what Giri roadmaster player erode must Flynn so the recommendation we have here is to alter the plan slightly to approve some proposed changes to figure 56 and the revised text these changes are based on a workshop held between council staff and foodstuffs based on a council resolution and aboard recommendation some of the concerns of foodstuffs were taken they're all taken into account some leader changes being made and some did not and the board are happy with these and would like to recommend that the staff recommendation be adopted sorry we've counselor you're handsome so you can did cancel on staff put that those in favor please say aye those post Harry thank you six this it's not quite and later on while I'm here let's hope the opportunity while you're here today and you'll be looking at a three-phase transport projects proposed amendments the board discussed this last night having only just seen it and had some concerns over this there's been a litre tabled I think we've all got copies of this it'm here so that yeah so we discussed this last night and we would respectfully like to request that you defer any decision on the amendments to an accessible City Transport plan revised first phase transport projects we believe that this should be done so that because the plan has not been updated to include the changes to the timing and scale of some anchor projects the severe and chronic congestion as a result of skirt works the detrimental impact of demolition and construction works on existing central city streets the lack of clarity over win if at all salisbury street and fillmore street will be made to weigh the new central city parking development on litchfield street in the hospital and the new financial position of the council and community board involvement would be really good in this particular plan while decisions on the central city and made by the council there are a lot of residents living in the city or we're not just building the city for more residents to come to and these residents have been impacted hugely over the last three years many residents time on different things that have affected them in the communities but the central city residents are missing out and we would also like to see a forum held with the inner city residents and businesses and to talk about proposed changes before they are agreed to I think it's really important that the residents are involved in their city it is that is I'll be back shortly yeah
I dr. chriskiss link from the Hansel peg leg thank you very much for this opportunity I'll try to be briefed and give you an opportunity to ask questions we're here I've got an R drain with me as well we're here really looking at your item 23 which is dealing with the responsibilities of your committees we made representations on Tuesday the 11th of March 2014 to the community committee and we now see in the agenda item today that a number of the points that we raised and one in particular seems not to have been taken into account our concern is that matters relating to Hagi Park art are still going to be considered by more than one council committee we think isn't need for much better coordination of hagley park matters and if it can come to one committee that is thatis best it seems that also that to us that the recreation side of things is having greater persuade then consideration of the environmental and protection matters for hagley park we made at that limits our march deputation and a to actually have a look at those again in the interests of shortness of time here I'm not going to read them all out to you I would emphasize also though that we are not aware of any similar major Reserve anywhere else in New Zealand or the world for that matter that Wrigley allows vehicles to be parked on the grass areas of the playing fields or under the drip lines and over the root zones and mature trees this council its committee asked the staff to do some work on parking we haven't seen that result we ask also that that the progress in that area might be related to us so we have some idea of what you are doing now can answer more questions on if you would wish on the side of managing an iconic treasure like hagley park with his background and experience if you want more questions on management to the parking and still abuse of parking we believe for events in an hagley park there is more photographic evidence beyond what we have given you so far thank you thank a committee and asked about information on packing on hagley park and the policies around that for particularly for events you haven't seen any work on that no okay thank you we have we've not had we not had the feedback that we might have expected okay thank you are there any questions from anyone Pauline you're just about hi I'm you saying that the parking damages the rootstock of the trees will go when the party is kind of out in the middle is what dennis is I invite you to go and walk out in North hagley park mount and look at the end result of what's happened for the events have been held there in the last few months with the wet season we've had it is it is not good okay and do you have any comments perhaps about often this heavy trucks and things that are involved and setting up and breaking down shows do they have any impact as well a few it is inevitable that you're going to have heavy vehicles involved in that sort of tents and structures and things the idea in any management plan will be to try and minimize that and get those vehicles in and out and off-site us and not Park them there I just note this year that there was a lot of rain around the period of Ellerslie and I think there was quite a lot of well if we take a leaf out of the Environment Court judge's decision for hagley oval and the use of any of the park for parking in association with that she was saying that if for any reason and weather events can be some of those that they would they couldn't use the park the park really came first and you had to find parking elsewhere and it was over to cricket to find 3,000 car parking spaces elsewhere every season in terms of yours sorry Oh Yanni think you just wondering if you've had as a response to your 28 of April concern over the compliance with the consent yes we've had we've had a response from the council acknowledgment that non-compliance had it had so in your mind is that satisfactory I'm it just seems like you can just keep reaching your consent without any consequence well the point here is that the City Council's is it has the responsibility for monitoring those consents and ensuring compliance some of our members have been watching closely and breaches have occurred minor breaches and substantial breaches in fact one of them is unknown known person to the workers around there now as she goes it takes more information so do you think we need to be passing some resolutions today to actually our staff to be a monitoring the consent conditions more proactively and actually taking more enforcement if you are managing this proactively as a council say you'll be asking your staff for more regular reports on the action monitoring regime what they have done it seems that monitoring is by exception and someone has to complain for monitoring to take place and we don't believe that is the right way to go about it I'm actually going to ask Jane to come back via the CEOs report on the time ago in a community committee I think it was my last question to you really would be since you haven't put hagley park madison to one committee in his terms of reference can you release the reasons why you didn't yeah and when we did the terms of reference there was debate about having sports and rec along with parks and and heritage and to the community committee but the environment can be felt it was important to retain it so I think we got up to a bit of a cellmate there where we agreed but I think we certainly we actually it's timely that we're actually reviewing some aspects of our committees at the moment and will certainly take it into account to get a more a very clear focus on heavy part would be something everyone would agree agree to it if you have some other means of coordination between your committees to make sure these things I looked out properly we would be more comfortable but history so far has been a test that has not been done to the two be doing it now we thank you if you want to thank you
So thank you we're in your hands thinking oh thank you thank you more good morning thank you very much for this opportunity madam deputy mayor and councillors as you know I'm David Lynch from momentos PR and I'm here they're assisting a client grant Ward the managing director from continental here in Christchurch I'll present effectively their main body of the deputation and we'll try and work through some of it because it's referencing things that I'm sure you're very familiar with it and Greg will take the opportunity at the end to add any additional comment that might be relevant and respond to any questions that you may have but I think the key thing would like to say before addressing the substantive matter before you and we do have copies of this on its way it's got caught up in the photocopy downstairs continental wishes to commend this council in its decision to repair strengthen and restore motive al as we're all aware we lost a lot in the city and I think it's tremendous association with mona vale and hope to continue that in the future obviously prior to the earthquakes on the twenty-second of februari the owners continental least mona vale homestead from 1978 through to the earthquakes the group one heritage building the group one heritage building obviously sustained significant damage to the tune of three million dollars and the wards have always been hopeful that at some point in the not too distant future they would be given the opportunity to work with this council and re-establishing the homestead as an award-winning restaurant wedding and meeting venue since the twenty-second of February the Continental have engaged council staff on numerous occasions for the purpose of being updated on how the reinstatement plans were progressing but unfortunately despite their best endeavours from time to time unfortunately council staff weren't so free with their responses but under the pressures that this councils under that's sometimes understood continental believed that at the meeting of the finance committee convened on the sixth of May 2014 members would have unfortunately and appear to have failed to consider and their view all relevant matters and the Mona Val homestead lease option that is before you today for your consideration and presenting this deputation continental would like to ensure the members of this council that you understand that they are not seeking to challenge the recommendation before you today however they are here to present a number of concerns regarding the robustness of the process it was adopted that resulted with the recommendation you're about to consider continental also wish to respectfully point out that although they will raise issues around perceived and actual conflicts of interest involving a number of council members here today they wish to point out that they acknowledge councillors have been acting in good faith and with the best motives and that continental also acknowledges the significant challenges that confront this council right now with many new faces and there is going to be a in their view the occasional situation where perhaps due process may be overlooked and seeking to address their concerns with the council regarding this matter continent continental initially attempted to pursue a number of direct avenues of engagement with various council members but unfortunately and why are we here well the council was approached by continental and as a previous tenant they naturally saw the opportunity of working with the council to return once the homestead was reinstated the purpose of this deputation is as I've said earlier to table specific issues with respect to Mona Vale homestead and the lease recommendations and we believe for a number of reasons that the decision or the recommendations day should be referred back to the Finance Committee for a further examination in terms of some of the key matters that we've identified and considering this request continental believes that the following reasons are grounds for this matter to be reconsidered by the Finance Committee continental had legitimate expectations that in accordance with the principles of natural justice they would be consulted and inconsistent Council process and dealing with Lisa's appears to be evident and we refer to the example of the botanic gardens visitor center the Christchurch City Council requirement that is a public entity entity that the general public law obligation is for it to act fairly and reasonable leave and it would this may not have been followed the City Council also has a duty to consider or relevant matters before it decides on a decision and it must also ensure that it dismisses irrelevant matters a perceived conflict exists with some members of the Finance Committee taking part in the debate when this matter was considered on the six of may we comment now on the council processes that are we see as inconsistent and dealing with mona vale and continental as a result as we've mentioned of the earthquake the homestead was damaged and clearly continental had a very high expectation of an opportunity to return following the februari earthquake continent continental took every available opportunity for ensuring that counts understood it's very strong desire to be provided with a future opportunity of leasing leasing mona vale homestead and that it was prepared to make a significant financial investment and contribution towards project continent continental felt it was important for both themselves and the council to maintain a catering and event presence at mona vale and was most appreciative of the council that allowed them to have an and then negotiated for a further term of two years which is due to conclude on the thirty-first of october and there was a paid arrangement around that license a pre quake continental requested an extension through their solicitor they were advised that it would not be granted as a right as it was policy that would go to tinder continental understood that unless like current policy the counselor treasons to extend on the basis of tenant might require additional time to seek return on investment that this was unlikely there wasn't this this wasn't part why continental commenced discussions over need to refurbish and was willing to invest accordingly in the home skid given that it had been some time that both the council and continental had undertaken a major refit from initial discussions with staff continental felt that in fact there was a very good chance that they might secure a further term continental was therefore understandably extremely disappointed that there was no apparent that there was an apparent oversight with council staff choosing not to notify the company that a meeting was being convened by that meeting the motive al Cowen's get release was to be discussed had continental being given prior notice of this meeting they would have sought speaking rights and probably would not be here today continental had a legitimate expectation that in accordance with the principles of natural justice they would be consulted and we draw your attention to the guidelines and principles set out in the local government act that state the following councils must provide anyone who will or may be affected by a decision or anyone who has an interest in the decision with reasonable access to relevant information and that these people should also be encouraged to express their views to the council you'll therefore appreciate why continental was disappointed at not being given that opportunity continental was not the prior notice about the report about the lease and about the meeting they weren't consulted and only learnt of it by chance a day before in fact late that evening I believe before the meeting continental respectfully submits that there isn't that there isn't their opinion that wasn't consistent with the the general public law obligations were to act fairly and reasonably as a public entity as you know the council must and must be seen to be impartial in its decision-making and it may also at times and this is very important need to consider the imbalance of power in some funding arrangements where it is significant enough to require a different approach from the way it might normally conduct its business given the impact of the earthquake and the huge uncertainty there was impacting on continental just after the earthquakes they believed that it was unfortunate that this council or should I say that counsel at the time didn't recognize the need to adopt a different approach to the way it consult conducted its relationship with their company and that's it then that this might extend to the opportunity of a lease at least being considered and possibly advanced so the other question we have for you today is what actually is a criteria used by your staff and the preparations for open tender no tender or continuing a tender for example it is understood that the any call for tender and if this is correct it would not be unreasonable to raise a concern that there could be an apparent inconsistency of the approach adopted by the council that you're now asking continental and others to follow and have confidence in David your time is up so would you like to just wrap up what you're saying yes unfortunately I would have liked to have asked mr. Ward couple of questions but you haven't moved time so if you'd like to just wrap up very quickly what you know casting not it's fine well it clearly we've raised a number of concerns and I must turn to the matter of perceived actual conflicts of interest the the issues there are concerning and was the greatest respect to councilor golf he is the V base chairman and also we note that poor lonsdale again with the greatest respect there's a director of V base and we believe that it was appropriate for those gentlemen to not participate in the discussions with respect to this similarly okay okay you haven't're just going to have to thank you for the delegation and I would have liked to have asked me a couple of questions but having set the standard standing orders at the start I can't really break them straightaway so so thank you for coming and this is item 16 Finance Committee which I understand you would like taken earlier than it is currently being taken well 15 so we will try to we will try to accommodate yeah please could I just make one closing comment we had no actually you can toggle like 10 minutes means 10 minutes and I'm going to enforce it with the other speakers as well and that's why we much prefer if you can do it succinctly and it gives us time to ask questions but unfortunately I haven't so thank you very much we have a handout anyway and we would expect a formal response to the questions and the recommendations made an accord will be a decision made and obviously those decisions are all made very publicly and openly and all agendas and items are actually you thank you mr. thank you
On here apologies from Italy in and from davids yet it's just making us go to a seat I just want to remind any of you who are speaking that this is live streamed and so just bear that in mind we have three deputations this one is from Greg Ward and dad will try to come forward gentlemen just so that the deputations are completely aware and there is 10 minutes total and that includes the question time so you're just so you're aware we've put a little timer up there for you and I actually intend to people to standing orders today given the size of me gender
As that last but not least as the crashes you count for James if you'd like to come forward and I think this is the first the first time you've appeared in front of the council for the butler crash its youth council was it right that's not true actually my hair my name is um quoted wrongly my name is james adams and I've presented in front of this council twice before since we were little no not since your life sorry in front of the previous council no he'll hug but first some of you people thank you fantastic oh you people are waiting to hear with anticipation so my name is james adams and I'm here with the Christ refuse council our organization is committed to strengthening youth voice in the city I only want to speak briefly today because I'm primarily here to sort of show my face and to say that yes young people are interested in the future of the city and the issues and the decisions that are being made but they might not show their say a real book thank you to you for putting this out to consultation and for giving me the time to speak today because so often I think we feel that decisions are made and we don't have any say in them and just the feeling of that someone is listening is is really great at our annual we speak event about two years ago about 200 young people were gathered together and they presented Roger Sutton were the list of five things that Christchurch young people want these included cleaning up the heat get in aven rivers and a new sport and recreation facility in the East which we dubbed qe3 today none of these have been delivered upon and I'm not going to condemn you people for failing to make these five things happen because I feel that me and other young people don't really care about them anymore at this point I think it's more than to note that the Christchurch view council can't claim to speak for every young person but the message that we're getting loud and clear from just want to live a normal life and I think the council has even if not ally or an ethical responsibility to make sure that young people can leave normal lead normal lives in this city we acknowledge that the council is certainly in a very tight spot financially and that we're not accountants and that we won't know all the answers but what I would like to do is not present five big things but two small things that I'd like you to consider firstly I believe that the council has a responsibility again maybe not a legal responsibility but certainly an ethical one to ensure that affordable quality housing is available as this is a key way to get young people and in fact all people out of poverty whether you do this by borrowing money or from selling off assets I don't know but we we've got to get young people and everyone to be in safe warm houses that don't flood every time it rains and so I don't know how you're going to do that but we be able to go places and increasingly cars are not the appropriate way to do that hey because it takes a huge amount of time to you anywhere and secondly because cars are you know nasty stinking things that are bad for our climate and for everyone else walking along the street so we'd like to see the council investing more in infrastructure for public and active transport some of the things that we've talked about as a youth council are around bus infrastructure and we'd really like to see the council pushing that the central city bus exchange is built you know as quickly as possible and we think that that the timeline that Sarah is put forward is is good and we would like to hope that that doesn't get you know pushed off into the future like several of the other major projects and we'd also like to see the cycling infrastructure in place as soon as possible by cycle to school every day and I can't afford to wait five years for that infrastructure to be in place because in be here if that was if I felt the Christchurch was the place where I wanted to be and where I could get places safely and so in conclusion I believe that young people have largely lost interest in big promises for you know fantastic things in the future what we really like to see is there's good decent normal lives here and now and we acknowledge that the council hasn't got a lot of funds to do that but I've talked about infrastructure for public in a public and active transport and affordable quality housing and those are two things I think that you really could do thank you thank you very much Tom dangling hey James that I remember when you first moved to Christchurch live next door to us and it's great speech as a kitchen with primary and I'm amazed you too small things and I'd have to see if I've quick links I guess just on a side of shoe yep one of the things that my kids talk about and their friends talk about as just nothing hard and a long time to get Washington skatepark finally completed but be interested in some thoughts on that the more it stop it and still the malls some other options at peps along the lines of the green the rebels smaller things that a lot of them what are your thoughts on this definitely I think there is a feeling that if you want to go and hang out somewhere with your friends and you don't want to go to someone's house the obvious places the mall and in some ways I think there's a real shame there's been talk of various youth hubs specifically for young people to to spend time I'm never sure if that's quite the response because young people like everyone is like all groups in society are so varied that what one group of people would want in a youth hub or a youth space would be so entirely different from from other people some of the things I would mention is I quite enjoy cycling and walking and so getting things like the tracks and the port then the cleans island bike track after the the rain and the wind I think it was all the trees were blown down there and we're really grateful that a temporary measure has been sorted out there so that people can now cycle some of those tracks again clean thank you I'm aware the Auckland City Council has its own structure with the youth council here and we had one or two discussions about this how will you envisage some kind of parallel structure with the Christchurch City Council if we wanted to go down that path as far as I'm aware we've got a time for all our youth council come and talk to you in early June we're no doubt we will discuss this further the youth council has just gone through the last year we've been making ourselves an independent organization which has taken quite a lot of time and energy and it's something that we're quite proud to have though yes I say it's probably not always the easiest for us to get our messages forward by many ways because a lot of the the issues and the decisions to some extent have already been made that you've decided sort of what the scope of the project is and so we'd like to be included or just asked what we think be win an issue comes up and then we would like the support so that we can reach out and meet more young people because we're very aware that we want to to get an idea of what all young people are thinking I think that the City Council clean up with it I'm gonna let Paul as the last question what do you think about an adventure park that actually had real class so I place zip lines flying foxes losers built some are really really close to this so it sounds great it sounds great yes it would be fantastic I would love to have such a thing again though I'd like to be able to go home and live in a warm safe house and slight little school more if anything yeah that's right well thank you to us and that's the end of today's meeting
Clearly I'm not really true madam here no no you don't even look like a green Mitchell but as that Quinn much or with you my good wife is asked me to speak on the other half oh good okay stay close oh oh well do you want me to sit for you thank you I met Emilia counselors this submission is about a piece of land really zoned on the edge of the cranford basin it's about a rating policy in the process around it so the first but at some handy arts here I can leave with you as well yes yeah the first one is a cutting from a newspaper 10 years ago I've got exactly the same issue and it's not well shown on the screen there from the odd number can scroll down yeah see councillors condom and James are in the in the limelight of that that stage and this particular issue was overturned and the objection was sustained so we can move on to the next couple very quickly not quite in the order I wanted but just as part of their property and the next one again some cattle that we have on the property these are these put have taken by the way the last week was so this is dean be part of the cranford basin but there's not a puddle to be seen next one there should be some maps here as well can we control those yep okay everyone listen should be some maps but done the handout so Perry just degrees alright so this land has been the subject of correspondent to vote the Planning Department in the reitz Department of council under the RPS the pc one of various other mechanisms a local group of residents it suggested many times that it's ideal for rezoning is the highest part of the cranford basin and close to all sorts of amenities buses and other services and the key activity center of Northlands is only about 130 meters away we understand the land was recently included in the live but by sarah that was subsequently removed by council planning officers for whatever reason when the city in central governed a crow obviously not to the Council of planets anyway that's a district plan issue the thali frustrating that we continue to pursue the issue in question today as whilst one department refuses to accept suitability for residential use concurrently another department seems to think that it is residential ins attempting to charge residential rates on this rural land the rates Department notified us of their intend to do this last year subject to objections based on greater than thirty percent of the land usage between use for non-residential services this is clearly wrong in a simple review of an aerial photograph will support our contention the objection which we were invited to make and made was never acknowledged never responded to and we assume that had been upheld subsequently however our council unilaterally imposed a twenty-two percent increase in our rates no notification no communication we are told that this isn't breach the local government act we also know there's been no underlying change the zoning nor any substantial change for capital value of the land recent correspondence from council officers attempts to justify the increase in the that houses on the street that had sir existence 1967 47 years ago worse than this this is where it gets a bit gnarly clearly the properties targeted that being cherry picked from aerial photographs some neighbors have been targeted others said not one of our neighbors is scared witless about this particular session today and what am I caught them as a result neighbor against neighbor divide and rule no consistency whatsoever the council officer acknowledges this fact and says you will undertake a review to address these inconsistencies we're not holding our breath the end result of this sorry saga the council policy is actually creating a virtual wasteland in this area we have previously had a cut flower operation and a small Christmas tree farm both pretty own economic but an attempt to use the land for rural services and now try to keep it tidy bug raising a few stock but the land is not suited the cattle despite the fact we have it on we can't run cheap because of the risk of dog attacks so close to the city the character oh they won't bring machinery down heavily road into town for small lots and we can't subdivide it so I SAT again it's becoming a wasting you and all that we clearly recognized councils financial plight and we are happy to contribute our fair share however we ask you what is fair about an iniquitous devices and inconsistent approach there is underpinned by lack of professionalism and blatant to stay at the common courtesies around communication and consultation as you will notice from the handout the objection to this process when there was last attempted in 2004 credited for aura and we're upheld by the council with destroyed by land holders of that time is devious device at the ludicrous not our words but we can't agree more and by the way we are aware that many of the landowners targeted at that time have not been talkative this time we wonder why we respectfully suggest that the previous rating regime remain in place until the council completes its review communicates the legal basis for that review and its outcome and a transparent manner and that uniform basis after appropriate consultation alternatively if you can convince your penance the land should be zoned residential than ourselves and many others are we more than happy to play residential rate Thank You melamine thank you I'll answer any questions yeah I always think she just while he was speaking trying to find it on the loop because um so you're saying that it was recast as residential and the draft lit by understanding is that exactly that it was put in originally into one of the early versions of the loop but then was taken out by the council planners I don't it's because I mean there was a process that preceded our election so the loop was all completed by the time we were elected so I wasn't aware that they were earlier though I knew there was one draft that went out for public consultation you saying it was in there no I was a different pride or any public culture okay so so neither it neva made it unto the into the draft for public consultation did you submit that yeah we be women submitting on this land for differences are so different mechanisms are probably 14 have you have you submitted on the district plan review oh you have okay hazel sailing either the rezoning issue is really a district plenary sure we understand it yeah what we're talking about here is a rating issue in the iniquities we've gone around well I mean I can't comment on FM yani just interested to understand how have you been given any explanation as to why you've charged a real rate sorry or is it an urban residential rate yeah when you're zoned rural and I was interested to know out of your neighbors how many are in the rural zone but are paying urban rates yes we have been given some explanation I have to say that the correspondence that comes back from council officers youth dictates not weeks but months has been entirely frustrating and in our particular Road over there Jason neighbors one is not being imposed with these particular rate premiums and then explained on the road is okay well it because the acting chief executive will will undertake to follow that up and she'll report back to us as well as you so that means we know what the outcome was so that we can get an answer quickly all I can say to you with that last time around 10 years ago included you know the Arroyo River orchards saw earlier residents association with people out surpassed the airport are also involved and then that was as I was over 10 at the time but I'm not usually how why that's gone this time we have asked that detail but haven't_''_547.99 been provided okay well we'll follow it up and get it fonda so thank you very much for you for your time and they give you a time like this I on 35 uses the right power in the city but never felt as they were needed to do this but yeah okay well let's see if we can find a solution okay Allah
Moving on the new zealand manufacturers and Exporters Association John Molly welcome do they should all have one page that's the one yep and I'm really only going to talk briefly to that and then requires an answer any questions that you've got so just in case you hadn't noticed that the tradable sector is under considerable pressure it's a pretty tough out there margins are under pressure costs arising selling prices are hard to move standard sort of line that are run on many occasions and sort of price increases around six percent or three or four times what we can generally get out of the market today so think that that sort of puts the thing in in context from the membership we have really no strong reactions to the annual plan this time it was the middle year of three years and they said well it's six in our percent that was what was predicted but it's not really a success we wish we could get the same sort of price round it arises and the discussion around debt is balance sheets in the medium too so I guess the flag today would be to make a difference not to sink into the detail and saying what you ought to do because I know you're going through a strategic exercise but encourage you to think outside the box and maybe do things a bit differently and don't get into the sort of binary sell assets or don't sell assets there are good reasons to sell assets they're bad reasons to sell assets so so just don't get into that sort of yes no dichotomy you're the things you can do to talk about you know think about the anchor projects a good few of those could be seen as optional and and they could be scheduled out but ask the community what he thinks I mean I don't think I've ever been asked and I might have of you and you might have a different view but but I'm sure if we put our minds to it we could know where the general view was and implement that in some sort rate which will reduce the debt which will then deal with the exposure or the risk we might carry that was mentioned in terms of interest rates rising but get the infrastructure done quickly and then bit of a sort of sectional interests you know try and really focus on on local preference you spending local money spending it locally is a good idea deal with the issues around the district plan in terms of reverse sensitivity and the user place conflicts that I mentioned in the presentation and I guess the final point I'd make is understand the spending vectors what brings money into the city and what takes money out of the city and try to sort of reinforce the stuff that brings the money into the city so I'll answer any questions you've got now that's a minute longer than I intended to speak so I'm sorry about that I just I'll start off but I think that's an interesting idea about going out for community feedback on priorities I know that you know there's been public discussion around part of the performing arts precinct and in some ways it you know that that maybe it is time with with good information to go out and actually have that is a very public conversation and get some feedback but I think what you're saying is while we're out there to talk about the others as well I think again it's not really you sort of ask the question here the anchor projects given you can only do one at once which one would you do first which one would you do second which one would you do through about setting priorities and it's not a hard thing to do a rank correlation say this is what the community sees in terms of the order now whether that spread over five years 10 years or 15 years then comes back to the debt situation and now liquid the city years and this is why I make the comment this isn't I think the future for the next five to 10 years is going to be more about balance sheet management the capital account that is publicly on things like the town hall we've been out through public process like this with head feedback and we had an overwhelming majority and support it was before doing it it's so for the quarter meeting the report yeah but but I think you know it's an interesting point isn't it because we get people coming and saying to us things are so slow strawberry litigating things just have some certainty have some clarity and then we seem to get this kind of thing about well we need to go out and talk more over certain things but the cost share there's never been any public consultation over and I wonder whether you would support us actually consulting with our community over the agreement that we have with government than the single most biggest agreement in the history of our city detention once we changed it myself between local and national government now this time I I was just thinking when I wrote this or when we talked about this I was thinking about something just just very very simple and straightforward we've however it's paid it's got to get paid for because whoever builds it's going to going to get paid so where the money comes from is a separate discussion to ask in the community about what are the priorities that you see across these optional now if you're a super super keen rugby supporter you might not see a stadium as optional if you're somewhere else on the spectrum you might see differently but it's really asking on those optional projects the things that we clearly can live without because we are living without them what they might see is the priority because that then informs our spending rate or potentially in forms of spending rate where the money comes from a slightly different deeper question and that goes back to my first point about old commitment you know off the table let's talk about this the wages yep Tim and thank you very much for your presentation asst common sense it's just straight to the point and I'm done going for long so thank you very much for this like it doesn't go on for long it's always a good point absolutely if we remove the town hall out of the picture I do I early agree with the game back to the public with regards to those anchor projects would you agreed if we reviewed those Inca projects to take one step further I mean for instance the major sports facility should it have elite sports it but some items in there or should focus on community and ratepayers I mean your thoughts on there and you can take that to the library and also the stadium I can't give you an opinion on that I don't I can give you my opinion for what that's worth but I don't have an opinion from the association's perspective so I'm better just not really really answering really could be a politician yeah thank you in terms of the manufacturers and exporters I mean you know when when one whenever I talk about the impact of the earthquakes on the Canterbury economy you know I always say that you could be excused for that it's the it is the the manufacturing and the and the large rural hinterland that we service as a city that that means that our economy remains incredibly buoyant despite the mess of impact and the center of the city on on the earthquake so should we be telling a stronger story about about the economy and why it is a strong economy I think that the strength of the economy is its diversity and and it's also the place where most manufacturers and exporters sit there are very few high streets consumer products that are made in New Zealand for all the reasons of scale etc etc but the relationship tends to be in supply chains and so we supply or the people who make things and so when the guy who runs the Electrolux plant rings up from from Adelaide rings up the tomtom soon as the elastomer and says yeah I relieved at an earthquake and that's a bit of a problem yeah yeah it's a bit of when am I getting my stuff because they've got a beast to feed people didn't get up and running within a week to two weeks they had no business anyway irrespective of the earthquake and so that that for the ones that weren't fortunately we're fortunate enough not to have their factories closed as a result of a problem or no the natural one or the man-made one of the barriers and the cordons that went up which it a few people then they've really got to get up when going quick and that drives that resilience it's not so it isn't an option you've got to move very quickly one of the I mean I just wonder whether we have captured enough of those Brazilian stories as you know for lessons learned you know one of the lessons learned that I think we've all taken from that immediate response from central government was that the the wage subsidy was like the most powerful measure do you want to comment on there oh it's it's the universal comment from everybody I talked to well the wage sucks that he did was took the wasn't the worry about throwing extra resource of things I mentioned Tom Thompson again he had his people out in his supply chain helping them fix up their wills well that goes hit them in the garret I think that was enough that was the people in the factory but really that that you know the logistics people who didn't have the depth in the management system to actually deal with the extra problems that the event had thrown on them so Tom had got his people out helping them sort of things on this bag of plastics looks much like the same as that bag of but if you mix them together they both useless that and so that that type of skill was actually pushed out into the individual supply chains but again take my first points everybody is under pressure and what that extra wage subsidy did was let people focus on the problem not focus about paying for the problem yeah I think it's a hugely powerful message and you know I've got a sense that we need to be learning the experience and that's one that I think we really ought to be embedding unto future planning for that simple and effective yep yep it's excellent well thank you very much for fans gone very quickly but thank you very much for making the effort to come undone very strong submission and now I'd like to invite
Microphone is where okay that's it okay well thank you very much madam mayor I'd like to start on a positive note by congratulating you and your council colleagues on the way in which since last year's election you've hit the ground running and faced up to a huge raft of daunting challenges and that's even before the floods and I'd like to thank you as a beckenham resident for the responsive alacrity with which you and the council have begun to address the flooding crisis as an administrator of the beckenham neighborhood facebook group which now has nearly 450 members I've been very keenly aware of the impact of the recent flooding on many residents lives this flooding has been the worst I've seen in over 34 years as a beckenham resident and I think that makes it clear that the the rivers flood prone this has increased as a result of the earthquakes so in addition to whatever proposals emerged from the task force I'd urge the council to review the appropriateness of the current extent of proposed development to note positively is the news that completion of five of the so-called anchor product is to be deferred and I welcome even more the deletion of at least two of those projects namely the stadium and the convention center as far as I said they're white elephants that should be slaughtered and I don't think I'm alone in that view now the positives I've mentioned so far make some aspects of the draft annual plan all the more disappointing to me at least firstly is I'd like to mention the proposed cutter over two million dollars in spending on strengthening communities you know over three years after earthquakes we we still have traumatized people and communities throughout the city and to make to propose a cut like this at a time like this see it strikes me as shockingly callous quite frankly the reduction in library hours is not such a vital issue but again it strikes me as a piece of mean and petty cheese pairing that will detract from residents quality of life especially those unable to visit a library during the is the proposal to eliminate walk-in service desks at beckenham elsewhere on Saturdays again the only day when many working people are able to visit a service center and there are two aspects of this that I want to emphasize one is that you know eight years ago I was involved in fighting a proposal to eliminate those those desk customer service those customer service deaths altogether and the first time I saw this proposal my thought first thought was oh my god they're at it again and this is the thin end of a wedge one point thing that really needs to bear in mind to be borne in mind is that for many people the the staff of the service center counters are the face of the council they don't just deal with rate payments and dog licenses over the years I've seen countless instances of counter staff at beckenham giving advice and help on a variety of matters and the council's face time with residence is a vital part of the way it interacts with the people of Christchurch and it makes an the grassroots but it seems to me that you know it's something else that I'm concerned about in this proposal is the what I see as a deceitful manner in which ratepayers are being invited to what this draft plan on the basis of a summary from which most of this from which this proposal has been admitted most permitted most people won't look at the full document they won't search it they won't find this proposal and yet when they give their cut there if they express support they will be taken as supporting that proposal which they have not seen that is sneaky and you know it's it's hat it's a practice that has been that has occurred over many years and it seems to me a system a show of systematic deceitfulness that's going to change the last thing I want to focus on is the democracy and governance section of the of the draft plan which in me in many ways strikes me as the most depressing board the targets for percentage of residents who understand how council makes decisions in the best interests of Christchurch eight years ago the target figures was seventy-five percent the actual was forty-seven percent so there's been a progressive decline both in performance and in aspiration and this strikes me as a symptom of a management culture that really doesn't give a damn about how people out there think and that's something that I hope you and your colleagues together with dr. Edwards will be able to start changing that I suspect it will take some serious and high-level butt-kicking and head rolling I wish you luck thank you Peter and thank you for your attention I would love to hear questions but we've come to the end of time but despite your harsh words I know that you have come you know with the best of intentions and I I must have met that I hadn't actually looked at the service levels for the expectations around people's understanding about what we did but they might actually be realistic rather than rather than aspirational so in fact they might actually be aspirational so we might you very much I really appreciate it thank you thank you and
And now we have them David close who is well known to a number of councillors here is a former councillor as a former chair of the Finance Committee as I believe yes I seem to recall that thank you very much I'll be very brief I'll just emphasize the main points of my submission and leave a bit of time for questions went the first point that I really made was that there's not enough information in this document to fulfill its primary purpose which was admirably stated by the mayor and the acting chief executive introduction when they said we need to decide what is important and what can wait but this plan did not really provide the public with the information in the sort of form to which the public could respond and provide you with guidance on what the public see is the priorities secondly and this is more serious there's not enough have financial information in this document for the council to make a decision on this annual plan because although it sets out briefly the problems you face such as rating base the higher interest rates the reduced joosten parent insurance payout and the higher costs it does not quantify the effects of these increase costs on your long-term plan because if you borrowing 2 billion for 30 years you've got to know the impact not just on 2014 15 which is what this plan does you've got to know the impact for the future and you're deciding as a result of this plan to borrow another 500 million or I think it's 575 million and the interest rates are going up by one percent so that's another five point seven five million that you've got to provide for interest just on that new burrowing but there is nothing here which gives councillors and the public the long-term impact of the financial decisions which are in this plan there's no spreadsheet 14 years showing total operating expenditure total capital expenditure for each year rates required etc cumulative debt and thus was standard in all council annual plans until a few years ago so I noticed that the council was a little self congratulatory for this year to six percent my christian is what impact does that have on next year because in my experience whenever we trim the rate increase for year one we often pushed it out for year two so maybe and I guess Rafe knows the answer this question it may be that in filling it back to 6.6 percent this year you've actually pushed it out maybe to eight or nine next year I don't know but that's a sort of information you need to have before you can can decide whether or not to adopt this plan that's current state thirdly I thought the plan lacked a strategy to deal with the very significant financial crisis scratch your face the guts of what I think the council to try to do is on page page six of my submission where I say that the council should recognize that control and capital expenditure is the key to averting a debt crisis so controlling that capital expenditure is the key to to do it and so the council should endeavour to prioritize capital expenditure long lines here is I guess the most important point manage the capital program by a combination of deferrals downsizing staging and if necessary deletion of projects now this is not new stuff this is the oldest trick in the book and I think that an every financial plan of which I had any part we always had to go through this process every annual plan you defer some projects that can be deferred you delete a few that aren't important you downsize some and you staged some we can't afford to build the new big new bridge in one year will will fund it and build it over to so it's the problem your face is huge but it's not different in character from the problem which every council faces every year in other words you've got to manage down your costs in order to conform with what are the reason black station expectations of the community as far as rate increases go and according to prudent financial management so I guess what you know I didn't see a strategy here for doing this and suggested to me you're doing an annual player a bottle korra long term the long time actually here away you cannot really allow the counts of a hemorrhage for another year without actually doing something about it I guess if I think back to our capital programs we often had to reprogram about 50 million dollars expenditure capital expenditure when we're doing our annual plan your task probably is three program about 500 million and I do suggest as a little appendix their attachment I suggest ways in which you can save money by spreading the capital expenditure out over a slightly longer period and I was surprised to see what that you can get significant savings even from during say 1.6 1.6 billion of expenditure oh five and a half years instead of four over a period of the 30 years of the loan you actually save a hundred and fifty million simply by doing something over five and a half years instead of four if in my second example you decide to do things over seven years instead of four you actually save about 450 million so I would urge the council to consider using deferral as the chief instrument even if you started to reside and think I mentioned this in my paper even if you started to repair the Town Hall tomorrow it could take properly six years to finish it so why not but the bottom say okay we'll put the town hall on hold for five years or whatever and by doing that you save this incredibly steep build-up and in debt and you cut down on you on your costs especially for loan servicing I've noticed an earlier person say that that he wants rate increases in region of one to three percent and in that wood is lovely to have and you might be up heaven under normal times we're not living in normal times and you have inherited situation from previous counsel or councils who borrowed instead of putting up the rates instead of cutting expenditure they borrowed and so the council is on a bit of a hole even before the earthquakes and then the council pretended that you have all this loss of wealth know there was borrowing to to to fund an operational deficit so you're faced with a very difficult situation but see you bite the bullet the better just one more thing madam mayor about housing I referred in my submission to the fact that the objective in repair of housing is repair and rebuild of facilities undertaken as per the agreed facilities rebuild program I thought that was a bit vague but when I went to a housing committee meeting on Monday recently I think it might have been tuesday I was told that this facilities program for council housing runs out of money in august so it set out what will be done year by year over the next few years but the problem is you the program runs out of money in august so the facilities rebuild program is not worth really the paper it's written on beyond august however I understand that when the council gave the government or sold to the government the red zone land it included 113 red zone units and understand that the staff report at the time informed counselors that from the ordinary council funds into the housing development fund in order to compensate the housing development fund for that loss of the hundred and thirteen units that seems to be entirely reasonable 113 units 100,000 he chats about 11.3 million we had a price on that the other day at one of the hearings yeah it was more than that okay well I bet was just a back of an envelope but yeah whatever would actually enable that program to continue it won't help the council's overall financial situation make it a wee bit worse but I think it's unconscionable for it not that transfer not to take place sorry I've used my 14 minutes I've going to leave a lot of time for questions well I didn't want to ask a question and it was around waste minimisation because you've raised a concern that I wasn't aware of it and with respect to the amount of increase and one of the proposals that came to the council before that got to this stage was to review the numbers of times a concern worldwide certainly felt that they would be concern about going out and reducing services but I like your idea of reviewing the efficiency of the current waste minimization model because it's increased by you say it's gone from four percent of rating income to now ten percent of rating uncommon from 6.2 million to thirty four point seven million and I guess that was an apparent to me when we had our briefing on it because that's an amount of money I'm concerned about and would want us to review as a council le plea I'm David when you talk about the festivals and in standard ends you talk about success with them and you suggest that look at reducing overall costs by thirty percent by deleting the least successful are you talking about attendance are you talking about money only what are you basing successful long is it a financial oh I guess if I were in your situation I put that over to the staff and say prioritize the nine million it's been six million in 2014-15 and prioritized you the city well but it might actually end up costing well II look at the recommendations I'm am personally I'm not in the position I always thought that the ice thing was a bit crazy because sometimes we had really warm with her in the week when we went to having a Snow Festival but really I don't know but what I do know is that that is absorbing a disproportionate amount of money if you can compare what you're spending on basic services like water which I think about 15 million years it may between the ad in a country this is a huge sum and it's rising as proportion of council expenditures others of its just rising accordance with its actually increased hugely so I think a hard look at efficiency I think provider capture has happened very much in this events industry and there are other people around the table you know more up this than I do I just think it's something she's ever really hard look at as for the waste minimisation it seems to me that most collected once a month and a red bin collected once a month I think the green one needs to be connected at least once a fortnight but if people in effect need more than one yellow been a month it would be quite easy so into paid team dollars or twenty dollars whatever's to have a second yellow bone or a second Redburn and there's nothing in the red bin or the yellow burn that couldn't wait for a few days most people I think would be happy and that could make a very significant saving and the counselors cough it were really really had every operational expenditure area and I mean I just looked at a couple but you people be more familiar with the some of these and see where savings might be made thank you very much for your submission I think I mean I just enjoyed reading it didn't enjoy reading it for the content but you've really eluded us to our responsibilities here to really scrutinize the numbers very very carefully and I'm really in pleased that you brought the meeting I'm allowed to do this but we've gone over time I just make a comment about your suggestion that we renegotiate the binding agreement with the government on the grounds that circumstances have changed since the agreement was signed that's an assumption that the people that signed the agreement didn't know what the circumstances were and yes they may not have changed from what was understood at the time when I read the quarter mental report it seemed to me that they were saying that the council at the time of signing agreement disputed some of the Crown's figures carry a tune of about or maybe three or four hundred million and that they were some under some pressure to decide within a very short space of time and obviously under normal circumstances the council have said hey let's defer this for a few days let's ask our staff there was more information but instead because of the pressure of the parliamentary timetable the council was pressured into making the decision very quickly under threat of losing money maybe other that saying what I'm putting on the table is that there were people who sign the agreement who knew exactly what the situation could be for the council and they signed it anyway yeah it's good thinking thank you
To the council meeting on the annual plane and if you'd like to present your submission that would be great thank you about a mare counselors it's Friday afternoon you've had a long week you're probably all flagging a little bit and I thought the two things I could probably do that here you off a little bit apart from making sure you had the tea break was firstly to say that green rebel is delighted to be a friend and ally of the City Council while still being fiercely independent of course but we really value the support that the council has given to us in response to the initiatives that we took after the sep tember 2010 and subsequently februari 2011 earthquakes we're a community project with proudly a community project but we've been supported by the city council to do it well so firstly thank you and I can say that there's some confidence because you're very generously entered into a three-year funding agreement with this last year which I'm sure you're honoring so on the basis what I thought I should do as my other contribution to the afternoon is to show you a few quick pictures and tell you a quick feedback on what we've achieved this year so that when you trouble around the city and talk with colleagues and cap officers and others you can say oh yes that's one of the green double garden doesn't it because we've actually got quite a few of them so if I'll run quickly through some pictures and see if that's going to be a useful illustration to use you a couple of minutes on this topic greening the rubble we're a challenge of the trust we make temporary gardens and the first of our sites it does seem a long time ago was built after the FEHB after the sep tember earthquake and disappeared into the red zone following the 2011 earthquake and they emerged from the red zone full of wild flowers around the nice emergence so that was the garden where ASCO used to be on the corner of Victorian Salisbury and of course that's fair to say I tracked it buildings of the redevelopment so all credit to the McFarland family for not only offering the site in the first place to allow us to get started but I'm putting something back to the urban fabric that least is interesting we've now reached our 21st garden which is not too bad for a community group that have no idea when they took on the first project that we're going to move on this for so long and such complexity we're starting to build on a project in Columbus tree I'm not going to tell you what it's going to be because it's a surprise we've got all the design sorted all material sorted most of the funding sorted and that project involves a linker between green rubble and another project that came out of the earthquakes it's very appropriate celebrate our 21st project by getting together was cracked for Christ's Church because crank for Christ's Church make mosaics out of the broken domestic crockery of the earthquake what a nice tea look it quite soon which I hope you'll enjoy seeing this year we've returned five of our early sites to their owners so that they can be redeveloped certainly the rebuild can be underway listed there our second built site was on sand Asif Street which made up a car park start with less ugly third or fourth site was at Pico where the whole foods store used to be hmm we made a side opposite palace video in two and street we did a a secret music room it's little back sections anyone we've done that's off the road and had a piano installed in it by gap filler to add to the fun that music room sites on Sid nums going back to its owner and then most recently we'd be moving materials off our site on the corner of Salisbury Madras because that site has changed hands and the new owner will redevelop the site so farewell to those Gardens but the key thing about our gardens is that the materials they're built with a relocatable so we're actually able to new place in a completely new configuration but we've not thrown anything away and process we're very frugal we get materials we keep using them as long as we can and of course our stock of plants that started off when they were given to us this big are now this figure so actually we can add a lot more greenery than we used to examples of that the project we share with gap filler near to the cathedral on the corner austral Colombo known as the Soundgarden and two projects on peterborough street one of them opposite the library and the other one next to the new art central facility which you may have seen a very good craft gallery hmm so those have been built with recycled material we've taken Gardens apart we put them on the near side some of our gardens continuing use we're not under pressure to move off them so there's a simple but quite funky little site in New Brighton there's the site which rob will camouflage by the wildflowers there but the one of these the everybody wants it to belong to them as recent I saw some posters from gap filler showing pictures of this site's I've got a slap nearest but this site this site is the coffee zone kiosk on Columbus street in Sidon them we're told by the local business association this is being a significant contributor to the revitalization soon and on the right one of our food growing areas this is a community food garden in fitzgerald avenue then we had a rather rather nice successor lee this year can I credit my colleague Jonathan sitting behind me here for coming up with not only a great design but getting it built on time and then winning a silver distinction at ellerslie with it its global relations forth a lot because that's a really nice project and it's built as a relocatable garden so we're going to put that back into the restart mall which is a nice arrangement so thank you to any members present to help us out with that because it was really good to be able to know that we away afterwards it gets reused with an interesting new partnership very challenging actually quite expensive project we've got a bit of taxpayer money into this one because Department of Conservation came to the party and we built a project that's proving very popular with young people I mean very young people the ones you'd like to paddle well I know most of you like to paddle actually but the one solid bit it the most minute talk so this is this is a an artificial braided River it's a pumped braided River that recirculates water across a stony area lots of different plantings representative of Canterbury a great little project much enjoyed ads on crown land so we can have to see how long last summer it gets subsumed by a building site or too long bits of a lovely addition to the east frame and my colleagues today including our volunteers behind not to mention we invited Jonathan to come in support and he said well I'll bring whoever's volunteering with me today can I just mention to you that his volunteers today because her partner's come here with one of the construction companies woman sitting next to us from New York whose partners come here to work and a woman on the right who enjoyed volunteering so much previously that she met allowed here and she's coming back to join him she's not excellent so can I just say and each week people come and volunteer and try and take part and they're not just locals there are also people to all over the world who are concerned what's happening in Canterbury and want to help out so this project green roofs there's a lot of rhetoric wasn't there just after the earthquake about oh yes well the green city will have things like green roofs these are actually three of the first green roofs you'll see in Christchurch it's just a demonstration site and we're still waiting for the commercial world to start putting green roofs on their buildings that's site on Cranmer squares with the visit year ahead we're going to look in the central city and in and the east where local residents have got plenty of open spaces and would rather like some of these gardens and remember with your encouragement we don't get tied just to the central city but that we can do work beyond the Central City with your support I've asked the mayor about this and I've asked your office's about it and they said they don't see a problem with this it's getting a lot harder to find sites and central city ladies and gentlemen as you probably noticed it's a sea of cars we would like you we endorse points made earlier by Ryan Reynolds a couple of days ago we think you need to think hard about incentives for the owners of sites and make them available for public benefit and public benefit is more than car parking hmm I know there's a pressure commercially to provide car parking but you'll make such a boring unattractive hostile central city it's eaten by cars don't do it and then the final point I think it is clear the city we do appreciate your support for our work we hope you can help us to help the city and we've really enjoyed the opportunity to be involved so far thank you thank you Paul just want to say thank you very much your your group has actually helped put Christ Church on the world map as a place to visit and we look at New York Times number two in the world or places must visit and the lonely planet number six and it is organizations like itself that comes through and that's really creative things and show and actually what resilience is all about and how people bounce back and create some fun in a place of devastation so I say thank you reversed and all your crew and the work you did to actually help ask it restart looking the way that we open okay thank you nope thank you for your presentation it's great to see the collection of photographs yeah I use some of them myself when I get my talk see last week so it's much appreciated love what you do weekend when it right same goes
CCS disability action it's a page page 126 of your folders thank you very much for agreeing to come on up but earlier since we was a penis thank you very much for the opportunity to you be here today I went for ccs disability action and on the axis coordinator manager of the mobile ad parking and I'm a barrier-free advisor the trust of my submission is to ensure that we take the opportunity to build a fully accessible City we had quite a lot of opportunity with the previous council to explain the accessibility issues I know you've got a very new council so this is a good opportunity to just go over some of the necessary reasons for us to take this opportunity the idea that access is only for disabled people as a myth when you design and build for people with impairments you create a safer and more convenient environment for everyone good access benefits everyone and it brings considerable wider economic and social benefits some of them are more people employment because of the workplaces are accessible more customers for businesses their own home and remain in their community instead of having to move into rest homes and residential homes appearance for small buggies children small baggies and people temporary injuries can continue to access the community it was interesting that the mr. Goff was before me because I had the opportunity to review his planes early in the and their concept and was extremely excited to find the amount of emphasis he had placed on accessibility and those plans and if more of our buildings are built to that standard then we will succeed here in Christchurch for too long now we have talked the talk but not walk the walk New Zealand ratify the united nations convention on the rights of human persons with disabilities in 2008 article 9 of convention states that two of the obligations we signed up to implement legislation and policies to ensure disabled people able to realize their rights and adopt measures that help foster respect and dignity for the rights of disabled people yet we still look for ways to avoid assuring that those with disabilities are fully included in our community we issues are not covered in earthquake strengthening work we have legislation that does not require some two and three-story buildings have lifts and here in Christchurch we are building a number of those buildings so that means we are putting in place a number of inaccessible buildings for the life of those buildings I ask you honors committee how would your ability to function in your current role be affected if you had a disability stepped thresholds steep inclines he be narrow doors having to chicken and advance of the restaurant meeting room or theatre or toilet was accessible how would you feel if you were disabled and been out with friends to a restaurant only to find that it wasn't accessible or if it was your entrance was around the back probably via a kitchen or a store she'd I congratulate the council having recently opened up the the housing that was in the paper a couple of days ago that is a one it's a great improvement and I'll give you eight and a half or nine out of ten of them there are seen improved and happy discussed at a later date I also congratulate you for sign an MoU with life mark proving your commitment to building adaptable accessible and healthy housing units I don't want to go on too long as I know you're very busy but access fig affects all of us but people with physical or sensory impairments are more effective than others 3800 and 380 3,500 people had a physical impairment and 239,000 people had a century impairment in 2006 when you design and build for people with impairments you create a safer and more convenient environment for everyone and to take off a science TV program all people ability wants us to boldly go where everyone else has been so I ask the council to use the local expertise that is available to ensure we get things right we have an opportunity in Christchurch to set the standard for an accessible City provide good access and you will be telling the disabled community you are important you're entitled to have the same opportunities as those who do not have a disability and we will jeopardize that message and also you would like to add that it is noted that a lot of people with disabilities from overseas now are taking the opportunity to come to New Zealand then they travel more and more so an accessible City is going to be a thriving City so thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you today and I'm quite happy to accept any questions well just think that one of the one of the points that maybe you didn't explore as the huge cost there is imposed largely on central government and both the health sector in an ACC so on us through livie's that we pay for retrofitting when when you know somebody's no longer able to you know sort of you know easily live in the home environment that they're on either because they've had an accident that's created a permanent impairment or you know they have an illness and said this literally millions of dollars spent retrofitting houses so it actually makes good economic sense to build accessible environments from the outset it that having signed the life mark mou which no its cover they used to be the minister for acc yes I didn't want to get tied up in too much detail but you're quite right the the cost and retrofit is is staggering and if we do if houses are built or facilities are built accessible either to the life max 10 an auto fully accessible then that retrofitting cost is is negated yeah so I mean I just think that sometimes when we are considering our plan so our annual plan and our budget we don't think of the potential savings that we're making for the benefit of the wider public spend you know so when we're when we're investing and building accessible units it actually has a benefit somewhere else down the track and we don't measure there and there is as much as the scale mangers may tell you there is actually very little difference none building accessible buildings as non-accessible yes and that is that is true fell thank you very much for talking with us just on that public but non public buildings private building ously with what with a lip for example a lift is required that it will be placed part of our district lean but it's something which will be interested in thank you too for ripping and representing people disabilities that you also clearly support the concept of social housing which as you know is for people with disabilities I just want to ask you to about the Pat section on on disability mobility parking spaces is it is you able to work with council staff to ensure that in fact the provision of those is adequate certainly a.m. and one of the greatest our greatest problem with mobility parking is abuse of obviously of the mobility parts and that you'll see a note in there I raised the issue that was looked at some time ago by council of making those paths painted blue and there's proven proven research that will show that they're less likely to be abused if they're blue the yellow symbol quite often fades out in people so I didn't see it whatever they are the biggest problem with parking is affected mobility parking spaces on private property ie supermarket areas I'm not able to be monitored by council packing wouldn't so therefore the abuse and malls etc is very high it was I was very stunning because they actually did the reversed of me they place in their wheelchairs and non-disabled packs yeah um yeah Lee um just so close aware we I am working with the advisory group that we have internally to look at the blue car parks but the question I really had is you know there's a lot of stuff is coming left to doing because people have goodwill or a good and teamed but we're in the process of signing and housing accord with government do you think we should be as part of their accord given the huge number of rebuilds and repairs happening be putting in place some firm regulation around minimum requirements for accessibility if you're going to do accessibility you ensure accessibility then it's got to be the hundred percent and the life mark is fine but's why I raised a cup of small issues with the ones out at done the place of what it is they said it should certainly be a number of accessible units within any of any of your plans if that's what you asking me um so if we just live it to the private market we know that there'll be some that will do it because it's you know they feel that they that it should they should do it and they can see that the benefits but there we hold a bit like people that don't remove asbestos or you don't put insulation that we just leave it to them up the private market most the places that get done probably won't get insulation won't get create a more healthy won't get made more accessible do you think as part of our approach with government we've got a special housing Accord that with in the process of talking about is that we should be putting on some firmest standards or requirements in regards to accessibility yes certainly do one council stock obviously it's more affordable and I weird affordable the issue with people with disabilities they're they're spending because they a lot of the mount employed they don't have that and come that can afford public housing I know of one developer who who built three really good accessible houses I actually audited them for him after he completed them unfortunately has what he needed to get back out of them was out of the range of most people with disabilities so you know there is a need for the council stock thank you very much I mean that it's a really really good submission on we really appreciate it thank you
Tuatara films Drusilla hi nice to see you shut up shut up I'll stand up because I'm sure I hope everybody has read my folders possession 14 years boot I am a strategic cleaner entrepreneur social entrepreneur and we have a lot of things in the pipeline the biggest problem our farm of the council was lack of communication five minutes to do a presentation and we're talking 14 years where we can make me and other project immense this one and that's what I find very hard you're I'm long to envision we need rail your population base is moving out of the city they will probably stay out of the city but they're coming in to work and you may not also realize that like and ring you're sixty percent of your teacher than that all come from Christchurch and the buses I start sometimes on call six o'clock in the morning I did traffic management yesterday I'm doing construction I'm event organizer right what I found was no bus can you work it go to the have a civil of urgency there's no water is no there's no signs telling people these are straight basic things we need to get the basics war and the problem seems to be basically communication we r 0 from clinics what's wrong with having a cup of tea once a month people walk them with an idea talk two phones because that's what's actually happening Fletcher's doing there serious doing their thing why are they planning our city and they have the door shut I'm really annoyed about the majestic getting bold are you getting shoved out into the outskirts that was a great facility I'm going to vent organizer we've been planning on now first of all I want to say I love you I think you're doing a good job right now my film project is 12 to 20 million it's in the men's room period food during the elections I found that they were going to build an industrial site over the city water near the graves the symmetry of growth through of quake victims so I've done seminars for 25 years screen Canterbury 48 and what I realized I thought hey why don't we build a Japanese garden there and develop it into a film set long-term vision to 20 it's a pie-in-the-sky evolves first of all protecting the land making sure that nobody builds an industrial site next to the graves this is very be read to me that's a big thing but I'm looking the long-term vision acid it should be the garden city of dreams our logo should be the art gallery should not be the cathedral we need to do a land swap for the cathedral it's causing a bit a lot of bad karma and actually I'm really angry about the cathedral but also to now talking as a center I'm a singer if you actually rebuilt that Cathedral as a trust it could be a great event center for the city plus the Town Hall what I'm finding is an event organizer even though you're building halfway sentence we can't even get in okay now I did I've actually done is just fifteen thousand dollars of my own stuff I've set up events all over Christchurch I live around Europe we built a 19 million dollar Paul what people don't realize that was six years of Lobban community group of 40 the council they set up a legal structure they had community people the Lions Club spent eight years making playhouses to make 40,000 for the middle pool the qe2 site I was one of the original to deal with players we did around the world in 80 days the whole of Christ chit fund for that why has that money gone elsewhere where that money should really go back to the qe2 site we're talking maybe 127 land or 90 men back should go back to the qe2 site I don't believe that you will be able to build a 50 meter pool and we built a 25 lines 25-meter eight lanes and that cost 19 million comfort cover you can bring up David is of wine every and you will tell you a little bit and how much it costs if you pick your site qe2 and then you've also got the metro center I believe you need to strategically plan these things I am for the stadium the reason why I put the stadium and the plan now is you need to start planning for the statement what I've also notice now if you're not on all the buildings down plus our history we go in there why am I going to go in there we going to have to go in for events now the elder flower show great facility I love the marketing but it was too big no communication sended doing a survey I use the internet I use email but I don't do surveys but I'll walk in and have a cup of tea and I'll tell you I spent two hours waiting at the bus stop I've got given the wrong bus I got the wrong directions so what's it going to be like for tourists I walk in and I see one team continental great facility see the other one he only needed one I 20 years why do I need to go and see a trade show the gardens which facility I with their pacifically to see the bond I display and the fashion show was to die for okay I shouldn't have come here in five you know I'd like to just talk about that type of thing over a cup of tea then everything else now getting back with our youth we need to support our you as a parent if you get on the internet now as a chatty I can get a job and Wellington Auckland right now right what's keeping my here my children you music my children doing education all right another thing that I've noticed with you bringing in a lot of immigrants and that for your trades that's good you know some of that's good but what's happening now our own people who haven't been trade and I'm talking adults are getting left behind I'm really for adult apprenticeships and I'll tell you why I'm a trainee on a qualified cabinetmaker not being over and do the pre-training okay cost me money now head to buy a car as a treaty I cannot get work anywhere unless I got a car so these are the issues people are facing and then the other thing is our film industry has gone back 20 years we need to have some kind of website for our film ok this is we're talking money and bus exchange row you've greenman network sorry and but anyway we'll see you've been to organize and what I've done is set up festivals charity balls right and then we've got Assateague merchandising now I actually read the Littleton no summer community board and said scene I've got a photo for some of night of 210 work can't we get the rights for that report on the tissue and I will give you that and you can use there as part of the fundraising for the new project the answer I got was so it's not my main deck and so is it o bobl its new Christians let's do it another minute indeed for a really impassioned submission clearly you're involved in lots of different facets of life in the city and you know I'm loving the vision that you put forward in some ways as well you know a really active city center will the Cathedral the Town Hall the majestic theater you know it's your vision for the city is great I notice some point number four is it point number three on your submission is the Victoria clock and you didn't mention that in what you've spoken to us about this afternoon what was your thoughts about the Victoria clock what happened was when I came here as a gentleman he got up and did a special presentation in front of Bob Parker and I thought it was a great idea and his was that the one of the faces on the clock stops and part of what I do is go around and look at different logos and different things on the Heather when we do our film I forgot to tell you that I've got another film project which is called filmed 260 so we're setting up all the first festivals we've done centres Lawsky and that will be in your Regent Street the antarctic street the antarctic center it's one of 20 stories if you imagine big bird and Sesame Street I've got gumboot you Regent Street the chalice the flying machine it's eight years of planning to 16 we filmer we've already got ninety percent of the stock the victorian clock is part of it as well okay so when I see sense this is what I do I check out all the sites then I turn around visualize how we're gonna film it and then not only is it going to be filmed the whole script will actually be developed so that a community group can put a play on every two years and say we've got the Worcester lumens club and we've also got the scottish society hall in each where when we put on a production once I get to Drama Camp is going then half the money will actually go to that community what the problem for I cannot get fun them but I can give a community group the stock if that's what I've done every group I work with they end up about sixteen hundred dollars with a stock and then enables them to apply for a grant to flip through their funding and what will happen is say if they're doing a Christmas grotto we did a s Grove I loaned them two thousand dollars with a stock we turn around and we did an event we had four thousand children through and we they made six thousand so then when things go through counsel and you say like just an example new brighton and you say oh we're going to fundraise for the sport but we're actually twenty or forty percent short then we will come up and frustrating and they might to her and say well we've already been doing debe dirty I what you don't know is that my vision for Christchurch is that about to 17 to 18 will have a green moon festival down Victoria Street which we do jazz blues in Kaiapoi New Brighton Littleton is pirate festival and so what I mentioned waiting on sorry I won't be too long is actually the Sumner surf life club to be built and we're going to put them stands a grotto in there and then I'm also waiting on the littleton woolston we will commence club we're going to put a wardrobe in there so that means the loons can fund it means a corolla can come over and from the hospital I've looked at all that type of stuff does that help it's very helpful with it thank you very much to asilo good to see you again thank you cheers and
Yep and anyone else you want to bring with you so you've got mark with you and I was waiting for your scones welcome hi thank you and thanks hi everyone and thank you for letting me speak I know most of you but there's three or four that I don't so yeah thanks this opportunity for those of you don't know me I'm a community coordinator Wrecking in the eastern suburbs but only with the elderly and the Christchurch East areas and we round week I coordinate nine groups for the elderly during the week and we ran a lot of other community activities as well as long as that DG co-op footcare lunches and many other activities and functions in excuse well anytime we can have a good time we do high teas at and June Queen's birthday and anything like that scones with the counselors who won't everyone happens I don't think I don't think yarn is very good on anyway ignore up yeah if you're too fast le Jojo judges anyway yeah firstly Pauline thank you strengthening communities funder and febri back and febri thanks for that yeah and all the other counselors as well that supported that we really appreciate that secondly I hope you will read the comments on behalf of the Christchurch East community groups that that I submitted with the original submission and I've also got comments today from other groups in the eastern suburbs or our other community leaders and eastern suburbs thirdly I'd really want to say that I we you know all of us here sure appreciate the difficult position that the council's and particularly at the moment financially we really appreciate that but we the rule and were aware that it's a very difficult time and only in the priests last night I read it last night not the morning there was four groups and the first six pages wanting the crotchet City Council for various funding and support not gosh where do you draw the line but you know I feel really strongly that may still make the submission despite the the financial problems that you're having because the funding in the but the ratepayer the participants on the ground and that there are people we've got to look after them at the time the as the title of the sponge suggests the council recognizes the contributions that are organ organ ization are currently making to society our community groups are the anchors of our society as you'll probably be aware it has been stated by many people that we're both anchors and the troubled seas we are their rocks and we are the glue that holds the communities together and oh yeah sorry the health and the welfare participants and attendance is already under huge stress and this will become even more fragile and stretched by further reduction and funding we convinced that costs this fund will eventually cost health boards and government agencies a lot more money in the long term we feel will be an increase in depression health issues and in some cases it may lead to substance in abuse and domestic violence as we all work with people suffering from loneliness and social isolation thus in tune will cost the society an individual happiness is very very important especially in these times after the earthquakes our organizations add welfare and well-being of our societies as well we create stronger individuals and create more competent communities the health and wealthy is already under huge stress and also become even more fragile and stretched by further reduction and the fan named to validate the statement I'm submitting a quote from dr. Rob Gordon and I hope the counselors all went and saw one of his attended one of his lectures he was excellent yeah he's a psychologist that's worked with the fires and the Kerak hurricanes and flooding over in Australia and he's brilliant he states it takes seven years for a community badly affected by disaster to recover what helps these communities most recover is one involvement to connection three community and for fun I really endorse the statement and I feel we provide all of the above community groups give excellent value for money with hard-working modestly pay coordinators and a large team of great volunteers who assist us to them are here with me today reduction and funding will that we currently provide we urge the council to adjust the budget if possible and if possible to not reduce the funding but to instead to increase it at least in line with inflation weird strongly that no reduction to allocate of funding be made I understand the final decision was going to be made next month in June I know that a number of you have already been attendance at the binomials side community see this is trust but I know that chairman of the trust would not mind me saying now he's actually going to extend an invitation for you all to attend our group so you can actually see what's happening meet the people see them see the location we're in we're doing a very utmost best we are and Rodney ratledge is the chair he'll be sending you an invitation but the day that you meet the most participants is on a wednesday in brookwood really welcome you there to see the program at work see what we do and talk to the attendings tenders yourself thanks for this time and than ever we need it we cannot stop the community grassroots work the people I've had we've got people that have shifted to the west as you'll be aware of because I'm in the middle of the red zone where we are but those people are still coming back to one only because this their community that's dear friends they and time maybe they all stopped coming but at the moment busting all coming because they really need it and that's as the forced move was a force movie that they had to go and they still are still traveling from Ireland from hornby from North cap and it's great that the still coming so please we need we need the funding we know we can't have it stopped or cut reduced thank you busy can I ask you a question if three if if you had a choice between continuing with the current grant system where every year you have to apply for a grant him not quite sure how much you're going to get or if we gave you on and do your job for the community with the community accountable directly to cut your trust which one would you choose second thank you thank you yani thank you you talked about rod gordon and one of the interesting things of courses you referred to the work he's done in Australia around bushfires hurricanes and flooding I just you know we hear a lot of other earthquakes and stress that's put people under we have had major flooding events and I just wondered you know sometimes I think people sort of a little bit under estimated just the impact that the floodings had on people particular no you're right in an area that was really badly affected so they can you just tell us a little bit about you know the impact of that second major natural disaster oh and immunity a lot for a week they didn't come I hardly had any one tune up because it was just another piece another thing that they had to cope with the elderly and in you that they stayed away I had a week but it't it did it was just another stress they became another wave of depression at them all right well so you gotta really I created vinced and bring them all and say hey this is what we're doing next week you know are you able to attend we're open you know so that that's what I do yani I keep I because of the people of some of them what one of my ladies she came to me during the week and she said it's taken me two hours to leave home to get here and she had I'd asked you to do I got Sarah and she's still on the position where she's in between ashes and a physique you see your insurance and I said and I introduced the guy from sarah the communications guy and I said a lot this is the guy you know will you ring him yes she would she hadn't rang him still so I said right next week if you haven't rung them we'll do it together right you come into my that call to the syrupy some but that's how fragile some of the only some of the only going fine they're okay in fact the initial reads owners thaw the lucky ones because that reestablish nair and they're actually quite there okay in their union new units but as the TC threes right as the ones are still living in their area they are fragile but I've got one lady yesterday she rang me she is in her 80s she's got health issues she was supposed to have heavier house rebuilt the commencement of her house rebuild was debris it's now going to be finished in December this year so this is what we're dealing with yes you do yeah absolutely this is what we deal with all the time but this is why you know this is what dr. rob bourdon sees have fun I am having fun but we do have serious we do have a anyone that I can think of I've had people on depression sleep shoes anything that I can think of that will help those people it doesn't mean or so near to get through this I get them on every fortnight over the over speaker and as always it's still a lot of its still currently relating to the to the youth play this is I thank you that I mean that the times up but you know I mean a number of us know you'll work very well we've been there many times I of course not there's a former MP for the area but thank you publicly for what you do in the community you're you know if you could be cloned and your bud flood could be bottled and shared around we would want to choose you for that for that cloning so thank you very much for everything that you do you've made a really impatient plea but I really like your answer to my questions I know I know everyone yeah yeah yeah and even that's on borrowed time I just say that it's those of us who have gone through what we've gone through that this is still important I thought all don't we really measure any point I know usually made up it I'm thinking of a new way of delivering the funding which would actually reduce the cost of delivering the funding and produce a much better result for the community because they wouldn't have to send applications and every year and cross their fingers that they're going to get what they got the last year anyway so we'll just taken greatest grab a cup of tea and come
So if we move on to the Democrats for Social Credit bob fox and Jinna which way right thank you welcome madam mayor unfortunately Jenna couldn't make it our presentation will be presented by Robin Columbus that's that's acceptable that's fine welcome thank you thank you I would just like to pay attention to the first of our six submission points number one local body access to nil interest credit lines and loans from our sovereign bank as the spokesman for the Democrats for Social Credit Party we asked the cat City Council to seriously consider the use of no interest credit lines and loans from the reserve bank of new zealand to fund the Christchurch rebuild these loans would be used for essential capital works and would relieve ratepayers of an unsustainable debt servicing to the private financial sector the Reserve Bank is already equipped to provide such facilities as proven by the multi-billion dollar arrangement made in recent years for the major banks the use of reserve bank finance in this way has been used successfully in New Zealand before that is not new the first labour government 35 he used the Reserve Bank to fund the building of thousands of state houses a move based on his understanding of what was possible using social credit economic theory the 1949 report of the Ministry of Works says the sums advanced by the Reserve Bank were not subscribed or underwritten by other financial institutions the section shows the government's intention to demonstrate it is possible for the state to use the country's credit and creating new assets for the country the 2012 report of the International Monetary Fund states allowing the government to issue money directly at zero interest rather than borrowing the same money from banks at interest would lead to our reduction in the interest burden of government finances and to a dramatic reduction of net government debt given that irredeemable government issued money represents equity in the Commonwealth rather than debt the use of social credit ideas contributed to New Zealand coming out of the crisis that was the deep depression long before most other countries Christchurch is now facing a similar crisis the reserve bank funding is the only debt and without the need to sell SS ok the bigger picture if this isn't be enough the big social economic environmental challenges of today require we address the nature of the money system Crytek shitty city council's initiative to insist on a reserve bank no-interest loan for the rebuild this would be precedent-setting although I think after last night's budget announcement auckland may have beat you to it hmm I think they've received I don't know what the figure is but the government's going to bail them out on their roading edit at no interest so there is a precedent already said when Christchurch City Council accepts a loan from the reserve bank for infrastructures interest-free the money is spent into the economy to stimulate the real economy creating jobs and building businesses at present in the Western world seventy-seven percent of our money is trapped in house price bubbles and financial speculation forty percent and thirty-seven percent respectfully there is only thirteen percent in the non-financial business sector and credit cards and personal loans account for ten percent such an initiative as of breaking the monopoly of our money by the banks almost all the money in the economy ninety-seven percent in fact is on loan from the banks is this sector interested in local communities I leave that to you to answer reserve bank credit at no interest would go directly into the real economy of goods and services before it reaches financial markets and property bubbles research economists you know if and beans of the International Monetary Fund have indicated in there working paper the Chicago plan revisited that is an essence replacing money created by the banking system with money created by the state this approach to our monetary system has the potential for much smoother business cycles no possibility of bank runs a large reduction of debt levels across the economy and the replacement of that debt by debt-free government-issued money money with a lowering of interest rates lower taxes and inflation at close to zero percent with regard to local authorities Len Brown of the Auckland Council last year challenged councils to find alternative funding solutions at the local government New Zealand conference he said nothing was number 281 one of june two thousand eleven Democrats for Social Credit welcomed that the general concept of a central authority the local government funding authority is what it's been suggested for all local government funding and in fact there is one already in existence the reserve bank of new zealand the treasury in preparing the regulatory impact statement and han a local government borrowing options left out the one option that would achieve far greater economic benefits to local authorities and ratepayers there is no interest reserve bank credit the Reserve Bank acting as that single central authority rather than the funding authority and that would come without the additional bureaucracy a funding authority as in visit would require all responses to our submissions to select council draft plans state that no regional Reserve Bank New Zealand facilities available for local bodies will we find no written evidence that such access has prohibited local government president Lawrence Yul has told local government New Zealand that councils are facing major pressures to fund large-scale infrastructure investments to meet the needs of future generations and sustained economic growth with limited funding requirements will place severe pressure on a pure property tax model and you people know more about that than I would and Mr Ewell says complimentary alternatives are required our focus is on developing a strategy and model as sustainable for New Zealand communities in the long term examples of funding tools that may be required for a preference in a New Zealand context include local income taxes local consumption taxes congestion charges visitor charges and payroll taxes and we would add interest-free reserve bank credit a sovereign government has the power to finance the public sector from its own central bank or Treasury creating for greater savings and producing far more capital assets in times of recession this is a proper counter-cyclical measure beneficial to local authorities communities and the economy as a whole and it is sustainable we urge local count to gang together to insist on this option and in doing so take a much greater step for a sustainable future by breaking the monopoly banks have over our money in closing I wish to just draw your attention to two christchurch press articles that were Trotter creating money out of thin yet time to do it ourselves and that was june five 2012 the second one making money dance to a new tune can work at chalky Tim Hunter business day Wednesday January 23 2013 so a few people are serious about your city your christchurch city communities just as we are then you will look at this option thank you thank you very much there any questions no I think we're all good so thank you very much thank you much appreciated
Um okay so the next submission is the tomorrow part neighbors Robert yeah hello sorry I said I called you Robert because I wasn't I was extremely juga babe just as its ville du Quebec welcome yeah thank you very much and I'd like to thank the council for the time to make this submission I won't go through the submission the writ submission we put in but I have some key points I'd like to emphasize around it okay I'd like to start with something that number of submitters have mentioned this morning which is the recent financial review and the shortfall of 534 million dollars to our way of thinking that reinforces our of submission rather than undermines it it really comes down to a hugely difficult decision for the counselors in terms of priorities and how to cope with that shortfall and what we'd like to see is to make sure that the people that are in pain the most do not bear the brunt of that shortfall so we'd like to ensure that the facilities that are being contemplated life up or try to improve it given that there's a lot of pressure on particularly in the east that those are given priority over some of the bigger ticket items which are would be nice to have if you have lots of money in the cupboard but you know to where we are now somebody mentioned it is a very rainy day now we need to start focusing on how to fix the roof rather than or about you know redoing the bathroom and to that end there's a couple of things that have come through recently that I've noticed that emphasizes some concerns we have about the decisions that are required in in this new clan I have a copy of the Otago Daily Times from last weekend and one of the front page items is about the increase in annual expenditure to maintain the cupboard Stadium the article talks about another 750 750 thousand dollars on to the current annual expenditure which would take it close to 10 million dollars a year annual expenditure now that's a third of the current budget mount of change and I'd like the counselors to try and keep that in mind when they are making decisions about priorities particularly around the covered stadium the metro center and convention centers those are big ticket items that are going to take a lot of money out of the count out of the city and can we please prioritize those down and prioritize people's welfare up in your decision making the other thing that happened that last week is I was in tri in Wellington for work and I went to the Wellington aquatic center that sorry to the Cabernet aquatic center for those of you who don't know about it its a 50 meter pool eight lanes doesn't have too much extra but it has an integrated die well in the same Paul you can sacrament that and I was shocked at how much joy I had just being able to swim in a decent facility something that we don't have anywhere in the East at the moment since the loss of qe2 it was clean it was heavily patronized 8 to 10 people training there were people just exercising and everybody had the room to do what they needed to do and they were able to get to it at it and you know easily without having to traipse halfway across the town through three different contra flows diversions road works and what have you so there is a big need to maintain that in the new in the new plan and to ensure that we get that facility in the Northeast and the final comment I'd say is that it really concerning that there may still be a idea to use that money and use it in multiple facilities now the way we're thinking is that two or three poor you know half half baked ideas will not replace one decent facility that covers a lot of territory and we can spend it all in one place and have a good facility that people can get to from a number of areas so that's really the three points that I'd like to emphasize to support our submission so thank you very much yep our Pauline thank you we the difference between operating a 25 meter pool in a 15 meter pool is the considerable cost France would you settle for 25 meter it what you're talking about is Graham Condon essentially which if anybody goes to ground continent it's just hugely over-subscribed the congestion in that pool is just enormous because you don't have much distance in that port you're constantly turning around it really we would like to see a 50 metre pool or at the very least a 33 metaphor to give us a decent exercise facility so are you saying mean for that 50 metre pulls work better with our greater capacity of Jesus to to access it at cub earney they've got quite wide lanes you can pass you can fit 10 10 to 12 people in that in those lanes and they don't get in each other's way with a small facility you're constantly trying to pass people and grow and condom the lanes are particularly narrow and if you're a little bit faster than that that other swimmer you're basically bumping into which is just ridiculous thank you very I've seen it Tim two quick questions firstly with the Graham Condon center the new facility has put under the years or we nuts put under the years do you think the the result would be least pressure on the ground Condon syndrome therefore it would function better absolutely I know so that 25 then there would bring the question that the 25 meter would work as long as there was less pressure yeah yeah I don't_''_352.849 I believe that what we have is suppressed the band in the in the Northeast in particular there are a lot of people who are just not exercising so what you'll do is you'll take some pressure off Graeme Condon but that has to go somewhere and there will be what's happening now plus all the other people are something out I thank goodness I've got somewhere close well as the second Christians with the Metro sports facility and the blueprint and the central city yeah would you advocate for once it's we've got to a point where proposed to be in there go out to the public for consultation yes I think it would be a bit a good idea but that that seems to be the sort of the longer term option you know it may be the premier facility but we still if you look at the diagram of the google map shot that I put in the submission there's nothing on our side of town it's a long way to any facility on our side of town so the Northeast is particularly Pauly said that even the rest of the yeast is a long way from the council facilities and in between there's a few commercial ones but you know there's a lot of costs that are being imposed on people you know the ability to get your children to a facility easily to get there after school learn to swim is hugely important otherwise we're going to end up with a generation who can't swim within two or three kilometers of a beach thank you David thanks some of the earlier budget allocation spoke of a 25 style all as well in this facility in the northeast what's your opinion on that sort of combination meeting the needs of the community and relieving pressure on other facilities yeah I think that there could be an option I think the way the Cabernet center works there is one main pool and it can be segmented to shorter lines and there's a dive well that one in but in the peak hour in the mornings and the afternoons I think they're open to 50 meters so that you're swimming right across it's wonderful it's got pristine water you swim over the 2 meter area and then you get past to the 30 and four meter area it's just it's a really good facility it's all one big pool with some barriers that they move up and down so you know there may be some creative ways to get the same amount of functionality but 50 meters is really what you need for decent exercise I mean people swim long distances and turning every 25 meters is you're losing a sure your your appetite for a 50 meter pool but I I think the desire for another 50 million the Metro sports 50 meter pool in another ones possibly not this is Clara the cub earney pulse it's truly a pole it's not but I've got all these add-ons it's just opposed it has some add-ons it has some like Kids Place area and it has a gym facility as well but the pool area there's some it's a single large pool eight eight lanes wide lanes full length and I used to live in willington have used it before where you can have aqua jogging in the deep end you can have some other people doing under you know underwater hockey and then you still have a lane facility that may be shorter atlas peak periods but again when they're six o'clock in the morning 630 whatever it was and it was it was well well utilized but it doesn't have say an elite sports facility and say physios and all that kind of thing is just pull it has the full the full list but it's well worth having a look at because it seems like that would serve quite a lot of the the needs in the East good Glenn we've got 43 seconds they do how do you think this will assist in social recovery in the Pegasus Robert and in fact in the city the basic improvement will be the just a therapeutic benefit of a being able to exercise and be able to get there at a reasonable amount of time and the second one is the message it sends to the people in the East that we are investing back in the east and it we're not abandoned if you look at the stuff that's going on with EQC etc there is a sense of abandonment in the east and in the Northeast that anything that's positive in the East will will raise morale and and give people the resilience to keep battling the problems they have to battle yep again perfect timing so thank you very much Robert really good Cheers
Some colleagues are not here this afternoon but will get underway and I think we'll be joined by by some of them as we proceed I'm could I'm vitally in Taylor from the property council zealand to come forward hello hello how are you good thank you is so not too bad so thank you for the opportunity to speak today that my name is a clean Taylor and I'm here representing the coffee Council of New Zealand the property council is a not-for-profit organization which represents the country's commercial industrial retail listed and unlisted property funds property owners managers and investors we have over 600 corporate members in New Zealand which represents billions of dollars invested commercial property that ranges from leading institutional investors listed and unlisted property into these financial organizations to private investors and developers is building owners developers consumers taxpayers and ratepayers property councils members want to live in and work in a vibrant built environment which is economically viable sustainable vibrant in a desirable place to live today I'm going to raise four issues with the annual plan which rates fees and development contributions so if we start with dead just some observations on debt the debt levels are forecast to be over 1.4 2 billion for the 2014-15 period including 575 million new borrowings however I believe that the annual plan doesn't take into consideration the findings of the court meet their report which is cause for concern the high deep means higher interest payments which forecast to be over 59 million for the 14 2014-15 period what this is of concern and a rising interest rate environment in finally the property council supports the council's decision not to take out loans that would be beyond its ability to serve us and repay and hopes the council will continuously explore its funding options cells to reduced in the second issue is rates property council has a keen interest and establishing whether rates are calculated transparency transparently and the reason why particular rates are established we're deem necessary property council advocates for rates to be reallocated or the amounts charged to be reduced we are concerned that the proposed six point five percent increase in rates and will reduce the competitiveness of our region at a time when there are significant challenges and at a time when development and the region should be encouraged rather than having additional barriers that is significant increase in costs imposed also of concern is that further rates increases have been cited as one of the five options to meet the council shortfall of 534 million we encourage council review other options and to cover or we encourage council to review other options to cover the shortfall and look I can't sit here is a property council member and not talk about the rating differentials as the council will be aware the 2007 inquiry into local government rates which was the Shan enquiry sit down a series of recommendations pertaining to local government funding and rating with one of the key recommendation relating to the application of rating differentials the Shand enquiry recommended that rating differentials be removed from the local government act 2002 this was a very salient recommendation which property council supported in 2007 and continues to advocate today property council recommends that that the council illuminant eliminates commercial rate payers are the primary beneficiaries of land transport infrastructure is incorrect secondly it is simply not acceptable to without a proper basis target commercial property owners who are already struggling to trade for profit and to pay a higher rate of contribution than resume to ratepayers the third issue of concern is around the fees I'd like to make a couple of observations on the proposed building alteration repairs a new building fees and charges there is if I bring this table up on the screen monitor to read it but yeah you're a significant increase is proposed and consenting fees unfortunately the percentage increases for the above was shown as a blank in the annual plan report which was uncontested with the thirty odd pages of other other proposed fees see it out in the pen and the plan look I can't really understand why the council would would show protect this particular fee increase percentage as a blank but all I can think is that in some way they're trying to hide the up to ninety two percent fee increase on on plan does not show the true cost of processing consents and other council involvement in the build process the need for clarity and transparency behind these fees and charges is imperative and this needs to be questioned by the councillors the draft annual plan does not provide clarity as to how the new fee structure will work and why it is better than the previous structure and the absence of the simpler mation we cannot support inspection costs being factored into the computation of these fees based on estimates we are concerned about the impact increase fees and charges will have on the development community and on the city's overall growth the charges are particularly worrying that property developers and a building climate that is already overly challenging for all stakeholders again it is I've concerned that these increases are being proposed at a time when stimulus needs to be made available to those heavily involved in the rebuilding and recovery of Christchurch and finally I'd like to raise issues around the development contributions the draft annual plan correctly states the local government act 2002 proposes to bill be enacted public libraries and leisure facilities would no longer be recipients of development contributions council proposes to include development charges for the public libraries and leisure the facilities while it still can and the annual plan well this is on the premise that it's not clear that these charges will this change will proceed or will not proceed now in the interests of best practice appropriation and budgetary allocation would have been expected to be made to account for the situation with a bill is enacted within the lifetime of the new annual plan and in the form where development contributions can no longer be collected for libraries and leisure facilities we would hate for there to be another nasty surprise for the council and hope that this is taken into consideration with the plan and sort of a look in summary it is the property council's view the christchurch city needs to assure they putting in place a policy which will encourage free investment back into the city and the district stimulus which will encourage reinvestment is critical increasing rates increasing consenting fees the lack reinvestment when this is cancer alongside other issues such as consenting delays the lack of transparency certain certainty a momentum around some of the anchor projects the inability to resolve the central city parking issue which will provide certainty for the retail precinct increasing construction costs and a draft district plan which is considered by many well respected independent planners to be the worst to be worse than the old plan and possibly the worst in the country on the cumulative basis that proposed increases in these other issues will be in disincentive for doing business and Christchurch and will have a multiplier effect on raising costs of doing business this is at a time when private investment capital is highly liquid and highly portable meaning it can be in very invested elsewhere however we hope and encourage the new console to take some leadership to take firm leadership and come up with a strategy which will ultimately encourage reinvestment back into the central city and the district the city must remain competitive this council must remove some of these barriers that I've talked about these barriers to reinvestment in the property investment community the Christchurch is open for business thank you thanks very much Jamie I know this you know this isn't even an ideal form to be able to yeah it's sort of like local government speed dating a way that dream but look thanks for the submission I just want to make one comment on particularly around the dc's I thought you know that at our upcoming strategy and planning meeting the next one coming up we've got a report on the formation of a development contributions working party and I've put either a Chairman's recommendation which has five councillors on there and five members of the business community one of which recommended as our representative from the property council fantastic so I'm just keep an eye on that agenda no it takes Jamie that's all right they've got my committees or approve their but um that's the recommendation anyway so we do won't work with you but my question is um you know really articulate submission but do you have it as a property raise the funds that's required to balance the books look Jamie odd I yeah we don't have it we don't have a firm view on that but I would I would expect that any of the non-performing assets assets that aren't providing a dividend above market benchmarks should probably be sold and so I think a review of those sorts of it first I don't generally get a good sale price stuff they don't make me much yeah look I think well what's the point in keeping them life therefore not actually providing return on investment so yeah and the thing is about that I know there's an argument of all should we sell or shouldn't we sell but these assets have been kept pretty much for a rainy day and what we've got now is pretty much the rainiest day the river ever will be and so it's time to sort of probably are free some of those assets up and reducing dear thank you very much on bro sorry that I mean that one is Jamie sees annual planning yes probably not the best one but welcome happy did City motion is valuable constantly want you to follow up on on some of those day increases because we were told that they dope they didn't operate on that if there were an actual charge that they're just the average charges based on the number of inspections peaceful but if these less inspections that will cost this of these more will cost more so anyway okay we'll follow that up great things we thank you just so
And next we have Robin McCarthy think good afternoon Rob and your submission got lost in the system I'm told so the counselors have got it as a separate submission that's been circulated to yet rather than in the folder so apologies for that welcome yep far away Thank You Mia and counselors and yesterday get lost in here that's the way it goes sometimes by the ego think we'll manage that counselors I'm going to offer this council million dollars in savings on the funding currently going to quote if canopy tourism now how can this be achieved it can be achieved quite simply for a tender process I've looked at the funding that's gone to this private company over a long period of time and there's never been a contract between the council and christchurch canobie tourism which is in itself as a private company make no mistake about it that's its legal entity it may have a shareholder trust but anyway I would also contend that there are not abiding by the purposes of that trustee so at council describes as a level of service agreement and when I asked about what that was it was just basically what was written into the draft annual plan and the three-year plan that to me is very unacceptable indeed so anyway one of the issues that we've had with this organisation to is the lack of transparency because it's a private company it hides under this so-called status and they're quite entitled to do so I've asked them many many questions over the years and I haven't had the answers and I think that those answers should be readily available and I'll give you one example there's an entry and what the annual report going back to two thousand eleven of four hundred twelve thousand 671 dollars of our expenses the airport's 284,000 what is it you know they've been a couple of that councillors well under the factor that's a cute council organization which is only just a title that means that the council has the power to appoint a couple of directors to the board why are the a lot of money our expenses but I've got fifty dollars of our expenses in my accounts plan comes on to me and say well what's a lot about so these are the things which I think need to be addressed the one of the big concerns is that the cat that cct has been running what they call a membership scheme now I looked into this as well its predecessor was an incorporated society and the tourism stakeholders were members now if you remember you're entitled to ask anything of the company you set the policy of the society you set the policy and his full transparency now what's what appear has happened is that when it was changed into a private company it just carried on as normal soliciting upfront fees off the tourism stakeholders it's wrong now because I jumped onto it I've now turned it into what they call a business partnership was not a part of Survivor under the partnership Act so what I'm saying is that this whole concept of soliciting upfront fees from tourism stakeholders should can be done by sending a memo from the council as a condition of its funding that that is what they have to do it's actually illegal I'll tell you now it's illegal counselors now the other problem that we've got is they have a differential Commission scheme I got a foreman here I'll show it to you anyway I'm saying today I'll show to where you choose your own commission so this is pitching one Operator against another and a classic example that was this year at a Kuro and the cruise ship was in every single booking in the morning that I was there went to one company where it was a local tour around acura or a local or toward the christchurch or a shuttle operation in tea or shuttle service unto christ church now I can only assume that that company must be paying the twenty percent commission but they won't tell me I've asked for a copy of what entity how much commission are paying how about funding are receiving from cct and I can't I think it has to stop because at the moment I'm not actually represented at cct so every single cell they make to another company is using public funding to compete against me it can't go on it'll end up in the courts councils it's as simple as that so I'm asking for Sri things immediately cinnamon now send a memo to see CT drop the upfront fee requirement nobody minds paying a fee I should add I'll just qualify that if purchasing brochure space for something of that nature on their rules or in their display Rex but when it's attached to this business partnership a membership then that what that affects effectively means that you have to sign a form and then that's a restrictive prate trade practice because you're not even allowed to go and invest in and some are any other visitor center elsewhere in years old well that's illegal too but this is what's going on now I can understand what they don't want this to happen because it's taking away an should be risk within the tourism stakeholders in the industry who not only have their capital at risk but they also have their incomes at risk so that's one thing I'm asking the other memo which should be sent them immediately as a strop this commission differential Commission that's pitching one Operator against another and the other thing that should be put out to competitive tender because I have a company called Christchurch jira tourism limited not that I want to be involved in doing it but anyway if I have two councillors I'll be putting in a tender betwee 1 million dollars less than what does what you're currently paying is organization and it's a big saving thank you thank you as Paul point more commentary rather than actually a question but personal have a concern that cct are taking cruise ships from used to come in to christchurch littleton port now going to quite Cora and considering the funding input from the other unitary patent this is only one percent do you've any comment around rabbit is this the funny that that the various other partners put into the to the hoc city fund and one percent of the entire fund is paid for by the other parts of canterbury christ church is actually funding the majority but and we're seeing the true has been pushed out of out of christchurch into the greater canterbury who only proportionally put a one percent on the fund or you could say that's rather an equitable as well there is another aspect which has come about in the last couple years and that's the mackenzie district councils now two hundred thousand dollars into cct and effectively managing their tourism promotions and so on and so forth but one person there's the seams of the Rosary amount of money when you consider against what this council hears fun cct I trust that might it's just it was country and any other questions oh well thank you very much for your time thank you much appreciated
To invite Antony goth from the Central City Business Association I have to say that the color of your suit has has sparked off an imaginative set of thinking around the table about what you would be presenting us with today we're doing green we all wanted it we all lost the beer and I have to say that Shawn also what about but but it is spectacular is always so thank you it's wonderful to see you loved it thank you very much and thank you for giving me the time to briefly talk to you I'm talking on behalf the Center City Business Association which it's not only the retailer's it's actually the Business Association a lot of the council's here won't be aware of exactly what it does say there was a little brief history and I'm not gonna read it just be that submit what are we doing well with it with the organization I don't get paid this about 10 of us on the committee the only person ever gets paid in the CPC Business of our councils here councillor monster which is fantastic he knows the inside workings but it is critical that we have a voice that works with the council mother dates the council you'll notice we never criticize the council and it's a deliberate act on our part we have a grumble do it behind closed doors and if you don't have the business community working with council we will never get the center city going it will take so much longer there's an organization that's running there you don't have to do anything to keep it going in a way you'd normally have to but what you have done is you have been funniness we were looking to do a target or a tener horrible thing called the earthquake at us and so that no longer was appropriate as no business is running there so we do need this ongoing support from council we used to get 150,000 from council it's been reduced to a hundred my notes say hey we can live with that and you know my fingers Thank You that I made at the end of my submission was really quite simple it said we're in unchartered waters the CB need CBD needs real help to re-establish itself every year that passes without a trading CBD allows more urban sprawl and means or take longer to get our CBD stronger day please do not take your eyes off the ball we are counting on a forward to your visionary new council the sea CBA is an organization that can help we've the community fabric of CBD occupants during the building of a new city we are the Central City Business Association in the building a network of businesses as a distinct from a network of buildings there's most important in terms of attraction and retention of occupants the CBD can provide this business community in a collective voice in the matters and our Constitution has this allows us to address it now there are couple of other things I wanted to talk about one was car party which I'm sure everyone's gets pre-decided that but the counselors to wouldn't if you had a if you said to Northlands hey sorry folks you know you care about Santa to mention you don't need to tap act now and pay for these you still got your shops the autumns would die overnight we mustn't forget that it could also died overnight if we didn't provide a topic I know you're working really hard on it and don't give us a gold-plated job I just patch the old one folks would be my comic it's a lot cheaper to patch that then you might imagine and I'm happy I your are aware that I have got a funder behind me not me and I'm the mayor and others are aware heard as a substantial person who is interested in car parking a serial part he'll pay for fixing your Litchfield street car part run up for you and take the revenue to pay it off council-owned it they'll bring okay be it on or even got to be something you'd a lot hard it and it means you you're not even definitely your pockets me keep its what I believe it's a totally transparent operation the tram absolutely passionate about the tram I was offered a tram drivers uniform today but I turned it down we're very pleased we are pleased to hear it so I rather sell the tremor look the time we've with you know you can't cry city has put a huge amount of money into the there's only 50 meters trap that's my laid for the finger where is the two loops for goodness sake we didn't put the power lines above don't worry about there but beyond litchfield street we can go up there to put of set of points bring it back round the back of the cathedral we must get the tram go every better promotion you ever see oversees the tram sets it up and we should be de latching on to that we should make use of it and we've got a train company here who I don't think make me money others damn thing but they're passionate about wanting to run up hey board and for a very small amount of investment we can get it going that you've done the points on the corner of Litchfield old total Worcester in Oxford terrace they are in place the tram lines are down Thank You mr. government they're going to redo the bit of tram lines along the Oxford terrace I don't know why I want to straighten it but hey it's their money so that's good and you don't actually our money wells butting daska literally takes pay a price I cherish it I'm very conscious that councils finances are stretched as anyone and Christchurch is on the rebuild and I believe that that's a critical thing that I to ask you readers that and allocate some money so we can get that trim up and running and I'm gonna finish the essay you've got sometimes ask me some questions you were like I've worked with except it's not starting with but you pour your vested interest there I just thought that your comment about the the concept of a targeted Business Improvement Districts birds then I is and what what that enables is a community or a community of businesses to come together and to provide the the kind of amenity that there that suits their own neighborhood and but they pay for it themselves and that the council assists that through collecting that targeted rate but it basically goes to the local business association in conjunction with the local community in order to either provide you know beautification or to provide additional maintenance or to provide extra security or whatever but actually when one is chosen of the beautification as chosen the chances are they need least security if it's an ironic thing but one thing supports another outcome but are you interested in pursuing that concept of Business Improvement Districts yes we are you'll notice my submission talks about us wanted to pursue the targeted rate we were well down there track at the time of the earth greats we actually had got all the property owners cause you'd need to you need to get the property owners over the line first and make you are there but at the moment the property owners aren't collecting any money so if we wait for a vote would get a resounding no so it's not the right time now but we're progressing back into that we have got that group that we're working with and is a thing called the retail focus group that has been initiated by the central city development unit and we're working closely with that and the chairman of that happens to be Richard appellate riches from Ballantine's so yes we see of targeted rate as the only way and but we need this interim to Aoife Chancellor support so we don't get the single City Business Association dying there's a void there and nothing happens that will just put City backwards yep no great and Paul I just wanted to thank Anthony because you may not aware that Anthony's been the head of the Business Association as chairman foot for eight years he's donated this time in as effort and his passion and as color as we see here today outstanding sued're done and your positivity towards the city center thank you very much David yes I too would like to thank you anthony for your enthusiasm and beauty ism and getting the city up and running again and it's more of a statement I hope your project starts up again very soon it will the world Thank You Ellie I just had a question it's in great suit and nice shirts to about your association working with the bars around town do you have representatives on later they countered as a business and your group yes we do we've actually got pride West and it's one of the 10 of the executive and he's on the little group that represents the center city we've also got a hotel yer on that on board that's Tim from the Ibis so we've been quite strategic although technically we're men to have all these people voted on I'd have to sound slightly naughty I'd wrote shoulder tapping and say why don't you put your name forward I'm sure you could've got on the team and it's got a broad section where you've got person from c1 cafe he's able to write to see in high street we've got Shawn Stockman from Litchfield straight whose property in person so the very strategic years I agree bars a credible and probably on the largest person internal both size and and Barbara she said Jimmy chin fishing hello please confirm with us we got into the restart the heart of the trust because we start probably paid to two years ago was born auto from central city pistol Association just for temporary the purpose for vitalized central hall central city but we know from our long from now on still remain this truster or combined with the original Central City Business Association is we work very closely with them but they are separate entity we I see those but to close that to sort of push that just people might say I had a vested interest would be totally true and so that does operate you'll see from my notes that I've given you my submission so it didn't give lift very much to pay his main salary in fact it didn't give enough but we've made savings in other years so yes we do support them it is not there for the long run the least that they're about to move into is a 12-month only it so it will run out in May 2015 there's a possibility it might be extended but as soon as his replacement retail available shops we see it as shutting down thank you very much I'm sure I express the views of everyone here that we hope that your development is underway again soon and we're really looking forward to seeing that become part of the jewel in the crown about our city center so thank you very much what
I'm going to challenged in terms of pronunciation as it yo curve bends darbar and yeah welcome thank you and so there's um yeah just a brief brief few words from outside the city I live in puro just past diamondharbour and enjoy walking running and I'm very fortunate to absorb the the beautiful scenery their honor on a regular basis by profession armor physiotherapist and are working mental health so I'm dealing with physical aspects of mental illness and just wearing my physio and head I just like to emphasis and the important of facilities and infrastructure for people to walk in a beautiful environment there is a clear link between physical activity and health physical health and mental health and it's a well reported by the World Health Organization walking is free healthy family friendly enjoyable and for a lot of people there's a few that I don't like it but and I would just like to really let plan for the head-to-head walkway would greatly improve the walking options that would be enabled people to enjoy the beautiful scenery of at the moment there is a lot of anxious people in Christchurch and and it's also you know Mike group that ideal where through work they're often the people that haven't got a lot of money and I think it would really be beneficial to a lot of people it would not cost a lot you know if you go to swimming pools really wonderful go swimming but you still have to buy a ticket if you go walking you can do it anytime anywhere but if it's beautiful it's safe yeah I would really promote that it would also attract visitors through the small communities around the harbor the coffee shops maybe some some backpackers or transport for the to get there the ferry so also that aspect from a local community I thought it was a very positive plan so I acknowledge that money is tight but in my opinion of walkway is more urgent to then the cabin Stadium as we heard before and the Flower Show maybe two so yeah I'm very worried to put that on the back burner really encouraged to get it here as soon as possible thank you we've had many impatient please on the head Tegan walkway which I think is great because it's good to see the community all coming together to support a particular project I don't know Andrew did you want to yeah thank you very much indeed for coming along and as the mayor said you're one of a number of people who made really positive comments about the walkway which is which is excellent you've talked about you know the economic benefits and the the recreational benefits and so on for people from the city coming out to the harbor and walking around and for visitors do you think that this is something that local people would would really benefit from as well I mean not necessarily walking the whole thing from head to head but you know do you think there are particular sections of track that would be well used by local people if so you might want to point out which those well I think that all I don't I don some of the existing tracks are being linked and so I would I would think that even if you don't walk the whole lot you would pick a stretch on a sunday afternoon and and another week you might pick another another bit and like for instance that the can be road is now you have to walk on the dust road hopefully it can get away from the dust and there and there are parts it that you can't walk now because it's there's only a road like parts of chargers Bay you know it would be so nice if that would be linked closer to to the water I don't know exactly where the dotted line is but I know this pads where you can walk because the traffic is always roaring past you so it would be really wonderful to to be able to do in a safe way it's very good look thank you very much for your time is that's great oh thank you I'm barry clark
Um Janet big Tracy Hopsin is giving everybody that's sure absolutely yes settle down and make yourself at home there's a buck I'm so short I've understand up oh you can't hear no that's perfectly fine but make will make sure that your microphones on this is said is good and I want to say special thanks to Tracy Hobson who's been so very kind to be entered Sean who's picked me up off the floor at least once today thank you we're very well saved here Thank You Tracy okay I'm Janet bead and this is my support Miri brunsdon I'm not asking for more money first I'm asking for last year's allocation for urgent removal of silver birch trees along the north boundary acidnam cemetery in summerfield to be reinstated and for the rest of the silver birch trees to be removed this winter secondly I'm offering to pay for the immediate removal of the enormous self-signed silver birch growing out of a grave directly behind by home now with my bus ticket in the christchurch public transport buses christchurch city castle has enough enormous problems without the headache of sharing responsibility for our bus system we had a very workable system with the christchurch transport or until nineteen eighty nine but since 1989 with Michael basics experiment in abolishing boards our people don't really know who takes responsibility for many bus things such as non-existent bus shelters and other infrastructure I've been making some missions to Christchurch City Council and to Environment Canterbury since 1999 about our buses and our lack of bus shelters a mouth christchurch city council could graciously hand over its part of the bus system to the main party the Canterbury Regional Council will be can which runs the metro system very efficiently or if City Council can't agree to that hand over then we need to create a christchurch transport board to run the whole bus system to quote counseling Jamie goes personally I'm more interested in Council not being the be-all and end-all of everything and actually enable the people who want to do this to be able to get on with it current council responsibilities beyond housing for example bus infrastructure and it's already happened at Auckland and I understand that this very week Dunedin is looking at making it happen thank you madam mayor and councillors I wish you well thank you very much who would like to turn questioning I think forwards do I thank you did it just I guess around the silver birch trees and I know you've worked very hard to have those removed and I'm not suggesting so that you follow Jamie's philosophy and there's a silly cut them down yourself you shouldn't have to do there and but I you'll be aware that the community board passed a resolution asked them to be removed at my understanding janet is that because of recent storms the resources were put it in another place but I think through the community board that your request should be followed up I know its long-standing yeah that's probably the main I just really wanted to give you the coming thank you very much patient I temple Tim um your genitals just follow that because you have been waiting a long time and you although we want to save money you shouldn't have to pay for the removal of it itself because it those trees have been identified for removal for a bit variety of reasons so thank you for thank you may I reply to that of course you may thank you it's just that the the bureaucrats say that oh not that self-same tree that's not part of it we're not going to do that until we do the landscape plan well I couldn't listen times mean the landscape plan is going to heaven there will be another few years as well yep Phil and I will get onto that with the board and through the board and so just rest assure that we will get on to it because we know that you have been waiting some time and you've done it very professionally so thank you I love you all David David do you want to ruin it for everyone oh I got to make an observation that I'd happily ended everything the infrastructure across as well at mobys do yes I'm sick of it over here yeah I mean that the people who pay at the end of the day are the same but side that comes out of he can rate or out of council rates but I think that your message which is a clever a joined up approach a single entity would be the way to go and I do agree with you on that yeah thank you wanting to say that I agreed that it should be a kid night also see do not agree ok I do understand your your concern about about the work but it's actually the separation that creates additional work so I don't see why I agree it either which way you look at it it doesn't make good sense to all lovely thing thank you very much
The federated Farmers of New Zealand and I recognize Nick clerk here come on up how are you Nick I'm full of things thanks Leah you're welcome but I think I've seen you in my current role no no no I'm the seen you on the airplane as well I don't miss anyone yeah I did I just don't miss going to Wellington yeah that was a horrible day yesterday also serves definitely dreadful right yeah well far away thank you thank you as as the mere said my name is nick clark I'm policy manager of federated Farmers based in the Federation's Christ your choppers I'm also Christchurch City resident and a ratepayer here in Christchurch albeit I'm not a rural ratepayer which is what I be mainly speaking about today I'm presenting on behalf of North can't_''_54.39 be federated farmers and I assume that the submissions being being read I won't recite it I note that our submission was made prior to the court of meat the report so that sort of overwhelmed I think were made in the submission let me start by saying that federated Farmers North Canterbury really appreciates the relationship heads with the council and the work the council does in the rural parts of the city particularly on banks peninsula I'd also have to say that the Federation supports strongly the efforts of the City Council to rebuild and recover from the earthquakes it's a situation that's unprecedented and hugely complex not to mention very costly it's been a match said in the last couple of weeks about 534 million dollar funding gap which looks like it's going to get even bigger if the insurance issues are resolved I think it's fair to say that we would agree with the range of options that have been put forward by quarter mean fur and I know you'll be going through a very major process to respond to those issues we believe the council needs to pursue a mixture of these options and dear I say it that has to include consideration of sales of some of the substantial investment sits and also very importantly council does retain perform better and provide better investment returns and sort of the three to four percent that appear to be the case at the moment tuning to rates we know that the average rates increase will be around 6.5 percent but the impact of revaluations and the increase in the rural differential means that the actual rates increases faced by individual rate payers will vary considerably with regard to the rural differential we increase back 2.75 after it was reduced 2.67 last year as understood and we do accept it this acceptance is on the basis of assurance has given us given to us by council staff that there has been an easing and the earlier fluctuations of the general rate due to large variations and maintenance costs particularly for sewage and that those fluctuations in our back to us of a more normal situation the increased differential and this makes things a little bit easier to stomach I shouldn't result in large rates increases for farmers on banks peninsula due to the evaluations generally going down since 2007 however the increase in the differential will be northern fringes of the city which have had increases in their rating valuations and some of them quite steep increases the point we're making is that even when the averages don't look too bad they can masts and big impacts at the individual level and perhaps recognizing this we know the council has what looks like anyway a helpful remissions policy where rates can be remitted where it is just and equitable to do so and North canopy federated farmers as you'll see an hour submission has suggested the council should look into whether it should make available its remissions policy for ratepayers particularly badly affected by this one-off event and maybe sets and thresholds and policies as to how it could work we also believe that fluctuating rates can be smooth a little by greater use of uniform property charges and we note that over the past decade the you a GC has been steadily diminishing as abortion of the total rates to just over five percent in 2014-15 finally and although not referred to our submission we're very supportive local government New Zealand's has long push for reform to local government funding to reduce what we see as an overreliance on property value rates which are in our view anyway kaic funding till the modern local government we hope that council will be engaging in this project as we believe it could help the council in the medium to longer term anyway our knowledge and appreciated tweaking the rating system and big picture long-term reform of local government funding are probably the last things on your minds at the moment as you tackle with the 534 million-dollar hole but we do put these suggestions forward as what we would hope I seen as constructive solutions to problems of individual ratepayers may be facing thanks very much and happy to take some questions thank you questions no gosh no oh wow so but I did and what was I going to ask you something that you've raised yep our poor name you mentioned think you selling off pips some assets so to do have any idea which ones you would recommend or which ones you would not recommend well I don't have you've got to sell this so you've got to sell that but I guess you need to look at those assets which held for particular purposes and whether they're meeting those purposes it does seem a little bit odd that you have about eight 1.8 billion dollars in investment assets and it would appear they only return about three to four percent and that's I believe that those sort of rates return or not unusual they've been they've been in previous to the earthquake they weren't returning a lot and I guess one would have to wonder whether if the rep of the return on those invests and those investments can't_''_398.71 be lifted then maybe that should be considered that sometimes assets could be could be sort of I mean there's also not necessarily saying he sell the Holy assets off it could be that you know perhaps a minority stake of some of those large companies for example the airport or the or the Orion or the port company could be could be diversity okay I'm Andrew and one the lead for roading improvements to stay my way 75 between little river and a Corolla can you expand just a little bit more on what you feel needs to be done what should we be focusing on there in our dealings with NZTA yes thank you for the question mr Turner the feedback I got from members on the peninsula was quite a lot of concern about the the suitability of the road for some of the heavy traffic that has been using it particularly with the crew that have been now calling into the anecca right for example of the buses but also the truck movements issues around some of the tight corners and the narrow road and overhanging vegetation on that on that road and certainly we're very keen for the council and would be very happy to join in that and discussing with NCTA what sort of options there are available to improve that road I know it's very windy hilly Steve Rose not an easy road to improve but some of those sharp corners and the lack of space for vehicles to get investigate those sorts of things it's good no well thank you very much for your time good to see you thank you thank you very much
Next we have Andrew tuck today and thanks I'll check in its peak periods the internet is a dangerous place because that we as the morning as they're looking at dangerous sites I was looking the crisis of the council site made my submission and took that little box which said appear so goes to prove it there's as the insights had dodgy sites to go to I'm becoming a grumpy old man I know that I believe that the rate increases are becoming too high I would not be here today if we had a rate increase between one and three percent I totally accept that that's what inflation is and that's what we should be going up by no problems at all the last few years there's been a regular large increase in their rates I'm prepared to admit before the committee today that I'm average kiwi I've got an average income I've probably got more than 2.5 kids I had three children and whole and since the quakes my expenses have doubled and any increase in been sucked up with increase in mortgage and other expenses the Chrysler the council I know the previous person made submission said you'll she loves you all the Chrysler counts and away is actually sad to feed my family stunned affect our ability to meet our basic needs of food and clothing and it's just something which I'm afraid I had to preach you today my income is not increasing to meet the costs of living in christchurch the increase in travel costs the insurance school costs like another colleague back here we no longer have a school pool so we have to travel elsewhere and pay additional funding to against women is increase in Paris we have no longer have a fireplace and when we had a rebuild we weren't allowed put a fireplace into the house and we're able to access free file would submit that's now to increase for our family plus there's the council to concentrate and core business only like my family can no longer afford luxuries and in the current climate I don't and we're roading court infrastructure maintenance I don't require any summer times activities buskers festivals flower shows top-ups I really love rugby really low rate be just a love going to lengths to park Jade study but we can't afford to go to his matches so having a sixty forty five thousand seat stadium 41 of Tears watch year don't need it we've been along to take a kid to 42 the current stadium for 22 back so get to take myself and one of my children it's good good time don't anything else so what I just ask is that you concentrate on the core expenses at the moment when my kids come to town they see wonderment they see potential I to see destruction they see opportunity I just hope that we both can all live and staying crisis and enjoy it thanks for the opportunity or mean we're not to take that box again well now I hope that you do take the box and keep ticking the box because if we don't hear that boys from you know 945 it _''_227.81 but if we don't hear that voice then we're not we're not doing our job so you make our job actually easier to do by coming and speaking so thank you very much that was heartfelt any arguing is thanks very much for that obviously if we're looking at this big financial gap that you've been reflecting a potential strain that could be put on one base which is the payer base could I ask your view if we change the base to a taxpayer base what you're responsible be to that there's a way of meeting that my best friend who was my best man he works for the equivalent Wellington became and we had a discussion at two o'clock after a few beverages and offices sold the world problems and he was so the same thing is that may be that the garage he is that local government can't actually afford to cover all the infrastructure and we may have to look to the taxpayer well overall tax payers maybe cover some of the infrastructure costs which we have your pipes for your search will remove the roading outside the road how would you feel about that to the increase so the hobo problem with paying towards as core aspects the other social aspect which or another council is very nice and soft reattach of touch and I do pressure what are you doing but I don't need and I can look at my family at Christmas and holidays and and providing the entertainment and over and over time but you know I can do that I just need you to do the call but such as that I can't attach to yep oh that's a very good message for us to hear thank you very much and I really appreciate you tipping the box thank you thank you
And now the last one before lunch is the enviro schools foundation Kristin price and the team from Kashmir hi I don't know if they're all coming up to go on come on all come and sit at the table 2 meters ill counselors so I'm yum Kristin price on the operations manager for the enviros Schools Foundation and I'm joined today I'm speaking on behalf of Kashmir high school and sustainability council and by Sam Sam and rest so I'm going to go first and then Santa's going to kind of follow along so let me thank you so in virus schools is a nationwide program and it sort of has a different flavor in different parts of the country so partly here to talk to the submission and give you a bit more background as well so in virus was Canterbury's got its own logo and it's sort of own identity in this region as well so the enviros poor's program it's a nationwide network of schools and an increasing number of early childhood centers and it it works and the sort of benefits that it brings about so these would be the program originally was developed by local government it came out of a partnership between hamilton sit accounts or in the waikato regional council so it's specifically designed to make sort of community outcomes that the council's have so looking at you know the sort of outcomes that you have as a council around community and environment in particular so it's about resilient more connected sustainable communities and engaging young people in an active way and creating there and because we're working with children young people we're working with the schooling sector where you know these guys spend a lot of the time it works really well educationally so it's sort of something that schools find works very well with the new zealand curriculum which means that they want to be involved which is great so we've got good involvement from them and it's got it's got a huge range of benefits which include and things around young people feeling like they can make a difference of well-being and connection to the community as well as practical environmental changes and things that happened so very holistic and its reach and on page 3 of our submission we talk more about the range of benefits from the program every enviros school is supported in a range of ways so each enviro school works with a facilitator so we train these people nationally and then that employed locally and so schools or centers on the program have got the guidance of a facilitator working alongside them it's a little bit different to some of the programs that work in schools often that's sort of someone coming in and taking a class so the teacher steps back and someone comes in and takes a group of students our facilitators work by with school staff to embed the program and enter the way that the school operates so they're not actually teaching directly to students they it's more of a train-the-trainer type approach where they are then building capacity within the school for those teachers to then integrate the program and until the learning that happens of things we have a range of resources that schools have that are useful for teachers and we have a lot of emphasis on events that bring people together both students themselves and teachers and in this case is an example a Christchurch example of a workshop for property managers so will the property managers from the local and virus schools get together and that they're learning things that are going to be helpful in terms of virile and supporting and virus skills and their school the programmers of framework and we use an action learning cycle which is about looking at how things are currently you know what can be different taking some action and reflecting on their action and this is important because it means that the program can look different in every school and each in each community so that the students themselves and the members of the community can choose the issues that they want to take action on and that can also be influenced by the priorities of the funding organizations as well in terms of what's relevant in the local and the can work really well with para games that are more based on particular issues so what we find and bigger organizations such as yourselves you know you do have environmental education programs that are based around specific things that our military was a council for example solid waste so what we find is that the two things and other organizations work really well together because in virus schools can provide an overall framework and a culture of change in the school and then you can slot those more issues specific programs into that and I often use the metaphor of planting a veggie garden you're the implanting your sort of particular vegetable seedlings of your issue specific program and to really fertile ground rather than just popping it and something that with an so what hasn't been prepared in it may or may not take root so that might be a way of thinking about their how it works so I work for the enviros schools foundation where the national organization that support the program we can partner up with another organization to more ito and we have given the holistic range of product of the benefits the ministry for the environment and in terms of the government are the most sort of appropriate funder for us each region here we work alone Regional Council boundaries being kind of a local government partnership organization so regional coordinators in each of the 16 regions generally a Regional Council employee there's around about 100 people who facilitate the program and they're mostly employed or funded through councils and increasingly we've got a new arrangement with kindergarten associations and that's supporting 770 schools thirty percent of New Zealand schools and three percent of the very large early childhood sector so we're just getting a toehold in their enormous sector at the moment but they're great fun to be working with so how does it look in Canterbury so in Canterbury there as a governance group at the moment that has representatives from the Regional Council doc in the waimakariri and Selwyn District Council's previously had our representative from Christchurch study but it's not the case at the moment there's a regional coordinator so on page 2 of our submission the sort of words that this picture relates to so the regional coordinators role is about sort of a direction and over support for the program in the region and then the facilitators are funded through territorial Authority contributions as well as some sort of overall support from the Regional Council and then those facilitators are then working with schools in the different areas and in Christchurch there and there's Christchurch schools that are involved represent forty percent of the whole region's and virus schools so you know the city is quite in terms of the regional layout of the program you know the city is you know really significant and lash so that's sort of a bit of overall background I've just gone through that quickly stood over where of time I mean really what our submission is asking is that we want to have some partnership discussions with the city and particularly peps across your portfolio managers about the city's role in enviros schools because it's change over the first eight years up until 2011 time the number of schools involved grew and then there's been some changes with the city is and some ways sticked back and we've now got a relationship through your strengthening communities fund and that's it it's not the full partnership model its meaning that we're not getting the benefits for the city that we could from an investment and it's also creating a lot of uncertainty as its usual year funding so it's not actually a for us a viable long-term way of working so we're wanting to sort of flag that formally to you and ask if we can have some discussions to clarify does the city want to be actively involved in the enviros Schools program and how might that look for the city or does the city formally want to step back in which case we've got a big change management process to work through with the 30-odd enviros schools that that are involved at the moment because the ability to be involved is contingent on the city wanting to be involved so we would want to sort of the thrust of our submission I'd like to hand over to Sam now though to talk about his particular experiences and I I just flagged that this project that Sam the team have been involved with has been a national pilot that's been off radio in Christchurch through the Christchurch agency for energy and its head funding from acre and the Ministry of Education property Department so that's a national pilot that we've been running here in terms of energy conservation and efficiency and seems going to tell you about all the great things that they've been doing thanks Kristen my name is Sam and rest and I'm the student chair of the sustainability council at Kashmere high school and I'm just going to speak like Kristen said about how in virals has benefited my school and what it has done for me so kashmir officially became an enviro school this year but as Kristen mentioned we've been involved with the enviro school run project eco driver for two years now so eco driver is a project that allows us and to sort of form and analyze the data and form strategies and plans on how we can reduce that electricity usage and how we can save money by reducing the electricity so through that we the sustainability council has been able to run a number of different things we did the switch it off campaign last year at Kashmir which was to encourage students and staff to like a behavior change in terms of switching off light switches computers and projectors and that was really successful we saved eight percent of our electricity bill just with that and our electricity bill on average is about two hundred thousand dollars a year so that was really successful we were also able to install two LCD screens and our hallways to get students looking at the data that we're getting from eco driver in term and and getting them to think about how they can reduce like how much electricity they're using and get actively involved in that process and then this year we were able to install LED lights in all of our classrooms which alone has contributed year compared to term one last year so across the whole project our savings is just surpassed thirty five thousand dollars which is really really fantastic results and this is thanks to envira schools project also thanks to envira schools we have been able to begin a stream restoration project on the Y makiki stream that runs through our school it looks pretty horrible at the moment so we want to make that a beautiful and healthy asset to the school and we've just gone forward with some testing on what what is in the stream the water clarity pH levels that kind of thing so on a personal level in virus schools has given me a great deal of opportunities thanks to my long-term work with eco driver at Kashmir I was afforded the leadership opportunity to become the student chair of the sustainability council this year and through this I've been able to sit on the squatter school student council and I was also able to speak at the first-ever festival of education here in Christchurch on the subject of sustainability and education these opportunities have developing leadership skills and then lastly in virus schools has afforded me the opportunity to speak to you city council in support of their organization and I can say that I fully endorse their submission so that they can continue to provide young people and schools alike in Christchurch the opportunities that they've given me in my school thanks it's brilliant I'm Tim and info so I take it this is the same program that was a Kish me primary school which Edith so it was then I have said kerry primary school want a green gold award by the way just the other councillors know one thing that you didn't mean to reserve the further education of ignorant parents by the educated and constant nagging from the children and I'd certainly changed my behavior I have to say and it is constant I see me apologize to that I think I get a lot of parents telling me how they're not allowed to use plastic wrap anymore because of the children constantly point out and then you cannot wrap my sandwiches well if a lot yeah my questions are noticed in here Environment Canterbury and one of the supporting emissions mechanisms their uses and kind they're an opportunity for this council to do that rather than just financial don't know that note here that seems a just a quick notes I've read it was financial from Council sales just absolutely so great question because if you look at the sort of picture at the moment you know we've got three facilitators and you know Council such as so my Mac annuity and all the district councils are putting money into a central pot that's managed by the Regional Council that employs those people but you know another way of doing it and would be there in kind you know like a staff members part of staff members role could be to support the enviros Schools program yeah you know so that's something that for example dunedin city council does that you know they have they have someone on staff that has a wider education role looking at you know waste and other aspects of of council I their job so definitely that's the sort of thing I guess over this next year that we would like to engage with the city about in terms of does it look like a financial contribution as it auto staff time does it look like other types of contribution yep and efl when name clean I've got two questions one for Kristen and one for Sam it because just asking you for a start like Melanie Coco who's a community board member who made a presentation before she another board member are running our whole program about how we clean up the heath get it's got stream you get river including the location area part of that so I'm just wondering if and you refer to the number of schools are involved in program I'm just wondering would this be an opportunity for say the community board in your sales and various schools to engage a wider group of schools to press run a similar alongside the one that Melanie is precise Emma especially for young people is that would that be a possibility yeah a possibility and that's why having the Council partners really actively involved you know sort of in terms of the city you know and put on the governance group it's a staff member really involved in the facility means that you can make the most of those opportunities because you would know the local and bios schools that are involved you have a connection within you'd see that opportunity with this project that's being initiated by the community board and then you could join the dots together so that's exactly the sort of thing we like to see happening so through the community board especially that's a way of working and appreciate the same as say with the worm okie stream near that neither school or the other parts of the Kashmir stream do you already given the work that students have already done are on the stream and it's great you are looking at and testing it and that kind of thing but I'm just wondering and its early stages in terms of the work you're doing I know there you have already that you could just tell us briefly to protect the biodiversity via at the same time improve the stream flow because we have the dual problem of flooding but we want to keep our by to keep their rivers clean well I think in terms of like one thing that we looked at that that in virals could definitely help with is they have a lot of funding for native plants and things like that and I and so I think that it sort of improves the sort of health of the stream I guess and that so that's really one thing that in by our schools could really help us with I think it was close to like a thousand dollars worth of funding that they could give us for just like planting stuff but I and I'm we were going to talk to niwe shortly about how what the sort of flood plans are and stuff like we're investigating that shortly and I know that the what kind of sort of vegetation you have along the stream kind of impacts on the in but yeah yes so we we definitely have an issue with that on the strike there's quite a lot of sort of vegetation that could cause that problem and that's kind of what we want to do to clean it up we want to make it look a lot nicer and get the stream a lot healthier so that it doesn't look horrible because it has a really negative sort of image in our school and that's kind of part of of what we're looking to do by cleaning oh right thank you very much n clean last question thank you thank you and it'd be great if we could continue to end if you are you happy you know to continue to develop that relationship like that I know in the past you've received a lot of financial support from the council though that has decreased over time and now we have a very difficult financial situation so yeah you don't look it yeah I think you know we appreciate that there's been during the time that things have there's been some mind-bogglingly significant issues that you've been been great playing with so really what we want to do now that that to some extent a settle down I appreciate there's an enormous and work program ahead of you about we're out of that sort of initial crisis time where it wasn't appropriate to be trying to engage with it it's how do we move forward we're really now wanting to re-engage and that's on you know behalf of us as the enviros schools foundation and all the current governance group to re-engage with the city and say what's the best way to move forward given given where you are now and so that we can be really clear for the 30 schools that are involved and there's you know another 40 city schools that are you know clamoring to be involved in this program on a waiting list we want to be really clear to them what support is available to them so and what we would like to do is allow some time to have those conversations now but kind of well over x yeah yeah thank you very much for your submission and much appreciated thank you thank you I'm sure counselors if you want to check appreciate you need to have your life we go we're going to a june four
Residents association David Hawk was it yeah welcome thank you okay well thank you very much for the opportunity to present this submission we really do appreciate that if it taken by council to listen to the views of our community and the wider community as well so I'm putting forward the submission we're very much aware of the council's precarious financial situation but we think a good place to start in these circumstances is a quota came across the other day from a recent publication on Smart Growth from the American city and county Management Association and it goes along the lines successful communities have one thing in common a vision of where they want to go and what things they value in their community and their vet and sorry and their plans for development reflect these values also Residents Association believes emphatically in the role of strong local communities in the health and happiness of a city so our submission focuses on areas in the draft annual plan relating to strengthening communities that we think need revisiting in this submission this oral presentation I'm for young people and the pushing out of the timetable for cycleway completion we are obviously enough focusing on also but we suspect that many other rapidly growing areas around christchurch will present similar stories to ours would go to the youth facilities first as we stayed in our written submission we brought this issue to the attention of council in 2007 which is seven years ago it does seem a bit tedious and tiresome but we seem to need to remind council that horse wall is growing rapidly someone said to the size of gisburn in a few years so provision for youth and horse all and other suburban areas across christchurch is pretty complete lieber small especially when you compare it with other towns big and small around the can't_''_131.099 as we point out in our written submission the money to progress the youth facility and horse all keeps falling off the list that the area was unfledged so he was flagged and funded in the three year plan but this has now entirely dropped off and we think that funding for the youth facility needs to see problems prevented and now as a community we are having to deal with at a local level among with community volunteers with a growth and petty vandalism that one gets with bored youth in your community we also see too many older teenagers moving out of christchurch to more supportive cities for their tertiary study and this is a direct economic cost to the city the second issue we want to bring to your attention that this in this opportunity is the pushing out of the cycleway project in particular their 209 thousand dollars originally set aside for the whole sort of city cycle way the first thing we want to say is that there is an alleged capacity issue in managing the rollout of these psycho ways but in our view this capacity issue is actually illusory council can contract the workout and we think that in this way the city will also get the benefit of international expertise that resides in these consultancies in fact having such consultancies work alongside council staff would be a very good way of building council capacity secondly we want to focus Hall sorta city transport developments as we understand it this is part of joint work with NZTA so four-laning of highway 75 public transport infrastructure improvements and the cycleway to us are all part of the single part of a single picture you can't pick and choose especially given council stated desire to decrease private car modal share NZTA from our information shares this view so if you end up delaying this part of the work the cycleway part of the work to us you actually run the risk of nzta spending their money somewhere else there are plenty of local authorities with their hands out for NZTA money and then what happens then is that NZTA blames Christchurch City Council for the congestion that results thirdly council has just approved an affordable housing exemplar at meadowlands Andrey as an association we really support that development as well as affordable housing meadowlands look to take seriously the needs of pedestrians cyclists and public transport users but it's an island and it's an island of accessibility that's going to be seriously hobbled if people can't get this issue around horse all existing subdivisions at country palms and halsall West are prime examples we think that one of the great things about a people-friendly city will be the elimination of the need to own a car if council could make it so that families could cut their car without sacrificing their children safety that would be a huge weight of the family budget we also think that if you leave that cycle way to later after Meadowlands is complete you're going to end up with grief around land acquisition and potentially car parking as well interestingly as an association we ran a community survey last year forty-one_''_352.1 percent of respondents thought cycleways the most important transport infrastructure improvement for sought for all saw and this was easily the top ranked response so if council values community as we do we think that you should make the changes to the draft annual plan that we propose thank you very much thank you very much I'll fill thank you for coming in telling us your views and one thing in terms of engagement with resonance groups like be talking to all of the community boards and it'd be good if you're your associate your residents crew to hear that presentation yep because what you're really saying too is that within the current and within the current major cycleways routes there's the route but a long fried safe from hose well on all the road suture lincoln road is not included is it where you look pretty say it's not well what we understand is that the route from hallsville which wouldn't necessarily run along forceful road the last iteration we saw us that it was actually running along spax road but the route doesn't matter our understanding is that the funding that was set aside to progress that cycle way has dropped off the from the from the spending over the next 12 months that's our understand the getting school here and in welcome to come to the presentation we also during these hearings have received submission from nzta itself which highlighted the absence of our having applied for funding under their cycleway program so they did under kate there might be I mean my understanding is is that the delay wasn't occasioned by funding it was occasioned by capacity but it may be that additional funding from an external source may be enable us to increase capacity so you know I don't think that the she's closed year Jimmy based on the facility for the young people teenager whole square area you mentioned earlier regarding to the you know the summer facility had been unfounded in this new year proper play he'll come from with us weather is escape or Pat it has to be more than a skateboard park I think that one of the things we're in a survey it with forceful school students this is way back in 2007 and at the time we also engaged with the recreation planners at City Council and one of the things that the city planners brought through which was really important I thought was that you have to do more than just do you know better concrete and few jumps and that sort of thing it has to be a complete facility that girls and a range of age groups and so I think we have to think a bit more deeply than just calling it a skateboard park and so I think calling it a youth facility and compasses those both of those SBS Pauline sorry I depletion on page four of your submission about the NTTA upgrade of the currents road Dunbar's intersection has that been done or is that waiting for council to do our bit first oh my understanding that's waiting for you guys rashi hi um I'll just you're supporting the integrated way councils approaching sport which includes laughing sorry that so far as I understand it it's the Dunbar's rider cool it's road as an NZT a responsibility because that's highway 75 but it has to us it has to be done as part of an integrated whole so obviously you don't control in CTF spending but there is as I understand it well and truly up on the on the list authority as ETA so you think they may be waiting for us to do a bit I see these sorts of things is that the two organizations you know talk to each other and coordinate things and we're just spectators in there in part of the plane have you seen it it says he sink leads off road cycle was that's my understanding and also doing a bus priority lane as part of that process as well so is we're sort of saying in our submission is that this is all part of an integrated whole and so you know including off a site off-road cycleways is really important part of it excellent thank you very much it's great thank you very much for your time a much appreciated and it's great to see an active and involved community ocean so thank you okay thank you
Next the next we'd like to invite friends of the christchurch botanic garden Allan Morgan to come forward yes sir good morning I'm Charles Graham I'm the president of the Prince of the botanic gardens and this is Allan Morgan please feel free to sit down or stand if you wish that's fine by either way the Friends of Botanic Gardens exist to support the botanic gardens in any way possible by providing funds for major projects while we consider major education supporting for various events supporting various events in the botanic gardens and the like I'd like to at this stage really say how much we appreciate the new visitors center that is great the first public building in Christchurch and and there are a lot of positive comments regarding it at this stage I'm going to hand over to Allan Morgan we've just formed a trust which we hope will raise a lot more money that to fund various projects in the Botanic Gardens and part of our submission is a plea to you to hold on to certain projects so put you over to him now Thank You Charles Charles went on holiday to Australia and said that we're going to get these submissions and so how about doing it for us so there we go that's why I'm here I'm also the past president of the incoming president as well so we bit short on the ground as any other volunteers around basically it's it's just to reinforce without reading a submission and to keep hold of the visions that simmer we've got the the big project we've got it in place and it's fantastic but downstream for Methos a few other projects that follow on from that example we now have an empty cafe which is still need to be fixed to earthquake wise but that's hopefully be turned into we're going to call the botanical discovery center primarily for school groups and would it be open all the time so this is giving a boost to our educational capacity the project that the trust which has been waiting in the wings for some time to we thought well it's inappropriate to launch it when the needs of the city wasn't so great on the earthquake so it's been lurking there for a while and but we were about to kick it off and but we we need to have projects either the trustees that we've got lined up become there when we when they say what do you need the money for we've got something specific the first one of the projects we've mentioned which are all in the master plan was the gondwana garden which was started you know in a way by the planning of the world of my time really last year that's going to be ongoing but it's going to need some funding and some interpretation to tell the story of gondwana in the story of the evolution of our floor and our country ism and the coupled with that there is also in the wings a children's garden which would be in the educational facility that will fit on the other side of the playground so when the kids come to play they might have a learning opportunity as well so that's the thrust of it's just a matter of we want to keep the visions alive we haven't sold new buildings at the end of the day there's a lot more that can follow on from that so it ultimately a new conservative complex that will really be able to tell the story of all the other difficult environments that we have for growing even plants of our own region like it's very difficult to grow plants from alpine regions in the Norwest prone environment of of Christ you achievement that's only you know 60 miles away and there's all sorts of other environments like sub-antarctic islands that have a very unique worldwide unique in a world sense of of a floor that is quite peculiar to that that area so that's the message that we want to put across as that you know don't lose hold of the of the items that are in the the master plan that will probably be rolled home for the next master plan as they not to ask for more money from the council we won't to turn it down but that the trust world really go out and seek funding and from other sources to to help with some of these other projects I think you're invited leading questions Thank You Owen well I'll just start off and to say what a fabulous day it was the opening worth having the the prince and the Duchess there even though he did catch me out whether with a bit of a joke I don't know if you heard what he did but when when they cut the garland which was tremendous you know instead of a Reuben they came inside and and pulled back the the little you know cover over the over the plaque which I said would be you know sort of putting the building at some appropriate place at a future time to show that they'd opened it and we the three of us stood back and admired her and he said there's a spelling mistake and all of the blood drained out of my face it was my experience of the day well probably of the year actually probably of my entire team is madness yani um thank you and thank you for the worthy if you're doing I'm just interested in the there's an old house I think on record and a four-wicket of Maeve that's kind of related to the garden as I understand it next to the hospital do you have you guys looked at possible opportunities in that space I'm sorry I didn't quite I got to hear I'm that work there's a delay as I understand there's an old residential property that's kind of it next to the hospital and we had a deputation the other day about chippenham logically relocating there possibly but just really interested in you know have you ever looked at any opportunities with that space 22 I guess enhance some of the projects you're talking about all looking at other opportunities are we looking at for rigaton Avenue young next year currently we have the phone we have to provocation groups we make use plants where we we well prior to the new visitors saying that we had a small trolley outside the old information center and we have to plant sales a year and from those two propagation groups from that nursery we got most of our phones for the projects in the gardens and the hoping that will continue from the new visitors center so yes we make use of some of the land one stage Jeremy suggested that we could possibly make use of the building but we'd have to maintain it and that was a no-no for us because we didn't want our phones go into maintaining a building rather than putting money into the gardens at the moment I don't quite know where we're going to meet at the moment but we have guides volunteer guides as well and they make one of the rugby club rooms in hagley park and we're hoping that we can share the old visitors center so we're in sort of semi negotiation as far as that's concerned and either that or we're hoping to use so we are we are scrapped a room ready as well as volunteers concerned and we'd like to make use of a building such as that number number four but it does need a lot of repair a lot of work and we're not into that the average age of the volunteer in the propagation group saying I guess the guides would be somewhere between 70 and 75 so they're not della climbing ladders with a paintbrush and and that sort of thing I don't think the guide themselves have got a particular plan for that area at Sydney nothing's in the in the mouth in the master plan for that I just thought things like having maybe young people as a scholarship studying botanical sciences yeah having a place to live like a botanist and resident so he wouldn't get the world of fitness yeah it has been used they're putting in parenthesis or people from working from overseas in there up until a couple of years ago I think that it's getting pretty dilapidated now it's used much for with you you points about the children's garden and especially like where you say and I agree with you actually that the current the current structures they're not within the usual scope of botanical gardens with a flow onto a connecting learning space would it would enhance people children's experience and I'm just thinking about ways that we cannot as account can support their to happen it's a very popular place as you know as a grandparent I love going there with my green grandchildren and they love it too but that like it an example of something creative the other day was that there was a program from the visitor center where the kids took a bang out with them and they they win exploring and picked up all the leaves they could fly in and berries if they had to try and find that kind of flow on a few so I'm just wondering if there might be to some children's groups and more parents groups who might link with you given that as your volunteers are older people and there you in the trust to achieve it there is a plan to employer education officer who would be based at the gardens but also probably doing you know botanical education citywide but the garden itself is to kind of models that you can either have something like they've got in Melbourne which actually has two professional staffers there and that's very hands-on there's another model we have more static stuff a bit like science alive where you you have all sorts of educational fixtures that kids can get involved with and it sort of scales down humping and garden and Los Angeles has one of their so there's there's a lot of models around but it all depends on the staffing and the and how much you know how much staffing is required and almost I think it it in Melbourne a place is only open when there's really the staff there so we haven't quite figured yet exactly where that could sit but the ongoing cost of obviously having to staff available is something considerable but I think there's also a along the way it's lovely thank you very much for making a submission again also thank you for what you do don't appreciated by the whole city do what
Yvonne Curtis hope you're not going to see in it's perfectly fine right um I'm Yvonne Phyllis and I'm here to make a submission on the proposed increase and animal control fees and it does follow on from the people before me but in a slightly different way so I'm against increasing the animal control fees because it's unfair to registered dog owners there's a better way to increase revenue if cats were registered then their registration fees would contribute to the Animal Control budget we could see registered dog owners as a minority of animal owners presently discriminated against as well as being more fear there are other benefits to registering cats and protecting our bird life is one of them there's two really important facts to keep in mind 37 out of 51 living species of birds in New Zealand are in the threatened category that is threatened with extinction they don't exist anywhere else and secondly New Zealand has the highest per capita cat ownership in the world research has been undertaken in both New Zealand and the all kill birds and at higher numbers than previously thought people make assumptions based on antidotal evidence so they say my cat is too well fed and too lazy to go check birds so how do we evaluate these studies one of the really significant things to me when I was read was how consistent they were consistent across studies consistent again about small studies and large studies and consistent across countries actually so registering domestic cats may also provide a partial solution to the stray and feral cat problem right now nothing seems to work neither extermination nor the capture neuter and release called TNA on which are rspca and use are working the problem is but people continue to dump cats and if you don't believe me talk to anybody who lives on the edge of town so if you are old enough like me to remember what it was like before dogs were registered then you'll remember the number of dogs just wandering around they were in rubbish bins no one know who knew who they belong to much like cats today now after some in a company unaccompanied dog people stop and look so the numbers of strays are much less and this brought the problem stray dogs is never mentioned so if every cat was a wanted cat then the number of strays and feral cats would decline and we make we may make headway against the feral cat problem I know that registering cats can seem like a really unnatural thing to do and it did to me too when I first heard about it and then I discovered that numbers of Australian states have restrictions on pets as well as many European cities the problem is being researched in the United States and all of these places have birds that developed with mammal predators and don't have the really special boobs that we have so in conclusion I do not think that the animal control fee should be increased because I think there are fairer more beneficial ways to generate income registering cats would make every cat a wanted cat thank you very much thank you Tim I think we've only got time for one fishing I'm just that will reduce it clean the birds because earth a cat has a letter of kittens and the kittens are dumped it's not the registered parent kit that is so you've still got the issue of kittens done the other thing is that is natural for birds to coquettes to kill birds I'm just kind of thinking because registering a dog which is obviously also unnatural you can put on a fence section and they can't go anywhere whereas a kitchen ok there's two answers first the argument of saying that if a cat has a click but a letter and people jump them that would be the same with dogs and that's not what's happened that probably happened initially but over time that stopped happening that people actually only had cats and got the new tree and they use the same thing with four dogs that it's cheaper it to register your your cat if it's neutered and so that that kind of works that way the second thing is that there are there are other ways like keeping cats big difference but secondly keeping cats in at night wearing a bill all those things make a significant difference you know they don't stop it but they make a difference yeah and the and I guess the first thing is to me is to have them registered so that people actually pay attention to the cat that they don't live out in colonies or people have 20 cats when they can't look after them that kind of thing thank you very much I look forward to researching that one thank you um
Thinking for agreeing to come forward it will give us a bit more of a break between submissions so much better challenge as well so as you know my name is Melanie cocoa and I'm a member of our spray tan heathcote community board thank you for the opportunity to talk before the council to give my personal opinion regarding the closing times of the South Pendleton and upper riccarton libraries currently the South library is open till 7pm and the Pendleton and upper riccarton libraries are open till 8pm and the annual plan proposes changing this to 6pm with one late evening put library now I believe that library hours should not be reduced at all as a benefit of evening library hours to the residence of Christchurch outweighs the financial cost I understand that the council is under great financial pressure however council services and facilities for residents should not be compromised now at first like to draw your attention to the Christchurch City Libraries document which was written post-earthquake so as you see on the slide and in the handout this was called the mapping measuring libraries post-earthquake so this shows that access to resources help provided by staff literacy and learning mental well-being place of belonging I'm a welcoming space and business in career development the people can use computers to you know if they don't have them at home to apply for jobs and write CBS is absolutely important to people using the library how do I change it so libraries contribute to direct economic benefit in lead to a prosperous city through successful resume in people so this slide film was in that document there so obviously libraries are very very important and the economic value of crush at city libraries has been valued at for basically five dollars every one dollar invested in library so they're very economically important so after work yesterday I went to the apparition of benetton libraries to take some photos for this presentation so um this was after I finished work there are only a selection of photos of people I felt a bit dodgy taking photos of people I didn't know I'm so I was a bit distance away but there 715 an operatin library there's a number of men li using the computers one of them on the right-hand side is an older fellow and these people are in the back there as well a lady working on a computer there was another guy to I don't take a photo of cuz he thought I looked a bit suspect it was all so basically the car park was more than half full there was about 15 people in the library on this floor meeting rooms here they were booked three of them were booked and they were full they had more than 30 people in them ethnic groups I'm study groups and yes there were some other people and there as well a range of people probably between five and sixty years old this is 715 at night fenders and library are we near straight after seven-thirty there's a range of people their use in the computers from the guy in the back is hard to see but he has Down syndrome and I do see him there quite frequently I was mall to me in old lady and it looks like a grandson knee is in the computers is showing here what he's doing people working on computers Wi-Fi studying there were other people reading browsing kids older people it was relatively busy I thought compared to during the day in the car park was more than half all there was probably around 25 people with a range of ages doing a range of things he's in the library at close to closing time so overall it was my personal view that question should be forward thinking City mindful of the needs of its residents and quarter this as the maintenance of services and facilities following the earthquakes it was significant lack of access to libraries and large areas of the city and all library lose users were affected by some degree let this council not to be the start of a decline and service hours to Christchurch residents my concern is that a reduction in library hours will become the norm and never be reinstated do we want to be a city of the future or one of past with a six should actually be open later I'm a particular personally and central library as people have been basically shunted out of the ER at 6pm in resonance of all agencies their libraries but access for those who work nine to five you know as limited they have to come and start after week that if half an hour maybe or the weekend Saturday to come to use library otherwise it's not an option for them and librarians I've talked to at libraries believe library out should remain as they are they believe libraries are primarily a community service and that is my presentation Sam Thank You Melanie yeah puts a shine people at computers etc what could they do that at home because they may not have not everybody has computers at home they can't afford computers I had to get my parents in my laptop my old laptop at all thanks Melli I just wanted to if you could perhaps tell us well and it probably as main question South library the frequency of use of the small meeting rooms at the community use and just yet the costs a of hell council would provide access if community groups weren't able to use those meeting rooms do you know no I don't know it's something we could you would reach for I mean I mentioned of libraries are closing any other librarians would be to be there after hours anyway to open and closed rooms so as will have the library open during that time right the other thing was going to ask you in its pretty camp as a pity counsel mentioned here to ask me hear me ask this but if in fact we decide look we do have to reduce the ears in terms of costs which is what your preference would be that they'll be open in the evenings and other submitters of see look saturday mornings are a popular time I'm just wondering about some morning closures so for example if were some mornings during the week so the library's open a bit later say 10 or 1030 and would that be workable from the from the way you see library users there are more people do stand there waiting the summit road society thought they opened at team our one and ask for access and some people don't think they have until 10am anyway so I think it as a possibility I think just having it open in the evenings where people can have access otherwise you know they wouldn't with the Pioneer I know they're closing you know half an hour potentially 15 minutes I decide it could maybe reduce about half an hour would be acceptable but you know there's clearly people using these libraries after hours yeah that's great thank you very much that's great thanks so um
The volunteer in Canterbury Ruth Gardner the morning and welcome Kyoto koto and thank you very much for the opportunity to come and talk to you all and volunteering Canterbury is of course delighted that this strengthening communities fund will be maintained at the seven point eight nine million although like Rex we'd love to see it increased we're really aware from the not-for-profit organizations that we work with that there is a tremendously increased demand for services and it just funding is absolutely crucial we're also seeing amongst organizations a lot of turnover in the paid personnel and I think that all adds to the stress in the organizations and so having the council funding just helps so much thank you but I'm here mainly to request that you consider changing your policy where you don't allow people to apply for funding for money for travel for volunteers to get to their place of voluntary work at volunteering Canterbury we have a policy that no volunteer should be out of pocket from doing their voluntary work and we also encourage all our members to means that there's even less discretionary funding around discretionary income around then there was and for many people the cost of getting to voluntary work is a barrier to them doing any voluntary work and it's really disappointing that a council policy may be increasing that barrier volunteers we find increasingly choosing a role where they know that the cost of getting to their place a voluntary work will be reimbursed many of them don't claim for that but some absolutely need to or they wouldn't be able to volunteer I spoke to somebody recently who said she would have to resign her voluntary role unless she would have the cost of travel to get there reimbursed some of them come by bus and I know there are places where there has to be cash petty cash available to reimburse them so they can get a bus home or top up their bus card it's really absolutely crucial for so many volunteers and of course many volunteers volunteer because they want social contact that's quite a high motivation for a lot of them and particularly those who've had to move and leave the communities that they were in a few years ago talking to volunteer coordinators many of them tell me that volunteers who didn't use to claim for this only now have to and that's a lot of the long-term volunteers people who hold the organizational knowledge and who are vital because they have the training Citizens Advice talked about how it can take two years sometimes for a volunteer to be able to do the job fully and so some of those people are really needed it's really great for an organization if there's a specific fund and budget for the cost of this reimbursement because some volunteers perhaps you've been out and rattled a bucket on a street appeal don't want to see that money going to the cost of their of their own transport but if they know that there's a specific fund for it they'll feel much more comfortable in claiming for that reimbursement so I'm asking that you reconsider that policy and remember that allowing people to it have increased participation in their community and that we reduce the barriers to that participation and change in that policy would help to do that volunteering can't_''_232.519 be very much appreciates the relationship that we have with council we work with a number of council programs where volunteers are involved you may be aware that next month fifteen twenty first of June is National Volunteer Week and we're having a big celebrating volunteering day on the 18th of June here in the Civic offices down in the foyer in the function room and we hope to see you many of you there coming along we have a great program of people to speak about volunteering including our very own mayor and so anything at all that can do to help organizations or volunteers please send them our way thank you well I really appreciate your submission because I didn't know that we had this policy until I read it so it was a bit of a surprise well I've been asking this of all of the groups that have come along about the possibility of partnerships would be red bus and possibly one of the other institutions or a keen and another possibility around partnership would be with one of the fuel companies maybe zeid or something like that would be willing to go fifty-fifty you know so what if we could stump up with X amount for a year then maybe they would they would match it you know or something like that because what we're looking for our ways their ways of collaboration that that yes they reduce the cost to the ratepayer but they actually substantially increase that sense of ownership across the community thank you for your suggestion we are actually working with seed energy and some other areas so I might well ask them excellent so yeah but we'll have to address the policy side of it is that exam thank you our Phil thanks for coming and talking with us Ruth I understand that overall in Christ huge post-earthquake there's been a drop and the number of volunteers so that's wrong I'm wondering would this be like a hand up to two so that they you say there's been a drop in volunteers I don't think anybody really knows there's certainly been a huge increase in informal volunteering as you'll be aware but perhaps less of formal volunteering because people's lives are so uncertain they don't want to commit themselves to anything that might be long-term and involve perhaps a period of training like the CA they offer and yes it's short-term volunteering that people are looking for and our challenges to encourage the member organizations to provide those short-term kinds of roles any other questions right thank you very much okay very good submission Melanie coca
We have the bricks come son well when I corner ortutay tena koutou katoa my name is Rick's Gibson and riding shotgun here is Winkie chin wink he is here because we work together a lot he's a long term contributed to the Christchurch multicultural council formerly the ethnic council he's also a trustee at the Christ huge migrant center I'm here and as a person who wants to make a submission in relation to with the strengthening communities grant sits in the council's priorities I'm here because I am the tongue of the fennema co-chair of one voice the real guitar he that's an umbrella organization that represents the interests of 130 plus NGO and community groups I'm here as a member of the co who had come out to a coruna coat he ought to tahi or Kai Tahu trust I'm also here is the trustee of the Russian New Zealand Business Council Charitable Trust which probably doesn't seem to fit here but it's actually a group that assists a particular sector of migrants as the also refugee Charitable Trust and my main occupation is it manager of the Christchurch migrant center I'm also a company director in a couple of areas but that's not relevant to this my comments on the funding review pertain to a couple of proposals firstly that the council will hold the strength and communities fund at last year's level this year and secondly that they decrease the amount in the future they're both illogical propositions in my view and I hope to explain why I think that the deputy mayor recently told us that the housing forum that the city had lost eleven thousand households eleven thousand houses with her word households is my that's 11,000 people that's perhaps a population of tomorrow that have moved 11 thousand households have moved in the city that's here the two-fold effect for community groups the areas where the households have come from have lost a mixture of their contributors and their recipients of the community activities and services in many cases complete reorganization of these activities and services is needed in those areas the second effect f Decatur for major increases in numbers and usually major changes in emphasis although some of those 11,000 householders left the city we're also experiencing an influx of migrant workers from across New Zealand in overseas these people have short-term and medium-term needs and both social integration in their personal well-being that add to the pressure of those groups that are supported by the CCC's strengthen communities grant that's the NGOs and the community groups that increase in migrant workers is dramatically affected the work at the Christchurch migrants enter the recent opening of the Philippine community support service was a great thing it was a great partnership between community and the sentiment was made possible partly by Allah trees grant and partly by the CCC strengthen community grabs supporting the migrant centres contribution to that effort it's a good model the downside is of course migrant workers are hard to attract funding to support and it relies and incredibly on voluntary labor although they are sick they're here in significant numbers of Filipinos are not the only migrant trades people here I think you workers here from Ireland England Asia South America quite a entry single group from there in Europe particularly Eastern Europe they all struggle with our bureaucracies our bureaucratic systems are unique and of course even confusing for most New Zealanders for this reason social services that are funded and supported by this grab act as interpreters of our bureaucracies for much of their time and that quite successful illness they're also vital and building links with these migrants and channeling lamento sporting and cultural organizations as well as they're what we call settlement support needs the need for services to stabilize and integrate relocated individuals in number two to provide settlement assistance for new migrants in number three to boost the general feelings of well-being in the communities that make up the city will not decrease over the next four or five years they will increase that the speed of their rebuild is still not at the top point it's still picking up the challenge for the city is to publicly recognize that growing need the extra demands outlined just before will significantly impact on the city a place to come and work on the rebuild that reputation is already on shaky grounds with recent issues relating to the exploitation of migrant workers and believe me from my position I can tell you only a fraction of them ever reach the newspapers there's the housing difficulties is the insurance difficulties that reputation is primarily the consent of the council all the other parties seem to find convenient reasons to duck for cover when our city's reputation as a host venue is under attack you've got community groups out there that do their best to support their reputation the council has the opportunity to raise the status of the work in strengthening its communities the communities for location and the communities of interest the council can designate community rebuilding is one of its anchor projects you can actually get up and say that that this is an anchor project of the city is to rebuild our communities my personal view is that would require some backup as rhetoric in action are going to be bold here and suggest an allocation of 10 million would be million sounds much better than 9.5 or whatever the fact that's an increase should signal your concern about portraying the city is a welcoming place to move to work to invest in the summer is realistic for an anchor project if you look at it overall it's only a single digit percentage of what any of the other anchor projects are costing and you don't seem to have an anchor project that's based around people perhaps I'm missing something would cater for all the increased needs I've outlined as well as being a bold statement of our commitment to rebuild the social cultural and sporting infrastructures of the people of Christchurch City now you can fire bullets at me don't bullets are respectful questions so thank you very much Riggs and I really like love actually the idea of an Inca project for people that you've suggested one of our earlier submitters asked us a bit about the possibility of restoring community support funding to its original evil going back I think of several years as you may know we previously the that something that you would support to debt we that perhaps this council work towards doing me well I've thrown up a figure but it is only a figure that I've thrown up but I think that the real thing is to recognize that this needs going to increase so that in fact there has to be a plan to increase over the next three or four years the amount you've got the experts to do the sums might think it was just when I plucked out of the air because I think it sounds good but I really would like to see you actually have a plan to recognize that these needs are going to increase their for the funding needs to increase clean thank you thanks Reese meaty could you tell us the some of the issues of relation to housing for a lot of refugee and migrant families right well the current issue the current issues are no different than than most people and I think we don't go to want to get too hung up on the needs for Refugees the number of what it was in September 2010 but there had been no new koi quota refugees arrived there's only been a handful of family in a reunification but I think that for migrants the issues are exactly the same but they are made a little bit worse by the fact that my grits are even less aware of her appt bureaucracies work and they're not necessarily council bureaucracy I'm talking about in QC I'm talking about insurance companies I'm talking about building contracts and arrangements etc oh that our libraries are we found that are a good front door well migrant people's to hear sexiest thing so maybe we can work on this yes I the libraries are and one of the things we actually running from the migrant center is programs to give people orientation into the libraries know that your libraries are a great resource and certainly for migrants excellent thank you very much thank you both for for coming and um we look forward to reviewing their to last but I'm here only to support Rex yeah cuz I've 45 years I've been in crutches for five years and further for the last 30 years I've been championing to these are the committee ethnic communities so I've been actively involved as how r x could be in the as a trustee Decius it's good and also very very precious long-standing council employee okay most welcome let's go thank you alright thanks
Now I'd like to invite Citizens Advice Bureau Rachel Owen and Rachel and someone now Molly hellas Molly hi most welcome I'm the chair of the Citizens Advice Bureau board here in Christchurch area and molly is our manager who is also think on the horse in case you've got questions I can't answer so Citizens Advice Bureau provides a free impartial and confidential service that answers any query with either information advice or referral we see our generalist service as complementing the new integrated Council library and service centres placement a cab and libraries stop smiling at everybody placement 11 libraries as common and other centres across New Zealand and our current placements in findell turn and beckenham are working really well for us and also for the libraries whilst phone calls account for most of our client contacts we see a need and a great value to everybody and expanding our face-to-face availability across the city our board is currently seeking approval from our volunteer members for a reorganization that will enable cab to provide a greater number of weekly agencies spread across the also already work with other groups to host clerks to provide access to services such as justice of the peace and free legal advice services that could help bring people into libraries as well as just providing access out into the community our submission on the annual plan is to request that we be considered for inclusion and the design of the rebuild of libraries specifically the Lynwood hornby and central city library and supercenters as anchor tenants we could coordinate the community spaces as well as provide additional to bring more people into the library seaters any questions sounds very good to me but I'm sure that they'll I mean that year it sounds like a great idea jimmy van khloe you're the precipitation requests the council provider the city lingu and also home p am I right combined with the Nuala maybe library recovery center but I remember in those you have the bishop they are complicit so you still have and they want or not we had to move our bishop tell branch into findell term library oh yes even though I shipped out of education language school in bishop Dale although at the moment it looks like bishop dermal is emptying out it's becoming a bit of a backwater and given that they are extending their reach into lincoln university it would probably be more applicable for us to piggyback with him into the lincoln campus it's the big choke point for us as volunteers molly is our only full-time paid staff member and despite the professional level of training we provide people it takes a good couple of years before they can handle anything that comes in on the phones yeah Phil thank you for coming and talking with us and other number of client contacts you hear is huge and you've got a great group of volunteers I just want do you still have a clinic at crush itself library yes we do on an epic and I'm honor thursday I live in 22 I think the clinics are great because it with your organization maybe that's a way of having fix ability to so we just want to say we certainly appreciate it thank you work that you're doing um obviously we have a number of community groups that have a real problem post-earthquake with community space and affordability of community space so would you be open to sharing but if we and I think the idea of having community corners and libraries or service centers or both is a really good one would you be open to sharing that space with others like tenants protection the Community Law Center completely we already have relationships within our consume mainly is making sure that the spaces meet our national standards as members of cabins Eiland we need to meet requirements around accessibility confidentiality for clients which involves things like a private breakout space we cover queries anything from how to cook a chicken or how to stretch your wall sweeter too I've had an interview where a couple have come in and spoken about historical insists disclosed by daughter and that's not a conversation you can have it a reception desk no honestly but as long as we can still meet our requirements we would love to be able to empower other agencies about coming into this building or inland would are you in the MSD building that's there because I thought originally that was supposed to be open for wii is actually explored the MSD site but the way it's actually structured it's it's kind of people are coming in for appointments in the orientation of the front reception room is where clients are facing away from the desk and also we want to be available to everyone not just in SD clients so our service is available to anyone in the community and the location of us at the lynnwood library is about being accessible to the whole community not just a small segment impartiality is very important our national body actually shot down the MSD building because there was a centralized reception and people were being filtered before they reach such as advice and being available to everybody is very important to us we would simply um the open transferring it oh yes most definitely very good oh look thank you very much for your submission it's and thank you for the work that you that thousands of Christchurch reason its citizens wouldn't be able to get through some of the issues they face without your support so it's very much appreciated thank you for your time thank you
Dame agri Paisley and Bill bayfield in most welcome thank you mere then and counselors we are here today to indicate our appreciation of the excellent working relationship that you have established with he can and do indicate our support to you and your task ahead and to assure you that we're available to assist you in any way that we can just a few points that I'd like to pick from our submission we commend the council for their contribution to the implementation of the land use recovery plan and natural environment recovery program and we request that these two key projects related to earthquake recovery are identified within the council's annual plan with an appropriate level of service statements targets and expenditure we support the work that you're doing to an undertaker you're undertaking to avoid legacy issues relating to rebuild waste and demolition storage across the city we support what you're doing in providing to the community and maintaining operations and consent conditions for key infrastructure specifically in relation to air quality we appreciate the challenges and reaffirm our commitment to related matters and we are working with your staff to develop a shared services model for have contaminated sites information and providing technical expertise on resource consents in terms of water we think that Christchurch City Council for its ongoing governance and leadership role and support and the Canterbury water management strategy and in particular we recognize the significant support for the Christchurch west milton banks peninsula and Selwyn mejoras own committees many aspects of the drought christchurch city council 2014-15 annual plan will contribute to the CW in this vision and we particularly make the difference in the participation in those committees since the new council has been in place and we appreciate them we acknowledge the significant challenges facing the management of stormwater and we'll continue to collaborate on shared issues with the council in the storm water implementation management group the group will respond to the recommendation from the from the christchurch with milton's own committee that asks our two councils to jointly investigate options to implement a collaborative community that approach to improving stormwater management this work will concentrate on managing stormwater inputs and require community action and while we are committed to responding to the zone committee we acknowledge that there are urgent stormwater matters related to earthquake recovery and emergency management and that these will be that there will be a budget priority for you just to finish on public transport we recognize that we need to work better with the council on transport matters to encourage more people to use active and public transport Environment Canterbury is implementing the final stage of the new network of metro bus services known as hubs and spokes to ensure the success of this network and to encourage patronage growth we need the support of the council to deliver improve passenger facilities at key destination and destinations and priority measures on congested routes in particular we encourage the council to ensure there are sufficient funding and two in the 2014-15 budget to deliver improved passenger facilities and riccarton and priority measures to provide reliable bus travel times between riccarton and the central city in time for the new services commencing at the end of 2014 we commend the council for recognizing the impact that public network and we note some issues with the level of service for congestion and suggest that this could be renamed reliability and be changed to a basic speed target which is simpler for the general public to understand and is easily measured using the existing real-time information analysis the amended target could clearly state the desired average bus travel speed at peak and off-peak times and which parts of the network this will apply to and can take into account any similar targets for other vehicles an environment canterbury start will be happy to work with council start to develop these targets further we support the inclusion of a level of service for the number quality and safety of bus shelters as these are also an important part of the passenger experience the associated targets refer to bus stops rather than bus shelters so we suggest that the councillor means these to provide clarification and make them consistent the other matters we appreciate the positive partnership that we have with you particularly in relation to biodiversity and pest management in relation to Christchurch City Council's packs Environment Canterbury supports area and in particular support that proposed biodiversity protection which you outline on page 63 so thank you very much for hearing us you worship and we're happy to answer any questions thank you I'm I'll just pick up on starting with the puppet passenger transport but I but I won't steal anything from Phil but a number of people had submitted here all really about some of the changes to the bus routes and raised concerns about accessibility particularly and some of our more challenged areas like South brought getting from South Shore through to new bright and you know and I guess that I've got a desire to see an interchange there at some point that will enable probably a smaller commuter service to run up and down and bring people to that Center on on that sort of not so much hub and spokes but a just a you know is straight a straight run down with a smaller bus which would feed into the major bus services that terminate at New Brighton but in briquette and obviously as something that's that we need to need to address that but we also received a number of other submissions around around the the capacity of rhythm road in terms of the bus services and so it's been quite an interesting conversation and I just I wonder whether it would be a good idea if we as a whole council sat down and looked at the entire bus network with Environment Canterbury with commissioners end staff so that we could actually feedin the combined intelligence of our two organizations to get a better understanding of how the whole thing operates because the sense that we're getting from people was that they don't feel that it's joined up and the comments that were made recently about exploring rail was music to the ears of everyone around this table and certainly to the to the wider public as well but they get confused about who's responsible for what so would that be a useful thing to do yes well and commissioners asked it was last week that we try and arrange a meeting and I think that Robin pay has councils together a number of issue so we welcome that the other thing is that we hear our submissions next Monday and Tuesday and we also have submissions on public transport so be very good if we could get together quite soon and just bring all the issues together and have a general discussion on the future might be very happy about that excellent our Phil well thank you very much for your summation especially about how we continue to work together collaboratively I just wanted around the area of bus and think of you the specific point about that we need bus shelters amazing besides bus stops just wondering if you've got any specific suggestions about of the way that we put those in for example whether we have some private partnerships as well yeah I don't have any specific ideas but we are certainly willing to explore every avenue we can to get the best best result that we we can we sit we're certainly very keen to have bus shelters wherever we can in this climate that we live in I think in pretty wanted to explore the topic of contaminated sites and you know we as a city or suppose have have gone through a fair amount of trauma in some areas with the implications of land zonings and now certainly we a bit of contaminated sites put on top of it and it's causing a wee bit of angst in some some areas of their community I'm interested to know really whether the analysis of contaminated sites has been based on site sampling or identification of former usage of some of the some of this land I probably use an example in the North new brighton area where we supposedly have a few contaminated sites and the only thing that I could possibly put it down to was the fact that some of this land and a former time was a poultry farm so David I'm kind of going to interrupt because I'm agreed that this is an important topic but Akina here submitting on our annual plane rather than us we should hang them about the announcement on the house I can tell you the answer your letter it is prior goose so it's not saying that the land is contaminated it's saying that a prior use could indicate that it might be so there has to be testing done and certain activities will trigger the testing requirement which would be the movement of soil or or you know major you know x2x excavation works or things like that I take your point but it has sort of probably I think there's a little more angst it has raised anxiety yeah we have sort of discuss it wasn't a team to thank area to give it dealt with but but perhaps the this is a topic that we could deal with on another occasion I just you know that it can have come here to make submissions on our plane I mean it might be helpful if there is anything that you could well I could just say you worship that this was we saw this as trying to be helpful yeah for people who were already restoring land they just had that bit of additional knowledge so the different this is a leading the judge because of the earthquake come you know that fact that people are restoring land and sand really need as much information as they can oh yeah so because this is a process that's happening all year the country and we're happy this could be an issue that if we meet on the applet transport we also talked about this yeah it certainly Christchurch City a staff had worked very closely with our people yeah I'm aware of that I think that I personally had been hoping that they could have been sort of more of a joined up approach around around some of the testing because that there will be people with a sense of disquiet now and it's on top of everything else you know my lens tc3 my lens flooding my lens now potentially contaminated so it's just like you know how much more can we take but I would really accept your offer of having a combined workshop on that that would be great are there any other questions for a king Jimmy increasingly a moment as we are is the EK no responsibility and also once every three years probably every three years he can have a review all those the bus route however in some of the new subdivision area because the some new subdivision area there has been a completely their solar quite a few people of settle down in there but a whole kid you know in conjunction and we align with the your review those the pass route for more fraser book is regular rather than just once every three years to review and to put to a consultation we are not the ones every three year review is important it's important that people know that we check all the routes on their basis but that doesn't stop us addressing issues between those three ly review dates indeed the earthquake has forced us to address all sorts of different routes and route changes we also have programs underway for instance with preston's etc where we know that major subdivisions are going ahead we actually tried to almost run at a loss leader where we stick the bus route into the subdivision it and get access to it so that they're actually difficult for us but we try to make sure that if christ church is growing in a certain direction or Rolleston then we put the buses there early so that people are just learn to use them and so I would think that working quite closely with you particularly through the UDS partnership we're aware of exactly where you're going exactly where the developers are going and trying to get the bus routes their head times are tough at the moment but I think we're doing it pretty well Wigner Skies is one where I think that I see buses travelling around pretty empty roads yeah thank you very much and thank you both it's really important to have your input at this level and I look forward to meeting up with you again soon on earth on a workshop basis thank you
Castle would you like to come forward good morning welcome hi here we going I know I was gonna say no stranger to the council welcome back thank you but my name cause of cincy castle and I'm a retired school teacher and I've appeared before this council what number of years now asking that the council and produce a formal complaints procedure and every time I have done so I've been told no we don't need one or it's left of each department to hold it in my opinion you do need one you need a formal complaints procedure and I say this from experience the past few years I've had to deal with first of all the leaky home some of the problems I had with that never really been resolved but it was the behavior of the stuff I had to deal work which I found quite appalling I've had a planning decision where the block of units of 11 the front two and a half units were made into a business one at zone and the rest of the all sorts of problems that was done of it when the city plan was developed and we were never actually informed the time I read it in the newspaper that I'm suddenly living in a business owner but that's created a whole host of new problems one of the owners five or six years ago applied to convert the front unit and to a medical facility will help facility but took get we got I had to get all the neighbors we all got together and we had to write letters get a lawyer involved and anyway the guy who only you're in a teepee turn actually he was what he was really trying to do of course was to increase the profit when he sold it when he saw unsold it and shortly after that I discovered a defect than the actual documentation and animal resource consent was in fact cancelled but more recently woman purchased the unit and converted it into a brothel it took nine months before the council finally closed it down when we asked to have it we were originally told we one of the neighbors complained and said we don't do something I'm going to go public about your failure to do anything it's a sorts of things which keep bringing me back here time and time again wanting a proper complaints procedure so I asked please could you have one as soon as you can do one get it then quick needs to be a formal and I'm Reginald semester I put in get a few details here that was when I put him here for other councils happened a few years ago I remember having a look at white a curry City Council what I became part of the Auckland Council and they had at the right in your place there it was on their website they have pamphlets here which were the desks everywhere it wasn't only for complaints it was also for compliments because there have been times when I must admit I did feel like I'm phoning up and complimenting start here anyway that's my site for this year hopefully Lindsay I can I can tell you that your in a customer complaints process go on a website as you seed it's not not easy to find normally easy to to access but with the new office of the chief executive which is being established at the moment under the leadership of Mary Richardson there will be a new customer services approach and this will be effects so you're hopefully hopefully next year you'll come along with a compliment on the long term plan which will show that that this new approach has addressed the problem that the whole I guess what does that culture of the organization as being turned around to be and can do approach so you know it's not it's not this is how things are done it's how can we help you do what it is that you want to do and the complaints process will be part of that we're hoping that that will reduce and the other as the as the richest source of information that this organization has it's called our call center or customer center and that call center holds more knowledge than anything else and we need to complete what's called a feedback loop yeah hell yeah that's quite important actually yeah absolutely Lindsay thank you very much for your perseverance in fear the submission to and like I know if you know the models for example how the district health board have a complaints officer and we could have a process like that you referred to watch a curry so there's any other good models that you'd like to pass on I'm sure we would be interested looking at those and as well besides the complaints the compliments to what you did yeah I go there to go hand in hand I think thank you very very much okay geez
And now I would like to invite aaron wilms first and john harrison to come forward on submission on the pioneer early centre welcome um I'm erin williams and I'm here today with gian harrison we are parents of children who attend pioneer early learning center our submission recommends that the council oppose the draft annual plan proposal to explore the transfer of day-to-day operations of pioneer early learning center to another child care provider pioneer provides a unique flexible and affordable service that the council should continue to run while our written submission covers eight key areas to challenge this proposal today we are focusing on the two fundamental reasons to maintain council delivery of pioneer early learning centre the incorrect cost savings assumptions provided as a rationale for exit which I will discuss and the importance impact and difference quality early childhood education makes which jian will talk about so the rationale offered for exploring transfer of pioneer early learning centre is cost saving and the indicated amount is a hundred thousand dollars this is an inaccurate figure the council will not have an additional hundred of pioneer using the budget provided by the centre it can clearly be seen that almost fifty thousand dollars of the costs are non-controllable attributed to depreciation and corporate overhead that is they are a deficit in accounting terms only rental of the premises while not included in the budget must be considered in light of the nine community early childhood education providers who access funding by the strengthening communities grants to pay for their rental of council-owned premises these average thirty thousand dollars per cent given these two pieces of information the actual savings should the council exit provision are approximately twenty thousand dollars the r is yet unexplored opportunities to increase revenue and impact on the deficit there are opportunities to increase occupancy increase the opening hours significantly improve the range and frequency of marketing and to review the business model particularly looking at the mix of n number of timing and casuals of casual spaces increasing occupancy should be the highest priority using the data shared by the centre regarding current occupancy in both the over and under twos and the proportion of 20 hours free used funding tables to calculate changes to revenue as occupancy increases these calculations are on page four of our submission as you can see even a modest increase of three percent in occupancy would result in an increase in revenue of fifteen thousand dollars should occupancy increase to ninety two percent across the centre which is admittedly a challenge the revenue would jump by seventy thousand dollars we believe that the centre can be run on a more cost efficient basis with a significant reduction in its actual operating deficit we want the council to continue to run pioneer early learning centre and are willing to work together with the council and staff to further investigate it and implement the identified opportunities kia ora koto I'm here to illustrate the points we have made in our submission about quality the three pages at the end of our submission are where we highlight some of the available research into early childhood education in essence quality within the section sector comes down to having highly qualified and well-paid staff low child-to-teacher ratios and small group sizes the new zealand council for education mitchell goes into some depth about the significant factors that point to quality pioneer has all these first-rate qualities plus is an environment which is child and family oriented quality early childhood has ever expanded impacts on the individual their family the education levels attained and the potential earnings for that child and the amount of potential drain on our resources on vote education health and justice if they do not reach that potential as learners and citizens generally education is an investment rather than a cost to be saved our center is one out of the box it's no ordinary early early childhood facility we are understandably proud of pioneer and we think you as councillors should champion it above others I'd also like to elaborate on the innovative way that pioneer staff have used current best evidence around transitions to inform their practice teachers at pioneer go the extra mile to support children's transition to primary school with purposeful peer visits as well as strong connections with local new entrant teachers a lot of work has gone on in the background to ensure that theory for the children families and schools this is groundbreaking and excellent practice that was noted recently by aero internal transitions between the unders and over twos have also improved with key teachers forging lasting relationships with children who they are primarily responsible for finally I want to point out that whilst only erin and I stand here before you today to explain our position it is clear from parent feedback and from the number of supporting submissions that we have support from our community after the submission date we receive confirmation from nathan makaida wallace who's a brainwave trust speaker and director of x factor education that he would like to see the council maintain its interest in early childhood education we're not just here the two of us um we're supported by people we'd now really like to take leave lots of time for questions and discussion on this that's great thanks just um one question um it seemed that some of the feedback from parents was that um that the underlying concern was that it was going to close rather than it would was being bought by a private provider but being run by the current team and kept as a preschool then that would be fine but no doubt the plan is to get rid of it so therefore I disagree yeah there was a bit of a change in wording from the draft annual plan as we see it now to the draft that came out prior the communication to parents said that it was to explore the possibility of tendering out the management of pioneer and the communication from that point onwards was stuck we were in a desert um so a lot of us a lot of parents assumed that it would be going to a private provider um and that it would be that the council would be divorcing itself entirely now it's exploring and then we've had a bit so yes so there was a letter sent to parents from the center um in february which was quite alarming I guess and it was much more along those sorts of lines and then the draft in your plan was much potentially softer and so some been their position so what so what I mean if it were to a community provider so say it was a community trust um that was running it like most of our child care centres in christchurch they're not all private are they nice the majority centers in christchurch are private okay we have nine that fit under the strengthening communities funding that are directly parent-based communities who organize who do the governance that's only nine out of the hundreds of child care centers in christchurch but there are a lot of lot more community providers than that kids first so kids first would be classed as a community provider is a quite a large organization um however in terms of early learning centres they run one in a building a second so they it's a different model of delivery kindergarten's a term time only and shorter hours yeah yeah okay so um yeah all right um phil thanks for your submission john marin um look I just wanted this the staff report on our page 29 which in one of the options they list list break even just wonder if you could tell us your view about that that option that staffing and I think that I think it's about addressing those four key elements of each of those four key things looking at marketing of the service to increase the occupancy looking at the opening hours and potentially increasing those those opening hours to to make currently the centers open 8 30 to 4 30 so that is against a traditional working day for a working parent that is shorter than a working day so there are a group of people in the community who would not be able to access so increasing the opening hours would potentially increase the the longer num or more longer bookings um casual spaces are allocated currently on a if you walk in and ask for a casual space you would get it if there's a space available it's on a first come first serve basis there's no priority given to parents who potentially would want a whole day space or a half a day space and of course if you take a casual or that's potentially a morning that you've lost I think there's some work to do around how that model is implemented to continue to offer some casual spaces but also to maybe make it a little more in line with towards a revenue driving model thank you so if some work along those lines was done could you would that be workable for you experience we'd like to see parents um communicated with and our ideas put into the mix we don't feel that there's been a great deal of communication with parents about changing the model and how that might impact on parents and also reach the targets that are currently set for casual use for users of the rec centre which is also a very important part of the well-being of the community so it's balancing those two things out and there's certainly some work that we're happy to do and obviously we've put a lot of effort into looking at the financial models um I really feel that a lot of this hasn't been explored fully know ref was first and I've overlooked them so I apologize that's okay I'm used to it hey um look thanks for the submission which was uh which was very detailed and and had some good ideas in there I guess a couple of questions really which might be a bit broader and that's really this is council's only child care operated facility um so my question is why should council run this as opposed to say a community group or a parent's co-op or just the ece sector itself because some of the comments you're making there is that would in a way make me worried about what you perceive as to be the poor quality of service provided by the general ec sector which is where most kids are being looked after so that's kind of generally certainly the research shows the linda mitchell one in particular use a lot of new zealand data so it's a bit more relevant to us but it also looked at there's a lot of research being done in the uk and the fact that institutions like councils and businesses in terms of running their own on-site ones focus more on the staff and the theory and the qualifications of the staff rather than the fancy building that it's in and the the fancy equipment that there is to play with so and and what the research clearly shows is that what makes a difference for children's learning now and ongoing is the relationships with those staff and the relationships are best formed by highly qualified formed by highly qualified staff so our private providers are trying to make a profit and they're doing some things about the session times and the delivery of things for parents that make it really difficult to access part days where you'd like to so the person that comes in for a casual use between twin and 12 can't get that somewhere else a friend who's doing currently has her child in for six hours a day when that child turns three because of the session times that are working at that center she currently pays 32 she'll pay a day because that centre runs a sessional model so they have a morning session that's a very clear start and finish in an evening session and so there's a financial cost to that parent for going to a centre that's running a financial model plus they may have they're more likely to have more higher numbers of unqualified staff on the floor and unregistered staff so that suggests to me that this is a conversation you need also to be having with the ministry of education well proliferation of private centres to continue and we're subsidizing them these private people aren't breaking any rules no no no no you're saying that they're running to the bank the service they're providing is not of I'm saying it's not as it's not the best it could be what what you may not know is that the rules were changed so that the the government of the day changed the rules to no longer required to move to 100 qualified staff I guess what I'm suggesting that it seems parents to get together and start to run these types of and they do currently and the council supports those through the strengthening communities funding but in itself bring brings its own challenges yes but if at the end of the day that there was a model chosen that would be preferable to going out to private yes yes without question and we've asked that we're very much of the opinion that there should be a preference to exploring a a parent group before putting it out for open slogan thank you very much a very good submission thank you um
And now we could invite Sharon Torstensson from the Council of social services in Christchurch morning shower nice to see you as well you get my point all sorted right after everybody in thank you very much the time it's the most beautiful day outside and I really really would like to everybody know it's just fantastic than what you guys are doing I'm not going to revisit my submission I think this speaks for itself would just like to really acknowledge the support that you give the not-for-profit sector it's just so valued and we would really encourage that the level of funding that you've made available and the plan is held through you final considerations I'd like to just give a bit of an overview of the nonprofit sector so you can have a really good feel for what it is that we're asking for the support for there's a lot of different names for the sector some people will call it a non-profit or not-for-profit sector but of course central and local government for instance also not for profit people get confused about because there are paid staff and the sector the term voluntary becomes about because people create these organizations out of a voluntary wish to come together oops sorry it's called the third seeker because business and businesses are guarded as a first and second sectors but worth noting that there were communities there before there was government or business the civil sector refused to once again the ability of people to come together onekama civil capacity the NGO sector the non-government organization once again that's you know businesses are non government as well the null ng itunes to be used for large organizations such as a Red Cross Fred freedom so currently presenting the guided as offering hallows big a type organizations tend to be referred to as NGOs rather than small community groups the community sector well government business are also part of the community everybody's part of the community we can't beside ourselves what to call it everybody can we say why don't we call it freed and what is it the diff desire accepted definition for the seat it doesn't distribute surpluses and additionally separate from government its self governing and control of its own destiny and its non-compulsory now that definition has been developed by V and johns hopkins center and there's a lot of work that goes live it's an international research project that compares a lot for profit sector in different countries this is another definition the space of uncoerced human association and also a set of relational networks for of the sake of family faith interest ideology that fill this space now the figures I'm going to give a really rough basically we've taken the national data and said Canterbury's ten percent of the country so we'll take him to seem to the data it's around nine hundred 9700 not-for-profit groups and organizations who can't debris about ten percent of them would have any paid staff it's probably a few more in Canterbury because of the generation of new groups post-quake the seat is made up of culture sports and recreation forty five percent of the sector and that but twelve percent of the eight percent as education and research here's some of the organizations that you'll find there culture sports and recreation the symphony orchestra tennis kids face social services we've got a Methodist Mission Age Concern pillows religion covers places like the Cathedral the mask the synagogue's development and housing I've got community places like fedora the ministry of awesome project littleton educational research covers everything from your community preschools through to really ali christ college and so on business and professional unions we've got restart as a part of a not-for-profit sector the employers Chamber of Commerce belongs so does the hospital and hotel workers unions under Lauren advocacy three percent of the sector we've got community law the communities cantabria assistance insurance assistance political parties under health we've got the Cancer Society small groups like depression support big organizations like st. George's they look like environment an animal protection and then under others we've got things like volunteering Canterbury awesome and the Canterbury Community Trust funding bodies are also part of the sector the sector can to bring employees around do both there's a the number of groups would be around 970 maybe a thousand groups out of that four out of the almost 10,000 would have paid staff and the number of employees pay employees is about ten and a half thousand with noting that over sixty percent of employed staff are in health and social services and education and research and these sectors is a lot of our government contracts and a lot of professional delivery of services and you can't_''_372.25 do that without paid staff the last look at reverberation was an april 2013 and reap the media total numeration it's quite a bit like that either the public sector or the general market so there's a lot of acceptance of lower wages because of the heart that people are putting into the work that they're doing with you because we care economic turnover and your turnover and can debris the sectors responsible for about a billion dollars and our incomes comes twenty-five percent from government 55 seen it from fees subscriptions so on and philanthropy such as Community Trust private donations professional qualifications for the work that the agencies are doing a lot of the managers do the promo not for profit management and those that haven't done in diversity based professional qualifications and of course the sector itself maintains their professionalism through various quarters and seminars through community north canterbury for instance runs courses on the legal obligations of the sector community accounting helps us look after our financial obligations and volunteering canterbury runs a lot of course and they've lots a lot of other organizations that provide the professional development as well we see our first accountability is to our community or to our clients then after that our accountabilities to the members of our organizations thunders supporters and in government vyas these statutory obligations that we have just some of those the charitable trusts act and corporated societies charities act and the financial reporting act so we have to be pretty cleared up as to what we're doing just do we note about charities not all nonprofits and charities and so there's about two and a half thousand and Canterbury if you become a are exempt from gift duty we also have to be on a public register which are searchable online and you know people that are accountable through their to become a charity you've got to have a a charitable purpose and those charity those papers are listed there and just to conclude our value to society is not just about providing services but we're for weaving together the fabric of our society we provide services years we also give a way for people to participate as citizens and volunteers we stand up for underrepresented citizens and we pioneer solutions to major social problems that government just hasn't got the fleetness of foot to be able to do nonprofits believe that we will create a better future through innovation and social change and that's that sense of hope that leads us to these creative models and the new approaches that we redevelop so and another something we create value and communities we've earful maintain their strong civil society provide services but we also build citizens skills and preview to produce strong networks and that's what's and veer working with the communities that's helping out communities to recover and become strong and that's what I'd out of sources that you're interested okay so any questions in equation they've got time I think I think we've got a minute or slowly yeah um felt so thanks very much sharing I just ask you about the white told us about a wide range of community groups the NGOs and friends thank you what my question is about is accommodation for the groups who you coordinate just people let us know how they're faring and if we example we've lost any but he'll the future is regarding accommodation from having lost kill anything else a future is a decision there's they're mostly aware of the issues around community house and we're we're struggling to get me established but that's looking exciting we will plan to move into our new premises on the first of timber and we're just about to put out a call for expressions of interest for tendency in there so we number of groups stole and temporary accommodation and there are a number of groups that we know are and premises with the temporary resource consent to operate out of domestic premises that's going to come to an end and 2016 we we're trying to find out how many there are and what their plans are so we don't know what the impact will be in 2016 when that temporary thing comes free we also know that a number of groups signed up for leases and places that are probably due to mature in the next year or two and we don't know what impact renegotiated rent levels work might be on those so it's a really uncertain time yeah just with with new premises coming online through the rebuild a lot of community agency is the same that it can't actually afford to go into the new places traditionally the not-for-profit sector in the city was the we were the vulnerable tenants of the commercial sector we took the low end of the market those buildings that have now fallen down the end there of rental that they used to be so it's a very difficult time for us here it's um come to an end of our time look thank you very much for your presentation very informative help we've got a copy of that hidden we've the presentation yeah so we've captured that so thank you very much thanks for watch retired
And now I'd like to invite window Wendy Everingham from lyttelton harbour Information Center hello windy thanks very much for having me here this morning this time Wendy Everingham and I'm the chair of the lyttelton harbour Information Center hopefully you've all heard about the information center we're a totally volunteer organized our information center and one of the important community hugs in littleton so not only do we provide information for visitors and tourists but we're also the home of the littleton time being and we're also now the home of civil defense and the meeting place for lots of community groups in our area but this morning I like to talk to you about the head-to-head walkway in littleton hopefully you've all heard about the head-to-head walkway this is a desire that our communities had for many many years to have a walkway going from godly head the entire way round to addley head so covering the entire of the lyttelton harbour I've lived in Littleton for 11 years and in that time this projects been something that's been you're aware but at the time of amalgamation when banks peninsula District Council joined with christchurch city there was a significant amount of money put aside for the head-to-head walkway and that money came from the banks peninsula district council reserve fund so so the money that you're looking at now is is money that was transferred from our past council to you so I'd also like to highlight um you all be aware with the of the master plan for little ssin this signifies that there's really great community support for this head-to-head walk as the head-to-head walkway was listed as one of the community aspirations for our area the head tad walk where to it's not just a walkway in isolation it will end up being part of an entire walking network for from Christchurch right the way through to akaroa obviously you've been hearing about people talk about the coastal pathway along from Heskett to sumner well that will link into this particular walkway the rod Donald trust also has great plans for linking all of the banks peninsula up by we're going right around lyttelton harbour that then we'll be able to connect to pathways right through to occur or it'll be able to connect to a little river rail trail so christchurch will have a fantastic network of walking in cycle ways from the colin the murky walks right through the coastal path way right through the head to head walkway and all the other walks that are planned so so our community thinks that this is a really amazing project and 314,000 that's in your budget it's not a huge amount of money but the benefits to the entire area will be substantial in terms of tourism recovery again this is viewed as a key project for Lil Jon however you will know there's no godly house anymore there's no time ball station there's no Littleton museum there's no cruise ships there's no Stoddard cottage we've got very very little tourism infrastructure walking is all that we've got and so to have this pathway developed further is quite significant to the people of littleton and diamondharbour own festival of walking exponentially festival of walking and so last year for the first time we had a headache we we made up our own little head-to-head walkway project through that festival and it was incredibly well supported by people so we're positive that if the walkway is completed it will get lots of use and for part of this wider network we also all the time hearing about recovery recovery is all about people and what better way for people to connect via walking we I think if the walk where it's a reason for people to get out of their houses and do something it's great to walk around a harbour fills one soul really and to have more important more people being able to experience the harbor and how beautiful it is can only help with people's personal recovery I'm I imagine you all also know that a community working party was set up by our community board to develop the head to hit walkway I'm one of the members on that working party as well from the rod Donald group's been meeting since December because we all thought that so the walkway was going to get under way it is June so this team along with council staff have been developing a development plan really and we've already sort of got the resources in place for council staff to start physically working on this project as of the first of July so so yeah I just want you to know that it appears that all the resources are there ready to go and we're all ready to go and it would be a real shame if it's deferred for enough for a longer period that's basically all I wanted to say really yeah that the position has been well supported by the community Borden and others that have appeared before us so I think Andrew probably wants to kick off the questioning on there and yeah thanks very much indeed Wendy for your submission and I'm certainly very aware of all of the the good work that the Information Center and the other groups that you're involved with in the Middleton community recreational benefit going ahead but I wonder whether you'd like to make some comments on the the economic benefits that perhaps would come from less as well well there's quite a few little B&B is dotted around lyttelton harbour and one of the aims of the head walk where's that people will spend two or three days at least walking around our Harbor and while they do that they'll stop over at these tiny being beings along the way so we feel that the walkways got quite a lot of potential to you know really assist business development around the harbor that that's happened with the corral one has up yes and I mean you only have to look at little river now with the silos that have been built and that's in relation to the cycleway Little River Rail Trail so so we're hoping that that can happen around our Harbor as well but as a glorious part of the world I still of an adult and so I've gotta be stirred address yep once the walkway is set up and community groups within the harbor basin there would assist with maintenance yes I'm on the Littleton reserves committee and there's definitely people within that committee you are willing to commit to that sort of stuff is also in cass bay at the moment another group of residents have got together to create another reserves committee so yeah people are really passionate about it so in general I think people you live on lyttelton harbour a happy to muck in and make things happen I mean we realize there's not enough resources to have paid or for all the positions so so we do take responsibility I mean I think you can see that with information center as well I mean we have an Information Center it's purely run by volunteers people put their hands up to do things that we think we need any other questions narni just very quick comment um thank you for the work that you've been doing that's really a little stones are really impressive model I think of community response post disaster and even before but I just want how we all feel so yeah we do all know about the Littleton center and and also project that'll turn on yeah it's really it is a fantastic model so thank you very much for making the time available and coming and submitting thank you
Get underway and I'd like to invite the representatives of the diamondharbour Community Association is it Richard saga thank you good morning good morning good morning everybody you're a code oh um first up pick something be stressed anyway um I know it's good it's actually much harder at the end of the day okay I'm the recently appointed chairperson the diamond harbour Community Association associations been going since about nineteen thirty-one so it's a body that represents fairly strongly that they've used the diamond harbour community we had about 25 people turned up to our AGM just last month and we had a almost excess of people fighting to be on the committee and but 14 committee members now and we're involved in maintaining the website diamondharbour Harold maintaining the community hall and other connection functions in the community so I think sphere to say we do represent well the opinions the community which can be quite opinionated it as a strong and cohesive community our submission is quite succeed in the way I've laid it out the points I're taking on on various things and of course it's reasonably procure because we're talking about diamond harbour and on a lot of those I just like to focus on time available just on number of those items that are raised in the in the submission the first one is in relation to the reserve management and I'd like to just bring to the council's attention may not be aware that the three recent storm events to cyclones and one large suddenly storm had a very very large impact on diamond harbour reserves while Christ she's got off reasonably likely during those cyclone events apart from the flooding the wooden damage in diamond harbour was very very large and those people have been to Diamond Harbour been out to the godly house point and gone right out to the point and looked across to repaper Island well it used to be a pine forest there there is literally no pine forest left it's been totally devastated about 90% destruction of trees on that headland so there has been a Norma's amount of damage of a context in terms of some of the work just want to know that we have got a restoration project the regional councils involved in supporting add as well as through the zone implementation committee and one of the local galleries and we're pleased that the council is prepared to support that as well by fencing that gully out of council grazing area and sporting restoration in terms of the walkway itself we support the head to head walkway but note there was quite a commitment required now to reopen and repair the tracks around diamond harbour we certainly like to see the walkway in going down to pearl and finished as a priority and obviously also back towards Chatteris bay that referred by extension moving on from the reserves just to note in terms of the community facilities on a second page of our submission there it's been obviously been lobbying for a number of years now post quakes particularly since godly house was demolished for something be done about the the state of the foundations there we have rather ugly set of concrete foundations that of value pre pre 1900 but I must say the community opinion is that doesn't actually value that the concrete foundation is really at all but we understand there is some historic and mirror possibly to them it seems the proposed solution is to remove the more recent concrete foundation and to grass over the older concrete foundation and if that is the temporary solution we would ask that to be hurried up and got on with we would hope that would have been done we had some indication would be done before the summer concert season that our subcommittee called spring organizers we have now had two years of summer concerts over there which are good community events and attract people over from christchurch as well but having to look at ugly fences which have them but some local community people took on their hands to remove any way the basic needs tidying up and sorted out as an immediate step and then longer-term what we like to do is to have more council planning engagement in redesign of what is to be done to replace godly house thinks about one and a half million slipped on the pot there I'm glad we've had an indication to the council that that is still ring-fenced or for not necessary particularly well room feeds but at least it on the books as being the insurance money for the godly house site and it's not going anywhere else as far as we know and we would like to have a replacement community facility put on there we've undertaken a number of planning exercises at our own costs recently we just funded a five-thousand-dollar landscape design report for the godly house site and the surrounding shopping sure he saves town center area and so that's a and that's our second major piece of design work that we've done organized and funded by the community and we would really like the council to engage with us in terms of doing some planning we realize you've got a very large number of other priorities in terms of Christchurch rebuild but so we've done it's almost gone as far as we can go now in of how Syria may be satisfactorily turned into something in the future which will have community value the only other thing I want to note in terms community facilities is to express appreciation for the fact that it's indicated there is going to be some upgrading repair work done to the community center which is managed to remain open once through the whole period post-earthquake which is great and that council does have membership of the Stoddard cottage committee which is a very important historic acid there and also in the community locality and lastly just to go back to the beginning again just want to note that the wilds been enormous amount of storm damage around the city it has been very pleasing that the council has staff or services or contractors have done their best to clean up roads over an output of the peninsula pretty promptly and have made considerable effort to chainsaw a way that the biggest trees on the most major tracks so just a pat on the back for the you know the hard-working young staff and contractors who have have a system'll start with the question that I've been asking a number of community organizations which is you know with a bit of support with the council how much could the local community do for themselves in terms of you know some of the cleanup activities I mean I know that you say that you've taken things as far as we can but that was more really in the development area for the for the for the overall site this is making it good for summer what assume is there more that the community could do like in a partnership with some with the council I think in terms of the reserve clean up this is a major decision to be made about whether or not some of those that those pine tree is actually going to be extracted or just left higgledy-piggledy to to be sort of gradually colonized by weeds and other plants that are generally what fills up the coastal reserve area yeah and I'm not something that amateurs can guide and I sending more of the area of the foundations and 0 in relation working bees and that sort of thing for I am godly house site that we help okay our timber I guess it's a long same lines with regards to there are groups that work on the what holes with maintain working with the Rangers maintaining the mounted bike tracks and walking tracks etc and signage and all that type of man you mentioned before about the the tricks and diamond harbour teacher would there be something that you're there you you guys to work and with the Rangers in the past and some decades back that sort of if it has been put in by the community current focus in terms of reserves and tracking is the morgans galley areas I referred to before where there's a commitment now for me to councils to provide plants if we do a planning program in there and that's probably going to suck up most of the the effort from the people in community want here behind that type of reserve management whereas a local person who does the acts as a contract with the council to maintain that up on page six City Planning and Development your comments are and heritage protection you know we have been advocating for heritage what more do you see us being able to do as a council and that in that space I mean advocacy today is largely failed but be interested if there's any other things you think we should we should be doing in that in that area now I'm sorry I can't offer any other further imagines of suggestions just just keep on doing what you're doing do you think we should take back to such normal democratic decision-making powers from Sarah over are listed courage now I'm not going to comment on the relationship in the council Sarah you know that's fair enough I think that's come to the end of our time but thank you very much for your submission it's great to hear better community organization here is more people winter instead of the covered part of the committee you know usually it's a few teared up to the meeting you're on the committee so it anyway why she thought it's great news thank you very much
This for lateness from a Lee Jones counselor buck not sure about the other art and I don't think we need to have a movement and seconder for the apologies to ignite so if we
CC is disability action is has put the submission off till tomorrow I Jane cook and David browse Burt Ward in yep hi I do the popo routine that's a heavy lifting that's fine come and make yourself at home I'm Jane I love a french from valley road necro Harbor and ours is one of only two properties on the last couple of kilometres of that narrow unsealed road and we've been the over 25 years we've always been pretty happy with our road we certainly don't expect a superhighway but in the last few years were very concerned about maintenance and I'd have saved me ver had so many comments from people around the district especially since the last couple of rain event about how the damage wouldn't have occurred and the flooding whenever could on their properties if the drains and culverts had been cleaned out and I just heard that over and over again so which I think that routine maintenance just isn't happening and hasn't been for a few years and what's being done gets scuffed through by the greater and that's about all and so after the before this year the previous big storm event that we'd had I think was about oxford timber october 2012 we contacted the city council about the damage that that occurred then in effect that the culverts were blocked an hour if we have a decent store my husband's up and down the road with a shovel doing what he can to make sure that things keep flowing but he can only do so much if the culverts are completely blocked up then there's nothing you can do and we met with Alan Cameron then and he agreed that work was needed and nothing happens and contacted them again about March last year I got an email response said that it would be be done soon so much this year I'm thinking winter's coming again better see when that's going to get done and then of course we got that extremely amount of rain which resulted in really serious damage to the road I mean rut that were half a swept off the road and wrecked our fences it's not just your own roads it's other people's properties as well that this affects and so you know that we're told us as an extra it was an extraordinary event it was going to be damaged I don't agree with that because our own driveway which is about half a kilometer long winding down a steep hillside had absolutely no damage to it whatsoever and that's because we look after it when I am content well first of all I contact the council several times to ask that a road closed sign was put up so that no one wind up there I did speak to mr. Cameron and he told me but there are a lot of roads on the peninsula is an awful lot of roads and you can't possibly maintain them all and I was pretty astonished by that statement and that's when I crashed off the computer and filed off my one line submission that I seen tone because I wasn't very impressed by that statement I think least a standard which keeps impossible for the users that need them and also avoids tens of thousands of damaged dollars worth of damage down there down the track so you know I understand that the pressures and demands that you've got on you and of course we've heard a lot more about that since I made my submission but there are some things you can't really afford not to do properly and I've been self-employed for more than 30 years so I know that if you don't finish what you start and if you don't avoid mistakes it all comes out of your own own pocket in the end and three or four lots of people have have come now and knocked at our road and very little being done thats kool that's are still blocked and yeah I like I like the saying that says when all is said and done a lot more will have been seed them's been done and I think that's what what what's happening here I mean you know we're not we or but these things can't being neglected now roads are our lifeline as a lot of damage occurring to the sea walls around the harbor and then getting undermined you know we have a demographic now in our Valley for instance my husband either youngest residents in the valley by quite a long shot there's there's no one the two farms and the valley there are no resident farmers left their absentee owners so notice ask how many people actually live on your road and there's only two properties now of course it's important for farm access but it is also of course we're in a tourism area I feel like I'm in this camper van I know I know the road would we be better to give you the road closed sign actually seriously I mean this is the first time that it that it's been damaged to that extent where it really was dangerous and in actual fact what happened was some about a week later after I'd made this number of requests a bus that got lost that farm winery went up the road and I think that could have had very serious consequences and what it took was a sign oh oh yes but we'd like actually like the drains cleared is just a quick question you would have seen a track down there at some point maintaining that culvert can you tell us who that contractors and the contractors fulton hogan or mayor yeah but I think they need to actually be going around with shovels and not just standing here looking at things and scraping around with a grader every so often thank you got some shopping today alright just bought a few photos as examples to highlight some of the points
Have appeared yesterday so their submission is in this day's document on page 116 welcome thank you and just trying to find your names and successfully so you might like to introduce ourselves as well mantra kittens from Town Planning Group thinking and met would lose rma'd wrinkles on October protection thank you well the purpose of the submission was to release assistance from the council for the ongoing operation of what's called Victoria Street term State Patrol which is an initiative that started just this last weekend and I'd like to officially clarify that it is an initiative that's going to continue with or without council funding that's quite important to get that across the line and to make that clear but is something the license he see is quite important the funding element to it really would enable longevity of the project but would help with that providing the resources to continue it and make sure us all fulfilled and achieving good aims and outcomes and also quite importantly examples I help with transparency in terms of you've got council involved and will be a lot on better outcomes again I'm I won't reverse what my outlined in the submission in terms of the proposal with the costs and benefits I'll take that as read it was suggested between to start this project that we do apply to the council funding the initial projects of six weeks long starting this last weekend and that's been funded partly why the council to date so the whole aim is to make sure that we can continue that process on its initiative as supported by also by the police and the council when hospitality new zealand and it's really an effort for licensees to be proactive rather than reactive issues in the area if we can continue to make changes and improvements as things go on we're going to gain more get better outcomes and that's quite important for us and the council wants obviously people to be living in the city again if we can get an environment we ever got businesses coexisting with residents and putting measures in place to achieve that that's only to our friends and the press'll would be quite helpful to clarify three misconceptions that have just come about from the paper today are firstly that the bars have no security there are 12 bars that are part of the group in vitoria street and together there's a expense their annual expense of around a million dollars in terms of security costs for containing people within your premise and making sure they're in a safe environment so it's quite a quite an important point to be clear of one of the other misconceptions of the bars don't want to pay for street security bets again it's another misconception as well this is a as I say as a council support initiative we want to make sure that it was run well when it has good longevity about it but I think there needs to be clear expectation and an awareness there there is going to be an overall community benefit to this that my opinion without way the financial cost of it which are quite to be about twelve hundred dollars a week and the street Wilfred damage and goes over them and the bigger picture probably helping please help with the resource in as well so I think in the bigger picture it does have some quite substantial benefits and the food misconception there that existing security should be doing the job and basically making sure people on the street are contained and in a safe environment and that's why pass you over to mr. would just outline now what's happening last weekend and yeah thanks I think one of the misconceptions also in the presses these guys are security guards they're not security guards these guys a job is to advise and support people of the expectations of behavior that we want in victoria street the guys are out flyering these two people these are the leaflets that we're handing out to people outline in the area of the liquor ban and the expectations of their behavior to keep victoria street safe they're not security they're vs essays Victoria Street safe operatives it's all about educating think of us as you will in a soccer're the ones out there giving the warning what does yellow card doing soccer it creates a behavioral change for the player and it's exactly the same we're trying to advise people hey hey hey this is where you're at this is not the expectations here we're the good guys we're going to give you a leaflet the next leaflet you get is going to be with two hundred and fifty dollars minimum on it if you're caught acting in this way so we're their support and the overwhelming response from last weekend was of gratitude from people that they weren't aware of this so we're there to educate people and then if people fail to listen if they fail to adhere to our advice then all of our operatives are radio linked up to every single bar we can just put a radio call out to all the bars these people dressed in looking like have been non responsive and they've said they don't care we advise you don't let them into your area to cause trouble this behaviour not welcome this is what we found these are some of the stats we've got these reports coming in every single night report after report after report from the guys into what they're finding overwhelmingly we're finding sideloading we're finding intoxication this is being found in the street not in the bars in the street prior to people coming into the venues saturday less sideloading around the areas obviously it's a saturday people are starting earlier at home but we're finding a huge increase here in the disorder and this is what we're here to prevent we've got links to the police all our bars are hooked up if there's an officer nearby they can come down and cysts with dealing with the disorder and it worked on numerous occasions over the weekend the police have an extra set of eyes and ears well four sets of eyes and ears out there helping to contain illicit behavior and this is what they are there to do there Aizen is to support the police there Aizen is to support the well to make sure that illicit behavior moves on and victoria street stays safe for those who want to enjoy a responsible evening out I use that two of them happy for questions that in my previous role I ran the Ambassador Program which is pretty much what you're doing here now I congratulate you on taking initiative and trying to do something about it great to see the safe city officers came in during my tenure to actually address some of the late night issues and they came on around about sort of four and they we're not through the through the night I know a number of the inner city property owners who had apartments in the city that look down on the street and when they saw groups of views intoxicated use they watch their safe city office has gone hide mmm this is the difference between a council-run security as opposed to our business rather security they are quite different models no I think nothing you're spot on I think this bottom here there is a difference and we want a difference safe better than time where they were there but using October protection and any other trained security professionals how we're going to get a better outcome and I think even just from the weekend scene we do we already have that outcome one question because a moment you know is a try and see the period especially after earthquake it's the total environment is the defender fonder before earthquaker so regarding to the security patrol do you think is appropriate if a council Gwen Effendi a year sixty two thousand dollars for extension to five years the time friend maybe after the from now on after three years when the CPD has been back to the original the state it is appropriate you know I think you how do you know I think that the father time frame was really aimed it looking at a period where the CBD does get back up on his feet it's it's hard day she put a time frame on that is at two years at three years as a ten years but the fact that was with five years came CBD does achieve those the rebuilding the growth with a mystery is I don't think there'd much lievable up to continue these types of patrols that is a transitional step and I you say that were through this the research that you've done through that they're the last night are the weekend the issues are from punters prior to them coming to your bar bars so these are people coming in there pre-loaded they haven't entered your bars yet so the issue is not from your patrons it's not patrons going from bar to bar as prior to actually entering any of the venues is these two aspects to it firstly we've been recognizing that time for the last 12-18 months in the split is largely brought about by preloading I think what are met some Sean from the data from the weekend just been it's just really prove that and other statistics now do a show them that's something is address and licensee it's very very hard to stop someone coming to an area think you can I just coming from your own patrons in terms of your of host responsibility that the owners along Victoria Street take towards your own patrons can you just explain your love is this to stick in two steps to that as well there's containing your patrons on site and making sure that our one in a safe environment and toxic ations isn't on premise is actually a legal obligation if you have someone to talk skate on your premature to get them off premise so once you get them off premise that's a different realm as you outside of your sphere as a licensee hints the reason why we want the trolls as a secondary aspect to actually control the streets as well in terms of them you look at most of the bars on the street they have security on the front gate as well which monitors lines people come into it to the premise again she assisted intoxication prior to a person H to come out to your premise any other ways that you take host take you know follow through posters instability policies mentoring you mentoring include provision of food and that kind of them Oh certainly no it's a you've got to have at least four or five options or food as he is during that very detailed host responsibility policies but one of the major thank you yeah thanks for that so we have a taxpayer-funded police force so why is public drunkenness a responsibility for council I'd like to see more police presence in victoria street and city and general one by doing this problem but again that's you've got a city plan that wants to create a vibrant safe city in my view it's a council obligation to help achieve that as well and that's why I'm saying for licensees we will step in and help get that environment as well but I think we will get a better outcome if we have council support from it and sorry I'm just going to jump in there I'm amy from hospitality new zealand what we've got to remember it's not an offence to be league it's not illegal and a could be as intoxication as I wish out on the street the police really can't deal with me because it is actually it's Martin offense that's my supps my supplementary question would then be do you think it should be an offence absolutely I think miss council should look seriously at creation in by law whereby at an absolutely of things to be drunk in a public place if we could get that you would be quite surprised that and completely only be we've done that somebody's head for the city we don't work in that space okay I don't think from the Bible okay I mean I agree with that I actually distinctly recall sitting on the resource consent hearing that probably granted consent to your premises correct and and there was quite some discussion at the time of host responsibility and the licensing hours the Victoria precinct people are quite indignant about the amount of hours that you've been granted and in fact I give phone calls regularly questioning my decision my participation and a decision to allow you to you all your resource consent application what steps are you taking now to address these issues because I actually support ref over here it's um it's not I can't see how we as a public entity should be funding something that's a private problem yeah well there's two things here my resource consents nothing to do with what with no no no just just as a first point but as we're talking about a precinct as a whole and precinct white issues as a whole not just one resource consent every premises responsible for dealing with your patrons and that's just as a host responsibility expect that they does have to do if you're not responsible for patrons you shouldn't be a licensee simple as there in terms of the weather should be funded by the council or not again if it's not funded by the council is you probably ought to be a major issue for licensees but we do want that the resourcing and assistance and to help with the longevity of it I don't think it themselves that we have some help from the council on it I think we're going to get better Apple but if the licensed premises weren't and victorious tree we wouldn't be having this problem you and you only back you'll never save anybody I was no line the problem now you I think I think you gave a Suzuki right gun causing well we're if they're not in the tourists retweet other guy like an open where do you think that is going to go to somewhere else in town same problems going to resolve somewhere else isn't it better to be proactive and actually contain the problem address the problem now before it comes to explain addition I think the rivers address as to whether we Thank you Thank You Brett strikes me it's all about the environment do you think if we zoned for lower noise levels that that would actually help I don't think would have much difference at all cause it's all about whether it should even go back a step Street Sounds owned you've about in the environment there where we're trying to control people on the streets and we live solely for noise in the city as you'll be a wish on private land you hit zoning we have zarling in the city and the CBD for noise as you're aware there's a planner yes I know that's what I'm saying it's you do not have zoning on a legal road at the paint I'm telling them I know that for a fact you don't episode on illegal road this is a street power security initiative there are no noise limits no wisdom is wrong premise yeah I just want to quickly ask about the police issue and I appreciate the issue about drunk in a public place and I think that's where the council's role in this actually I don't think it's a financial contribution issue I think its lobbying to get the law changed or adjusted accordingly what I want to ask is how do you find the police are when it comes to requiring via help I there would be provision under that to be able to ask for some support from the police yeah I me on both nights when I was out with the team the overwhelming response from the police was thank you you're an extra set of eyes and ears for us when we really appreciate it they're appreciative of the sport the information that they were getting for us and when we showed them leaflets and talk to them about the project if they were unaware they were blown away by it they really appreciate there is a resourcing issue and it has been for a while there's been not enough around but again what we've got to come back to is we're not policing the streets we're giving information we're trying to educate people that's what our main aim is to do is to educate and then if people fail to listen to what we want to educate them about the expectations to feed on that band to the rest of the bars so they will not get to cause trouble on Victoria going somewhere else ideally would like to have the street safe in every major street so people get the message this cat this kind of behavior cannot go on and it must change it substantially longer than we should have allowed and leave and it creates an incentive to be last okay thank you very much indeed for coming in and for everybody for their participation and that's the end of today
Yeah yeah I've just got a PowerPoint to go some more beautiful images of banks minutes if you want to drop the lights yeah yeah I'm just waiting for that PowerPoint to come up I'm speaking to you now on behalf of the New Zealand native forest restoration trust this is a North Island organization and is the group that's involved with this project that Gary introduced about the water catchment in a Corolla so the road Donald trust is acting as their local agent for them because they are a North Island organization which is why I'm presenting and I present apologies from jeff davidson the New Zealand native forest trust red manager now the new zealand restoration Trust is a North Island organization that is the largest landowner of native forests in New Zealand outside of the government's they have 28 reserves and all of their reserves are protected by qe2 covenant this is a map of where the reserves are you can see they're all in the north island except for one so I think we're really lucky that in our area at this time their interest is in protecting biodiversity throughout New Zealand's forests and wetlands and this is an image of their only reserved in the South Island so far up at the top of golden bay but now they're looking at by a reserve in agoura with some land that's on the market and their interest in this is because this piece of land that has come up is adjacent to the pointer of the henna y Reserve which I hope that you're all familiar with henna way one of the jewels of banks peninsula absolutely fantastic native forest restoration reserve run by Hugh Wilson now the site is the land is all above the Aqua Rio Township up at the top of the ridge there and it laps over the ridge into NY now this image little difficult but if you can look at this this is the guts of the project here the shot is Google Earth it's taken as they were a bird flying above Akkara looking up the hill so down the bottom mirror Vicki buck I just I'll just be very careful but there is a garage on ship down the bottom there there's the ridgeline up the top that we were looking at that shop from across the water henna lies over the back of the hill the land we're talking about is up the top here and the significance of it to council is that it is the main ocurro water catchment so the proposal from New Zealand native forest trust is a two-stage proposal in stage one they are wanting to purchase and they haven't purchased it yet they have a confirmed have their offer accepted there's a hundred ninety hectare block at the top of the hill and they are looking for council contribution first of all support and principal for the project and then taking a 40-percent financial stake in recognition of the catchment benefit I'm not presenting any hard figures here today because we are not in a public excluded session and to protect the project and the vendor and the interests of the purchaser but forty percent stake is what they are looking forest truster proposing to purchase the lower block this outlined in the pale orange but that's a little bit more complicated there is an old dwelling on the property that needs to be subdivided offers for the forest trust are interested in the land not owning a house so for stage 2 they are asking for no contribution from the council but the contribution in stage 1 gives the forest trust enough funding to be able to afford stage 2 just in terms of that water intake so there's the water intake there the water then goes into a pipe that goes all the way down to lure pill reservoir which is above Akkara and that is the main or supply for akaroa so I'll zoom in a little closer on this catchment now so you can get feeling for it there is some really steep land up at the top here and you can see how it is riddled with all these little rivulets of water that come down off the hill that creates three main streams there's one there's two there's three is for a Curragh the property is currently farmed and what that means is that it's grazed with sheep so there is fecal contamination of that water supply and it is ariel sprayed as well the farmer has been asked in the past by the council to fence all those little streams but as he's quite rightly said that is completely impossible to fence all those little streams going up look look at the terrain there you wouldn't put a fence up that but under this forest trust management the whole thing would become a bush reserve the grazing stock would be removed the perimeter would be fenced there would be no more spraying and bush regeneration would be the focus of the project so that's a really practical way to manage this catchment there is very strong local support for this project first of all these slides I must say making everyone awfully fat they're not that fat we have got a healthy yes he'll these are healthy people we have a very public-spirited vendor here Mr Graham curry who is offering this proposal is that it will be managed by Hugh Wilson and his team from henan I reserve the community board are strongly supporting this project the Royal Donald trust was so impressed when it came across our desk that the trust is putting in a twenty percent stake and doing the local work for them and the econ zone committee are putting in the money for the fencing so the catchment benefits will be in this the bush is going to come back rapidly because there's a lot of bush there to start with in the gullies as you've seen will have improved water quality without the grazing and the spraying will have much improved water retention as that block fills up with Bosch and water suppliers their huge problem in aqua for years reduce sedimentation and a greatly reduced risk of slips and waterway damage if this project guns ahead and the benefits to the council are being involved and by the way this image now shows you it sort of from just below the really steep bit so you're looking down towards a chiro and on the block and how will these little rivulet join up the water intakes about there you're talking about protecting a catchment asset that's worth well over a million dollars a forward to the council by the time the whole projects done would have a thirty percent stake you're talking about third-party managing it at no cost to the ratepayer and you're talking about if the council becomes involved in this project at having a stake in the management plan at this stage rather than being cut out of the story and there are wider benefits of this whole project as well agora has become the premier tourism town for Canterbury and its water supply is increasingly vulnerable as more people are going through that town but as well as protecting the catchment the reverse trust will open this block up for public access with walking tracks so we'll create increased recreational opportunities the childhood home of Franco forwards Lee the greatest export we have from agoura is up on that blocks of this historic interest and it will secure that beautiful landscape up behind I'll stop and open for questions thank you I realize you're not talking dollars this afternoon suqian for very good reason but of course for us to be able to consider this fully we need to know that dollar value so if you were able to supply that to us confidentially that would be great I can send out should I send out through the staff thank you very much yep that will be good and when is the like the it's obviously under contract at the moment when when of those figures able to be put in the public domain presumably when the contract goes unconditional or when the deals done yeah when the contract goes unconditional I think there wouldn't be a problem but at this stage really the project is waiting to see whether the council contribute to it or not and on the basis of that forest trust will have to decide you know whether they're going ahead and if so to what extent they are going ahead with the project when you're both courses of land or just one be fantastic thank you just on the the spraying affecting the water suppliers insignificant is it safe or is it treated and well the waters all treated as it comes into opera so we all assume as we drink it that it's perfectly safe and I'm sure that it is but the less contaminated the water is when it comes in the less treatment obviously it's going to require fire right okay thank you much you can just stay there now if you like I can just stay there I nightlight you go on to the rob a rep as Muslims Association yeah okay sorry y'all_''_593.99 will get this other presentation up for me cuz I don't know where you put it on your computer so the second presentation I'm doing I I have to change hats now and represent the robinsons bay residents and it's that one ratepayers Association and I'm also speaking to that and I'm also speaking to my own personal submission thank you very much now I've got great support here from robinson's they see aren't enough chairs need my neighbors from Robinson's Bay great community all here to support this mission so wonderful to have everyone here again if we have the lights down we've got some lovely slides of Robinson's they here so first of all just to remind everyone where Robinson's Bay is it's in the akaroa harbour between devotion and akaroa and as you come out from christchurch to occur oh you get this beautiful view of the robinsons bay wharf in the bay now this off is a strategic strategic recreational asset for the whole area before it was closed it was used for swimming fishing boating and extensively used by residents and visitors alike it was built and it has been maintained by the community the current structure dates from 1914 and was built by Robinsons they resident Jim Hayward it at the early stages was used to import and export goods by sea from the wharf and who knows we may need another access into Robinson's day in the future especially given the state of highway 75 after the recent lot access into our remote community back in the old days there was a tramway that went along the wharf the tram lines are still there now a much more recent times the wharf has been repaired by the local residents and working be in 2004 after years of council but we can save a experience of the council not your counsel neglect and at that time it was raised to a higher standard than it had been previously but the interesting thing is before that it wasn't closed when it needed repairs we could all still use it even though it needed an upgrade but generations of children have learnt to swim off this Wharf in Robinson's Bay it's the best place for swimming it's our swimming pool the beach areas are mud flats they're pretty icky and to make the worst they've got sharp stones in them so you don't want to be walking out into the water and Robinson's Bay across the beach and the wharf has been popular with kids of all ages kids learning to swim teenagers jumping here's the sorry sight since december two thousand eleven this horrible gates put across it and it's closed and we're not allowed to use it anymore and the reason is because a for kilopascals of pressure standard as being applied to that Wharf what that means is 400 kilograms per square meter of pressure that's for huge people per square meter or five and a half of me the average New Zealand woman per square meter of that Wharf so what we've got is a vehicular standard being applied to a pedestrian structure and it's an example of stupid safety now that's a term that's been coined I think by the cycling fraternity and cyclist myself I am sure that the life risk I was exposed to today in riding my bike across Christchurch to come here and meet my submission is much higher than walking out on that Wharf in its present condition the barrier is ineffective to the determined this P these pictures are taken from a video that Sue love it found on the internet of some young tourists but it is preventing other people from using it my family don't swim here anymore so we're cutting out families with children who used to swim down there and kids who learn to swim there and we're cutting out the elderly this is an old Robinson's Bay identity Jessie mold enjoying herself out on the wharf in 2007 it was her uncle that had built this fourth in the first place elderly people like Jesse can't_``_857.709 go there anymore we had elderly visitors from the UK this summer we couldn't take them swimming off the wharf it was really sad so that's who's being precluded from using the wharf but we think there are plenty of solutions to this problem first of all apply a meaningful safety standard for pedestrian usage to this structure and then reassess what work is actually necessary and in the meantime reopen the wharf with a usage limit sign here's one that's taken from the war for little uh calor I've just done popped it on our Wharf instead Motor Vehicles prohibited so that up this is the sign that's used on all the bridges and things that dock have on their remote bridges out in the bush maximum load so many people so you know we could have maximum load 20 people and that would be fine we don't need to have a rave out there on Robbie's news bay wharf and if more significant work is needed then we want you to empower and involve the local community the communities you are willing to fundraise and to volunteer once again I personally am perfectly willing to put in a substantial financial donation towards the repair of this facility on my backyard and in my personal opinion and part of my personal submission I believe that you should reallocate the fund that you currently have allocated to the robinsons bait reserve project here and defer the reserve project which is to put interpretation into a small reserve in Robinson's Bay down the track now a lot of money has been spent on the reserve in Robinson's Bay there's a walking track been put in but there isn reserve exists but in these brochures that the Robins the road don't trust just handed out to you the Robinsons be reserved for the first time is on the map and it is public information that it exists now and there's a whole panel giving the story of Robinson's pay in these brochures I think you should just put a track counter on the gate and see how much that reserve is actually being used and in the meantime put the money into this structure which we know is very well used and loved by the public so thank you all again for listening to me for two submissions now and I'm happy to take any questions thank you and have you got a question of it question but I have got a I'm speaking on also on behalf of the Robinson ratepayers Association and on behalf of the Robinsons Bay domain reserve I'm Peppa Foley resident of Robinson's Bay I understand MizukI's coming from but the Robinsons made the main committee are really excited with the way that the council have're absolutely thrilled Robinson's Bay is a little section and I can see it being used there are a lot of schools that come over to occur are you know on social studies trips a lot that he used and tachometer and if Robinson's Bay is a little teaching domain as the council have put out with first of all the bush then the farming and the coxford and back again now to conservation it just will be a wonderful thing so I just want to make sure that that last part of Sookie's I no argument here no I'm not even know we could do the same thing about hey quarter or eighth or tenth of the price and put the money into the reserve into the off sorry I did and given the given the last comment it's likely to be a contentious one I'll ask the questions anyway how many dollars are we talking about transferring from the reserve management fund to the wharf to do the work is it supported by the reserve management committee in principle or is that more important question does the community have the capacity to do the work that's required on the wharf like if the funding is found whether it's from the reserve budget or whether it's from elsewhere can the community have you have you got the capacity within the community to do that work well the amount of money first of all it's over two years it's this year and next year 30,000 I think was already spent on the reserve this year so there's about 60 odd thousand in the budget over the next two years to do put into a petition signage in and then to create a bus park in Robinson's pay in terms of do we have the capacity to actually manage during the project well we did it last time I don't think we've actually been given the engineering reports or anything like that but I think we're perfectly capable of hiring subcontractors to get on with the work if we needed to do it the Robinsons made main board will accept that they possibly could pay they want to share the money I can assure you I did a ring run before I came and there's quite a few that want the domain because they feel the community will raise the money for the wolf the wolf is so popular that they feel the community will come to the party with a quite a bit of funding great so what we're hearing is there's a willingness with for the reserves management committee that the domain board to work with the community in repairing the wharf which is fantastic and there's certainly a willingness on the part of the community to do everything there cancer to get the wharf up and running I do have one other question if I may you you've obviously had some contact with the community board on this are you willing to work with the community board to sir to progress the the restoration of the wolf project well I should have said at the beginning actually apologies for Lee Robinson who's been the chair of this and who's been driving the robinsons bay wharf at all why would we not want to work with the community board we'd love to work with the community board yeah and that's also great I mean the community board could actually be a vehicle for getting this moving so excellent thank you and thank you very very much indeed and thank you for the whole problem since both coming over to test it lovely see you and
Frank five minutes is that your understanding yes cool okay thank you we're in your hands okay I've been retired as an economist for about six or seven years by sort of a few clients and one of them is Environment Canterbury and last year I undertook a quite a comprehensive review of their funding and rating policies and lepers so I'm quite familiar with rates and the local government act requirements what concerns me is you're very low level of uniform annual general charge or you a GC this is about 118 dollars for every property now the annual plan states that the purpose of the you a GC is to recognize the costs associated with each property that is uniformly consumed by the inhabitants and inhabitants of Christchurch in fact it does no such thing the annual plan states that the you a GC is based on calculations but is not based on the calculations of the cost of any activity but is based on what an assist as being reasonable now this puts the cat before the horse the LGA requires councils to matters and only then to assess and if necessary modify that outcome of this allocation of costs now my submission is that you should shoot you should do what the LGA requires you to do you should identify suitable candidates value agc funding and I've submitted their three programs of work that I think should be you a GC funded and the details and the benefits that I've set out and most efficient and such a you a GC would be about three hundred fifty dollars it's still only about six percent of rates revenue and this is well below the thirty percent that the government prescribes as the sort of maximum that would be reasonable for you tulare but I know some councils actually set the UAG see as being thirty percent of race revenue and generally the Christchurch you a GC is quite low relative to other council from the around the country now the second issue is the inconsistent application of flex charges for the council services for households now there's a compulsory fixed charge for waste management and this is in the this is a good use of effects target of rate however the same logic is not applied to water supply or for sewage collection but it should be ask yourselves what has the capital value of a property got to do with how much water is used or how much liquid waste is produced and is it fair that the burden of paying for these services is not shared equally by service households and I think the way that the rates are structured means that rates are becoming an intolerable burden on people who happen to live in the more expensive areas and by way of illustration and I said in my submission I paid a thousand dollars but in fact I pay six hundred dollars a year the last each year for the last three years the water supply and sewage collection services that we haven't even used because of my Houseman uninhabited and rule it is uninhabitable because the earthquakes and the new and new annual plan'll increases to seven hundred dollars a year and we when we rebuild will be paying about fourteen hundred a then now now I I worked out in my expenditure on various goods and services for the last year to March 2014 and now we don't own any rentals that would inflate the cost but even so local authority rates was still our biggest expense item at about 6,200 they would have been 7200 that the main dwelling had it been abital and when I rebuild because I'm going to spend the insurance money I'd expect to have to pay 10,000 a year in local authority rates and by way of comparison my vehicle costs are about five and a half thousand insurance was about 3,000 my groceries were about 5,400 medical optical and dentistry cost me about 4,700 how I was two and a half thousand phone and internet was 1200 we donated 2,800 to charity I haven't calculated or included travel recreational entertainment expenses or probably the biggest cost actually as central government taxation so I think that's just the way you structured your rates is going to make it quite intolerable for a lot of people particularly with the way rates are bill of of interest charges on infrastructure thanks for your submission I just wonder though if you re advocating that the uniform Annual General charge be increased yes answer yes so what I was going to ask you really dinners and in terms of for example you said it'd be intolerable for people to pay what would probably happen to though is if he repaid what he paid a higher annual general charge people on lowest incomes or lowest value properties and effect will be paying more so into hell with if it was intolerable for people to pay how would you suggest that they would pass well it is very low at the moment they get the government center set a limit of 30 percent in your you're well below that so yeah obviously I can afford to pay the 10 grand or whatever I'll be paying rates but I I just point out there's a big a big cost and a lot of I know a lot of elderly people who don't want to move out of their homes and the end and ones that are going to be subsidizing everyone else particularly through the fixed charges as well as the unifying of general church
Good afternoon firstly I speak on behalf of the terminal residents association where we are your southern entrance to the city we don't ask for a great amount but we just like a few things like everyone in fact we had an annual plan meeting on Monday evening and one of the things that their annual plan meeting was we would hate to be city councillors at this point in time with the what's with what's in front of you but one of the things which we wish to submit honors the counsel fees and charges it was with some shock that we saw that timberland community center the charges were going to go up forty-three percent now that's a little bit on the horrendous side any shape or form especially when last year the Consumer Price Index up to December was 1.63 we don't have a bleat about about a rate type increase for the community center but we as a residence group have put hundreds of thousands of dollars into our own community center including selling our land and our old community center our own community center and the rest of the money that sort of window do was money which and this is going back somewhat because some of you people may well not know haverhill County as it was in those days before amalgamation set aside two hundred and fifty thousand dollars which in in over the period of time we end up to about six hundred and some things they haven't bolas which also went into the center along was closed on half a million which we had raised so we do feel that this is a bit of a a bit of a kick in the teeth to even suggest a forty three percent increase under any circumstances so that's that's that piece right roads and footpaths I'll make this as as quick as possible like everyone in Christchurch we have roading problems and and in footpath problems and what have you all we are asking for is maintenance we're not masking for new raids or anything of that of that style and we've just like to upgrade some of a footpath in Public Safety for for people using the footpaths we have requested in the past Christ HD where consider one link of a footpath from waterloo road to baddest road and Kirk road now there are no footpaths for instance on the on the main south highway and we would never even ask her anything along those lines we'd have no no show in hell of getting them but between kerkrade and barton road for more than 10 years to my memory we have been asking for a footpath come and and of course everyone's talking cycleways so if it was going to be a footpath because the timberlands sort of split because there's an area in which is temple isn't them where there are shops and for heavy and garage and those sort of things but basically people have to walk along waterloo road now for those of you who may or may not know there is huge development going on for instance where the islington freezing works used to be which is on waterloo road vehicles go down to go pound road to head north a push it and another one by hand it's pretty damn difficult going along those roads nowadays we have the same problem on jones road which is going out towards rolleston so the flow of traffic has increased greatly over the years and we just feel that some good intention needs to be put towards looking at something safe like that in recreation and what have you we are fairly well supported in fact because we've got we have got netball courts and what have you along with our community center but we would like to see a certain amount of goodwill from the council in in sort of doing these paths and and walkways in the area elect a faith the two of them timberland swim pool now that's the only swimming pool within cooee of the Templeton other than if you want to go to Rolleston or come into foreign area or something of that of that nature but we have a very neat little community pool which is well serviced and well looked after I might add by the council but we'd like we haven't had the greatest summers I might say but overall you would like to see them the swimming pool hours extended from what we currently have and we think that's a reasonable ask and it's well supported and people of course come from to lead role because there's nothing in the whole new region but they come to our pool and we don't really have the great problems with with people there with graffiti or any of those sort of things so so we've pretty darn lucky to be in it to be in the region right now the lacquered I say this a bit with Italian cheek lack of service in the southwest area currently to pay rates you've either got to come into the ricotta or come in here as I did not so long ago because the person in the video shop at hornby said are we don't take those now whether it was a new person or not I don't know but it's not a very good idea when we had a perfectly good place would be couple of years or so before this anything we also know that there's quite a lot of money being spent in the halls elyria but we most certainly would see even a temporary building of some description in the Greek immigrant community area I don't that you've got to go into right into by Westfield into the center there which is only a small place but we don't get to be able to talk two faces belonging to counsel whether the council workers or what have you which we did have we had the privilege of being able to do that some years ago now we feel as they would be shut out and we don't think that's a big ask we know that we certainly know that finances are tight that but the ability to support the ratepayer who after all is the one of great concern here but we'd just like to see something rather than about 20 17 being in our area which is quite a haul Dwight yeah I do hope to still be around the inverter now of course this is right at the forefront of all your minds we had a quite a storm water system put in at railway terrace in Tim Burton some years ago it doesn't seem to have filled the bill because right from now even a small amount of rain from and and I suppose I'm talking over you hit to an agreement has wrote from well right way terrace up to re y street it says my holy street in here but right up to rely street even a small amount of rain the drains block up there those old type dish strange we're not asking to get them redone there's only one area which would be quite nice to be redone and that's in front of the chemist and the and the doctors and whatever and the bus stop currently in that area the bus has to stop out in the road to allow passengers to get off and the chemist normally puts out a few cones you know the orange cranes puts out a few consoles nobody comes out and drops their't think that's too big of an ask because when the Buster I don't know whether the bus drivers moan about it but that the passengers have to get up and walk through the water now I took a walk along those I don't know exactly what the corner a little little bridges there were 22 metres of bridges between the the chemists and the hairdresser and what have you so that's quite a lot whereas if that piece of dish drain was done away with it would eliminate quite a bit of that I would see sorry I'm just agree with that if you want any questions at all you're going to run out of time okay won't take you long since you threw okay okay unless somebody wants to very quickly unless somebody horse kappa fee from underneath me no they wouldn't it with regards to you mentioned about the the drains etc and that was just put on a wallet or some time ago it would that the reason why it's not working would that be possibly related think so no just as long before the earthquakes okay long before the earthquakes oh that's a shame everything can be put down to this quake damage yep so now it's a very direct question here's a swimming pool yes when does the swimming season end now and what do you want as you do we would like to extend it into februari toward the interfering I haven't got those exact dates in front of me I'm very sorry you've sort of caught me on the hotly yep but to the end of February's what you're looking for here toward the my favorite thank you yep yep and just in relation to the community center and you said forty three percent was a bit steep what did you think was okay I thought well I think I said the rate increase ah ah it might be higher now that the reason it came as a bit of a shock is that I'm saying that when you see forty three percent increase and you've put all your effort into the into the Rangers but we pay for all of it as we got the point yeah Jimmy Jimmy yes they cost in Holmby the video shop in moment you know yep they have received the kind of the Reed by Jake hey Seto and but you mention earlier no star being aired cannot answer in or any kind of question cannot answer question yeah right how gender you you thought a need to pay for kind of a temporary walk-in service center before the permanent has been the radius yeah yeah yeah we understand we understand the delay and what heavy but we would like it's as you model are they all know it's better to talk to somebody who belies the counter not somebody who flicks out a video there that's that's great you thought not can do that's not conducive to the right buyer okay thank you very much okay
These Susan from the ground up there Susan we've only got five minutes for what I'm for you is that okay with you five minutes okay awesome yep yep absolutely thank you so make yourself at home and let us know anything you want the emergence of Christ Church has an interesting new thing it's something you know it would be one thing to get rebuilt but it would be something really cool if we could make that rebuild really something new and different and mostly in the sustainable direction so I thought I would share with you the results of one of these endeavors the an opportunity that we've identified and what it means is okay a little bit more work for the council but what we think is needed is you'll see a line here that's quite green and that is a zone for urban diversity if you look at the city plan it's got the what really is a pretty good long-term view of the city as a collection of integrated urban areas with suburbs between open spaces all of what does that density look like so in those areas we really are talking about conversion from classic in our old suburb to something new and the way to do that the easiest is the first line you see there which is the back law infill just Chuck another house on it and what our assessment was was that we built a model of the investment the returns the housing the quality of housing the quality of amenities the number of jobs the number of increase or the amount of increased disposable income basically we built a model of each one of the options that you might have how much money would be made how much money would be generated in the local economy and then the longevity of that with a hundred year view the the potential to continue to generate economic activity over that time and so if you just fill in backlot so you don't get very you don't actually get any new amenities you get more traffic etc you do get some new housing and infill housing where we take away the old house new houses but you don't get any new amenities you get a lot of traffic can you don't get a better neighborhood and you don't really actually get that transport oriented development that sort of makes that future city work so as you keep moving while low rise apartments well there you have not made the best use of the land if you want to sort of segregate students that works if you want to segregate old folks that works but you don't get any new community amenity you get a few new jobs and the people who built it make some money that's all right but if you look at that urban diversity now here we're talking about what we call a high street so it's actually mixed and that's where our submission is that we think there's a new zone that needs to be considered and we've done a lot of work on the numbers of how that zone works and the profitability and the economic activity generation and the fact that what you've done is you living but you have multiplied the benefits so much that it's actually become something that's highly attractive it's a place people go who don't even live there you know it's a high street now and that sort of thing is how you get that city to work you have those things in those places and so that would take a whole big work through of what's allowed for that you know the height the sign all that stuff but but you know if that needs to exist that's what needs to evolve there and so it is a bit of work to get done and we're working on I think what's really the hard end of it which is the action research with the people who are now in that classic suburb situation where the student slums have started to take over and it's a you know but it boys it in a nice place and how do we let them or how do we facilitate them to create a community driven development to turn their place into this new piece of work and for us we're really starting to move out of theoretical and model into you know really working with developers and designers and the community members and the neighbors and the University and students and tenants and etc like that and investors but it's working out pretty well so we thought we would let you know that that's a huge opportunity to actually have that figured out what's going to be allowed there because the developers say that is so the way we want to do things because you get economies scale site management you know the design is so much cheaper materials are so much cheaper it we really need to look into this so we're willing to help out on that as possible thank you so much um have you been talking to Alex Hanlon at the Canterbury University know you're at Canterbury and about the dovetail campus at all yeah and is there any traction for this style of thing this high street urban development wouldn't be appropriate right there it needs to be connected up to be within walking that mean that is what they're walking distance but it's just not right over the right place these things are really specific to place the fact that they come back okay thank you very much Ellie then pool no we're out of time just looking at the columns this is really excited that this kind of energy and innovation that we need we're going to look at the infill housing in the wealth the only real negative and there seems to be that issue about no buns owns the amenity and so forth for the community would neden fill housing be a better option if you could put requirements in such as input for neighbors close to transport green space provided I'm just wondering what sort of things you could adjust within these columns that would not necessarily rule out the options that you've presented um I think I would say they're actually in the developments that we're looking at if you look at that high street development the way that it interfaces with the living one is through a master plan not sort of just oh I'm going to sell off this old house and put in a row oh this one put in a row that's how you get sort of the motley crew of two to come with a neighbor that's going to be okay thanks how big an area do you need um ok there we we go with the research from overseas and that's about a kilometer of a street because it's a very comfortable walk where you can hit all the shops and restaurants in one go and probably with a cross section you know so there's sort of a center area so we have actually mapped out one that we've cost it up and got if you want to see that I can send you some more stuff oh I was just interested in the developers comment so they're quite into it because pre-earthquake some of the Bellas I spoke to didn't like putting apartments and their buildings guy said it didn't actually work didn't stack up financially so this really or some more forward Thank You tamela's because I think this is I think it's where you put the apartment if you stick an apartment in the middle of a suburb then there's no reason to live there other than that you're desperate for a house but if the apartment is in a place where it's about living there that's cool then building the apartment isn't the problem getting the consent for in a random place probably should be but if it's part of part of a place that is that that's a place where people live over bakeries and you know a high street then the actual building of it isn't the problem and I should say the developers refer to me as the ice breaker that they can't go there but they can go behind us because we figure out the stuff that needs to be figured out first thank you um so this seems really similar to the breathe proposal that we've spent too I think about two and a half years doing so what's to find out why that's not happening this is how this would absolutely and I would say we know why the brief people have been in you know with us from the beginning and what we started with why it's called from the ground up is because we started with the city and we started with the city in transition for a hundred years and how it all works and from that you find where these things need to be and one of them needs to be at the university the university does not have a college town associated with it and it needs that it needs walking distance walking distance for you know 5,000 people to be in a urban area so that's one area there's other areas where they need to be and the brief competition probably wasn't in that spot so that's that's one of the things now it probably you know you've got the whole central city area that if you look at the next column over the high-density high-rises of course that fits in the central the work of getting it worked in because it wasn't there before but it's all about things being in the right place and mostly for us that's the transport and the metabolism of the city making sure that that all works um if you look at dunedin as an example would it be the best example to look at and say New Zealand because you go the in its vibrant its seems we're close to the city center and the university in between you've got old houses you've got two storey apartments etcetera etcetera and would that be the example that we should be following lots of examples yep absolutely in Dunedin is a good one it is in a form that evolved into before sort of the sprawling car era and that's why it works why it's vibrant so to recreate that now we have to be very careful about where we put things because they're going to be the definition of that transition and and how things grow over over time starting on the housing living model but for so kind of an epic one if it to innovation hub there is that's sort of what I'm seeing our the rest of the work this is the result of the work the rest of the work started with like I said the whole city the the people all the activities the ability for those things to intermingle and connect and and just looking at that over a hundred year time frame and you know the energy the materials of water the environment how that all moves around and how it connects with the planes and the rest of the country in the rest of the world and so this is sort of what we come to that everything works best when it's actually in the right place and and for the right purpose like duh never mind thank you for this we've been having some good healthy debates over social housing and typography and all the risks so what are some of the trends you're seeing in the way that social housing now fits in the landscape or the other way around and you here the way that we've costed it out I think the best thing is to have housing that people on a on a really you know tight income can afford as opposed to sort of segregating I mean I know you need that fallback position for people are handicapped or who really have a problem but again diversity seems to work a lot better than sort of over there over there over there fair enough taken more time thank you very much indeed sorry it was fantastic um and thank you for the work that you're doing on it where I don't know how this Linton clean does this come through your committee regularly bleeding now that I've got my mouth empty does this come through your committee so that we're kind of getting this or does it go through planning I guess he's pretty and planning it may be a good place to start it's just it's the right if such an awesome resource saying I don't want it just wears a joint committee walking out the door anyway we so much Susan
Little one and cycleways which we have a lot of and but totally feel free to say whatever you want to on that and then another one from the Victoria neighborhood do you want to run them together or haven't seen it all I'll do them separately they're quite similar but it'll do the Praetorian separately ok thank you we're on Monta I live in the inner city on grace-filled Avenue and my submission has to do with the proposed delay in the implementing implementation of psycho ways work and I just want to applaud the the plan that was previously presented my reasons for opposing the extension of time and a cycleways program from five to eight years include one there have been several serious and fatal accidents involving vehicular traffic and cyclists and christchurch recently with constant road construction consequent traffic delays and Driver impatient already at high levels a lack of designated safe cycleways forces cyclists to complete compete with motorized vehicles for their share of the road and very unsafe circumstances to clearly marked in well-planned cycleways would increase cycling safety of biking resulting spin-offs would be fewer cars on the road reduced traffic jams greater public acceptance of cycling as a legitimate form of transportation three support for the immediate introduction of cycleways program has widespread popular appeal it is not just an idea being pushed by a small group with a vested interest for example a cycleways idea was widely supported in this year an idea campaign and a hag me fera me board is on record as opposing the delay for sustainability was a word that was frequently used in the early days of planning for the rebuild it has seldom heard anymore and delaying the implementation of the cycleways program could signal the council's lack of commitment to a cleaner greener eco-friendly city five in the rebuild the cost of implementing the cycleways program is very modest indeed it would be money well spent and the positive effects would be felt by all segments of the population cyclists and non cyclists implementing a cycleway system as soon as possible would result in a broad range of cost effective outcomes less wear and tear on the road in cities and suburbs reduce commuting time for both cyclists and non cyclists that is all traffic participants benefit unless they are annoyed poise pollution reduce stress on commuters lower impact on the environment more business for shops and cyclists visit shops more often than drivers and it is easier to combine cycling with other forms of public transportation not so easy to do with cars and other forms of transport in conclusion I request at the original time frame for the implementation of the cycleway program be reinstated oh that's good to hear right yep sure the Victoria neighborhood is submission Association submission on the part of that group Dave Kelly the Secretary was going to be presenting this today but he couldn't be here so I'm here instead to matters of want to comment on they want to comment on we want to comment on cycleways and the hospitality new zealand's request for counsel money for more security staff first the Victoria neighborhood group is existence and existed since 1985 and works to support residential amenity in the area bounded by be liev park members at present the VNA discussed the draft annual plan at our regular meeting on the thirty-first of march and we oppose the extension of time on major cycleways program from five to eight years number one some of the actions required are obvious and can be initiated very quickly for example the matata Street cycleway was built some years ago but the required crossing of Dean's avenue near Christ routes girls high was never constructed leaving the cycleway stranded that crossing would be an obvious he early action and there are a number of others some of the draft cycle routes have already been in planning for years sometimes literally for decades too it is important as the rebuild gathers pace to send long-term planning signals that this council is committed to cycle ways that will help people decide where they want to live rebuild etc with knowledge that of what transport options will be available the risk is that any delay looks like the current council starting to slide on the commitment of the previous council to create these important cycleways 3 the total sum of money five years is about the cost of the roof for a covered Stadium for the earlier the detailed planning gets underway the more opportunity there is to incorporate psycho ways around rebuilds both for road construction which is proceeding apace now and for land acquisition four paths before buildings are replaced five a greener city generally in better cycleways specifically were among the top two or three most repeated messages messages of the Sharon idea campaign the VNA has always championed walking cycling and public transport is important for making the inner city more accessible and more pleasant to live in we therefore request that the original timeframe of five years be reinstated be the next topic hospitality New Zealand's request for counsel funding three hundred and twelve thousand dollars over five years for extra security staff to help control bar patrons is outrageous one unlike cycleways funding which will benefit everyone whether they cycle or not this request is another example of the private sector asking for money to clean up the late-night mess their businesses make in the area to the draft la p recommends a1 a.m. and such a densely populated residential area is inappropriate bar owners when seeking liquor licenses for new bars in the area repeatedly denied there were problems for surrounding residents due to 3am closing however it is now clear that the request for extra security is an admission that there are major problems and ones no want the council to pay for I urge you to reject that application thank you
Um okay Gary and Sookie welcome I do feel intimidated do need to stop talking to Gary or anything okay you started your career talking to me so I was telling me off I could remind you of a past madam mayor we we used to have a counselor that used to annoy the hell out of Vicky by calling on the meta mayor right dish that's a bloody musical vacuum cleaner thank you very much thank you for having us here today and we thought what we do and I just go like there I think what we thought we'd do is the the rod Donald trust as a council controlled organization that came out of funds which came from the old banks peninsula Council they were ring-fenced and put into the trust into an environmental trust which I'm privileged to cheer and councillor tuna is the council representative on the trust we base a lot of air right work on the City Council open space strategy but if you haven't read it as a superb document and also the writings of Harry L which from the sunshine leak because the youth first youth hostel association in New Zealand was on banks peninsula and so those are that's the basis of what we our basic k pepper and the we have just produced and you've got for the first time recently published the trust has done a comprehensive inventory and maps of banks peninsula we've made them available to the public the visitor center sold out of the books immediately so we're in second print the tracks are beautiful but they have been underfunded and banks furniture is a poor cousin compared with other areas so our submission this afternoon is about supporting a green rebuild of Christchurch and I will go through each of these in 10 we believe that it is important to reinstate the Lyttelton head-to-head funding I think the funding was taken out of development contribution levies I think it does worthwhile checking that the trust is committed to making sure that it is a reality we are working with different communities around the peninsula around the head to head to actually get them involved in engaged allocated were 300,000 and the planning for these funds was completed and would be used to bring existing track sections up to a respectable standard starting at littleton working around our second point which we wish to cover as the Little River Rail Trail to city connectivity and our submission to the three-year plan we applauded the council's bold move and initiatives for more active transport and recreation and the Little River Rail Trail is the longest cycle way that Christ Church has it's a strategic asset and a recreational gateway to the peninsula key area for banks peninsula is to get the Little River Rail Trail properly connected to the city cycleway network one of the things that we also want to do is to see how we can highlight Little River and have a number of routes going out of Little River for cycles tramping etc and we we will come and talk to you about some of our investments that we're making including some hats we're about to build hats on the route on the trail um we the we think it's cycle so connect that and planning and the counselors plans to connect into the trail via the southern motorway but we also seek combination of op off-road and quiet road access from hallsville this will enable people from the port hills eastern and central areas of christchurch to access the trail safely on their bikes we suggest an off-road cycleway connects the halls world a city cycle way as far as the old totaku road from here site as and you will know that it gets quite dangerous with the cycles and cars out that part of the town particularly in the weekend from here so from here cyclists could travel on the quiet rural road and join the cycle trail at totaku encouraging people to cycle from their homes and christchurch to would will assist with development and Little River as people are more likely to stay overnight one of the things that we really want to emphasize as we as a city have an amazing regional packs team and we work closely with them and they are very stretched and we would like as the walking has developed council's strategy that I referred to earlier on council staff have played an active role with our trust and thus their budget for the year was cut by a million with a feather 600,000 cap proposed for the coming year and this will stop progress and tracks and will impact on track maintenance which is already minimal outside the city limits the port hills rather banks furniture is the city limits we want to also support to the project to protect the icarus catchment the New Zealand native forest restoration trusts are a predominantly north ireland group their interest in this area brings a major injection of external cash and enthusiasm and they have just purchased a piece of land the project has strong local support and the trust our trust has committed to twenty percent state the project would create a huge new reserve above a car or protecting the entire main water catchment and the City Council are being asked to contribute forty percent of the first stage I believe these funds have been put aside already and so we're just saying this is an important and important projects to banks peninsula they provide recreational benefits to the entire city population and what we are really saying is that as peak oil hits us banks peninsula will become increasingly important as the recreational area for Christchurch it will be the recreational area of Christchurch and so we think it's important and our role is to actually identify the tracks open up as many of them as we can work on hats and and affordable camping grounds and those are all the things which will come and tell you about at a later time when you have more time but am our argument as banks peninsula is the stadium so we believe it's time to rethink think big projects we believe that with this sum of one point something million that we've talked about this peninsula could become the stadium for Christchurch if we think about it properly and it will involve more people than go to a rugby game and so this is a environmental it's green it's recreational and it's close to town and at close to the main trust the council should embrace so thank you very much ask you one question regarding to the cycleway the route you mentioned earlier like a little reward the cycleway from the city to little river where the holes where is kind of sexy but my understanding the popular council original plan is from city parcel a home Petula Little River psycho wait so imagine is from home p collection scalar to the soldiers that easily yes so I think what we're saying there is great connect it through from one be but not everybody lives in jambe lots of people live in kashmir brighton and so on so we want to have two funnels coming it's a link so that both sides of the city are connected might be a leading question but what you're basically saying is that we need as a council to think about the future of the city and anything we can do to invest and to our hill areas would it be a you know venture parks stadium like walks through our Air Arm Bay Area's will be really important for the natural stadium for Christchurch and when we when the trust was started the basic agenda of the council was to have banks peninsula linked right through the peninsula with walkways and affordable camping grounds now the council owns land on the peninsula we're trying to actually find where those places are because many affordable camping grounds in New Zealand have been subdivided and people don't have access to good see places so yes the answer is one issue though is no we drive out of Christchurch and to sell one and then back under and to which as bankers is part of Christchurch City counts so we actually crossed boundaries through some of that area how do you suppose do you think we need to have a closer link with Selim oh yes I willis you should be but I must say that as I drive from tai tapu to Little River I actually don't think a lot about the fact that I'm crossing through Selwyn but it has an impact on me good very much indeed guys that's great thank you we will you are you appearing tomorrow as well ok thank you Gary thank you see above maintain so thanks Bob and we've got two from you the first one
Thank you well firstly an apology I'm not Graham Bell withing I'm Steven Taylor and Graham is unfortunately unable to be here but I'm the treasurer of the tramway Historical Society and I'll be speaking to our submission I don't know whether it's a positive or a negative but I don't have a PowerPoint presentation for you and so I'm assuming that everybody has read the submission but I'm going to summarize a few points on it and then hopefully leave plenty of time for questions which are hopefully I'll be able to answer so Tremmel historical society and established about 50 years ago we run the pyramid tramway at at pyramid heritage park and run a base in urban public transport museum and out there and probably most relevant to this we restore tram vehicles that used to run in the South Island and we have supplied the jority of the trends to the current operator of the city tramway so we have a vested interest obviously in that operation and the trends are supplied through the Heritage tram from now we provided a submission to the three-year plan and last year am delighted that its use the society's views along with a number of other submitters we're expected on by the council at the time in terms of essentially getting the city tramway underway again obviously not the full loop that was previously in operation but it's a somewhat truncated version and we expect that in the fullness of time as work on particularly in our master it gets completed that the original loop will be completed but the further part of that submission was that the tramway could start operating through into the casual mall area using the first part of the planned extinction and our submission essentially is to continue along those lines essentially we don't see any capital in the budget for the current financial or coming financial year to continue that work so our submission is by basically in three parts that we continue to the council continues to support the work of the tramway operator and other organizations such as the skirts edu and so forth to facilitate the heritage loop that goes down our street which is which where it's currently blocked and also the first part of the extension inter casual mall and then back down high street and into the cathedral into the cathedral square around the back of the cathedral now most of the work in terms of track workers there's at about 50 meters that's missing and they would need to be a crossover put at the bottom of high street near the intersection of Manchester Street and obviously over here would need to come up the second part of our submission is that work needs to be done on completing the first stage of the extension which attracted most of the trackers in place except for where it comes out of poplar lane into term street and then on to the bottom of casual of high street and so basically completing that work getting that infrastructure in place obviously additional work would need to be done to put overhead and so forth in there as well and then the third part of the submission is to continue the work to of that work which is extending the tramway further down high street and into the polytek grounds in subsequent years and that work needs to obviously from our perspective be continued now we see that the extending the tram wave through its full loop and into casual motorcycles will continue the work that's been done to date with the tramway particularly extension into with the reopening of it into You Regent Street Cathedral junction and so forth of bringing together the various isolated currently isolated bits of retail and activity in the city to give the people access to those areas particularly people from outside the city who tend to be more likely the patrons of the city tramway as it currently stands and with the extension into cash or more and so forth link set together with the restart facilities and shopping precincts they're down to where the new tribe was it building on the corner of Litchfield and high street is that's just opening up there strangers yes it was on the tip of my tongue but obviously lost and then consent to extend down those various that currently at the moment currently isolated bits together and also allowing for organizations to give them some focus for redeveloping along that route of the tramway and bringing movement and color etc back into the city tramway then to the city via the use of tramway to facilitate transport so that's basically a summary there's a lot more detail in the proposal in the submission we put together and I'm happy to answer any questions on that or anything else hopefully they get related to the submission thanks for watching thank you for the work you do you guys have done some great work especially with the gondola and the patronage on that gondolas being dinner quite spectacular can you just tell me yeah I just put it up we're not the guy I know you're not the guy little bit you are there are some associations with okay with you the can you tell us how many patrons are currently using the train right in terms of the city tramway 30 tramway sorry I don't have those figures 2016 60,000 sorry just so you're aware in our book of submissions that of people who don't want to be heard but have written and these submissions there was a very substantial number on the tram I am aware that it anecdotally that like there are a number of submissions and we are and without having read all of those we are in generally in support of everything that those submitters say and I'm sure there is support of ours thank you um you're probably not aware that some of the submissions we fit earlier today I've actually talked about extending the tram into either edgware possibly looking at other roads have you guys done any work I mean obviously some out to some neural to ferry mode woolston would seem logical have you done any work around outside of the central city if we extended the tram whether logical place for it to go would be well I mean the general feeling about the society is we're very probe anything that's done with trends and obviously as anyone who's got some knowledge of tram routes that used to go out to some each where and in fact they were the start of most of the turret bus routes in terms of where they went so there's theoretically infrastructure or so forth that could be redeveloped along those routes to put the trainer's back in place we have not other than sort of an hour our wildest fantasies have not actually done any serious research in terms of actually doing those extensions but we would be quite happy to support them and it's not really where the society is in terms of being able to provide infrastructure expertise and so forth for doing that sort of work but we will be happy to support it and provide any background knowledge and history and so forth from that we can you can now you've got a steam operated transit oh that's right isn't it yeah we do yes it's a kid centurion it dates back to 1881 the only regular I've been the world still operating that's why sorry the only one of its type in actually come into town in about two thousand and three for a brief I think three circuits of the tramway but it's not something we would expect to occur on a regular basis yeah thank you we could and the the main issues as far as I'm aware in terms of doing that with the cost it's not a the transportation of tram Thea calls to and from the pyramid tramway is not a cheap item as far as I'm aware however is a tourist thing having the only operating steam tram in the world is pretty colas now yeah and there is a lot of anecdotal evidence from operators particularly of steam railways and so forth that having one steam vehicle available is not something that's able to be operated on a continual basis unique you actually need to have a fleet of such vehicles so while I'm not who pulling the idea of bringing it in on special occasions we would love to see that happen regular operation is not really feasible thank you very much indeed and thank you for stepping's very very good of you thank you and guys just in terms of the plot prop plane you now get a break until 3 15 yeah so there might be a cup of coffee up there I there is there is a cup of coffee anybody is very welcome to go and grab one if you get there first there will be one
That's next I'm cheer tiada koto we're just going to put up the graphics we're hoping to show a video actually a fly through but we'll see how that goes Cullen just so you're aware and you've got two submissions one on the perimeter walkway we're on the biodiversity partnership was wrong and we've allowed 10 minutes for each but that obviously includes the question time normally as well ok but I'm just-just aware that you can talk very well so I just want you to know good to advance ok so I'm colin work and I'm representing together with jeremy here and Stan and Eleanor and Dell behind me the the crisis criminal trial steering group this is a concept that has been around for a long time it's almost caught of a century actually and so most of you will have perhaps also seen the recent press articles which give you a pretty good idea what the whole concept is about you can see the first couple of pictures there show an overview of the sort of colored segments around that entire area will sort of have a look through that little bit later on so it's an important bringing together of nature and people and it's 130 kilometer walk way as a minimum but it can be expanded with many sort of side side trips and tricks along the way and there are many points of interest to be sort of picked up as one goes it very much sort of focuses on to the bite of those futures for New Zealand and for Canterbury and Christchurch but it covers many sort of aspects of geography and history as we go the I guess it's a little bit of right light relief hopefully for you today and that it's something is going to cost very little for the city but have enormous and huge benefits both socially health wise and economically so the basic facts there about 130 kilometers cycle friend reroute ops options mostly comprising existing pathways and that's important which means cheap runs on the board to boost tourism promoting us as an eco city the route all the sort of main natural and many cultural historical features importantly also and the City Council has already contributed a lot to this much of the scoping has already been done it's also already also been an award winner you see the picture there of the golden foot awards that we actually won because the thing is in fact been happening on the ground over about 12 15 years through the 2000s of course there are many sort of precedence for this kind of exercise overseas and the pennine way in England the London capital ring walkway which you can see covers a similar distance and similar kinds of concept in a way to what we're proposing here but also in New Zealand we know how the Otago rail trail has been an enormous boon to the Otago province and providing the sort of combination of Z of exercise and appreciation and tur pretation of the countryside in there are many sort of commercial opportunities which I've obviously very important of the future rebuild of the city but it does require perhaps a bit of a city in the past rebranding it as an eco city we see that along the way and it could be covered over a mini day walk especially sort of for some tourists will come to do maybe a whole week to get round the whole thing will utilize local accommodation bed and breakfast heavens cafe culture cycleways part of it being part of New Zealand cycleway for example and also the educational ramifications of that the pictures they're largely from Germany actually spray bold which again represents the sort of combination matron culture the this also fits within us at a wider eco-city context rebuilding the city is a multi-dimensional brand incorporating and reflecting and celebrating all of its history both natural and culture so we now I think going to try this video I think we can pretty much get it going just wow okay so here we are so it takes you through of course the existing crater rim walkways starting here the bridle path and the top of the gondola which is a substantive without to godly heads through Taylor's mistake come across Scarborough to through some wonderful opportunities therefore of course bed and breakfasts and tavern and cafe culture entering through to the mouth of the estuary around through Red Cliffs there and into the very rich bird life around the estuary and around the Pioneer walkway there in the historic theory media area Charles worth reserved again around the estuary past all of those a bird-like Bixley which is going to be a huge natural environment in the future the lower I even River the cocaine reserve up through some of the red zone to trevors wetland and then up through tomorrow Park to bata lake forest which is rich in orchids and ferns and other native wildlife across the high hill of the refuse station through Brooklyn's Spencerville mouth of the waimakariri River many different features along the other famous braided rivers their clear veil and sorry you wouldn't Queens coins here with clear water and McLane's Island which represents a very significant natural environment of Savannah woodlands coming through to the head of the haven River the Haven catchment down through the sort of very garden city sort record and Bush there obviously an icon through to addington and a whole lot of little side roots there and into the headwaters of the haircut river now the Wigram retention basin and then across the Great Divide to the hallsville catchment westlake all's well through to again a little bit of Suburbia are in parkland but the wonderful halls will reserve quarry reserve in back up onto the hills to the top of the crater rim walkway and back to the starting point looking of those wonderful vistas of the harbor and through of course to the rest of the city of banks peninsula so that gives you a bit of a sort of a flavor so we've achieved a lot of things already there's the over 150 on our mailing list for the walking events that have been running since the 1990s the press Facebook article quickly gathered well over 300 likes and 105 shares or many letters to the editor the support of it messages of support great deal of interest hundreds of people they're engaged in our facebook page public meetings press formed and importantly we've engaged with the number of potential sponsors already and they have allowed us to mention your names the rotor some of the Rotary clubs the addington Raceway is interested christchurch horticultural society to reflect the garden city sort of component and I can just add length here research is also keen to promote a kind of a Bible it's and the sort of opening event and the Ember we've been refining the track root we've got an Internet domain ready to go and got quotes for some of the specific costs of website and other members there so watch next importantly and that's where we come to the City Council we need yours and II cans re endorsement because bear in mind this has been around the traps a number of times already has already been votes for it from previous councils and even money proposed so it's really kind of a reinvigoration of something that had already been on the way we want to complete those sponsorship arrangements track mark and information panels publishing website track guides marketing contributing so that we don't have all our eggs in one basket as we've had in the past and importantly that November launch event a weekend communities joining together around the city at the finish junctions of each league walking relays and guided tours on each league with land care research involved in there and interest from the ultra marathon people and the bike-a-thon people how can the city make this happen well as I've said we need their formal endorsement of the christchurch trail by including this in the annual plan and budget importantly we need to have some staff time directed to providing the necessary in the A's on graphic design interpretation policy documentation and marketing of the project we've suggested some sort of budget items to help with the sort of code funding of the capital expenditure for signage and information boards and assist with liaison between the project TV can and other property owners to facilitate planning decisions as required so that's that's what we've come to inform you about and hopefully seek your support thank you thank you Ellie's to ask a day yeah now you go okay um would something like this lend itself to the discussion that we've been having about sort of fruit forests and fruit trees and things like that would that be yep it hopefully you can submit a flavor of the fact that it's very diverse it covers everything from sort of our best natural environments like wicked and Bush crabbers weapon the estuary braided River design but it also goes through suburbia and we pick ups community gardens like the one the wonderful one that's at the University of Canterbury and so it's to show and a showcase the whole richness of our city and make it really sort of vibrant and alive to not only its citizens but of course the visitors and people coming in and we think it would be a major attraction this event we're planning and of Ember we foresee could be an annual event actually all my ten fruit trees I'm just wondering at the top tier ground but the sticks are you tapping into the source to a sort of a side trip if you like or trust everything of a sort of component of eggs into it but to keep faithful to the notion of a perimeter it kind of covers the sea end of it because it crosses the mouth of the Styx River or comes along the mouth of the Styx River and but apart from there it leaves that to two other other promotion adequately they usually there's other trails in the city of course as yours on the south side of this of the sticks no it runs along the way McCreery River so it comes up through spencerville Brooklyn's Lagoon Auckland's then across the mouth of the Styx River and then onto the banks of the waimakariri river and runs right along the I will additionally be looking to promote nearby tracks and things as well as alternative ideas for people well while are enroute this and so we'd also combined with the coastal path why would you rather some part of any sort of mean that the coastal walkway it was of course party I don our whole pile of Christians on this because I think it's going to spark them how long does your next one need the biodiversity partnership does that need 10 minutes well I think you're pretty sure I'll try and start it down yeah right okay Andrew then Glenn and thanks for the presentation Colin I'll let me keep the question very very brief what we can do to help from from what you're asking is resources marketing collateral and funding is is there no track upgrading required to achieve this mean most of it is on existing walkways which I maintained I divided the city council board you can read and we are looking at the beginning arrangements with organizations like rotary who are interested in doing some sort of surveillance kind of maintenance something is obviously not hard maintenance on the other foot pads but in terms of a market marking and that kind of thing keeping the signage sort of in good shape I think he thinks colony looks like we've already got a stadium I think this would be tremendous do an event so do you think you know a multi-sport event I can see several disciplines in there would really give it a little earlier different dimensions to it one of them one of their working party one of their working party is an ultramarathon runner and he is driving some of the efforts towards having that sort of type of thing happening on our opening day just running is a long way I mean you've got a two-hour pedal you've got other things in the other piece is great yeah yeah a way of additional funding are you actually a registered charitable trust are you a registered charitable trust well yes or no we operate in under the umbrella of sailboat I've taken Christ you so we could exist there is sort of a son so you know we can use the bank now okay I'll just tell you an afternoon tea time another place that would be that's like so I'll just change my clothing here can we try to screw her yes oh I'll do that okay okay mmm I Bissell at the back there who's the coordinate of KCC who also you know has used the track and supports for the hundreds of families that exist in their group ok so the crisis by to visit partnership again this is another idea that's been around for some time but sort of been interrupted by various things it's another win win situation for the city it which needs more strings to its bow and and it kind of really provides a wider framework for things like the walkway so I will sort of you know I say I say there that I'm sort of representing the multitudes and I'll sort of explain it as I go along but there are you know we've we've helped public meetings with you know sixty or so people supporting us and making motions and support of it so representing all the major sort of conservation groups so here's the sort of main proposal which you've got hopefully Oh could you right sorry about that so you'll see there anyway you'll have a copy forum for nature conservation to screw interest groups in the region she has knowledge about unique and vulnerable biodiversity of the city supports the council importantly and implementing the biodiversity strategy through citizen science and having eyes and ears of the whole community available the fast track information exchanges about threats and opportunities for biodiversity and surveillance early warnings of biosecurity risks and importantly again I know it's all about money these days to save resources and time for the City Council and community who I'm afraid to say suffer submission fatigue instead of being engaged in the things that they really want to be doing on the ground and working and productive dialogue leading to shared outcomes so that sort of pretty much my key message there there's a lot to be done we're in the middle of a biodiversity crisis I'm not going to all of that I hope you'll trust the fact that you know I know a little bit about biodiversity and there are big issues there we're losing it we've got major pest problems the next page see that the Garden City image reflects all the layers of our heritage and that we transition to a more inclusive eco-city brand and that this is reflective of the partnership between Maori and Pakeha that can be symbolized in the landscape as well and of course importantly this provides for native wildlife when you have the right plant species present and so also a more ecologically based management of the green space in the city and reviewing some of the sort of policies which we think are not necessarily conducive to fulfilling the biodiversity strategy as it stands so of course there's lots of good news the travers wetland Trust has had a wonderful partnership with the city council so that's a good model there the waterway enhancement programs from the 90s has also left it's a wonderful legacy of course some people now want to get rid of it all in order clean up the rivers but we won't go into that right now crisis unbeknownst to most people both in the city and also beyond is actually very rich in natural environment and in our city as there are in our national parks we have many native birds because we're really the bellbird capital of New Zealand there's lots of interesting little creatures as well wonderful lizards and leaf veins slugs and wickers and what have you all of these things to be enhanced quite some quite rare plant species which need to be identified and protected and also to be brought maydel the wider public made aware of these things even our lawns have got little native herbs growing in them and I've already mentioned the important natural values out in Maclean's Islands been a bit neglected but it's some one of the rarest ecosystems in the country actually and it's been diminished all the time especially by pressures from dairying what can be done restoration regenerations right this very nature is able to respond if we give up a chance we can get sort of bare ground to forest the top left to the bottom right pictures there show a project that was started as a sesquicentennial project 1990 and you know within 15-20 years other native got quite a developed ecosystem there and many little plants are sort of popping up in places like an Ernie Clark preserved their masses of regeneration from some of the old native trees that were planted along with the English English parkin trees in the past past that one one of the important things about all of this is integrating people and nature rather than separating and polarizing them nature native species can exist right in the heart of the city we don't need to separate them all the time it's important as the you know the a van pro Jeter's even River precinct as being developed to sort of pick up on that theme of interwoven three edges of a rope representing the partnership between nature and culture and between the treaty partners symbolized in the sort of plant and vegetation and landscaping and as and when you have that and you have the wildlife coming then you have a better reconnection of people and nature all of this of course contributes to that sort of branding of the city as a important destination already done the Christchurch primitive walkway you know about that there's various so we'd tools that can contribute to this the nature watch online system for recording Natural History observations has already many observations that engages people and citizen science as part of those eyes and years and being able to report all kinds of both nature and also weed species and pest species know and alert city officers and managers to dealing with those things as required we could be much further ahead for this money if we had better more sensitive management systems here's a terrible case of you know trees being ring back and that's been a problem for the city for many years on end of Joe cotton saying reckon why Maori council days many plants very costly very expensive to the city are just being wasted by poor management we also need to get on top of weeds one year seeding seven years weeding we've got some serious problems you know there's the big sort of gun rubber things like Sycamore and all those things like that big tussock become a major problem down our rivers because we haven't really got on to it when people have actually wanted the council to do something about and nip it in the bud hmm the there's also various of design ecological principles so the point is the City Council I think you probably agree can't meet its international region city obligations on own in a particularly NS of a piecemeal way it's under enormous economic pressure we all know that and so but there's a very willing community out there wanting to help and pull pulling beside in it but that requires a dialogue in between the two so there is that expertise and eyes and ears out there it's costing money and biodiversity lives you know not to do this and some of you know the pest problems you know could become uncontrollable there's advice and suggestions and recommendations out there they need to be sort of picked up citizens have demonstrated they want more nature in their neighborhoods and I can quote the city citizens on surveys which show fifty-four percent people about 75% want more native birds in neighborhood lots of other surveys demonstrate the same thing tourists are becoming more discerning about authentic clean and green and Christchurch is long undersold its biodiversity brand so what we need is a formal arrangement between combined conservation groups and Christchurch and the council to establish a regular dialogue about matters of mutual interest the crisis biodiversity partnership should needs to have some sort of status as a consultative interested party to all environmental development conservation matters and of course to support officers and setting up a Christchurch biodiversity partnership and together to achieve the outcomes and the aspirations for the city's biodiversity strategy entity co-marketing thank you thank you fall on your only wait ten minutes overtime that's fantastic and Dave's look we hear from an earlier submitter in the tisket catchment about the problems with waterway enhancement and its ability waterways ability to quickly remove excess water and times of storm what's your response to that and any solution to the sort of diverse opinion that's starting to evolve between some quite nice waterway enhancement and well as you know it's pretty complex thing and the council of course is just embarked on us of a two week project dealing with one particular part of the city and we've heard those recommendations from certain quarters but I have to say you know it's an simplistic view of the world of course the original waterway enhancement was done with with modeling of the rivers and the flood levels and all that kind of thing years ago but of course then we dropped the ball to some extent the water when enhancement programs have stopped and that whole program kind of dissipated but the the sort of the broader answer the generic answer is that of course we need more than just engineers and people who see you know an immediate problem in their backyard involved in the conversation and of course my own expertise or my own discipline in ecology is is you know one of those disciplines that needs to be involved increasingly he rather than it being all in the hands of one kind of discipline so to kind of be able is that the only solution just to rip out all the vegetation again and set us back you know a couple of decades of tremendous benefit to the city in terms of habitat and environment and bird life and stuff so we need to find some other sort of solutions I know that's not a very sort of clear-cut but you know you've had a whole team you know dealing with this for a couple of weeks it requires you know a good measure um which happy to discuss at some future time
Yes just me thinking madam chair councillors good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to present beacon submission today how do I get the story up on the screen okay from our sub what I need to do Tracy yeah I was told of what one moment you carry on all well I wanted to introduce you to someone who's on the front page of it that's the difficulty but I really just want to focus on what principally on councils leadership role in determining housing outcomes and in particular bill beck smarter and the eco design advisor role okay so I'll talk without I was I my opening Peck just imagine there is a middle-aged couple sitting on a sofa and a warm dry 1930s home that has been repaired post-quake it is insulated in the walls under the floor and in the ceiling it has a really energy efficient heat pump but actually has a rainwater tank now and it has some other clever double glazed windows this was a house that was cold damp and basically unhealthy like a lot of the houses it's owned by chantal and Gregor and they're really chuffed that the post the quake repair they've now got a house that will last them for the rest of the life warm dry and healthy and and that's the kind of image I want you to have in your mind a little bit about what beacon pathway is we are not for profit our purpose is unashamedly to transform new zealand's homes and neighborhoods to being high-performing adaptable resilient and affordable and we do that through research through demonstration projects and through collaboration and I have to say post-quake here and canterbury the collaboration in support we've had not just from council but from the district health board and from the ministry of business innovation employment has been stunning and we don't get that in other parts of the country so I just kind of want to acknowledge that we've been involved in a number of demonstration projects post-quake we worked with a group of industry partners to build a high-performing house that's out at hive at the moment and that your mind a small but house that performs kind of like to twice the building code in terms of its energy efficiency it's got pv on the roof solar water heating on the roof and actually it didn't cost a lot more to build than the average three to four bedroomed house that's being built out in the burbs at the moment we've talked a little bit about bill back smarter in a minute we've been strongly advocating for houses to be upgraded at time of repair Weprin eqc denied homeowners the opportunity to upgrade houses we stepped in developed a fact bank and we were quite strong at advocating and addressing the issues that eqc had thrown up about why you wouldn't do this and took us 12 months with when I say us iker mb and council to persuade eqc that they should allow homeowners to do that and we've also been involved in working with yourselves an mb to get an example of what 21st century house might mean for Christ's Church and I'm talking about the brief in the Canterbury sustainable homes working party and in particular advocating for regulatory interventions in the land use recovery plan and I'll talk about that a little in a minute so what I'm focusing on here is councils role as a key player in determining housing outcomes and I'm asking that council set aside funding for the operation of the bill back smarter service over the next 12 months and this service is based on a successful pilot that beacon ran which has the support of the insurance council project management organizations and homeowners we took seven houses to date in the rebuild process and we upgraded those houses alongside there appears that the insurers were funding and so there were some pics of that as well do never mind did acknowledge that we seem to cook they're mine so the the service itself aims to take that knowledge and to build it into a case management service that sits alongside the repair process and it's focused on giving the homeowner independent advice for them to be confident about making some decisions that could happen based on kind of almost ten years now of beacons research and we have had stunning support from a couple of the PMO's in particular Hawkins have been doing I AG work and also arrow we're endeavoring to align finance options for the homeowner so clearly some homeowners can't afford to pay and wanted to upgrades some of them who own homes can't afford to pay so then where is the opportunity to align with things like the eco program and I mean I won't advocate the target of rape because it's inappropriate at the moment but and then there is a QA process around contractor selection and kicking off the work at the end of the process so we're setting up to de-risk it as much as possible and so essentially the service set between the homeowner and the repair process so the objectives of the service are to optimize the recovery process we're targeting at least thirty percent of the homes that are still to be repaired before June 2016 seeking to reduce the health costs by improving the health upgrade and clearly the resource efficiency gains for homeowners in terms of reduced energy are considerable and the reduction in air pollution through more efficient heating support seconds air quality targets I mentioned before around cost benefit as part of the work we've been doing we have prepared for Sarah eeka Council and the Ministry of business innovation and employment a better business case and that better business case shows for an annual investment of 1.2 million the payback for the region over the three-year period and Beyond is in the vicinity of 48 million dollars and that is around the benefits the homeowner the benefits in terms of the reduced health costs and other social benefits so that's the bill back smarter service and I would strongly advocate that it is an opportunity for council to work alongside government agencies to deliver real long-term benefit and addressing a large number of cold damp homes and I'm not just picking on Christchurch New Zealand as poor housing but we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here to intervene the second issue I'd like to advocate for is for service now this is an independent advice service that provided to ratepayers in seven other local authorities and it centrally supports the things like the bill back smarter service it supports the work that council has been doing with builders for builders to be designing and building better performing homes and you know just so you get some idea of the benefit in other parts of the country you know the results show that eighty percent of the homeowners who took advice from the eco design advisor actually took action as a result of that advice so it is working in other parts of the country at eighty percent that's informations on their website so there's been some feedback some survey work around the effectiveness and sixty percent of those people actually changed the way their behavior in their house so part of it obviously is the built form but part of it is also what we do in houses and too many of us try and dry clothes and houses or we don't open windows and bathrooms and that sort of stuff so the eco design brands work around information and if you look on their website there are a whole lot of easy understood fact sheets around things like ventilation insulation that sort of thing other issues and I just had prepared one slide that was asking Council to provide more advice on the sustainable subdivision layout and design and I essentially we're asking for three things for you to ensure that all subdivisions are in taped sites for maximum solar gain this is the single most important thing we can do to improve the performance of our houses I can't give you factual evidence here in Christchurch but in Auckland we build a house that was designed to maximize solar gain and it housed used a third less energy it was it required no heating in the winter in Auckland to keep temperatures in the living room at 18 degrees and in the bedrooms at 16 degrees so that's World Health guidelines without any additional heating so that is the single most important thing you can do also encourage you to incentivize developers to remove restrictive covenants on their developments covenants sub optimal outcomes for the people who are living there and actually prohibit the building off site of houses and moving them onto subdivisions and a lot of cases there are covenants that will not handle will not allow a relocatable home and I'm just aware that you've gone over time do you want questions from people yeah okay so two more points which I I'm installing the rest of its longest being extremely kind because we've lost your presentation so I'm just giving this right little bit of extra not know I'm happy to stop at that point and ask four questions cause I think particularly did thank you um thanks very much as particularly interested in your example of the nineteen thirties home being bought up to energy-efficient and warm would that apply to something like our social housing old cold brick can you do anything with those and I've got to be very careful how I answer this because we've got so much variety in what we've built and so if there is space in the cavity in it's not on a concrete floor or if it's not on a wooden floor sitting on the ground then you've got the opportunity to insulate underneath you know often it's more cost effective to have good thermal drapes than it is to put in double glazing and there are now opportunities with you know we've got sloping ceilings Killian proves there are ways that we can insulate underneath that ceiling to improve the thermal performance right what about the walls if it's a concrete block wall and the rest of the house is in really good condition I mean there are a number of things you could do you could strap in line the inside that's quite expensive you could insulate on the outside that's also quite expensive so I mean from the work we've done it would suggest to do the most cost-effective things in terms of ceilings about forty-two percent I think under floors about fifteen percent sort the windows out with curtains rather I'm not trying to say don't double glazed but good thermal curtains it have to accept that you can't do anything about the walls okay thank you very much um thank you um have you looked at the housing Accord that's been done on what Oakland and in Christchurch and have you considered that these things could be added into that rather than just kind of yeah I guess this is kind of a budget we can make a few changes but really some of what you're talking about seems to be that central government regulation as opposed to just encouragement because encouragement hasn't seemed to have got us very far and no encouragement hasn't got a spirit far I can speak with a little bit more better informed around the housing a chord in auckland than I can in the situation Christchurch but their housing the unitary plan in Auckland specifies that if you're building more than sick sorry five houses then you have to achieve in that development a home star rating of sex so most of the things we're talking about would be up there with a home star rating of sex and housing areas has to give effect to the unitary plan rule so by default they either have to achieve a home star of sex or through an alternative mechanism show how they are addressing housing performance now my understanding here is you're looking to do some other thing suggested in the district plan review for residential buildings and we're now just looking at what we can suggest for commercial and industrial buildings as well in terms of energy efficiency and most of the things that you've mentioned in their submission and you'd have to ask the question why is it not mandatory and why does the building code not force us to build in this way because in other developed countries that's what's happening that was really where I was trying to get to with the question given that earthquake repairs which are happening now and said they have been happening for three years without much thought to sustainability except in isolated cases as part of our one opportunity to do something different through the housing accord should we be asking government to have this but you know in my experience over the last six years you're wasting your breath and I mean we certainly see the one opportunity for leadership and internationally it is the cities that take the lead it is not federal government or national government other than perhaps the UK we have had a completely different drivers but yep I'm sorry you're our best bet guys um thank you and just in terms of not quoting you this is live streamed so we promise not to quote your daughter here we go again but I mean there is the reality you know and I think internationally it is the cities that you know the seattle's the Portland's that have made the real progress it is not the federal government anywhere that do need to cap it off the effort thank you once again to the very very much indeed for coming down very helpful submission thank you oops
Is that my lesson yes I have two submissions madam okay thank you here's the and I'll let you know when we're ready um madam chairman Phillip haitham freight and with regard to my first submission that I'm doing on behalf of the Darlington residents association may I also say to you it is now not just mine it is with the full authority of the executive of which I'm a part and the chairman mark be land as well who is the chair of the DRA um firstly as I have left all my notes at home could I just emphasize that I have worked for a council myself and therefore have some considerable knowledge about how the basics of drainage systems go and one of the first issues that we've always had with the Dudley Creek is that just moving up the creek from the avon river join at the bridge when you get about 30 to 40 metres up you can see quite clearly contractual rubbish that has been pushed off site into the creek it is certainly not I can of a creek bed and even on a day without any rain it holds millions of liters of water back now it's supposed to be a salt scouring Creek so this type of thing needs to be looked at urgently that our creek beds are not becoming a rubbish bed then one of the next things we have a problem as you move up the creek is the problem of your bridges the bridges and how they are built now if you look at the bridges on the Dudley Creek between marion college and 15 to north parade as you walk north in this case you will see three very different designs at marion college you go across the creek at road level get to 136 north parade and you're going down a reasonable slope to get to the bridge and the bridge narrows into the creek bed get to 15 to north parade at the corner of banks Avenue and it's even narrower and you've got about one-third of the space left that you used to have only a few yards away up marrying college earthquake insurers the way it's held up at the moment with extra beams underneath it makes a fantastic damn for every storm so bits and pieces it only takes a small branch to go across there and you have got a dam which is causing you major problems and this is something I think you have to look at in the future in policy as to the width height and where you allow bridges to be set in relation to property um in simple terms um we see the water level there all the time in places being too high because as you look at the third base of the creek even if pipes have sunk before the earthquake the water came out of pipes into it now they are down below the level of the creek but also you have got infestations of bamboo at the likes of banks of Achilles intersection now that in this case brings it down to about half a meter in width to a meter and this is something you've got to sort out from the point of view of the uniformity to bridges etc so that you know what your basic widths are and then if there's problems you've got things you could sort out and I think what's said in here at this point I can leave it there it explains everything that I've said in summary we would liked so you to sort things out from the point of view of making sure that this creek when you go to places like as I say there averill Street paltan Avenue junction please make sure that the pipe that comes under the road you can guarantee that the rubbish that's in it drains out of it because at the moment it's like this the creek bed in relation to it thank you very much that was in relation to your first one and would you like to go straight on to your second one so that we don't cut into any of your time yes now I'm Tracy is just going to set this going okay okay well pause the time while Tracy guessing right madam chairman the second one I present christchurch and district and we provided you with a list of bus stops that we would like to see upgraded in the following year now the reason why we've asked for this to be increased is because of the practical reality of life for the disabled person 15 new bus stops a year around the city while it sounds nice it barely meets less than 1% of the number of bus route bus stops in this city and the council has always said one thing everybody wins when the bus comes first but it leaves out one word passenger us and nobody is going to stand at a bus stop and get soaked but the direction of this submission now is going to slightly change in the way I am going to present it to you because I want to start here on this one we went to the Hagley very me community board to ask for bus shelters to be installed at the disabled persons center aspire Canterbury and this was apparently by lieut morally we were told they were just underway to be put in in the can and the CCC decisions have been given thought to to make this route Wooster Street more of a route that is a priority for cyclists and that according to what I am told by he can they are going to strip route 60 from Wooster Street now this we consider to be an act of discrimination to the disabled person because route 60 connects the public hospital the exchange the disabled person center major malls and the Burwood spinal unit all on one bus route and this was one of the reasons why we approached you last year to get these ones done the first two and we were told it was financially impossible but with the support of the Hadley Farrah Mead board these ones we've been told worked apparently going to be done but really route 60 must remain and we need the support of the council to ensure that this route remains and does not get changed in the metro he can review may 2014 and the petition that I could show you that we have here is a very important one and this is this this is not acceptable and we do ask for your support to keep route 60 alive and well on the current route that it's on now the reason why we go through these ones like Springfield Road st. Albans street corner is that it is outside a medical center well these are places where bus shelter should be the same like pepper new erode st. Albans street it's outside a medical center going inbound there as well st. George's Hospital on heaton street and then heat and street eats bound outside the sports field near the Elmwood Sports Complex and there's also a children's playground there but it's under trees now who's going to use a bus stop and get soaked by the rain and Russell Street inbound to the city from there these are places where buses meet like the metro star and other bus routes and you have to have good intersection interchange bus stops available for people to be encouraged to go from one bus route to another um northaven road we've come to the Delta community center could be justified but here is another one for you a bit further on this is the Kenneth Weaver trust at seven oh seven eleven to seven eleven barbados street look at the disgusting dirt hole it is the filth that it is on a council-owned bus stop yet over the road is this could we please have some explanation as to the difference between the filth and the tidiness on opposite sides of the road it's unacceptable now stand more Road northbound outside house courts that's a very highly used one but then this is Petrie Street on Shirley road corner why is there a decent high quality bus stop outside the Shirley intermediate school then you come down to this dirt hole this piece of thought and then you get down to the Shirley to the Shirley primary school and you've got top class bus shelters um 146 hills road is one where we've been asking for because of people with physical disabilities use the physiotherapists and everything around there and etc sorry we've asked for these for a very good reason and good place as well Birmingham drivers on route 40 but the bus stop is there but 32 meters of footpath is not so you go oh the bus shelter into the filth walk to the Red Cross Center and by the time you get there you'd wonder as to what you're going to do with your shoes and I had to experience that myself last year when I was doing my first aid certificate I mean that's just disgusting um hagley Avenue outside the atrium for instance it's somewhat interesting there's the bus stop is there but you wait under trees outside the netball courts and you get saturated but also Orchard Road that's bus stop 1971 forth memory serves me correctly the huge mud holes on each side of a small small tarsal strip is just amazing it must be a highly used bus stop and so what we do ask please is that the council picks up these things things like this and please make our bus system usable because you're not going to get people onto the ECAM buses however the council who is responsible for the hard surface the path of roads and the light to get onto the bus does not have these bus stops in good order and I think madam chairman that basically finishes what we have to say thank you very much and it leaves a few minutes for questions are there any clean thank you thank you Phillip just in relation to Dudley Creek of which a a good chunk of it goes through the bill would pick this Ward C Council has identified some of the issues such as clearing the waterways obviously in things like black gates are they the flip case is it something that's relevant to an extreme and the problem is if you put flat gates in on the Dudley creek at the moment that question is where would the war to go in these if you're trying to keep it off property maybe at the lower end but the problem is at the bottom end as well the land is sinking as well but you can see that even up at arm as I said where well there that there's been contractual rubbish dumped but also one of the other problems Glen that you have with the Dudley Creek is that where these contractors have put in the ultra-fast broadband cables you've now got a situation whereby at 34 to 36 banks Avenue the side of the road is collapsing because they have not done the repair of their work after they've laid the cables properly and if more rain gets into where they put those channels you're going to have the whole of banks Avenue collapse the junction and the whole bank going into the creek as well and I went down and photographed it yesterday and run through your to your Center and told them what was happening and you can already see the side of the of the bank that has been built to raise the road starting to move because of the fact that other work is not being done properly and not being sealed off properly so that when they go along and they fill their trenches etc they fill them properly and it's the same and they people fill their trenches put the tar seal over the top then you ring again another few weeks Lake later and say would you please fix the pothole because it's all sunk because it wasn't compacted properly in the first place and which goes to bus stops the many of your bus stops have glass windows that situation is scratched in broken do you have an ideal design that we could look it because some obviously that do have shelters are pretty there is your ideal design of your bus stop um I will comment on it for you as to why firstly it is totally plated at the back with steel secondly the benches at the end and it has a space for a wheelchair which meets the requirements of section 21 of the human rights act as a non-discriminatory bot bus stop but as you can see if you just look around you can see how and why it's important to maintain things around it because you can see that because areas have been patched every so often they're breaking up this if you go to this one he and here at the front which I use as my to stop or go further in level the other way that one on st. Albans street two seats have been put inside it but there's no space inside it for the wheelchair so what I say to you is that the ad shell one and the first one and the one I showed you before both are consistent in design and my advice to you is to get rid of the glass off the back of any and every shelter regardless of whether whether it's the eggshell ones or your own because you can't smash the glass on there because there is none at the back and that would be how I would say to you that's what I would expect to see as a minimum design because it meets your specifications that timetable is inside there undercover the timetable can be put at both ends the Metro finder is beside it it's the wheelchair space you and I can use it and it is one of the one there if you look at it carefully in principle you can see the bench is the same the wheelchair space at the end oh you can just see it from a different angle there but get rid of the glass okay thank you very much Philip we've actually gone a few minutes overtime because you covered quite a wide range of things well thank you madam chairman I do hope that's what's been what we brought to your attention we can see some change thank you very much for coming and for both of your submissions
K today who is listed in the next one no longer wishes to be heard as green boil yeah hi Glen would you like to come forward and we'll just give you a couple of minutes to let see that thank you Phillip thank you madam chair thanks Glen for in your hands but with we've got the submission and we've all read the submission so just soon this is obvious brief as possible no that's fine you've got five minutes yeah so thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you this afternoon it must certainly be an interesting experience having to sit and listen to a succession of people who just want to tell you what you should and shouldn't do and I'm probably no exception I was motivated to put in a submission by reading a claim and the draft annual plan that proposed rates increases six and a half seem compared favorably with other local authorities and well having looked at what other local authorities proposing this isn't quite right but even if it were true make a right as Einstein once pithily remarked compounding is the most powerful force in the universe and compounding rates six and a half percent is certainly can have a powerful impact on ratepayers wallets so and here not telling you anything you don't already know either spending has to be trimmed a bit or non rates income needs to be raised a bit or both there's no free lunch and so I'm going to suggest a couple of non free lunches as I speak to speak neither of which will make me very popular one item of major expenditure that so far seems to survived all scrutiny is the proposed 70 million dollar cycleway project now I've spent weeks trying to get the cost-benefit analysis of this project from the count to no avail at all it seems as though one just wasn't done instead somebody woke up one day and decided it would be a fine and dandy idea to spend 70 million dollars of ratepayers money on a project with no demonstrated net benefits and which oversees study suggests very likely to affordable housing project which certainly has its problems but at least is targeted at those most in need cycleway project is I regret to say really just middle-class welfare I like to cycle and I want somebody else to pay to make it nicer for me you know I'd love to have this myself but in our current circumstances to me it's a luxury we just can't afford on the revenue or income side there's got to be a lot of scope for capitalizing some or all of the CC HL assets none of these with the possible exception of Orion are economically strategic their operations are all very procyclical which means that they don't provide any relief when times are tough as we've seen in recent years we also don't have or know very little about their non-strategic or overall performance thus ECHL chairman is on record as saying that the cost of capital is irrelevant for these businesses which must surely be one of the most remarkable statements ever made by any director any director anywhere at any time the only accounting valuations of these assets are believable then ratepayers would be better off could be made better off simply by capitalizing all the assets and just putting the proceeds and the bank in other words these assets the cccc HL assets are not geese laying golden eggs it should be more akin to Turkey's that are being eternally fattened for a Christmas that never shows up at the end of the day I think it's important to remember that these assets were purchased for providing against a rainy day well to me that rainy day has well and truly arrived it's time to liquidate thank you excellent thank you
What okay thank you for allowing me the time to come and talk to you the first topic I'll wish to address as the heathkit river flooding which I'm aware is a large problem and I'm sure you're all aware of the larger need for investigations in finances to be put under thus so some of food residents association requests that there is more put onto us and including the whole of the heath got river system including where the stormwater drains in the street drains in the springs into parts of our local river the part I'm mainly referring to is which is part of our area is only terrace and ish Grove dears not as largely effectors what other areas are we were part of a survey we did a survey basically that beckenham Neighborhood Association also did they had a much bigger result obviously but it was clearly indicated to us that ish grove terrace the homes were relatively lucky because they were up quite high but they were actually quite affected by the drains the streets James where there'd be basically in it was noted that many drains go into one area which has bother Swan Lake Gardens so they did have the excess blocked on Ash Grove terrace and some loss of income was resulting from these floods however only terrace was more affected in early clack reserved and because of the low nature of the banks the banks without some due to the earthquakes will have some effect the land has dropped evidently unfortunately no homes were reported to be flooded so lucky in that respect but it's just emphasizing the importance and follow along with what Pallister Humphries was saying that the importance of cleaning out the drains in the storm drains you probably can't see this but I personally love next door to a storm water drain and it's very green at the moment and we have fouled out a report to get it claimed better to me it's a prime example of possibly what's happening in our river ways our waterways in of its duty via than what's it doing further on down the river basically so it's straight leg straight yeah to me it's a health issue and there's probably mosquitoes not unnatural but um to get it tested would be interesting but it does sort of emphasizes I thank the importance of looking at the storm water drains collectively as a whole as to whether they need to be closed up close done even or what's to be sung to Tony experts pleased to investigate so and also there has been according to residents and neighbors in the area that there has been ineffective replanting done to the land the only Terrace has evidently quite lower than ash grove terrace which is why it's just a complete pull over only terrace so whether there could be more planting that would a sus we also have other ideas like which I'm sure you're well aware of diverting waterways drains cleaning up storm two drains regulatory gene the head cut rubber is perhaps they used to do more often maybe making the river deeper wider you're creating stop banks are building up the height of the bank sides particularly is led on behalf of Summerfield residents association that regularly testing the water and notifying the public as to whether it has safe for dogs kids that are possibly going to go in there regardless unless there's a sign up there there is no polluting sign up there I'm not sure of its safe in that area but of there was some sort of indication that would be useful for the public so in summary summerfield residents association acknowledges that while the area by heathcott river does not have the same level of flooding that other areas of his rubber heavy before that the entire he'd cut river needs to be tended to investigated as to how a flooding can be may be impacting on the rest of the river or might may be affected by the further subdivision developments over the previous years we would like it investigated and before further development goes on preferably subdivisions and get impact on the problem that's happening and other than the brother Thank You Julie for everything is done in the area just to clarify a couple things you're you're some sort of residents association look after us between Barrington and columbus oh I'd clarified it for the other councillors so now also with the waterway that you've passed the putz around with do you feel that worth regards to regular maintenance of those waterways that it wouldn't be in the obviously in the condition that is er now would that be a fair statement they do clean it out address year laced usually and it's usually weeds so you can cope with weeds but they too may its growth okay yeah and it's stagnant which to me is unhealthy yep wait you can sort of well you know deal with that tongue so it's almost more than maintenance it's just maybe it's better to be filterable and preferably it would be nice to all day so it's covered over we have requested whether that's able to be done in the past yeah so I mean we leave it to the experts as to what is the best thing to do for the it but at the moment running around because it's quite deep quite dangerous plus a safety risk as far as health goes as far as I'm concerned at the moment we did find a deed rich earlier yeah they have been ducklings that have stuck being underground and apparently according to my neighbor actually these methane gases used to be under there too so yeah to me it's a health risk pen yeah yeah thank you okay can I just ask um how long it's been stagnant for like as it actually ever worked and was it before the earthquake it would work okay or is that anything you've noticed post-earthquake so please Craig I was some clean concrete base basically not nothing no water in there generally you really no water on there and then Cynthia earthquakes the was noted to be some luck perfection and the bottom and did get chipped out they did you like underground her see the only obvious cracks under there I'm not exactly sure of all the results of that but there definitely has never been that growth like there is now our financial situation is whether we just stop doing repairs to some of the horizontal infrastructure government have put on fixed the mountain and whether we get more or not and whether we spin more or not as a question what would your view beyond that in terms of fixing our infrastructure I guess it's just a matter of being aware and with a rear that the finances are tight and whether you know residents could actually have are they able to seek permission to cover over themselves basically to you know help end with the City Council basically as to what is required if not thank you very very much indeed for coming in and thank you for just so sorry yes you may yet no you certainly the only other thing I was just going to say about was the cycle lanes just leave the importance of that we require that basically with them the area on the main streets some of them have been started but they sort of drift off into no rear and yeah been quite a busy area particularly with Barrington mole taking completed please but thank you for allowing me to talk which ones can use be slow which ones are drifting off into no weird I go solo agree they need to be finished with no good if they do get so down on Colombo street if you're going towards beckenham summerfield e and basically it's great lines and they're not just disappears and then also on barrington straight down the motion straightened it disappears as well so it's as like someone's head paint and painted half of it and then just forgotten to paint the rest on Marshall but um yeah that yeah the main streets would be greater but was completed to like come so and streaked and Milton Street are quite popular quite busy areas for schoolchildren staff and Amelia and Summerfield school quite often cite pain down there not it just feels safer do a bit Elaine's here thank you thank you very much indeed it can go a little bit Jane's got a note about your drain as well
So Humphries yep welcome make yourself alone this one microphone working can you hear me um I'm here today as a public health physician representing the Canterbury District Health Board that is to say I'm not here as medical officer of Health which is of course a ministry appointment and really I'm just going to confine just summarize I'm not going to read out my submission but I'm just going to summarize some of the points but before I start I just kind of pre out preamble it with some thoughts around the thoughts we've been having in a district health board around active transport and many of you will be aware of the tragedy that affected Charla hi ray were she got killed she was one of our employees she was on her way to work she was killed on a cycle path in Christchurch what some of you are probably not aware of is the effect of not providing appropriate cycleways for people and the effect is had on our surgical department we have a number of surgeons who are very keen they actually don't need to cycle to work to stay fit because they're pretty fit anyway and over the last year or two four of them have been injured cycling to work they have been off work surgical time has been down by approximately eight weeks per surgeon right so that affects all of us affects everybody who wants an operation we look at our waiting times and people it's a tragedy that people attempting to cycle to work are injured and their consequences that our relatives have to wait longer for operations so it is very important that we separate cyclists from traffic and I am always disappointed to see cyclists being put alongside traffic it is dangerous and it affects our whole community and it is still going on I have seen new cycle ways being put alongside roads when they could be separated quite easily and relatively cheaply so to move on to our our submission from the district health board the the summary of capital expenditure reflects an overall variance of 11.6 million from the three-year plan with the largest impact on funding of service a footnote reveals that this is due to deferral of funding for key cycleways work to future years the district health board opposes the significant variance from the three-year plan for transport infrastructure improvements this is because despite extending timeframes for completion of the 13 key cycleways project from five years to eight years we query why funds previously allocated will not be used to move forward with improvements to active transport infrastructure across the city the district health board requests greater clarity overall regarding how much of the capital expenditure for transport improvements will go to active transport infrastructure this is not actually specified in the annual plan and finally the district health board requests more information on the design standards to be used to create safe and effective pedestrian and cycling routes across the city not just for the 13 key cycleways as ongoing infrastructure repair and development continues and how the council will ensure that these standards are adhered to that's all I have to say any questions and subways in cyclists are one side of it how much of driver behavior knowledge as do you think that the education of drivers needs needs to be uplifted arm and what are your thoughts on that the evidence from around the world shows that you only really generate safe cycling when enough cyclists are prepared to go on the road and that it's as engineering improvements that create that environment obviously with more cyclists on the road drivers do tend to look out for them more if there are more of them there but if there are only a few cyclists and if those cyclists are really just the gung-ho like rebound cyclists they you will find that education doesn't make as much difference it really has to be separate the cyclists from the cars that means ordinary people not not not the people like me actually I ride to work in my in my suit I don't wear lycra I I use it as a means of transport I would like to see more people like me who are happy happily confident in writing to work and that can only happen if you separate people from the cars yeah thanks Alice you here so would you suggest that we need to relook at our cycle strategy essentially the district health boards position on all our submissions around transport issues is separate the bikes from the cars and if if they are not separated it won't work it will not generate enough confidence in people particularly when you see headlines around people being killed on cycle marked off cycleways you know it's they're not good enough we need to see people separated properly separated it may only be by a curb but cyclists don't kill pedestrians cars kill cyclists and pedestrians here second question this flooding issued and you see that as a public health concern flooding is always a public health concern you in terms of the fact that you know some people having their houses flooded regularly not just with water but with sewage absolutely did they still be in those houses do you think well the answer is if a house is going to be flooded regularly the answer is no and the district health would have submitted on a number of applications in the in those areas because no people should not be living in houses that are regularly flooded okay and finally um the alcohol issue obviously we're going to hear a submission later around paying for extra security around alcohol ribbon areas who do you think is responsible for the problems that we have with alcohol at the moment who do I think switch mmm because I'm kind of workers would you say what were you talking about there if somebody's somebody wants money from the council to provide you know some kind of extra security to deal with people struggling with no I mean where does my responsibility life that the responsibility lies with the with them with the owner of the facility not with the council sure they're making money out of their facility they should be the ones that provide the security and they do generally speaking but if you ask me who is at the root cause christchurch city council produce an excellent local alcohol plan it it is regarded generally as the you know one of the best the best researched the it that local alcohol plan like the law commission report identified that the root cause of the problem is essentially off license sales it's pre-loading the cause a problem it's no our licensees who deliver an excellent service in this city they don't they there are some of them that have to chase the drunken dollar at 40 45 a coconut one that shouldn't have to happen they are competing with off license sales many people will pre load up until midnight before they go out and that's where our root problem lies okay thank you very much thank you I know the first comment on your submission table relates to rural water supplies and we had a submitter earlier this morning suggesting to us that we should look at deferring the work on banks peninsula around water supply reticulation and sewerage reticulation what would you comment beyond that well essentially the the position of the public health unit and the district health board is that reticulation is important and quality reticulation is important so both for wastewater and four for the water supply itself so thank you I've an interest in footpaths ella stood in my previous existence I saw some of the effects from a pastoral dimension of elderly people and their Falls and what this lead to at the end of the day and p.m. age I just wonder if you could give us a um which is often DD HD but are you able to give us a financial in kind of wider impact take on what happens to our their older people when they do have a full-on broken footpaths and how much it's costing you're absolutely correct counselor that have fall in an elderly person is often lethal not always but it can be the and a lot of people do not realize the importance of maintenance and an adherence to standards around footpaths when you're a young man or woman you know you see a small change in a foot part and you think what's the big deal it's a couple of inches or an inch or two what's you know why is everybody worried about this that inch can kill somebody that I spent part of last year in a wheelchair having broken my foot falling down a hole from the earthquake but also make it ensuring that foot part of level is very important for people in wheelchairs you would be surprised how much drag you get on a wheelchair from a very low gradient so I agree I think adherence to the quality of our footpaths is important those guidelines are there and they should be adhered to for the safety of our community one question do you feel the summation particular emphasize the cycle where facilities mostly important and you against the 10.4 million dollars d forward to the future financial year ye hear your written submission also emphasizes the public transport facility is also very very important is sexual if I regarding to the upper our ties comparing this kind of the tool catechol which was more high per hour ties if due to low Council partita is limiting making a choice between the two it they are both important would I want to see one sacrifice completely for the other the answer is no of course people than our cycleways do but if our cycle ways are safe they will provide a facility for a much wider group in the population and they currently do because they're not safe our elderly our young are put off by the potential danger these are then people who might have to choose a buses and alternative but the better more comprehensive system and safer system you provide for everybody means there are more options so it shouldn't really be a choice between one or the other they are both important the important thing is we should not have kilometer upon kilometer of lines of cars of a single person sitting in there it is bad for the economy it is bad for the health of our residents and that is what we have you only need to look at the traffic jams across the causeway in the morning or running north of christchurch this is not good for our economy it is not good for the health of our people yeah thank you and thank you for your detailed submission quite a wide-ranging one um one issue interested in hearing your thoughts is around the issue of psychoactive substances we as a council have gone through and looked at you know the policy that government has enabled us to consider but I do wonder whether you've got any thoughts about as a city whether we should be much more proactive at looking at things like drug law reform whether we should be advocating or even considering funding for addiction of you know treatment services for alcohol and drugs but particularly around some of those psychoactive substances and I'd be really interested just to hear your your view on if there's anything else we can do from a non-regulatory point of view as a council to deal with issue in our community in terms of dealing with addiction I think it's a if I heard it right it's a kind offer for the City Council to support the district health board and we should work together on this but it is a responsibility of the district health board to provide those addictive services addiction services I think the council was moving very sensibly council was doing all the rights right things in terms of consultation I'm not sure how far the council have got now with developing a detailed draft but towards thinking very carefully about density and the effect of that honor community is important there is no doubt in my mind that some of those substances most of which now are now rebe and of course before they're going to really learn to be used appeared to be addictive and appear to be causing harm to people which is why the Ministry of Health has now decided to ban them and hopefully the ministry itself will review that and we will have less harm from those from those things but I would hope that we would continue to work with the council around addiction services but its primary responsibility of the dhp I'm just going to ask you about the young the cycle ways that we've already put on around Ireland around the University separated do you see those working on your hippie with it I think they're excellent yeah I'm a cyclist I've the city but those kind of separated cycleways are uh make you feel confident when you come down and they do take a little bit of getting used to for some people have not being used to the kind of driveway issue but they are actually safer and they protect you from the moving traffic there there could be though they may be difficult in some circumstances to have that full separation but at the very least they should always be a curb way between the cars and the bikes or sometimes cycleways will need to share with pedestrians I think it's always far better that's cycle cyclists share with pedestrians then cyclists share with cars so where there's an option narrow the road will make the pavement wider all right thank you very much thank you I'm flooding a couple of the the questions are given around especially the hit cataria as firing the flood when we've got silt and influence on the roads how important is it to get it cleaned up before it becomes dries and becomes dust because of what as guess am the bacteria in silt if it's contaminated can sporulating can form spores and survive in dry conditions so it is important to clean it up it is a council responsibility to clean up contaminated silt and they should be doing that promptly if it does blow around yes it can cause a problem for people not so much inhaling it but certainly coming into contact with it there is certainly a theoretical risk I don't have data on you know how many people get infected from sewage contaminated dust blowing around but it's it's a real threat so when we talk with our flooding task force we should instill in them that there is a priority to clean those streets up from the silver cetera before it dries you would agree with me yeah I would say it needs to be cleaned as promptly as possible it may not be can you can imagine on a hot summer's day of flooding and it will dry out very quickly I would suggest that just cleaning it from please is important I think putting hard comply with data on sort of the health data for Christchurch people at the moment and where does that go to be in relation to our sort of policymaking we do have that we do have data on Christchurch people we have data on admissions we have data on infectious disease rates we as a public health unit can analyze any aspect of data that any organization is interested in and we do work with the council in many different areas where we share our data with the council if there were specific issues that you were interested in or any of your staff are interested in be very easy for them to approach us and we will both produce the data but also analyze it if that is required that's an important role for the public health unit well you can contact me but essentially depending on the area you're looking at there will always be a manager and a public health physician working in partnership in the public health unit who your staff will have a relationship with and they can they can access it through it falls next psychoactive substances this we were grappling with the the concept of only allowing these be sold in the central city yes and you mean something that density as these sites do you see that if we only allowed to be sold in the central city as a problem by having all those outfits being sold in one in one space understanding that the each of these facilities have about 300 customers a day yes the issue is that you need to work out and I understand the council was going to do some work on this exactly how many facilities you would allow so you've got to look at how the spacing between them you know whether it's 300 meters and how many therefore would fit within the frame and I would say within the frame not within the four avenues because as a resident of the four avenues I would not want to see psychoactive substance shot on my street but the frame is clearly defined to talk about the frame the problem has been that of course there are some retail outlets that our support outside of that now have they generated a dependency in that community who only for example for these substances possible they have what happens if you come July you then say right when we're going to bring you all into the central city it's an issue for us all to think about as a community those people would have to travel into town to get those substances they want there we are told they're not dependent but they are you know they will go in and get those so I think careful work by the council looking on hat looking at how many we can reasonably have within the frame is is useful work and I think that's it you know I would support okay you're welcome
And I just saw the roof of the navels that looked looked quite intact I thought thank heavens these a familiar place to come back to I thought well you know thank heavens for the church or thank heavens for the council the cathedral is still there and from a a tourism point of view and I was involved in terrorism for 11 years to me and to a lot of other people it is a focal point of the city and our Auckland's got the Sky Tower Wellington's got the Beehive but internationally if people think of christchurch they think of the cathedral and long term to retain the cathedral would be a good investment even from the tourism point of view so that would be my my second point thirdly it is technically feasible you've had experts from all around the world saying how it can be done I'm personally an engineer but not a structural engineer but I have read enough comments from qualified people to know that technically this Cathedral can be repaired before somebody gets into it again with the big on finances however I do make a suggestion that we we built a church in summerfield all 50 years ago and we sold individual bricks to individual people I think it was two shillings at a time for a brick so possibly you could go for a public subscription and sell a stone at the cathedral for a little more than two shillings and the other thing I'd say is if the cathedral was to be refurbished it would show that a Christchurch does have a recovery spirit and we're not really a city of demolishers which it appears to be to the outsider at the moment and I've heard these comments wide and fair and is that a possibility that the council could run a christchurch wide referendum following these submissions as to how many people in christchurch would be prepared to put in 10 or 20 or a hundred dollars are purely additional to the air current financial burdens just to save the cathedral and finally I'd say on personally wish I'd be happy to contribute either site labor or project management which a a sizeable group of volunteers I'm sure something could be done that's all I'd like to say thank you there thanks for your submission how would you feel if the council together with the government actually compulsorily acquired the church did the restoration and then handed it back to the church how do you think that would go down yeah personally I'd be very happy with that as a proposal and because you could then slotted as a as a multi-use facility couldn't you Multi multi religious you particular mention the know the focus tourist attraction and also quite a scandal kcg garden city rather than righteous loki cabo city but if Lisa procedure no will be completely after 20 years this computer still use the car border the case is you you know whether you are acceptable or not I don't think the time frame is particularly troublesome yeah you look at the houses of parliament in London they've been there for two or three hundred years so you know 20 years here in the years neither neither here nor there cathedral city or the upside-down ice cream thing or whatever it's called in the number square but I think as a cathedral city Christchurch should be here to stay um have you talked to the church about this I don't know okay so you don't have to have done any feasibility with regards to buy Iraq or or looking at the voluntary or social value that they could get out of the array oh that's that levels a bit over my head Oh stage here thank you okay thank you for coming and extra speaking to it as well much appreciated
Where I just bought a few photos as examples to highlight some of the points thank you for the opportunity so the first part of our submission was focusing on ensuring that the information that you provide and put on the websites and particularly where it is public consultation is actually accessible often we find with information that it's not designed in a way that someone who doesn't visually access that information can get the same level of detail as someone who has full normal vision the other issue is for those with low vision often the informations presented in colors and formats and tables that when you look at it just half the information may be visible the other half isn't so if you think about it when the information goes out if you photocopier and it comes back you can't read it then it's not vegetable on a website so don't do it so black on white white on black yellows and blacks are the best contrast and you know I do every year sit here and say the same thing but other thing is presenting documents that can be accessed by those who use voice programs and making sure that if a PDF is the only way that some people can access that information if the rest of it can't_''_95.399 be gone through is make sure the PDFs are set up with the right alternative text and formatting that someone can utilize it and make good use of going through a document the diagrams and graphs are no use to anyone if they don't have that alternative text yes yeah when you say you come and do this over and over again do you actually access directly the people who are doing the website stuff we provide this information to the council and we offer we do have a digital and accessible consultancy team who's been a lot of time one of them is actually based here in Christchurch I can works with a lot of local authorities yeah so it'd be really good to see the uptake for them okay so the other thing that concerns the blind foundation and in my role and my role a lot of the council's around the country a lot of local businesses private pronese regional authorities to talk about design and making sure the environment and buildings are accessible these are just some of the examples brand new intersection in by the airport where it's been a new footpath some of the issues around some of the existing rebuilding and I've spoken to skirt over the last couple of years as well and there was an agreement through the council to put back better than was where there were obvious issues that it wasn't going to be a huge budget blowout to actually improve it each Street should have to cut downs the problem with this one is it's angled into the middle of the intersection you're asking people with mobility scooters with walking frames with canes etc to enter the parallel traffic before realigning by doing that you can see the mess that had to make the tactile tiles and search you put them in slightly wrongly even though we consulted it just makes the rest of the design awkward it looks no reason why brand-new intersection had to have a joint cut down like that leading into the middle of an intersection it happens over and over again and that communication to get amongst the different groups as well who work there one of the other things is who consents were around rebuilds of properties again over and over we're asking people to enter the road and then giving them minimal outside your own building its point nine is the clear way for the walkway through here if it's straight well and truly understand it is I carry a tape measure with me well and Trinity couldn't get a guide dog handler and a person walking what happened on be liev during that all that work was the guide dog handlers we've got several that walk to our building and instant albans walked on the road side of the cones because that's the only way and the wheelchair users did the same and the mobility scooters did the same they were out in traffic you can't see the fencing until you hit her and then to cross the road before the traffic light it's not going to happen for those that have low vision some of the other issues that have happened around consenting and probably a little bit of the lack of communication and I think you guys already aware of this as ccsb Jay brought this to the attention I'm sorry he wasn't here today the cross fall on this foot path leads everyone into the gut because the buildings are asked to be built up the curb lane stayed the same and the cross for was just put in people avoid this and the optometrist who is a low vision specialist there his clients battle to get the door open as well because of the slope there on when they've got to open the door to curbs out of the three horrific ones we have the answer on the colombo street bailey intersection was paint a yellow line and people won't trip over it there's a major bus stop there major bus route after hours clinic on the other side cranford street with risks that's guys doing that again their arts was suddenly cut it off and now planters have appeared but all of these sandwich boards that turn up again and therefore see everybody out you can't open your passenger door sitting next to that my old favorite the guy in condoms center so when we had starting to talk a little bit about recreation facilities this was the accessible entrance to the pool if we had been consulted on earlier and through the design phase this would never have happened this is the things we're asking about coming back to roading just just a little bit because the bus infrastructure our clients rely heavily on busing they can't drive and taxis are expensive so getting to facilities like your recreation facilities and it's been interesting listening to the other speakers the hub's don't work for our clients full stop we're now having people changing buses three to four times with those hubs to do their journey when you have an impairment it's very tiring it adds to your day adds to your journey time why that it's going to be a challenge particularly bad weather the hubs are not well designed we totally disagree with the way they are on the streets they should have been incorporated into building facilities we fully supported the wicked and Road doing something more putting them next to the traffic lights you end up with the drivers every day taking challenges to deal with pedestrians who are changing between those hubs they just cross the road straight out there's no facility for them to encourage them to cross in one place or to give them a prioritized crossing it's completely missing from the design there's a lot of disconnect the hubs that the Northlands one blocks the footpath so the pedestrians can't actually get through we have presented a lot of these issues to e can as well there's a total disconnect around some of the design and I know it's it's different groups talking to each other and then talking to the malls and getting them to take on board if that's where the bus interchanges be set and that it became an issue you know put them there but then think about the pedestrian access to those facilities most private commercial retail spaces build for cars they don't think about the pedestrian and it being part of the journey because we don't think people walk everywhere if you want to reduce single vehicle occupancy build will build them roads they will come make it harder for them they'll get on the bus or the the train so yes so those two things are very important for us this is another building we nap after the September earthquakes this is the main entry the accessible entry is behind a fence that you've got to get someone's attention to let you into that it's a commercial property so these things are still being consented by the teens within counts so we really keen to do awareness and training I've done a lot of training with the roading team but there must be some level of understanding that there needs to be an accessibility order and I know with Sarah we're involved with holders of the expertise around blind and vision impairment deafblind accessibility so we can provide the best advice to make sure that our clients are able to access those building and given most of them are over the age of 60 they will have additional needs just for an example the technology hub wonderful building no contrast and then you've got doors that are opposing in their opening so you just get past one smash into it because it's left partially open and you can't even see it's there and the next door comes the opposite direction so it's simple things in design when they're compliant when the compliance team look at plans if we can be involved from that planning and design stage we can point out some of these issues that could be easily rectified and by adding contrast people can actually find emergency exits and get out of those in the same token the Botanic Gardens which is just open the new information center we're already getting feedback from clients that's too difficult they're not going back it go in a wheelchair and see if you can work out how you'll make to get in that building for a start and how with low vision you get in that building it's very very difficult and then once you're inside the counters etc are not easily accessed and they present hazards with lack of contrast and the lighting the glare and other issues within the designer that I also encourage beyond reckon leisure and the Botanic Gardens is you know when you look at the council owns a lot of facilities such as the airport the airport is not that accessible for our clients think of the journey if you arrive there with low vision blind low vision deafblind by bus or by tech see how do you even find the door to get into the cap into the airport building had you can't find it if you're lucky you'll get someone who will help you get your ticket who they then may send you upstairs if the much it's day we'll see you upstairs you've been going to find good luck finding a left if you can find the lift amongst the doors and then you've got to get through the departure lounge the floor is AG leery there's some design patterns and that don't make sense they're not logical they don't lead to anywhere the pillows aren't that greater contrast so there's a lot of council own facilities as well where it would be good to see you know we've got this plan to be the most accessible City to see some of it being implemented so from the blind foundations perspective you know we're here to provide that level of technical expertise and support and we would love to be involved a bit more to ensure that the council is able to achieve those outcomes thank you I'm going back to the picture of and we've just put the lights up and it might be good to put them down again so that we can just go back to one of your pictures if possible if that is possible or maybe you can explain if not the airport and it's the new road crossing yeah can you explain really clearly what's wrong with that from your viewpoint because I mean maybe I'm being a little bit slow here but you went over it quite quickly and I think it would be a benefit to councillors just to have you explain really clearly what was what was wrong with that crossing okay to get a crossing position and two separate cut downs so you're not crossing from a centralized block with one radii that's designed for vehicles to be able to take it at a reasonable speed so to have two separate crossing points and approaches as the developments happen around this area there will be a second pass come in at some stage but to lead you directly to the crossing position so for this one there was a fully blended radii that slopes into the middle of the intersection and that's what happens when you put one cut down in is they bring you into the middle of an intersection so the slope encourages but if you've got will follow that slope down so it takes you into the parallel traffic before you realign when you're blind and have low vision that's why the tactile tiles are there the leading edge of those tiles gives you the direction of the cross so they start to get me see when they go in as well and you need more of them to make sure people don't walk through the middle or step over them and miss them and end up in front of a track on the opposite side they've put us left slip plane again very difficult if you're deaf blind to cross slip lanes and we're a lot of people now as you know we're parking further down and walking and wheeling their bags to the airport so we have to think of the new traveler with their wheeled mobility suitcase and also the texture who's not paying attention who's going to just walk into an intersection yeah could I trade my place with pauline who's bassington I can just a quick question mine is from relation Pickering tells me whose husband was Neville that she pushed for that Alexei is in a chair so this goes back decades and something yani has been mentioning is about skirts works I just wondered is there a way we can ensure that these cut downs are embedded literally in all of skirts work because it wouldn't it really is a fundamental part I think of it has been across you we give a lot of the plans yeah I know Alexia well my grandfather was deputed me awhile she husband was me I'd say yeah she started barrier-free trust New Zealand and did a lot of work in the year that disabled and so she's still very proactive from Wellington yeah we get I get most of the plans and most of the roading plans I got these I commented on these plans and got ignored that's the problem is the level of consultation is often consultation and I have to say the same thing with the edge we're village plan it's all showing shared services and shared spaces we've done a years with the development of the issue at spaces pedestrians without curb cut downs don't know where to go she had cycled pedestrian facilities for those who are older and our clients are just impossible there's so many points of conflict and the ability to be in the middle of a road that perhaps wasn't a sheared surface without curbs so yes really important to get the design but I do work quite closely with a lot of the council staff but again turnovers and that level of communication and building it and so it would be good for another rematch from the council to go back to skirt to reinforce that you're supportive of putting it in right yeah because this was a new job it wasn't a skirt job ya know it's very interesting stuff I just wonder you please get it to the ground pond on pool and explain to us what because the photograph doesn't really tell ok this is the ramp entry to the pole you at the bottom of the ramp is a step yeah bottom of the rationale for that is because they measured it wrong or them their architect when Vijay and I met with him on sight we actually the council asked us to audit this building when it first just before it opened said that it was going to make up the design to keep it as a ramp so he do he made the decision to put the stupid and I believe there's another couple of the dinner in the cavity I didn't include I could have get those no direction so it's quite complex making things accessible so what can we do to to help that ensure that your you're on board was even things like the Metro sports facility any new buildings that are going on what can we do to if we can be built into being a stakeholder that must be consulted with you know it's just we would love to see the city being accessible I'm on a full-time role at the moment because the idea was that there would be a lot of work coming around the rebuild of Christchurch commitment by Sarah to have accessibility audits which may or may not involve the blind foundation so we would like to be in there to be providing that expertise right but so you're more than the blind foundation now your technical environmental awareness advisor for the blind foundation okay see that jewel ok so but what about disability people real cheese I work with bj who unfortunately deferred not to yet or barrier-free trust which elixirs started so we work both so a barrier-free trust had been brought in to do some of that auditing yeah so we work together as agencies we all know the issues right what I'm trying to say as if we hit a a tick box at the end of our projects we wouldn't put you in the air sec yeah but that would be brilliant yeah yeah yep yes yes thank you just helped enormously thank you you actually wind up the morning as well so thank you very very much indeed um guys you are allowed break
Good morning how are you this is roger he's part of a group as well more or less we we know it's kind of we've already got the funding set aside but there is the danger with all this financial stress going on at the moment that we want to try and protect their what we're promised um so I take it you've all read what we've put in good your wiki reading so more or less work we've still got a strong following and this completes the sports and we pump pics is so so important to the eastern side we've lost end we just we just want to give our lives back on track more lists in this the financial stuff that's going on we just want to ensure that we're still going to get the replacement that we were promised in it what was promised with it facility in the last in your plane is still going to be included in there's going to be no changes hopefully at all the public sorry I'm losing polling we've put up several different sites that have been mooted for the replacement pool complex and the result is that the qe2 facility still comes up hands down way above any of the other locations it suits that the whole brief of the thing you've got the transport the land there bearing in mind that any land that we're going to be building on and the east is compromised anyhow there is part of the land that is still very very viable for what we would wish to be built and it's important for the community to see the council actually doing something out there I think if you wander out there that you wouldn't find very much support for you guys at this point in time so something tangible would certainly put your ratings up a little bit we sort of feel a bit stymie because of as Joe was saying that with with the shock although we don't think it was really much of a shock and knowing that we're sort of 500 odd million plus in the hole so rebuilt as promised and I must emphasize that the ears promise but or yeah is it plying the sky this is this is something you know are we living a pipe dream here or as the money still there you know that's that's a very valid question as to we need to ask us to you know are we wasting our time or as the managed all set aside there is in two of course because the old site did pull and money at it was a very visit busy location it had the gymnasium the squash courts and of course the pools it's as I said it's a center hub fool the schooling ground there it had the learners pulls and all that and I'll just give you an antidote will notice that Steve Johnson the one of the life members of why Mary surf lifesaving club who's just been had a huge queen service middle has noted that this year at y mari Beach the quality of children swimming and all there is just abysmal you know we've one day we the water there's one day the the the ability of young people were net to learn to swim a net has been compromised and that's probably not just in the Eastern community to that would be all over Christchurch because the killer to Paul because of its location ease of parking ease of getting to was able to bring all those schools in there n have their tuition done this one training and all that so we're not only talking about what happens in the East as far as that goes it was a very positive thing but which certainly would like to see some affirmation as to what is being done we we think on the polling we've done all effects and figures that have been available to us the qe2 site is still that best site even though as I said the land has compromised to a certain extent but there are actions of that site that are well was able to handle a new building and and I think there should be a priority out of all the major facilities to rebuild we yet we see progress happening on other sites oh yeah hi again I mean just answer your question on the funding that hasn't changed so I think we can put that to one side I mean I think the problem is this is more of a local issue and that you guys need to sort out with your your community or innocence it so we're paying to see demon yeah I think sound away but we've just been suggested that maybe we need to come and make sure that the funding still in the annual plan that's not going to change in let's go funding for this facility or facilities has been allocated and that's not going to change but I think obviously within your local area you need to decide what you want and where you want it yep thank you thank you and all their comments are kept it on live streams of the ego just my question is if you could just please give us a feel for what sport of recreation means for this coastal community and obviously the 16th deal with it every day and we've got several people in our group that actually work at the facilities and attended the facilities of course and they hear it all day every day and it's just the second home for the community and that lost the gathering point the social point the exercise health and fitness if people are able to go there right now and distress themselves through exercise as well it's huge and a previous annual cleanse you for I see you know stress the importance of somewhere not only for children to learn to swim but for lifeguards to train you mean go in risky I mean that is also the links up with the other recreational facilities I mean facilities that like the river and the forest and the beach you know it's right in the middle and that's the way of life out the east but just on that thing again those facilities the sport and Rec facilities all throughout Christchurch are so much more important than a stadium and the convention center like you can't just go to you you know you full stop I think we've established that the stadium is on the back back burner so that's not yet interfere yeah um I'm don't want to really get the past but the Metro sports facility do you think we should have been given that with now apparently government have extended the stadium to 2019 which is great which we you know um but do you think the Metro sports stadium and the central city is actually the still a valid concept or do you think we should actually be real looking at least you agree with it the whole way through whether it's the wrong place to have sports and recreation if you look at like like like take for example jelly park vs Graham Condon where Graham cuando squashed and amongst all kind of businesses in shops and schools and everything whereas jelly parks out in the open preciate green environment sports and recreation I know you've moved it from the best Depot closer to Headley part the other government moved it for you but it's still an refresh the fridge ear the clean green environment it's all waking it's probably an unfair question for you group that's good and why would you build a facility on top of a well and also that facility is supposed to each other city actually pat ok yeah we could have used we could have built with three facilities but it will thank you
That's right turn onto the weeks we had a submission from one of your neighbors his stay thank you madam chair councillors I'm a resident of Foreman's road in Islington and basically my concerns are around the proposed what I'm submitting I guess how forced to submit against the changes to the altar Junction Waterloo Road area based on a couple of issues and you can see here I think there's an etiquette Road design to offer an attractive route for heavy trucks through that area and also there's a strong potential when Woodilee road if orderly road gets close that a lot of traffic will be just not only just trucks but private traffic will be just displaced into Foreman's road the the area if you're not familiar with the Notting Hill area of hornby heslington here next next to us is this new development Waterloo business park this is main south road and waterloo road here the key issue for us is that these two three red areas here represent a major heavy traffic load fulton hogan tnl several large the purple whoops my point of the Foreman's road is here and I just want to point out the light blue lines what I believe to be the major traffic heavy traffic lines around that general area and so a lot of heavy trucks are coming from the north down Gilda Thorpe's and in waterloo road and so for around here through horse or junction to these it's very busy area here and I'm concerned that the changes will have a negative impact for those of us in Lomax Montague Foreman's row this is a relative island of relative peace and quiet we have of course the hot state highway here number one and the railway line either side but in here is not a large movement of traffic and about ten years ago the council approved a heavy traffic control system there were large trucks are not permitted to go through Foreman's road and there is a there was a roundabout installed here at this intersection to discourage trucks I'm consumed that this new change will actually undo that that work for't know this is the new business park area pound road waterloo road as it exists and the proposal is to realign horse or junction through into this business park area and while I can fully understand the the advantages to the business park I think there's some negative outcomes for us as residents the the change basically caps off the end of halls real Junction Road and prevent and removes that crossing on the railway line so consequently all those trucks that were going north out of the end of halls or Junction Road I supposedly meant to go out here and through and out on to pound road 1 I'm not particularly happy with the design with all these roundabouts and so forth and here won't be particularly appealing to trucks and to it actually pushes vehicles on to pound road and a way around past the airport so I don't think there's enough flow for those trucks to be attracted to use that and was that you know the likely this is supposedly the present the future design closing waterloo road or way as my understanding or don't have to go back out this way my concern is the likely appealing use would be to get back into Foreman's road again which is negative outcomes for us at the very least if heavy trucks don't use it we're going to be having a lot more private commuter use of this road presently a lot of traffic goes down here to these businesses as hundreds of cars every morning and if that's closed off then I can guarantee you they'll be up and down Foreman's road and yep clearly it's a memory issue for me this is a design proposal for this area through Waterloo business park and while it's got a large truck sitting there roundabouts are never very attractive for these for these vehicles and I don't think the business part really wants to have heavy trucks through them but I just wanted to make sure that the council has a better design it encourages vehicles to go through the so clearly that concerns are regarding the design the potential and outcomes usually out usually working out we'll have traffic displaced into areas that they haven't been using previously so for me it's you know I'd like to see a safe and efficient route route for over dimensioned vehicles through that business park area and sure that heavy vehicles do not shortcut through local roads and actively protect that heavy transport free status of Foreman's road and associated areas thank you when crazy yesterday they were to be part of the business development manager Hamish he mentioned he had been the consultation with the local community in Hastings whether they have consultation with you or your surrounding the residence the only contact we received was a written brochure which said either you support or don't and and that was really focused around that changed the individual Junction Road I don't think my neighbors really realize what will happen if Woodilee roads closed that hasn't been that general discussion about how traffic flows will be changed and one simple example is when the railway lines go faulty on the end of halls or Junction road and it just becomes a motorway through there and my fear is that this that's what will happen what is a quiet residential street will suddenly become a major through route and you know cleaning my own an enlightened self-interest wanted to keep that street quiet and we bought there because of the low traffic volumes because there was a clear route around us we knew obviously as light industrial area but our little patch seemed to not have a lot of traffic and so clearly we don't want that to change nice to see you in another outfit other than
Break mark I'm just wondering Jim um I as your group or here is your group all here okay I'm just wondering yeah I appreciate it I'm just wondering if you'd like to hear the stadium group and then break is it possible for people yeah okay come on Ford guys this is jim anderson and michael to hammer it right oh sorry I'm sorry that's it so this is 15 are you Michael wants attention tim is the CEO say no trust so this is just the first part of that Michaels Michaels ahem all it's your different a different submitter all together yes I appreciate that what yeah I appreciate that it's just that they're here early I thought what we might do is be curious to them take them now and take a slightly later afternoon tea it's michael here my girl akin he's not he's not coming to the heads it was it's a different submission yes I appreciate it I appreciate that and he may or may not be here today so that's just how different like there's more than one in the city judge okay Zoe one of me thank you very much for receiving the submission I'll speak briefly to the submission which of course you have a copy of already the new stadium amo stadium was established in 2012 as a temporary replacement for the damage stadium was built an anticipation of a new state of being available in 2017 a life span of five years the majority contribution of 34 million came from the government council support was in the form of the land which is still owns of course in various infrastructure that remains the property of the council including the field itself and the lights which will all be returned to the council at the end of the stadium's life and it is the stadium's intention that the whole of the stadium be returned in whatever form discussion between us arise it at present the stadium trust anticipates being able to meet operating costs from revenue through to about March until March 2017 it's one of the few stadiums that of course we did free but this would require financial support from council should any untoward unforeseen or extraordinary events occur I'm talking about some major thing that won't be covered by insurance like a burst water main under the field or whatever I'm just flagging and we're hoping nothing happens like that but you never know if council is confident that a new stadium will be in place by 2017 then there will only need to be discussion on decommissioning costs in terms of returning it to the council if that's the wish and within that context of course the long-term planning process however if the stadium is required beyond the 31st of March 2017 then there will only then we need only to that as if there's a new stadium in place and we don't need the continuation am I the present one then all we need to do is discuss the decommissioning costs however if the stadium is required beyond the 31st of March that is the proposed stadium will not be ready the new consents will need to be matter of fact anyway and financial investment provided to support the extended life of the stadium because there will be some essential maintenance required to keep the stadium going the stadium includes a seat and scaffold system that comprises 11,500 24 of the stadium's 17,800 seats at the time of constructing the stadium of decide to lease the system we didn't have enough money to buy all the seats and because it was a short term we thought it was best to lease with hindsight I think we'd have been better to buy them to be honest but there we are if the stadium is required to have an extended life it would be prudent to purchase the seton scaffolding system now the cost of that is two million we've already purchased five or six thousand of the seats and that has lowered our lease payments and therefore enable us to run our affairs without any losses and this would go even further this would cost about 2 million dollars but it would save us in excess of 500 thousand dollars a year and over a three and a half to six and a half million dollars and that that would be a cost of decommissioning receipts which we won't own of course so we'll have to give them back and upgrade them so that are going concerned that's all part of the contract because we don't buy them the stadium won't own them and won't be able to pass them on to the council will have to give them back by providing the trust with a 2 million dollar grant now the council will provide us with the means to purchase the existing seat system eliminate the need to pay annual lease costs in 215 and beyond and any svet scenario that requires a stadium d to remain used beyond 2017 would make the purchase very advantageous not only from a financial point of view but would also put ownership and control over the seating system in the hands of the stadium trust and ultimately the council and so you could actually give those seats to other organizations or use them for a second tier stadium or whatever you costs the three and a half of six and a half million can be applied to various maintenance progress projects that would extend the life of the stadium beyond March 2017 our engineering advice is that it would be able to be extended for 5 to 10 years or even more and be done cheaper now of course if we do it then in the future if we do it now we save all that money and were able to spend that money on the essential maintenance that would extend the life of the stadium the doing nothing is not an option because it won't last beyond that if we don't enter into a we already got a maintenance program but there would be an extended maintenance program required if the life the stadium can be extended our engineering of Isis as it can be Stadium Trust is happy to engage with the councilman's officers as desired between now and the annual budget being finalized to discuss this proposal further and more detail there are some commercial in confidence issues around the least cost and so on we don't to go in the detail there because summers commercially sensitive but we could do that in private with officials thank you very much now who'd correctly that if you did this then that it's stadium could last ten years yes the timken answer that in more detail we have a maintenance an asset maintenance program report from city care and we also her engineering advice about these structures and everything and the maintenance required to keep them going and and we are advised that the the stadium life could be extended up to ten years and beyond thank you for the sorry buddy thanks the deputation you would have seen probably used a document that Sarah put out which indicated first I'm chair of strategy and planning refs chair of Finance and for both of us is the first that we saw of of these indicative timelines but but they obviously put out a completion date in the second quarter of 2019 news to us but you know that's fine if they're signaling they're given their is the Crown's signaling demon and also the stadium have you spoken to them about any cost contribution particularly around the two million dollars to purchase the seating because the business model has changed quite drastically if what Sarah is proposing as of yesterday is indeed true if they then change the business model on you then do you think it's fair for them to be able to contribute in any detail or what their new business model is and the paper no there's no business model at all it's not around the business model boats around the time lines no was there any indication and in the detail of any significant contribution from the government of other than that already advised no the only the only thing that was in there was a change of timeline the first that I've seen about it was was as of yesterday it said that that an indicative construction completion was the second quarter of 2019 so they'd only has application say is I we are in consultation with the government of course because they have major stakeholder and I don't I have is that the government was unlikely to increase its contribution of the stadium over and above what has already been indicated but I can't_''_607.77 say any more than that really okay but Mr Brown he does know of this presentation great and he knows that we're in a position where we we must know very soon whether we are going to increase the maintenance on the building to to keep it going or not because we can't we can't_''_633.46 say that it's available to 2017 if we don't do that x-ray so can you say that it will be available if we do but but if we don't then 2017 is it and as I see it and one of the reasons for the submission is that the city doesn't want to find itself in the position where it doesn't have any stadium no no so obviously we will need will need test some dialogue with from to know from 2017 yes yeah okay well yeah I mean I'd to just come in and says as soon as wondering if you considered an interest-free loan for these seats once the decision is made if there is one made on the timeline because if you of the cost of two million over four years if you've paying five hundred thousand a year they could be paid off and also at the end of that time when they finished being used is there any resale value in those will they be used up I'll let them comment on that but just to remind you that we already have taken a commercial loan it's at commercial rates from the Trust Bank of Canberra community community trust for the other seats I think that about 5,000 of them and we also got a groan from the line foundation for that but these remaining seats are the more substantial part and they're the ones that we're looking at and and there is there's always been the possibility of a commercial loan but the problem with it was that the the bri payments and the interest would take up all the money that would be needing for the interest-free loan I guess we've got to look at it from from two perspectives we're in a position we're right now what we're saying is there's an opportunity to reduce error costs by in some shape or form purchasing the remaining seats in the facility the reason we're looking to purchase those is it's going to free up capital for us to invest on maintaining certain aspects of that facility and we can do some of that maintenance now far cheaper than in the future we're open to any model that's going to achieve those outcomes and to me it's about partnership and it's about the trust working with counsel working with government to identify the best way forward to achieve that to satisfy the desires of all three parties at preferences certainly a grant we move forward we start investing money in those regions projects I think there's obviously going to be a need for the stadium to continue beyond 2017 that seems incredibly clear to me so I think we want to have those discussions with going to ask the last question I think he have you approached the rugby union or the IRB for a contribution given that you know date they are one of the main benefactors and they do seem to make a lot of money beneficiaries they do seem to make a lot of make a lot of money from the Rugby World Cup they obviously are making money within New Zealand so yeah I'll jump in here and indicate that in terms of Canberra rugby we currently have a lease agreement with them that means that a portion of their their profits from each year does come to the stadium trust plus we are charging them a high fee so we are in a position where they are already making contributions of various degrees to the stadium terms of an approach to one IRB or oriented are you I don't what we haven't done anything of that nature recently I guess it's a matter of looking at what are the uses of the stadium and how is it appropriate to apportion those two different user groups bearing community benefit how could I just make what I would just say it in respect of mr. brownie so I get very clear here he has been personally he gets up he gets a hard time in many ways but I have to say that he's personally been one of the catalysts for the stadium being built in the first place and so there's no doubting his commitment to it but my impression is that the government is not likely to want to increase their commitment for that particular project any further than it is already obviously we want to hit some through the talks with you at some stage I would think what will the counsel advised us when they'd like to meet or do we know we'll expect you to know it by spj makes me thank you okay thank you all very much what I like to do now I appreciate Michael's here and is actually break and come back at eleven o'clock is that ok with everyone
Thank you did you hear what I said we would like to pay tribute to the council for the work done to little stronger communities in Christchurch Stephen Tyndall have said that healthy communities create healthy businesses we aim for that and hope council with hungry building of our facilities and upkeep of our assets and see that as that as an investment we hope in this way to exist to assist in the rebuilding of Christchurch normal will go into more details hi I'm Melanie white I'm on the committee of the Community Association as well thanks for the time this morning first letting us speak I'm just really going to follow on from what Helen saying and speak to number nine and our submission which is community facilities rebuild which actually covers the quite a few of the other points with we've made as well what we really think would help governors bay community is to to coordinate the building of community facilities into the future is a comprehensive concept plan and this concept plan would would include anything and everything that the community it would be very helpful if it had a budget an associated budget estimate and a time frame estimate and the concept plan would include the the points the skate park and a public toilets in the community hall and maybe other things and then the community will be able to target those projects and aim to complete them within the framework of a concept plan so they wouldn't have to be redone or undone or adjusted for future development and following on from that point in the interim knowing that it's probably going to be quite a number of years before we get a new community hall the community needs use of a space and this that's the point number three's of the old school masters house to achieve that we need some money to connect power and to get a new front door the community are going to do a lot of voluntary work cleaning up the grounds and preparing it in other ways but we had an estimate this week of six and a half thousand dollars to connect the power and then so total of eight thousand dollars would enable the community and to use the schoolmasters house in the interim as a meeting place and for community groups and the youth group and and things like that it will be really great concept plan and the schoolmasters house sets out to its are there any questions thank you and thank you for all the work that you and the community association doing governors day as well I like the idea of a concept plan for governors Bay and I love the idea of community involvement in projects where council B&N a we can be an enabler and the community do the work and I just wanted to think of that in terms of the of the wharf clearly this some significant work needs to be done down there to restore pedestrian access to what extent of the community got the capacity or the ability if council was an enabler in that project and how much work could the community actually do to reinstate what you understand of the work that might need doing on the wharf no I've read through piles is obviously technical work that the community couldn't do themselves I know this there are people who are planning to do fundraising to help get the the GT back on track and I know that once the piles were down the differently people in the community who would be prepared to help putting the boards and the handrails up and and finishing it was really behind that yeah we might build a flank yeah but get a named plank um but the technical work of because there's quite a few piles that need replacing that's obviously something probably would be more difficult to access within the community yep great thank you if they got into this tonight project have you ever engage with your local comunico try to apply for some phantom from your yo-yo your local pool for the for which project the local communal you hear the project oh yeah um yes yes there's a lot of volunteer work that goes on with old man's beard heaps of volunteer work lady here the schoolmasters house everything we've done so far has how we could use it and getting to the point where what we need is power supplied everything else will do ourselves cleaning it up making sure it's safe to use planting round round the house the skate park as long as we get permission for that we're happy to do the rest ourselves I think we've got the way with all within the community to get concrete and do all the work and so on I mean we do as much as we can we're pretty proactive I just want to say thank you for all that that's I know yannis got a question but actually what you're doing is amazing it's really really cool and probably we forget to say thank you so just in case we do especially thank you yanny thank you I'm just very quickly on the item 7 the Heritage Roxy walk do you know is that part of the head-to-head walkway proposal and are you guys supportive of the headache yeah yeah it is part of it and at the moment it is falling apart of rattled it all apart it seems to be falling apart quicker than it was before and it is part of the head-to-head walk which we can course we support holy yeah and you guys are actively involved in it we aren't but we've been I've been asked to lead groups around and interpret the vegetation and that sort of thing yes cool thank you one Christian just on that pat the walkways around the governor's bay we're not when I do walk there they just their bit up and down there a bit difficult even fine so it would be a way to say for the community if we can previous us the community also to be in some ways involved even in guiding the reconstruction and the planning of and they're part of the walkway I'm sure we'd love to yes great and we have we have qualified people in the community who would help with that all right thank you
At David Lee is David here yep hi David morning come on make yourself at home and you've got 10 minutes if you're okay with it to tell us can I get me some all of this information about yourself yeah definitely put the hearing me you can give us whatever you like I may only going to talk on what I handed out to you here why are you handing it out spoon would I mainly gonna talk about stormwater flooding which is probably dealing with me mainly it's a complex issue and as a complex quite complex explained and it's covering a quite a big area I'm not sure I can put it together but dumb I'll run out of time and sometimes quite hard to put sing it together you do a beer with me if I make a mistake and what I'm doing have you all got a copy I'll start reading here and the storm water flooding make the map this is a main issue for me err living our livelihood is affected and we are struggling we do not know if we will harvest our crops we have lost so many crops this year is causing us a lot of stress the incoming spring we will sew and plant for the Christmas harvest and we could lose the lot or because our waterways the cash mystery in his gear river that's not doing what it should be doing is removing stormwater the next section I thought just not written here I thought this place was a great place to live to bring up my family so we built our dream home on air maha garden land year 2000 and there was no flood zone or any kind of storm water flooding no flood zone and any kind of storm water flooding in those yet with only minor we chose this land because it had great potential for growing quality vegetables and the soil is the best you can have plus other other excellent features now if week if I missed anything here let me think so if we go to page number as ecchi page number 24 it's not 23 pages or sets each quality veggies and pay 23 24 25 27 or show the quality dividual grow we can't grow this quite a quality veggies now because of all those floodwaters happening to us all right now on the next page page to this the section here was a dealing with the City Council I'm not saying it you're a lot of City Council was a previous City Council Bob Parker and them we told the city planned in 2002 there would be problems as this how far back it was before we had these storm water flooding problems that was flooding in the area was any small in the time back now it has excavated and in 2008 variation 48 was put upon us and we ended up an environment court fighting for our livelihood variation 48 was about how we control storm water this is the turning point where things go wrong and the city had opted their method to control storm water their plan was to hold back storm woods and ponds all around us which they have done now I've got Pandu around us to more flooding high water table and now what happened now is small rainfall is now producing 100-year flood levels as you mention a newspaper in variation 48-hour submission and now submission from our engineer Warren Lewis put forward a number of proposals to help reduce stormwater flooding in our area in other areas I have these printed sheets and when you read them you wonder why the city plan is building all these poems at a huge cost in needing continuous maintenance at that time in the time wood for the submission and theories and 48 were landless had costed all these proposals nowhere in the other thing is that that we know we went through various before the entry the Environment Court there was no where that the city plan said what Warren Lewis has proposed would not work now if we will go to page page number 51 which is not 51 pages the page number 51 I'll just read the top paragraph in yonder when you read when I read this paragraph you understand why does the second city council do what they did however as their capacity and therefore eliminate the needs for ponding than the rest of the Henderson basin area was never called the Henderson baseman was a city council or city plan should have said not city council City plant had labeled as a Hinson basin and the if kavod matures could be used to help to fill the Henderson pond area to create available residential land when you see that it was a possible way of not having those pond there and get the council went ahead and put those ponds here now then my first lot of submission I sent you in the mail I actually wrote 1.8 million better that she's not right that was incorrect was actually five millions is if you read the first part of the ones I sent out not the one I given you when I send out to you now if we go to bet to page three that's the one that gave to you oh that's a bit messy now if the city since the page really want to hand out here the city if the city plan had flooding we would not have this high level flooding that we have our presence if those ponds in the arid were not built to the weren't built all that money could be have gone on to upgrading the waterway the case mystery in his get river I want what I want now is I want to see some real action like greeting of the high spots widening where necessary I mean dash to widen all the river and removal of trees and shrubs from the floodplain and crow scraps viewed flood plains where necessary I've got a diagram here and the 1i sent here I showed you it prints on this one here page page for this is the 1i sent in the mail for next page for the diagrams and we all know it takes five sorry then I've constructed that diagram cross-sectional area here where there's that's keeping the flood plain without these bushes and trees which slowed down stormwater I mean we design cards to have coefficients low drag Nets little thing but err err river and waterway has got everything to way of the city cash will be doing things and there as you go to the one I given you I had the one I handed that dear on page four this is a copy page ball hits a property here showing I've got a copy of the city city plane or how they would build deal water weight and when you look at it all the floodplains is that you overgrown you can see the diagram words got bushes and all that bull tree planet whether it should never happen now if we go back to on the same section still anything what I've done here oh yes right if we look at the back in page number 61 if you get in the back here on the same section you see a photo via showing this is the waterway and if you ask me how do you speak storm water flow freely but if the flood plains there's we're their bushes with a bullet and then that gracias all that as part of the floodplain yet the school board has to fight it way ny reporters from an in wat National Institute or whether they reported that the coefficient of this river here is actually down 2.9 we are normal river like this get was down 2.3 this is how much slowing down on the stormwater these sort of recommending planting on the banks does and now I think bit is just about the last thing I'm going to talk about thank you I want to just draw a conclusion what I side here to hold with me a second yeah I'm a high garden is what about circle soon assuming the community this is not written down anywhere and I believe that I'm serving are playing a very important role that we're growing vegetable for people to live and the first Hawkinson the City Council really needs to help us I mean don't flood us out I mean I'm losing so many crops now it's just not funny and in the other section that I did write something in here in the first lot I said I said to you that if it's possible for here maybe the City Council can wave as some of the rules that the be rationed 48 variation 48 put in place the videos in 48 only allows me to put 100 cubic meters I saw a perfect here but that's not going to do anything but what won't help the flowing it won't help my crops either but I need to bring more on there that section there was put upon us by the city council not your city council previous City Council how they planned it you know I mean this is fast I'll Casilla was quite unfair we can if we can't grow a vegetable what's the point I mean we've got excellent soil will get excellent ground in the summertime there's one feature lot of people don't realize it the water table got one meter to one half meter in the summertime because of the hills and the floodplain you don't get a location like this ever anyway in the wholesale Harlem what happened here is in the summertime because of the water table is pulling need to integrate your province match if you grow the stuff like wet require you need to in the middle of something you need to pump the water just on every day I don't have to do that I need to put the war and maybe just to get the plants up for the first 50 mils that's how important this ground this ground is really good ground if you don't want to say about I mean just carry on what you don't let let my place flood then what I want to do I want to have an answer from you the council use the Newcastle and I'm really glad to be here to talk to you and I hope you know a new council will do something for me that's all going to say pry these recent rain events has replaced photos or just this year you have experienced bed flooding it's debating all the time because the cache miss dream nothing winner was a chronic chronic drainage board that whereas you dread to hit road you probably know that since for the last 40 years and would you been down the cache miss creme if you walk down the case treinamento about walking between Westmoreland and in their walkway and you'll see it just actually edit a telegram I went to the Kashmir green corridor I went to the hip master plan all these run by the City Council and the Kashmir in corridor what they're done their rhythm and all the bank or the floodplain you see it let's I'll shown that diagram there they'll just planned out in all these two times what's it come due to the storm water the reason I ask is because they ruin a she's small rain events they were actually large rain events as we know that the rainmeter was actually giving us wrong readings so these rainfall we him there should be only one in ten that we getting levels now 11 hundred the my gap that went run it to spark road this doesn't very often does it one minute comes right out I mean all my tiny visa went under water I mean that cash machine was flowing properly it's down 2.9 coefficient I think that runs it about someone said when the westmoreland I talked a bit about the rules resource men make their where it should have been kept at that resort men's day the resource men x it was about two meters why doesn't it down to about 11 meter and what's all the bushes growing you that if you like to get one meter flow rate and farce I consume that you know it's not acceptable when it's under the city council plan you know thank you David yeah yeah thank you for coming and I'm yeah we buy vegetables off you know you're probably well um with a nice only a personal but it does seem that I'm the ecology of air some of your water wise and the page sixty one's a very good example of it has overtaken say the flood management in some areas of our rivers and the print but I do think that on page four around your property with the of the plant India if council just the big f we're looking it's a widening those drains around a long spikes right at suture I won't do a thing wonder thing if your main waterway is not flowing properly which is the case marine hits get river you can a problem I don't know you have you heard about the tunneling you have you heard about the timing to control storm water if you heard anything about that so input but what is your suggestion with regards to the the cache miss dream and hid kit river this is the argument with the city council planners they see it if we upgrade this is true all the various record yet the argument was if we upgrade the Kashmir stream we need to upgrade the dam downstream so the upgrade the downstream they're not gonna do anything up scream that's what lets in so one model fix the other army I agree with their so why don't you do but at the same time the wooden wouldn't reply back I'm not sure even when you read the one loose a script Leah there was a plan to put a tunnel through from governor's Bay and that would actually stop all the flooding in this area there'll be no more flooding and it would probably reduce the flooding down downstream his get river it was costed at 460 million well unless had done a whole lot of had proper people doing more the engineering and they had cost of that 58 to 60 million I mean when you say he's going to spend 60 million down at crompton basin it don't sound a lot of money it probably cost about a hundred nap because things gone past 12 thousand I they probably crossed by 100 men but all the water from this area here for eight thousand Hector's which I'm on the upper half of his kept this Bentley is that 8,000 heated peb Yvette 10,000 hectares all that storm water could go through that I mean a third of the store would be go less than what if we go down the hill and that would reduce it by quite a bit thank you thank you yeah thanks very much holiday for hearing me anyway councillors engineer and pick it my people haha yeah okay with Leah Leah does oh oh okay thank you
Thank you Michael de Hamal and we're in your hands thank you my I've made three points on my submission here one of which is about expenditure on banks peninsula in particular there is currently a project for putting a new sewage scheme in agoura there are plans in the pipeline for a new pipeline right word new sewage disposal system for lyttelton harbour running it through to christchurch and they have been recently work on winery and Charteris pay schemes these are costing huge amounts of money and when one comes down to it were never actually formally consulted on on the peninsula or approved on the peninsula except that they were put into the budgets and so on as part of the agreement for the merger of banks peninsula with christchurch this city council they went in Bob Parker's plan as projects that we will do and projects as to why banks peninsula is running out of money but it can't afford them and Christchurch City at the time said we will pay for these that was quite a few years ago now but example as far as I know it's never been through the local community board it was just rubber stamped as part of the amalgamation agreement which the people of ocurro in fact voted against it's not too late to tell the good people at banks peninsula look we've had an earthquake we're going to defer these projects by five years and reconsider them then I'm sure that no da who would understand because the main purpose of the sewer schemes in particular was to reduce the discharge of effluent into the harbours there were ways of talking to know who I think that would say along the lines of these discharges have taken 50 years to build up to their present level we will guarantee to reduce them by 2 percent a year for the next 5 years and then we'll look at our sewage schemes again properly banks peninsula council did have plans and projects under way to reduce the volume of effluent going out and to allow alternative treatment systems and things these all went out the door when christchurch city came what I'm suggesting is that at least a small amount should be specifically allocated for research on long-term transport links through the city and beyond in the next 50 or 100 years I think it likely either through floods or earthquakes or flower fires or anything else any other events that areas like Rolleston and rang gora will become major centers of population in Canterbury if you look at what's happened in other cities that have had disasters the outlying towns 20 or 30 kilometers away have become much larger and in 50 years time I think we'll find the post Rangi aura and Rolleston our communities maybe 50 maybe a hundred thousand people and now is the time to put the research into the possible transport links that will service those and allow those people to come into the city when they want to and for people from the city to go out there when they want to at the moment it's probably just a matter of doing a bit of research and making sure that there is communication going on with the railways people planning other things that if the airport needs a second terminal it is in a site that can be serviced by a transport link it's that sort of deep down planning it doesn't need to be very much at the moment it might be only ten or twenty thousand a year but at least so there is an issue and initiative I'm positively underway in order to achieve a long-term transport system my third point is about the waimakariri River Bridge in the past the benefit cost ratio putting a cycleway on it was a bit marginal it was about two or three I think dollars return for each dollar spent on it with the current congestion and the change of traffic patterns in the north of the city my rough calculations show that if you take if by putting a cycleway on the old why Mac bridge you can take 20 cars off the motorway you'll end up with a benefit-cost ratio that is eight or ten or something like that I think now is the time to do that and take even 20 cars are pedestrians who people might be able to park their car on one side of the bridge and walk across to their work on the other side even if it's only 20 people at Hellas who are living in Belfast they can park a bridge and walk across the bridge to work save that number of cars I think that if the sums are done one would find that it was a very economic project while mentioning benefit cost ratios there's another thing that's happened since the draft plan went out for consultation and that's the question of Sumner road in littleton my rough calculations on that show that for every dollar spent on reopening the road it actually works out that each car if traffic volumes remain what they were before before the earthquakes it'll be a subsidy of in the order of two to three hundred dollars per vehicle using that road for the next 200 next 50 years it is an incredibly expensive project the study reports on it show that the road will be open to the standard that it was resiliency purposes the city is surviving without that extra heavy traffic route without paddocks for a wide load word we haven't had projects deferred because you can't get the steel into christ church or anything like that I urge very great caution on spending 50 million there and if you're not spending 50 million day you then can build lighter structures through ferry made and sumner in terms of Road foundations and everything else and probably save quite a lot more downstream in terms of traffic roads through the city from that route happy to answer any questions ok great and I will be quick in that case I talked to a lot of people in chatteris Bay little river winery a Corot who are really happy with the infrastructure work the council's doing I'm sure they are you really do you really believe that there is community support for what you're suggesting I'm not saying there is community support what I said was that the good people of banks peninsula wouldn't mind that's different from community support they were happy the City Council but they would understand if he got deferred yeah thanks Michael can I just ask you like you've suggested that the be recommend that we for the research on public transport routes yeah so I'm just wondering the current model that II can a planning we are using the hub and spokes model do you support that model overall or do you have do have some other there are a whole lot of different ways of doing transport models they used to have a hub and spoke model for the bus system in Christchurch until they introduced the orbiter when the whole system changed the hub and spoke on dedication was shown to be not satisfactory the orbit has suddenly got all those traffic things that may be ways that hub-and-spoke can work what I'm suggesting at the moment really is that a that to be planning and ideas put forward in a continuing research thing to work out what the way of doing it is my suspicion is it will be a y-shaped thing from the central city with one branch going out and the other branch going from the central city through hornby if you like r2r elliston but there would be other links that connect that together but as the basic spine of the system why I shaped structure right I can be I can be contacted anytime or elsewhere thank you
This is greg miller from the beacon of Neighborhood Association welcome indeed thank you Rover's got a couple of points order to touch on briefly and in two items to discuss them a bit more detail this in previous years we have made submissions we believe that rates remissions for earthquake affected our properties and present it to leave due to earthquake damage should be a hundred percent remission and I dislike to note that there been some comments made lately that some other things should apply to people have been forced to leave the house attitude of flooding and we would be supportive of that and again leave we should be looking at one hundred percent rates permission in those cases and the other one I just wanted to touch on briefly as in relation to customer services which was item 21 now submission there's a proposal to cut their cut get rid of the Saturday opening hours of a customer service counters such as we've gotta the become and service center we opposed to this because we find that that's extremely valuable for people the South's the Bickman service center is a in in the library there was a great hub for the local community for the whole side of town and its really great for us to be able to get in there click male liaised with the the surface seemed to staff the interact during the weekend now the the main point someone who can discuss so they are item five relating to stormwater flood protection and control works obviously since we made our submission last month things have deteriorated somewhat again so what I won't dwell on the problem and we're very appreciative of the council's efforts with the the task force to get some temporary measures up and running and when we were quite keen to work with council to ensure that the proceeds as efficiently as possible and the main consume we've got it's the ongoing what we see is he an adequacy of the existing stormwater infrastructure there's a lot of demand we see being placed on the system due to recent and upcoming development in the southwest area of Christchurch't just due to changes in the river with the earthquakes or increased rainfall there's huge amount of extra development in that area and we don't believe that the infrastructure that was set up to cater for that at the design stage is adequate we believe it's that's leading to some of the serious flooding effects were seeing at the moment so what we really want to see is a thorough investigation of the infrastructure at the moment look at look at all the things that are in place such as the retention basins they actually don't believe to be entirely effective or adequate and the capacity in looking at really what could be done first of all to get the infrastructure to a stage now we the existing developments in the south southwest area don't have any adverse impact on the flooding of the haircut River and that that may be through looking at the retention basins monitoring how they perform whether they're of an adequate size and if there's any way that we're going to be improved at that the cross section of a river how we can improve flows through the river and get more water out to sea and really we only once we have investigated that in rectified any shortfall we'd like to see prepare proposals approved to for any additional developments in that area and again weird expect to see that the storm water mitigation measures were put in place at that time we're reviewed and we're guaranteed to be adequate to cope to ensure that the their effect on the port levels in the river is neutral really I know in the past we've had discussions of council about the impact of southwest area developments and they've said to us in their belief they're designed it to be a neutral impact and if anything positive possibly a positive impact and we really don't believe that's the case and so we appreciate that the infrastructure costs in this area are already high the development contribution costs for new developments are high but really that's just the nature of of approving new developments in an area that's the other item I just wanted to touch on very briefly as the mid heathcott River master plan which page 95 item 14 teen it was a some provision that some funding Leon the three-year plan which has been deleted and just very briefly the background of us so that let me I MIDI fetch linear park because a proposal to look at the the health of river and plantings and in utilization of the areas of land alongside the river really trying to creating a part that would follow the earth got river in this case all the way from Colombo street right around to a power road and was creating an area that would look at things such as traffic calming and planting and improving quality of life in the river and creating a part but people were free to enjoy so we were disappointed to see funding for this cut one one thing that we we would suggest is a lot of work there's go on around the river anyway we've got obviously the flood mitigation measures at the moment both temporary and hopefully it do one of the proposed cycleways follows much the same area as the Met heathkit master plan there's also issues with water quality and pollution and overflows of sewage into the river and of course the the ongoing repairs are being undertaken by skirt along the river and we think that really with the amount of expenditure that's going on there anyway it would make sense to at least go through the divine design stage of of a master plan so that we've got something there can be referred to to inform design of each of these individual elements with constantly seeing work being done in isolation along the river people coming along fixing individual bones and it's often done without any global view of really what what is in the best interests of a river and what we can work to to to get what to what we're looking to a long-term with the this master plan and obviously we may need to revisit the design of the original plan but the summer that is perhaps not on the best interests of some particularly thinking of things like planting in and treatment of river banks that's it it's all say this one can mean the bigger Neighborhood Association itself the work you've done on the survey with regards to the flooding and its effect on net community in those individuals as well so thank you very much for that it's a great piece of work to put into the flood task force you mentioned about the mid heath get linear plan and that will change I think with regards to focus more on flooding than ecology around those riverbanks but there was a lot of work that we have to do on those those terraces around here whether it's five field river law or all that were Mia I so I think there's a really good discussion to have with staff and a workshop or something moving forward because it is very important we've been waiting a long time for it it was fantastic and it's original we've obviously hit some changes since then th the right thing it would be really nice to thank you again next time I minor questions would also kind of like to involve Greg and some discussion about some of the points that you've raised Greg and thank you for your excellent submission but just so that you know our council made a key decision to have the the impact of those the southwest innocence basin and the download to have that investigated so we are looking at that but the your pointer and I think it's important as counts as we take your point about the mid heathkit master plan you'll be we agreed that included in the plan was scope for improving the riverbanks and are improving the river flow so we'll take that on board and and certainly thank you for your comments in relation to help some of the work that scooter doing needs to be aligned with them with river improvement but you might like to comment on my comments as well but it's I well where they weren't had Christians and yeah I guess we would really be supportive just some least some desire and today so we can have some comment on this is a huge amount of being money of money being spent on on dis repairing services and roads paths and in river ages and things and the cost of a design to make sure it's done in a way that as with some sort of consistent players feel insignificant when compared to the actual cost of reinstating that infrastructure so I'd be good to see that we could add some value to what is really essential as expenditure anyway can get some extra value ever thanks agree um thank you really really good submission and I know on item 28 you've talked about spinning on big-ticket items and you make a point around the Aven and the heath get even getting a lot more favors than the heath girl didn't we should be asking government in terms of the hundred million that they're spending on the even precinct through the central city to consider I mean they've offered to help us with the flooding we know that the skirt works as an aligned to the master to maybe spend lease in the central city and put some of that money towards things aren't the middle earning a heath get improvement plan yes yeah evidence and I guess one of our concerns is that historically and at the moment that the heath it does seem to be somewhat ignored when you look at the amount of money that had spent on projects to enhance and a brute VA Vaughn there are a lot of areas around the earth get wear and maintenance as minimal was already been discussion of drinking and programs such a set that over the years have lapsed and I think first and foremost we just want to get what the relatively healthy we want up to stop flooding and anything else we can get beyond that would be great Christian with okay thank you you
Do Angela Macpherson come on fall into it thank you for your submission which is by have slightly changed my solution so I have a copy for bigger body ok somebody will come and get that for you thanks Sean that's very good submission and what I want to talk about is the possibility of selling the Christchurch assets and I'm just I'm against selling the assets but there are a few points that I want to make Christchurch people have experienced one of the worst series of earthquakes in recent world history and and this has been followed by the extreme stress that has been put on people by the insurance companies in which we placed our money and our trust we have lost much built up over decades and we do not want to lose any more and I think previous councils have shown great foresight in investing surplus funds in things like the port the airport the lines company and citic here earthquakes are a force of nature selling the air sets would be an act of man and I don't think it the companies that comprise christchurch city holdings and the council stock of social housing units and I think that instead of selling we should be asking these questions why is there pressure to sell and why do some people want us to sell it would be very interesting to know where the pressure is coming from I know some of it is very obvious and what are the motives for that pressure and that is a question I really like you to ask people like Peter Townsend and the government what project would the money be used for and is that project essential now and I think it would be a terrible shame if the assets were sold just to pay running costs for the keeper city running how does the council plan to replace the lost income particularly from Christchurch City Hall buildings and I know that that stream of income particularly prior to the quakes has helped keep the rates at a manageable figure I was unable to find recent figures for the dividends paid by crush at citi holdings that leads on to the next question how I know the proposal this year is for around about six percent rise and I I really think that a Christchurch ratepayers are at a stage where you can't impose much more upon them now here to comment made in the last couple of days that the Christchurch rates are among the lowest in the country but please factor in the stress that christ church people live under because I think that is probably the highest by a long margin in the country is it wise to lose control of the port the airport and the lines company in particular and of those the most important I think are the port and the airport eric says to the outside world in the borrowing power of the assets be used to generate funds and I know this is something madam chair that you have canvassed recently and I just repeat their question can the borrowing power of the assets be used to generate funds are we prepared to take the risk of these assets being bought by asset strippers and just bear in mind the 1980s and particularly new zealand we are fine feeling the effects still and for many years to come we will be feeling the effects of that decision and the last point I make here is that overseas experience in both developed countries like Spain New Zealand and the UK and developing countries like Argentina chilly Kenya and s up John proves that when s it's sold prices go up and services go down the last thing that we want is this really something that the council is prepared to inflict on the citizens of a city the Christchurch City Council assets belong to the citizens of Christchurch they should not be sold to finance the building of white elephants that most do not want will not be able to afford to use and which will never return a profit those who want these projects should finance them instead the council needs to think of ways to utilize the assets and grow them the cch companies return a dividend the city and it's tempting to say that social housing does not however they cater for citizens who stroked who will struggle in the crazy who's paying a one hundred and sixty dollars a day plus ten dollars for her cat a day to rent while a house is being repaired for financial and social reasons we need to keep our assets please I implore you do not let them become yet another casualty of the earthquakes thank you for a stunning submission ah Andrew in the dream yes thank you very much for a well thought out and really solid submission less that's great now clearly we've got a responsibility to balance the books and that's what the budget and the annual plan is all about so faced with your your suggestion of not selling assets and faced with not increasing rates further you talk about white elephant projects what do you suggest the sacrifices should be the stadium is number one for me but are just a small anecdote I meet with friends every morning for coffee and this morning we looked at the press I don't know whether it's page 2 or page 3 there's a photograph of the LSD fair show on it and and that's just half a page in this morning's press we saw two items which we think unnecessary for the running of the city thank you and I thought I know you will be going through line by line particularly canceller mangy over there and ears I think they're probably ask a lot of savings around but my top priority for postponing indefinitely would be the stadium Thank You Angela what if you could be my speech writer but but the second the real question I'd like to ask is what what do you see is that the long-term effects if the council was to sell down or sell off its assets that the long-range effects on the on the right pants on the right pairs I think rates would have to go up but also I see that who is going to buy who is going to get control of the port of the airport that is a question I'd really like you to bear in mind when you think about this who is going to get control of those two particular assets
Wanted to note his wrist kind of building up his own land and if we could somehow look at that as well yeah thank you I'm not asking to build up all that there's wasting time building up all the low yeah I'm not until I just want to build up the front half we ditching the higher part you know yeah thank you yeah thank you yeah mine's a little Leeson teens um I'm here on behalf of basically one of the one of the poles when the other gene was talking about it earlier just reducing the opening hours of the public facilities in the pool area and met speaking on behalf of a number of people that I swim with in the morning and that would changing the times would greatly affect us basically they're 15 minutes I agree with what he said basically 30 minutes at the end of the day seems more viable the 30 minutes the 15 minutes and the morning doesn't seem like a lot but I work on a schedule where I get up at I arrived at the poet 528 and the door was open at five thirty and I swim me and I get out between 52 and two past seven to get to work on time and I represent a lot of people who are middle class working pay tax pay rates they're going to go up and to reduce that we still need to get to work I just think numbers based on contribution so we pay it quite a lot of rate to be at the pool at that time in the morning as well so we pay a greater rate for my four sessions at Paul cost me sixty-seven dollars a month which isn't big money talking millions before but I then have to pay a definitely to go to meet my requirements for my training twice a week which is another forty four dollars a month which is 113 which is actually more than a person who buys an entire complex pass I'm only allowed the four days those specific times on those specific days as well so it says about what we put in contribute quite a lot compared to people are rolling in in the middle of the day that don't have a lot to do have to get up at five o'clock to do it either so I just them was there any other ideas you came up with or is that what the first one is basically my question so someone can answer that for me yeah sorry yeah yeah but they might be yeah yeah this is a bit of oh you might not be able to answer this and he probably as an announced to it but for your position you take about how it's going to affect you in the morning if those hours are trimmed what do you say to the people at the other end of the day who are unable to go at that time the morning maybe there are mothers getting kids off to settle and then work yeah like I understand that and I could think if they could I'm open I'm not it's not emotional I think if you could submit to me that it would't lose as much money by having us leave the first squad of 50 members left the city pool and took up with one of the residents being foreign early or aqua Djem you would lose 50 people paying a premium to be at your facility okay fair enough thank you very much for your submission on this is the whole process we come up and ideas port to us and now we kind of here bit from people and that yeah well doctor getting up at five in the morning time it's alright because there are that other views or variations we could do on it I know other pools do split shifts so they have stuff that only you know don't tune up for two hours there is a reduction in course I can understand if you're looking at from a reduction in cost point of view or running costs especially jelly park they have two pools one being a sports for one's a recreational pool the sports ball can be completely closed by two doors being locked don't have to pay a other alternatives I think and I think total numbers entering the premises between the first 15 minutes of the day in the last 15 minutes a day you'd find greater numbers in the morning so primarily loss of income by excluding the people who provide the most input is not the best idea so that's pretty much it cool cool thanks for time you
I'm rogue Templeton thank you guys okay this is Kent green hockey ah thanks guys you know the drill good morning and thank you for allowing us time to make a submission I'm rod timberland representing kendry hockey and I had peter cox representing our facility zoning trust and also neil prior from tennis ken debris so what we've done is actually invited Neal to join us at the table because we think it really does represent a collective view on the aspect of the annual plan that we want to submit on which is nigh pune why so what we're going to do is let myself and peter submit on behalf of canterbury hockey then pass over to kneel to put forward Tina's Canterbury's views and then hopefully we can engage with you on questions around our collective clicked contribution so from Canterbury hockey's perspective we've got just some very simple messages and support of nipon away basically we can't currently accommodate the demand for our sport we've got around 4,200 regular players plus around two and a half us around 11 100 players per tooth the national guidelines around 800 players per tooth so when you come around numbered park in our other venue morris park you'll see the lights on well late into the night mainly because our difficulty in accommodating training and a lot of that involves junior teams having to play quite late into the night we're also struggling to meet the demand particularly in the growth area of our sport got some very exciting strategies being developed by hockey New Zealand that are really involved engaging with schools in bringing them into the support we really can't accommodate them in our current facilities we also have issue around eastern clubs and schools who all has to travel for the Northwest to get to our current hockey venues and given the city that we're looking to and gate 11 that becomes very difficult that another message want to give us that we are currently the facilities we currently have an adequate for us to host major tournaments internationals and particularly we see that as we're the city can obtain a national game has as masters where you have 40 plus teams all of a mature age group looking to make a significant contribution to the I guess the accommodation and hospitality areas of Christchurch we certainly see huge benefits of working in a hub concept I think it's one of the positives that have resulted and the current environment is that the sports are all working together we initially came together I think because of the physical demands but we actually following through and to other areas so certainly when we look at athletics and penis canopy hockey see real benefits and having us in the same same location we need a commitment the ability for us to continue to take our sport along the strategies we have really as dependent on our plant facilities so in summary I think from my perspective addition from Kennedy hockey we need no pinner wat nie pinner why we don't have a plan B we need stable and sharable land to put our turf so on we see the benefit of no pune by being to fold a releases pressure on but also then it gives us international standard facilities which we can then host national international and major tournaments so that's our playing perspective I like to do is pass over to petered out and look probably trust the facility's owning perspective thank you and good morning the camporee artificial surfaces trust was established in two thousand around the building of park park and it was established to own the artificial surfaces it works closely with the council and with Canterbury hockey to determine what the turf requirements are and to manage the financing and construction of them since the loss of the two water-based surfaces apart the priorities of the trust have been fiercely to establish the two new San based Tiff's that none week Park the club hockey at a cost of three and a half million dollars for the two of them now other priority of course is to develop two new water based surfaces to replace the pirate park for club and representative hockey so in that regard firstly we fully support the Pune way concept secondly we have three million dollars in we can raise any additional capital funding required we can start immediately and we believe that the investment that we can make will add significant value to the council's investment in our pune way the very simple messages thank you very much so common hockey's perspective I think our summary is that we think sport and empathic oh ho kia is essential for the rebuild both an I guess well-being but also an economic return we've kept the sport growing but we're now being limited by our facilities we fully support the partnership approach with both the other sports and the council around I pin away and as Peter said we've got we've got funds to bring to the table for your investment when our Passover tennille cura good morning and thank you for this opportunity my name's Neil prior on the chief executive for tennis Canterbury region and representing tennis Canterbury is the operational entity for tennis and also representing the Wilding Park Foundation which is the facilities owner for tennis in this region I'd like to begin my comments by pune why we are very very supportive and enthusiastic about this concept like hockey and athletics we see this as an opportunity that presents our three sports to collaborate and to co-locate there are significant benefits and in such a concept and it's evidenced by the strong collaboration between those three sports it's not just a collocation opportunity its collaboration and partnership and community it's not just facilities it's an important valuable community asset it's an opportunity in fact for Christ use to lead New Zealand with a world-class multiple sports facility it's an addition to the community and it's not necessarily just an earthquake replacement it will cater for local regional national and international events and are supported strongly by sport New Zealand and sport Canterbury and in fact makes up a key element of these spaces places and people's home so that's the our comments behind nappeun away as a concept in terms of tennis in particular it has tennis Canterbury in the Wilding Park foundations preferred in fact only green fields opportunity there is no plan B we can contribute cash towards this development for the facilities aspect of it like our other two sports we have also grown participation and you would have heard Julian falloon make comment about that we have returns in fact exceeded beyond pre-earthquake levels of participation that in itself provides pressures on our sport to accommodate those wishing to play it with the facilities that are required to do so so those renewed pressure on us to provide those facilities to the community if this was to be chosen we are ready to go but we do need some certainty and commitment from council that it will in fact proceed for us to continue our commitment and enthusiasm for the project our preferences for a try sport single-stage development and we do have an internal deadline at governance level of 30 sep tember to get some indication from council that this can be taken to the next stage of full feasibility so in summary we have a strong commitment tunapuna way and have the financial means to invest and facilities there but we do need the confidence to retain our enthusiasm for and I think we've got a few minutes to take some questions thank you and so can I just be clear from hockey and tennis this point of view once cancel it just assume council makes the decision about nap in a way you guys can actually go ahead and put the investment in there too for your facilities at least hockey and tennis Oh a lot boost on behalf of tennis we sit with this is our preferred green fields option however we are committed to making sure that we are making the right decision and will take into that decision the opinions of our wider tennis community however it is our preferred option we're ready to go if we're newbie yes but we're ready to go there will need to be some I mean we can proceed as soon as we've got a bit of land but it does need to be some infrastructure obviously like power roading and what have you horizontal infrastructure I believe us to these days thank you just a question of press both hockey and tennis and I of lost athletics swimming hockey at pirate Park and potentially tennis at wildin park as well which is sort of a quite a huge loss to the eastern suburbs a question for tennis I suppose the existing facility are there any parts of that facility that would be retained as playable tennis surfaces in the future quite possibly we have reinstated facilities there on an interim basis so we've repaired indoor and outdoor courts if we were to move tunapuna why I believe that those facilities could be retained for the Eastern communities thank you and for hockey you mentioned in your presentation a lack of facilities in the East is there any longer term plan to to reinstate surfaces in the East as well the difficulty is obtaining stable and that can be ensured we have engaged with some party such as schools the difficulty there gives their competing demands on their on their resources obviously pirate park isn't recoverable so at the moment the focus very much as on being able to be creative around our existing facilities and with our existing game and looking forward yeah Davis questions but but it was think we were the world in park we didn't invest with you in that area we would certainly like them make sure that it is retained and some level for that area yeah and a very good comment poor liguilla we're very understanding of the studies situation east and west so you know if it was possible oh no your long-term Oh basis would would like to see some facilities retained there but there is a lot of decision-making that would go and behind it but in and thank you for the investment thank you
Thanks Brendon anyway hi take yourself at home Thank driven hi my name's Brendan right um I currently use the gymnasium at jelly part at five thirty in the morning my I've seen submission put forward about changing the time frame for that I think there's quite a fan umber of people that are there at five thirty in generally on there before the doors open so I think they've all made submissions as well hey ray I just wanted with us somebody was before you finally make up your mind if somebody was going to do a survey at five-thirty see how many people are there and occupying the gymnasium making sure it's been used I appreciate the council has to run the facility well and proper Animal spose profitably or so it breaks even for the council so it's not costing a lot of money but am if we could see there and I've seen quite a few people taking photos and I think they'll be here as well so it's all of it say thank you very much on the subject there are obviously an astonishing amount of people who go to the gym at five thirty in the morning so I start wicked seeming so I'm willing to take your word on that actually when I go to work every share and go I start the day so I'd like to stay so Jim who instead of say cutting hours in the morning if we were to cut them in the evening would that work I mean would loves people I mean I did the gym in the morning or used to but yeah I've spoken to a few staff over the last few days see my morning's reading there and I've seen quite a few people running well with iphones yeah the last couple of weeks taking photos of actually hand many people in the gym and I know there's quite a few people and especially in the summer months that use the pulp la dairy at their training in the outdoor pool and will I've no doing exercise of some form prescription I spoke to a few people me and they see if it it's probably caught or not that it is in the morning yeah I'm never gonna shout happily earlier go how fast I thought I might might fit you guys I don't know but yeah yeah think what you think it's quite busy in the one it's extremely busy that's wrought thank you Jesus thing over
And we have next Jane who isn't going to make it today and nirelle is sick and brendan is running wee bit late or actually probably on time but Robert Upton from burnside Rugby Football Club thanks for a bit and thank you for being but early as well deputy mayors and councillors my name is Robert Upton I am the executive assistant to the board of the bins I directly Football Club and I'm also the Secretary of our touch module on my left is Robert Clark who is the chairman of the bruns I rugby football club board of directors viously can I thank you for the opportunity to make the submission this morning on behalf of our club by submission particularly relates to the fees and charges for all parks bench and on page 145 of your draft plan and in particular it relates for the classifications used by council to determine the charge rates to be applied when the sporting club utilizes a club playing facility there are currently as I'm certain you're both all aware two classifications namely casual hires for sports clubs are now organized and conductor has changed significantly over the last two decades previously sporting organizations were very dependent on their national and their regional bodies to provide the overarching leadership and administration required to organize and conduct and play the games today many sporting clubs are very professionally managed and are more than capable of operating in all respects and dependent of their national or regional body our club prides itself on its independence so much so that late last year our board decided that rather than to pay touch affiliation fees that money could be better utilized employing more staff at our club to organize her own sport was only then that we discovered that to use burnside Park for our touch module we would need to pay the council twenty-nine thousand dollars a year thirty six thousand dollars under proposed increases in the draft plan as our module would be classified as casual higher from the researcher that I've been able to undertake the Genesis for the present two classifications would appear to be more historical than contemporary as sport has evolved and changed fees for using playing fields should also be reviewed and updated and as a start point our club would contend that as a minimum of third classification is now appropriate for which a small fee could be paid simply their classification would apply to nonaffiliated sporting clubs that organize and conduct tournaments modules for a duration of at least 10 weeks put some context around in 1983 members of our Rugby Club organized the cert a sevens tournament that year and which 2016's participated over the years thanks to the drive and the hard work of many many volunteers the team numbers have grown and this year we hosted 216 playing over two nights for about 20 weeks of the year this equates the equivalent of about 2300 individual players I was respectfully submit that redeem this level of usages casual is inappropriate our module has played in a number of sections and I think it's worthy of note that many of our mixed social teams which make up the bulk of our module because we're not in the competitive elite go again is either based around would contend that our module contributes to the health and fitness of a significant number of people from all sectors of the Christchurch community and demographics and unlike most other modules we provide trained referees many of these referees are senior high school pupils who are recordin ator upgrades and up skills to a level that they can participate in referee gains in their own right and as well as this new school we would contend that further enhances the developments of the individuals and their attributes such as maturity conflict resolution decision-making there have been a number of pundits and weird agree with them who have argued that taken over all our module be viewed as a community and social service ideally from our perspective the charges associated with our new proposed classification should be free what these council staff has some discretion in that area realistically however in the current economic climate a small fee would seem appropriate and we would recommend a fee per team registered to play in that module and the value of that fee should equate to the casual higher fee of currently forty-seven if this fee was agreed to based on this year's figures next season our module would play the council about ten thousand three hundred dollars rather than the current proposed thirty six thousand dollars if our recommended classification is not agreed it wouldn't be financially viable for our board or logical for us to continue to organize and conduct the module without a sizable increase in our annual subscription fees we know that it is already a difficult challenge for a number of our teams to find this fee and any increase would definitely compound that situation and probably result in number of the teams withdrawing without wishing to stereotype some of the teams that would be forced to withdraw are those that in our opinion for a number of reasons benefit considerably from their current involvement let me make it very clear as the unanimous desire of our Board of Directors to continue to provide organized sport exercise and social interaction for 2,300 people from all sectors of Christchurch society for about five months of the year the council accepts our proposals as I've articulated them has been an integral part of the northwest part of Christ Church for over 30 years will continue to flourish and grow again kai thank you for the opportunity to present thank you you made that point very well and interesting that we haven't_''_432.49 changed those classifications for some time are there any questions Danny thank you for your submission just really interested in you know one of the issues council has is the ongoing maintenance of parks and just we really should do you as a club do much of the maintenance or contribute or is it something you've considered that you could do that might might be an improved level of service or is it something you'd prefer that we just keep doing well mostly and currently the council max the parks and that sort of thing that's ongoing maintenance but we employee was in our club most mainly by volunteers who go out and Remo at each week because you know the grass grows and city cared most certainly are not around that frequently on the back and we'd be happy to being affiliated the Christchurch see council get paid nothing if we remain affiliated we wouldn't have to pay a cent it's always amazed me how rugby fields up look a lot nicer than soccer fields but there's obviously a local level you do a lot in all of that ways and in some areas so um that's that's good I think that's an interesting conversation project for us to have going forward thank you
In your particular area and the first submitters that we have ad della Seymour and Julian yes agree from sport New Zealand and sport category you will see a little clock but ah I'm not do it not during your presentation but you just so you're aware from the start there's 15 minutes and we will tend to keep to those times sure white quite rigorously at the end of your presentation little pop walk thank you very much did one we are in your hands great thank you very much good morning everyone is an interaction just said from Vicky that my name is Julian flown on the chief executive sport Canterbury and this is Dallas see more a relationship manager based in Christchurch from sport New Zealand so we made a dual submission to you today I guess that the key thing in terms of our presentation was going to summarize the key points that we really want to make today and I think the first thing is that we believe that there's a huge potential for an upper no way to become a key sports that have had a huge impact from the earthquake if it looks hockey and tennis and we think it's a facility hub that has huge potential in the collaborative way I think the last three years have shown our ability as a sector to bring sports together and work together and the three sports will come after me this morning will actually show that message of how collaborative actually are we think this huge potential beyond the three sports from a sport and recreation perspective to show greater wider collaboration and time and by positioning this facility in an open way environment the future potential of growth of sporting recreational infrastructure and participation is fantastic and we think it's obviously the last three years and part of the not turn away concept is around replacing an upgrade in current facilities but it's also an opportunity to add to the sport and recreation network obviously the last three years have been about recovery but this is the the first concept we believe that can actually add a huge amount of value to the infrastructure of sport of our our presentation but we think it's one of the few projects that were obviously requiring significant capital that will actually bring stakeholder investment to the table Dallas and I doubt myself from support Canaries affected along with Dallas from support new zealand's perspective been trying to advocate for some government investment both from the government but also from the national community trust investments to add to this project and that in addition to the capital that Tookie sports especially hockey and tennis can bring to the table and contribute to to the night away concept over the last three years I've been leading and cheering recovery processes focused on a strategic document called places of spaces places and people and I just want to touch on it because the collaborative leadership process that we've been leading around recovery that's involved the key agencies of sport New Zealand obviously sport Canterbury but the three councils of which Christ your city has been key along with Sarah and we've been focusing on four key outcomes around bringing participation back to pre with great levels Christchurch residents to both participate perform in Excel and as you have a strategy in place where those facilities and that infrastructure can allow a talented athletes to remain in Canterbury we also had a go around bringing major sporting events back to the city and obviously with rugby world cup not coming to Christchurch that's been a huge driver and I'll show you some imagery in the month around cricket world cup and how we revitalize a map linking tanar pune why we've been advocating over the last three years or with our key principles around collocation and efficiencies around that hubbing of not just one sport and isolation but collaborative of sports and focus on partnership some of the work I'm getting involved with a seer at the moment it's wild in sport and recreation but this initiative really at the moment is around I believe a partnership between three key sports or anchor sports with potential for growth beams of participation I thought take the opportunity to celebrate really is that as I said which one of our goals was to bring and we celebrated in the three sports that are going to come and later on if joined in that celebration is that we're back to one hundred percent of priya Thwaite levels and some of the sports and tennis is one example that they've actually pushed through and Tim the participation they're actually higher than they were pre youthquake and that creates another issue around this project is the opportunity to cater for a facility of the structure the case for growth as well as recovery and but we've celebrated that the second thing in terms of infrastructure and places and spaces to play sport and physical activity I want to show you some imagery around and celebrate the council work in terms of rebuild as well well knowledge in that we don't have a 50-minute into a pool or an athletics track you know the ami stadium built in 100 days worth to from the old am I with like some carisbrooke a fantastic opportunity to bring back outdoor sporting events to the city and your council has been key to that that the land they've been repaired Cal stadium I think was close to five hundred thousand dollars with her appears and strengthening that your council contributed to getting their indoor facility up and running post-earthquake Washington Way and councillor Yannick Giants has been passionate about that we know so that's been a huge you go down there on a friday night and see the amount of participation that's happening around that facility for our young people so that's a fantastic achievement as well a throne ground Condon sport recreation center up there because I think that's an example of while it was planned and started pre earthquake and then completed the post-earthquake there's a great example of your council partnering in ministry of education alongside the Northlands mall in terms of a collaboration collaborative project of a hub of Sport and Recreation and obviously that the enhancement of the cricket oval along with the pavilion will add to bringing the world cup to christchurch in February and obviously the Metro which is a key discussion point in another key hub in terms of the network which all very well that's not catering for the three key sports that will follow up this morning with after my presentation around the need for both growth and enhanced network of facilities for both hockey in tennis but also athletics because they don't have an all-weather effort extract those the infrastructure of facilities that I've just shown you doesn't cater for those three sports and that's why we believe that the napper no way sport and Rec really school and recreation hub is really the solution and a collaborative way for those three sports we're advocating for the first three phases and we believe based on the conversations that we've been having with the three sports that those three phases can happen in conjunction and that's probably the council has to work their way through it so we need math lead extract we need a hockey to couple of hockey tubes and in a tennis center and we think and Dallas will talk a little bit the Roma sources in the moment that that is the priority that is a fantastic opportunity with population is growing and we also believe that there's a lot of other sport and recreation happening around the Canterbury agricultural park is now pulling away as well equestrian is an interesting one in terms of eventing with Dallas and I met with Christian New Zealand yesterday and from a venting perspective and cross-country perspective not a pro not applicable to not put away mcclain's island as their preferred hub but definitely for a queer student team to show jumping dressage that the current facility allows for years polos obviously there in rugby league so there's a nice neat have already there that both athletics tennis and hockey can add to in a collaborative way jealous so in terms of the investment as we said we'll leave both Tennyson nokia talk about their own particular situations but we're working with through our CEO and board international gaming trust to bring some some resource to the table to make sure that we can add to the capital the capital cost of of getting up in a way off the ground we don't have final contingent with as to what the council decision is on point away but we're very active in that space in it also the overall concept of not burn away aligns with our national facility strategy which is currently draft and looking to be a signed off by our board in the next couple of months as well so well we can't give any quantum around what investment we came bring to the table we're certainly serious about getting as much capital to the table that we can bring together to helping up when I get off the ground and we direct knowledge and recognized out the situation that the council is in with the current rebuild of Christchurch and and the reporters come back from court amenta and we're back your knowledge net we're more than happy to to step up and play our part to to help christchurch up and gets back on its feet and helpless etiquette because I get back get back on its feet as well one final comment that we'd like to finish with is and we believe that regional atwill class regional community facility so yes while it will be able to cater for the high end of sport this is really from from a sport cannery Pacific perspective a community facility to allow for community participation of grassroots sport in addition to be able to hold events competitions for the high end of school and that's where the three sports will talk to you a little bit more detail later on this morning yeah hi guys thanks for that in terms of this not being in the draft annual plan have you had much conversation with staffs I know we're due to get a big briefing on it quite shortly do you know what their current position is on this the concept plan that you've been working closely with some bet reckon esteem do our Council and the concept plans that I showed you there being created an association with council yeah so it is it is still happening as far as you're concerned but just slightly delayed that's our understanding of us so we asked for a feasibility last year's anything but there was a concept what the last council did was asked for money be put aside to do a feasibility which is just finished and we still haven't been briefed on that but we have made that feasibility study available to the sports groups into the amv Association so people can see the work the next step for us is to get a briefing on it and then make decisions about whether we were stupid wish to receive good morning thanks for your presentation you had a slide up there before referring to collaborative investment and one of your partners and that was the National Gaming trusts to what extent does this project rely on funding from game interests we know the first the first three stages which is based around atletico key in tennis currently that plan that that's been put up by councillors around 35 million dollars again we'll leave the other two sports to talk about their contributions but what we are working in the background with sport New Zealanders to bring sport New Zealand investment to the table and work with the table as well tear to their capital cost again we don't know that the quantum is yet and will carry on with those discussions if I guess dependent on the on the council decision as well reasonably she's never going to amount we're looking to get a reasonably significant amount yes just wondered with the Metro sports facility what your involvement if any has been with that and if you see replication and this and just what your position is on my colleague Richard Lindsey he's a national facilities advisors on the project team and working very closely with counsel Sarah and although the parties involved with planning for the Metro this this is this adds to the infrastructure we do here it's not it doesn't cut across anything that both athletics hockey and antennas have so it skating for different sports and also caters for a wider recreation space as well so this is adding this is complementary to capitalize complimentary to the metro center can you spend some thank you for your presentation this week some concern about the area of and I'm just wondering is there a material for all and all weather type track or playing field that in fact would be pervious do you know if if that's Patera outstanding is that that quality of land has already been assessed by the feasibility that's been completed on the and it's fine for building yes sorry just asking OBO the possibility of a material which would be all weather our coach might be pervious do you know if it like available I'm not not aware that as far as I know whether athletics tricks they are impervious to water and this is the nature of the of the service that they have to run and compete on yeah thank you I guess just as that this is this is a one I guess but the the pub we want to concentrate on our submission but as part of our submission as well as to thank and acknowledge the the input that council puts into sport and recreation it's all I will take the our submission is red but really want to acknowledge the value to to the city as a whole in as a nova certainly coming down a former from the Christchurch years ago as a student support and recreations have been a big part of the city so we think the council via contribution then we have to take this forward as well and support you and me thank you okay guys thank you
And what did you say to him okay welcome to everybody who's here and thank you very much indeed for putting in submissions and for coming and telling us what what you want done
Albans residents association Emma are you staying sitting at the table for the Courtney's street as well I am yes yep it's great yeah good here all day now that's my rating is great sorry just what we sort of wrecked out my name is Jonathan course and this is sade the first time I've seen a number of you round the council table I'd like to say well done the election was something that certainly warmed me off trying for local politics and I don't envy you your job and dealing with a situation that's likely to be thankless and with the bottom line that's going to be tighter than assembly that I'm not going to elaborate on we just enjoy it we enjoyed your campaigning that's all well I do it again but I'll be there for your entertainment next time anyway I just like to take oh I like to introduce DNA genome okay she's a member of our committee as well hello I wrote you guys a leader at the footpath so we've in our paper submission and there's fairly detailed so I'm not going to sit here and read straight off it because there is a fair bit there and we've only got a certain amount of time I just like to say by starting that sin albans as a community that we represent is well it's a little bit special it is the first suburb north of the central city and a lot of the the rebuilders picta has pitched at rebuilding the central city and making it a jewel well around the jewel you've got to have setting and I think some Albans is quite an important part of the central city setting it does have main roads coming into it from from the north and it is often it adds up to the general picture of people who are visiting christchurch send albans has an enormous amount of potential as being one of those suburbs that we want to make melbourne look like some weird outback town and we want christchurch to be cosmopolitan we wanted to be funky we want it to be capability being one of those villages and now it's it's populated by people who are enthusiastic about living in Christchurch they've stayed here that resisted the temptation to move out to places like Pegasus and regular wood England kaiapoi and Ralston but we also sadly have to endure them traveling through Christ you are through sand albans twice a day it's a city adds a suburb that's taken a bit of a kicking in terms of its earthquake effects it's suffered as much as the eastern suburbs but it's also had the the very well publicized flooding episodes and I'd like to also thank Mary Wilson for allowing you in particular but I'm met Amir to get at least four words out before she interrupted in the interviews fucktons just one part of the overall picture of sand Albans and it is something that we do address in this plan but it's it's only one of the things that that San Albans has facing it we have a community identity that goes back to the very foundations of Christchurch soon when the the council addresses this but it has been there all along it whether it's edgware or whether it's matter how or whether it's surely there's there's a lot of conjecture and we'd like to them to ask the council to give it some consideration that sin Orleans is its own community and it does have an enthusiastic staff of volunteers what staff is entirely the wrong word volunteer is the citizens in sador burns who do a lot of work for the community but we are asking that the council do take this into account and give those volunteers some support now part of that is the community grants funding there are a number of projects within us at Albans that Iran listed in our in our submission and we we need the council's help made the council's help we're in an area that it is being tested currently but it's very well publicized 500 million dollar shortfall personally I recommend you could save 230 million dollars by kicking the stadium to touch but that's not need help we do need the staff we need they're not just the council table but we need the council staff themselves to to lend us a hand it's a big part of what we do we need need the council to help us I think I'd like to just add there that I think the history of the st. Albans community and the involvement of the people and the volunteers goes back 50-odd years in the area and with the current situation that we've got at the moment I think st. Albans could prove itself to be a community that would be very supportive of the council and the direction it's taking but also very capable of actually doing a lot of the work itself and making the city a place that people want to come to without taking too much resource from the city so and we'd like to read really like to be involved in doing that and making this a place that's on a great place to live and part of that examples the Sun organs community center if you guys have been here all day it's been a fairly long day of listening to submissions but if you drip out as if you drove past the Sun or burns community center has waited on the way here it's currently shut that was not the way it used to be used to be open there used to be someone there and you've got a crew of volunteers who are perfectly prepared to administer it and keep it open for the community so it can be used but again we need the council's help in order to to get in there and get it open the Sun or burns community center is the nerve center of what sorry used to do in the community and the fact that it's closed in a post earthquake environment when we're trying to strengthen communities that's just untenable you need to be perfectly honest I think there is no space I look at communities from around the beach areas and so forth they have spaces they can naturally go to an area light sound in a in't have anywhere we can actually meet without having to go through a booking system or paying for something so it makes makes those connections within community very difficult makes sharing information very difficult and it makes building relationships very difficult so it's really important that we have that back so we can help start our community cover yeah an example of that is the Oscar after schools program that currently has no home it's just been made homeless bites in Auburn's primary school and it's a very important part of the the child care for a number of parents who do work in San Albans if the community center was open Oscar would have a home and it would solve a lot of people's problems we also have a number of issues with our green spaces with our community facilities in space and cinnabuns park is a meijer you can't walk across it without gumboots said factors that I speak and a nose bigger the set factors that a lot of christ church was built on a swamp and that's why we burns park is just diabolical even in summer I was a resident of Barbados street just 100 metres away from the pack digging postholes you've only got to go down half a meter to get to the water table and you'll know better than anyone with the the flockton basin issues incidentally fought in the basin was never called that prior to the flooding nobody had even heard of it it's it's a situation that needs solving ends we don't have a lot of green spaces who don't have a village green that's that's currently up and operating you know the saga of the edge where pull just needs a bit of love it's an Albans and in terms of that damn that sort of green space and village green that people need to communal we've actually just lost another village green with the pulse it√≠s with the drilling of the water wells so it's been closed off to the community for about the last four months and the people lead at the volunteers leading that group have fallen space within st. Albans that due to not being able to find any common ground with the council it's been lost so another loss for our community as well hmm and just before I start blathering about transport because some all burners as a float and it does have an arterial route through it there's a lot of residents who are experiencing heightened levels of earthquake stress because of large vehicles coming down the street your whole house does move you don't know whether it's another earthquake that's going to knock your socks off or if it's just a track going past and I'll add that to that as well for the safety I mean teenagers told me a story yesterday I don't know if you are aware of portney Street which will be talking about later but he now has two years Courtney street to get around and she told me last night when I was dropping her off after our meeting that when she can't get down the footpath because of the pothole she goes down down the street 300-meter stretch of road as 98 kilometers now so every time she's doing that she's putting in life at risk can also just point out that he na is prohibited by government for putting lights or reflectors on a rare wheelchair yes is their policy and the moment but she can't go down the footpath that's it's fairly stack in terms of transport as well some audiences about to lose to bus services 118 in the the metro star which connects new brighton so we don't have access to the beach by bus and there's a lot of people and slow low incomes who love going to the bus to the beach and they can't do that but we have access a little too important people like going to littleton as well if we don't have those choices are being a typical kiwi how are we supposed to be a typical kiwi that's it so sorry you lost a bus service yeah we're going to lose the meat for herself services so that end it is that it can service is it connects the elderly with your family or not but it does contribute to the overall transport picture or that's at albans that then I don't think it's a lot of tourists because we're the home of the Crusaders in the OM dragon so we get a lot of tourists and it's nice to see the income and engage with st. Albans residents yeah st. Albans has no inaccessible buildings right and its sub 0 which is quite employee but however if you look at the be accessible thing that's a government policy and I don't think that will work for the residents of Christchurch because of what happened with the central government it's not going to work so it needs to be a social change editor because last year at st. Albans was part of the inclusive communities project run by the Human Rights Commission and we did a lot of Education in connecting and I led that project and people understood I got people to understand what it's like from their families protective on the air the no cut downs and people connected on that wet hmm and every time I speak to one of my elderly residents they can eke to me through understanding what access is like and it never happened when I came in a week after the earthquake I'm not treated like a stranger write down someone else right okay and there are several other transport and access related issues that are highlighted in that report but I just like to go back to the idea of that new york-style village that we want Christchurch to be very cool we'd also like to the council to give consideration to extend the tram network in to enter which way hmm it's there's endless amounts of possibilities there and potential it could be a jewel of a suburb and also 10 minutes on the on this one's kind of are I don't know whether you want to kind of share a little but we're going to take five more minutes of Courtney Street time to put to the search albans you you can you can do anyway everything at the two submissions is a total amount keep going okay yep well ought to be fair I think I've said my piece about it's all in front of you and paper and yet we appreciate your consideration but then I'll hand over onto the the more cortland street SP well before I go back on go to the court nice tree I just like to add to that this whole st. Albans community identity it's been very strong for since Christ richburg and I mean there was christchurch city and there was a saint albans city that's it right beside it and it was his own city when it when it first started and and st. Albans as in a burrow sorry in a award that looks outward so going towards our identity I think that's a big issue for our community because we've actually always been connected to the city st. Albans area has always been connected to the city and that's where and the way the structure of the city is at the moment we made two outward and I think I think are coming up very soon we'd love to be involved in that conversation to see our community be situated correctly within the city within the city you're speaking my language this is the new way of doing a representation review that we're working on we would love to be involved in that exact you will be you will be having a meeting the volunteers it's free labor that does it's connected lately but what what I see I mean I won't tell you what I want you know what I want I want communities to define themselves and to look around at the SS and depth their neighbors and decide how a proper planning environment or what a proper planning environment and a voting environment would look like at around 50,000 people mm-hmm how's that that's great it's great I think well I think st. Aubin says about 22 the area that we recognize as st. Albans which they are very different to what the council recognizes in their community profiles at the present time the community yeah I think we recognized is about 22,000 homes and the st. Albans area so bixolon yeah all right so that spent a few thousand people Oh Vicki and well we've got one more part of the equation so yes do I don't you want to deal with the whole lot together it's so just Courtney street yep okay so then we can we can have questions across the lot yeah so Courtney street I'm here megared para conor from courtney street we have arrows courtney street as classified as a collector road but it functions as a local road this is a hangover from the 1960s from a plane from the 1960s and we really like to see the name of our the classification of our road changed from from a collector back to a local to provide security for our community which includes nine children three people over the age of 80 a school a whole school of children right beside it an English park on the other sorry no English party moraines in ASB park on the other side a community that wants it rather than being there for cars so we'd love to see that specification changed please right ok questions now I've got Bucky then Jimmy and and Phil I'm really sorry that your own counselors aren't here to that this afternoon they were here all day today or tomorrow way out they had another meeting yesterday on the radio on the way here a shin see how they see see how quickly how quickly things happen around here now that we try it is great to see ok Becky and a couple of things the the sindh albans community center what's actually stopping the result sorry the Suburbans community center that you've mentioned here what's actually stopping there being open ah access to be fair at the moment there's a system where whoever wants to use the community center has to go up to the service interrupted papanui to get the key open the community center use it then drop the key back and then come back to its enormous community want to run up themselves why they which is the same be performed in heavy traffic we've gone to the community board and I'd like to acknowledge mike davidson see it and we are trying to work through that at the moment so there's no physical reason why thing can't_''_1023.91 be used no it's just people we had to pry there yeah no no no I'm totally get that but it's just a no they're acidification yeah okay yes it's because of issues with the past council unfortunately we weren't oh I remember you were possession about we weren't involved in the placement of the new building on the site we were left out of that discussion and the management agreement between the city council and ourselves was broken with it by the last council yeah and we're trying to go through a process of the moment damn with the current community board and it is a positive process it is fairly open we do have to jump through a few hoops in terms of tendering to them to administer the building but it's a it's a we would really just like the key yeah really well I mean our God cheer for even at the community board coming next we might have come yeah community fatigue is huge in our communities our bodies poring over our pro bono that we want to try and help now so okay would be handy and asaf me but that's because I'm just intrigued and it's not really a council issue are you really not allowed to put reflectors on your wheelchair no really yes really happens if you do well could I think there might be some Lords up but I'm trying to try and change it I'm in the prices are getting a new when it's gonna take six weeks right um I'm sorry Jimmy was Nick sorry apology I'll quickly two questions at first one you request counsel no to that of the candle items I'm concerned where for each item do you have a kind of your plane plane and Carvallo can friend priorities and also cause the fundraising sh 0 all council is unique so solo it again it's it's difficult to get it together because the fatigue but and we have it we've put so we went out and out we we see that our community we've come up with what they want us to do we've also looking at with putting some effort and resources and to studying and to social enterprise because the one lesson that we've learned post-earthquake is that we actually need to support our self but at the present time it's just a wee bit difficult to get to do that as well as keeping all our other projects going as well so what the st. Albans residents association is looking at doing is actually building a social enterprise around a BBQ trailer that we've had funded and so and we're just about to put a structure little sort of structure with that too so that we can actually go out and make money yeah and sarah has its own strategic planning for issues that it raises including the community center we're going to run out of time so Tim courtney street was it still in them it was it successful it was sixth the reclassification of the actual name hasn't been done we were told at the time of the resource consent that and there was something that we had to come and deal with through the annual plan process so we got a resource consent to build the road as a local road so the road is being built when it's being built as a local road but it still has the collector road status on it so the design is as a local road through the resource consent process and the classification is still a collector road so the closer kocian going to be changed as it that's what we're asking you as well sir we've just lift we note here that yeah yeah so let's just get VickI's just come up with an idea that we should have a things we can fix in a day day make sure you publicize it do it on the street the comics to read a bit it is high street nice but time but I think you here that's like your watch it on all these it but I was at Paul yani was gonna be another question of so this is a reference to something if you don't don't with your indulgence please oh that will pay for your don't you I have to because I'll be brief he referred I think just briefly that us a better staff you me and I just wondered is your association like an example of a group who neeks prep some seating funding sorry than fact you can have someone work with you and that that person be paper we did have a slow we actually had five staff before the earthquake yeah we were in like there's a lot of projects in person area yeah so much history I could be here all day but as positive we want to look forward not there yeah yeah agree again Yanni yes I am so the new councils really keen to look forward so there have been previous issues here but I think the Keating is what were you already asked for announced an explanation from stuff about the axis how many people were using the center how they access it the community water picking it no no I just go badly sorry we've gotta gotta truncate yeah it's gonna it's going no no but with no but please just we actually need to try and katie on a different night just to point out because we've heard that issue of accessibility come up so we have actually had a committee structure now with the community Queenie has a specific tumor reference to include disability and we are doing work with the disability sector to get the issues highlighted and raised further after the government's level so I think that's a real serious disability action action so Medici cool so my many other odd yeah new councils really came to be more proactive in that space yeah but agreed looking forward not back and we'll move on thank you very very much everybody yeah
Nice to see you Jonathan mike mike davidson from the shirley papanui community board before before you start can you tell us whether we'll be tripping over any process if we just fix the things so that they don't have to go out to tender um yes Oh someone else's classes I don't have all the information in front of me so yeah from the biz my memory I know like the community board wants to move forward and there's a issue for us and I know there's been some some issues in the past with the whole situation in from my memory I believe it was they wanted to make sure the opportunity was for everyone in the community to obviously be involved with that conversation with the PIAT with their community well we didn't want to look like we're just favor in one organization except that you'd be favoring the one that's been doing up for years before the earthquakes and then being that earthquake comes along and suddenly the rules change so I mean it's just go beyond there but it I agree engage the community and the conversation was had within the board in there were there was definitely board members that were they wanted to make sure I was open to everyone within the area to make sure that we were using it to its best advantage and obviously being closed is not using it rightly so and also a director members of transitional facility and I think the bigger conversation is on the pyramid happens first Europe with a net went within that site and it's important that we actually get that sorted so moving moving forward we actually have the proper building and facility they're all service the whole of them st. Albans yep so sorry to sort of three is an important conversation there we are we are having and we are aware what's what's involved with the obviously that going back and forth to the peppery service center to use yeah okay all good so far away okay so we've got this for four key priorities for action that we've noted as part of cycle waste program and we obviously aware of the extension of their from five to eight eight years but as a board would actually like to see sort of a year to year timeline for the delivery of that cycle way we think it's obviously a very important aspects get in the public transpo as a whole but also been able to get people out of the cars to try and ease some of that congestion we took that cycle way the pepper new parallel is going to be very key to doing that within our area so we sort of want to see it actually a detailed year to year of where it's going to move move forward we're also at support of mixtones instead of the slow slow road we just think it's going to be better for the community to know that entering into a shared the area not just a when it's a cycle you need to slow down to the their speed so we also request that a public engagement be a high priority and their borders involved in all is the stormwater drainage flood protection and control as of soup we are aware that there has been a lot of movement forward with this of this issue with the task force is one of the thing as the border encourages the council to assist with the radiation of dwellings in the flockton base and slater street area they don't actually meet the minimum four levels specified so what's obviously sue my favorite one is the houses that are getting flooded above floor floor level when there's a 150 year event and I think one of the things to remember is it doesn't take too much rain for this area to flood and I know over the last six weeks we've had some pretty big rain events and like the March one which obviously was a one and plus 100 year event but doesn't take that type of event to actually cause what we're seeing in the flockton area and obviously this is causing a huge amount of stress financially emotionally and physically to the residents within that within that area so one as they are buying properties with that buyback option once the remediation work has been completed and approximately two years time or going well next we have the regional parks and the board notes that the parks budget will be redistributed between the original and sports parks activities and there's been little detail provider on the rationale for the proposed redistribution of the sub of this so the board is concerned about the impact on the reduction and the budget on future staffing and operational services service levels for the regional parks for example the it was brought to the board's attention that will likely affect pest and weed control and lastly the board is highly support of the community funding scheme and recognize the significant cost benefit values that are participating groups and organizations provide to the city and people and so the board supports their attention other community grants fine at 7.7 76 million very good I think that the stormwater drainage flood protection control I mean I guess that the advantage of the task force approach has been to identify that yes you know half the consequences are widespread throughout that that area even though it might be only half the furnished poor levels that are breached and an event but as you say it's a minor event that will flood the floor levels but we now have because of the whole situation that we've confronted that we now have really good data right across the city and we're improving that all the time I think that your community board has been tremendous in terms of the way that it's worked with council staff and and tried to bring the community together to deal with what would have to be the hardest issue that we've had to face that's thus far in our new council tomb so I mean well done on what you've done so far but we know that communication has to be lifted and that we need to truth test a lot of the information that we've got on that document now I'm Phil thanks to your submission it's very thoughtful Mike and just for start studying on the cycleways look I further consultations with communities as the goings I'm wondering if there might be the time to actually have those conversations with people and if for example there's your community follows your suggestions about the circle ways being said a different place like a mixed zone there that could potentially follow would that be a way up so the process you think this could be achieved by yes yeah I think it's just important that obviously Brigid as much consultation and conversation happening and you know it's going at eight years which we accept I think it's important also that we know exactly sort of after each year what stage we're going to be there yet so we can know in a year's time exactly where everything as I think that will sort of change a little love the attitude for it being extended here and and I think you're aware that we we can't we didn't want to raise people's expectations about the time and you've given that people would want them sooner yeah okay no that's else have any questions or I just the only thing I'll mention one doesn't I guess that on the flooding we we very much want to make sure that we we communicate well will continue to communicate well I think with the residents fishing flockton basin and that we want to hear back from people too and you get this IC am I holding so what what we're proposing to do is that people like in and other community representatives in fact we have some ongoing dialogue with them to make sure we are community so when we're giving information back to communities that we're hearing directly from some of you people as community leaders to you know I agree that we still need to make sure we keep that communication Lee ball up they would find out exactly how many people are affected I think at the moment there's 26 that have been identified yeah a single one absolutely in an area and obvious we've got to make sure that is the right the right number so I think that I'm not now but but on this whole concept of you know taking the the two breaches of the floor levels as the level one vulnerability to take away from the fact that the match had been was the was the extrema beam but you know as the future comes with climate change that may in fact become more frequent I don't_''_588.54 I no longer use the phrase one in a hundred years of then kicked around enough for using a lot of him like this but it's a well know there hasn't been there's only been one but the ground was so situated as a result of that that actually a smaller event was that was was was bringing up the the inundation much more quickly than it would have an a in a time when the the ground was able to absorb them and take it away so you know I guess whatever things it's not just the obviously of water going into properties into the houses is the surgeon that has gone on to the land and the cleanup afterwards an effective of of the task force already as the the need to not only work a lot more quickly in a planned way with local communities and anticipation of an event but actually the cleanup afterwards is very important as well and it has to be a lot quicker and a lot more focused on getting rid of that that search as well mmm is there anything else that I think it's always the hardest being the last submission for the day but look thank you can I just get one song in relation to the bus service yeah this way and because I've actually had someone talking to me about it lately because I've also had concerns with the Metro start going it's actually been replaced by a new route called the hundred series which actually follows the same route with an hour Ward from plans to recover and obviously then they'll do the connecting buses from those points over no the metrostars being discontinued there will be another bus that follows the exact same route with an hour you I think was the desire to as we have hit correspondence coming to our board recently so I've just talking to someone than the community about their there and also the 118 bust open the reason why they looking at discontinue this because it's only getting about 1.3 people on it per per trip so I guess it's the service its own yeah it's not being utilized I think that yeah I mean it's interesting I've that we had a submission earlier on about bus routes from somebody you know it's a regular user of buses and I think that there has to be I mean in a way it's chicken and egg you know because I mean that the what drives person to use as you know sort of quick efficient timely public transport services but you don't get quick efficient Tommy public transport services until you enough people use yeah to sort of get the frequency levels up so anyway it's going to be hugely challenging that look thank you very much I think for your time and thank you everyone it's come I will now declare the meeting closed we've got we've got a number of notes that we will at the end of all of us have a list of be able to follow up on so thank you all very much
Ron healing hello everybody hi my concern is the provision of facilities or a parking special specified parking area for tour buses in Christchurch just give it a wee bit of background prior to the earthquake I live in solitary street opposite large apartments and it became apparent that it was being used as a parking area for tour buses we approached the driver and he told us that his company had bought in apartments and that was used for overnight stays for the drivers and whatever from our point of view to have a say two or three buses occasionally certainly one bus in front of the house and it was it was wasn't an ideal situation look out your window and see one of these huge big buses every morning so that that's my main concern that that in living in the future the plan of the city that is provisioned for you know a designated area for the parking of buses those Brussels seems to get larger and larger David that we have a tree outside the house they not the blower branches to flatten a two-way system so consequently their hazards there was going to do him increase dramatically I would imagine the sort of drivers used to stay there weekends and then on a Sunday morning very early they come out a lead obviously wanting to get away to wherever they were going the bush would start up at seven o'clock in the morning he'd warming up the 20 minutes and we were trying to sleep I often clean up the person and everything like that and off the bus would go in and you know another one would arrive and so the whole scenario was really just you know think sort of conducive to a sassanach green lifestyle so they might will mean concerns yep I think I mentioned everything did I want to say so that the Security Council's they've got questions for a scientist sorry just I must say this was prize it's not happening the moment there are obvious reasons but it was prior to the earthquake and I was justing that subsequently it could have care again so you're worried that it make sure that an hour plan we have a designated well we allow residential residents to take precedence over the parking of buses I think that's what you're saying yes you need sure yes a minute okay I mean obviously the wii objection to the drive is staying there overnight obviously in their pocket really wanted my just a but you know I think we could have a designated area where the bus was could park yeah we've raised this with sarah in terms of the actual interchange you know that we want the buses to go enter the interchange not just not to be parked on the road you know I mean we've got visitors to our city we'd like them to be able to have that amenity and inside as well so I'm I'm hoping that we could come up with a solution for this too so Tim um realistically there would be no difference between effort were a bus or a large truck would there and the scenes that you've got a large vehicle that's obtrude obscuring of warm up and then moving offered but so really you know this would be more of a boil or type scenario rather than specifically on buses is it correct we're diving I don't see the w ater I'm not aware they serve you have the legal requirements but I'm just as a resident you know just putting my point of view that you know if if we could have the buses parked in it in a specified area rather than sir you know outside I was just at the weekend the only reason you from what you've said the only reason the buses were parked at your house was because the company it's seem to may have carried me if I'm wrong had bought a apartment so their drivers because a Calabrian salisbury street equipment peterborough so we have been anywhere so that the issue is the the parking of a large vehicle so you could ever tracking feels like oh yes yes yes okay thank you but you know versus as I say you know huge a so just you're looking great that's brilliant thank you very much for taking the time to come and make us that much on much appreciated thank you thank you Peter Townsend and
Pubert Heidi was a fabulous idea but cathedral square loving us already my idea is my wish which I had already six years ago yep when I came to Christchurch first and now I'm here Christchurch needs one more special attraction what happens is a permanent covered market in central Christchurch open daily all year around fresh food eateries and retail space imagine a bakery charcuterie meat and fish and wine bar breakfast lunch and dinner sorted inspired by many towns in the world covent garden started as a flower market and has now become the focus for locals and visitors alike it is one of the first places you visit when you in London I think of Seattle Barcelona Adelaide Melbourne Vancouver not to mention Paris and all indeed almost all small towns throughout Europe we all flock to their markets which is usually and are situated centrally next to their famous landmarks Christchurch is a market town for Canterbury and already has a number of open markets which are very successful but when the weather is not so good not so inviting how much better would it to attract people tourists and locals a focal point to the inner city rejuvenate the town centre by market visible and large enough to complement retail offices and presidential accessibility have one of our many wonderful Architects designed this place recycle old stones or demolished which are coming from demolish buildings once loved make it an exhibit to the world and visitors to come a showcase for New Zealand's environmental movement's involved people create public interest in local sustainable foods improve access to fresh food all I'm the one well designed truth markets tend to establish what people want food culture encourage mixed uses of arts and crafts work retail and entertainment somewhere to hang out to listen to music to watch people markets our community builders there's a resurgence of central city markets throughout the world a magnet to attract people into the city and bolster surrounding business small change leads to big change such a development would soon pay for itself make it a landmark for Christchurch thank you I was just looking up on my computer but I didn't get there in so really I'm just I decided few handles ya know that God somebody will come and collect those off you I'm Tim I guess to two examples that we had with the UM the arts into market and also the cathedral square market yeah of it throughout if you go markets rather like claimed another you know you mentioned a whole lot about whole of them many of them aren't actually permanent sites are stalls that cannon on whatever you want to throw do your thing and then at night it's a different killer fish yeah so I guess what are your opinions off so the arts into market and the cathedral scream acted other love the Art Center market all the markets which I see in Christchurch but when it's raining and when it's windy I never went to it I used to live around the corner in in gloucester street and was actually searching for somewhere to go in the middle of the city other than a cafe you know and to do my shopping it didn't exist and so a night it should always connect with church and with theater you know that we can come and have some what you eat and think outside of market times that would be my proposal and I see a beautiful architecture as well I've just come from the botanical garden and I was most impressed but a little sadder yeah yeah this is amazing a that I gotta go that apparently the cafe's just opened so I want to go there on it absolutely wonderful what they've done there yeah it needs an architectural designed beautiful landmark I know it's a wish it's an idea no it's a great idea it's a great idea and we don't need a GPS to get to it no nothing like okay thank you very very much much appreciated
Oh ball spill ball here alone ladies and gentlemen welcome I'm here on the submission about the alterations of the whole conjunction road Foreman's road area my concern about the horse will junction road extension is the effect that on the residential section of Foreman's right forwards ray is not an arterial route and is dedicated and on trucking right and there are small signs of non tracking at either end of the road but these need to be made larger and clearer is at the present time the truck drivers are not abiding by a non tracking silence I've approach to the other and when stopped and asked why are they in the non-resident only in the area they say they do not see the signage traffic is also becoming badly congested on along the main south road and on the south side with truck and trailer units blocking access by turning right into either fulton hogan or tending right under the main south road the spanking the trip leg up open on the horse will jackson section and it's affecting traffic coming out fact that cash that's come out of Foreman's road has taken up to eight minutes to get out from Foreman's horse or junction road to go very 300 yards to the main south road to turn left and that's taken enough to eight minutes to get through that through that area I don't know if you were here earlier when the the people submitted from which was it the Waterloo business park but have you seen the proposal for the realignment of the two right yes I have how does that work the dome is that work for the residents well beer and more what it seemed to me to drag the truth away from that nightmare intersection with the main south road um you're there looking at bringing the traffic through that way and they're going to stop stop part of horse or junction road which goes to waterloo road yeah now I was involved with with the alteration of that road which gave the trucks the right away to come down the main south right to left under horse road junction west on watery road had to give way to them to gave the trucks and the trailers the freedom they go across them is the section now I believe they're changing that intersection and putting the road further to the west and it's going to be a road coming off out of the emotional Jerome out of the orderly park what I'm asking is that when you look into things on that that you bear in mind that there is the non trucking route on on Foreman's road which if possible I'd like to see kept bride okay right yep David um vaguely familiar with the area there's a axis I think to Foreman's road off the main south road so I don't what a top end of what you cycle the Wreckers Bend is that still in existence that I stole the air so so if the extension of holes will a junction road and links up with a road through the Waterloo Park out to pound road comes into entering existence and that access off the main south road is solve your problem and what I have what I've heard is that the trucks part of the water Lee rate is going to be stopped so the trucks will come down moodily right and at Foreman's ride on the resin on the industrial saw it they will veer across to the left and coming under the waterloo park but I don't know where the traffic is going to travel east and west along waterloo road I've just been asking whether they left a map because I think they just had one on the screen yeah and it would be quite helpful to to actually see the map yes I think you know member yes ilusha care or whatever why don't we they're going to they're going to bring up the map and then we can actually look at okay what your proposal was did you have another question David no no I just really want to clarify on about the weather than you when we may see it on the map with a in fact we do satisfy a number of the residents from Roy yeah and Disney does this come with them the annual plan yani from your well there's a really interesting some separation between people that get plan changes the cost of providing the infrastructure and the annual plan so it's very common for the developers to come in argue through the annual plan process to put funding towards infrastructure improvements sometimes they're part of the conditions of the plane change or the consent other times the Commissioner has seen it's appropriate to go through the in your plan process to consider track the funding and it's often linked to the staging of wind development it can occur so that isn't my graphic yeah but sometimes you would you would in any way this is maybe how I'm saying it is that sometimes there's a public benefit that actually produces a private benefit at the same time so it's kind of like a 11 but I mean I don't know whether this is one of those but it we bought the other day what we realized was there was a traffic planning and engineering so I need this also get between our budget I need exactly that point at them this morning at the at the water conference that I opened we r you know you could you can have a building consent I showed but not know that the that the water pressure couldn't possibly allow sprinkler system to work properly I mean this the guy that was telling me this wasn't from Christ eh I hasten to eat but sometimes when you make a decision in one area and it's not informed it's not informing the consenting process then you can actually have a perfectly valid consent issue but actually not be able to produce the result which is a safe building so say I mean this is raising a good point but here's the picture here you say you can see I live on the Foreman's Road stick on the one with a former droid wedding us yep now the Horsell junction road closure that is where the hopeful Junction Road near comes into the portal Junction Road connection to water's road and horticultural Junction Road they want to make the next division across to the left yet come into the new area there yet what my query is what is going to be a net intersection to control that the track because it sort of looks like around about doesn't it yes but at the moment the Foreman's road has a compulsory stop either either side right and one and six vehicles stopped at the compulsory stop oh ok so then they're ignoring us they're ignoring it yes now I get it now I get it okay so just to know to just give a sort of beer and more in a bit keeping the trucks off the father of the residential area years right the other streets through the area have got the non tracking about compliance as well yep I'm going to late term ask if the council got an reviewed the signage and the relevant of the development cause at the moment you're saying one in six vehicles stops with a shot yessir the composer so my concern would be an audit on that intersection almost immediately because one and six not obeying a stop sign was absolutely just that's just brushing relief yes yeah yeah but then we also had the pleasure that police set with the radar and just a wee bit or you can't quite see but well I think I'm in the middle does 10 has a from around about 2 to the end of the street yet and I'm on the middle of that and from that roundabout to my house vehicles have been clocked at doing I think that's a d4k but they've come off and it's a 50k area okay those vehicles trucks are they prod value a private car they just people just people using Foreman's right as a terrible rate okay all right we'll look thank you very much it's been an incredibly helpful submission is most appreciated thank you very much
The next submission has been postponed until tomorrow so if you want to just leave aside mr. Giddens submission so you'll need to sort of kind of like I as I have rip rip it out of your book for tomorrow's submissions pop it on there so could I invite bill Holvey to come forward thank you good afternoon ladies and gentlemen suburban rail yes want to take your time up on suburban rail in the days when we lived out at Kerr we it's always irked me that we've got beautiful network of lines radiating out from Christchurch because I'm familiar with the Adelaide district of South Australia I compare them flat open no tunnels stuff like that I'm sad I know there's a lot more people in the adelaide district hmm I think there are very wasted resource our tracks what I ask is that we consider to quite urgently get a rail unit rail down from Auckland if we could strike a reasonable deal with them and give it a trial here from other Rangi aura or rolleston rolleston was it should have a normed epic transcript between here and there royal is a lovely thing because frost and fault don't really delay it by very much at all whereas if you're on highway 1 and it comes down a fog it's dangerous and being it's slow I asked that we don't build railway stations their 19th century as motorways our 20th century to 21st century you just have rail halt build a platform so it's high enough for people to get on you don't have ticket machines at the station you have them if poss is the most wonderful thing you can have an F boss machine on the train or as in Adelaide in combination with a cash machine so you put your two dollars in or whatever and ride in and the turn styles are at the central city so if you haven't got a ticket you either have to pay their or find somewhere that's the turnstiles I do think rail has got to be looked at a lot more than it has been when you consider consider that twenty-eight percent of my petrol is powering the wheels and the other practically seventy percent is heating the atmosphere around and behind me which is pretty frightening when you're doing putting out a hundred kilowatts of horsepower you're doing 100k down the motorway with a decent-sized car you're putting out 200 kilowatts of heat 201 bar fires are blazing behind you and the only reason this has been sustainable is because there's been not too much alternative electric traction is going to be the alternative obviously that's going to be behind us getting the local rail running on diesel which is again much more efficient and road transport its users I think about a quarter that the fuel on rail that you do on tires on the road I ask that we consider with the county's securing the right of way out to Lincoln through preble t'en we already have pretty well a right of way out too prevalent to the airport would make a lot of sense I've been to quite a few cities where you get off your traffic on a bus which is never very cheap and often very slow clogged in traffic those city roots have an electric standard gauge of light rail running out to the airport have a huge advantage and we've got really we've got through Islington across waterloo road they have already got a right of way to start it out the idea would be to seize the right-of-way now not sees it that buy it do whatever don't let it get built over and then in 10 or 15 years time be trying to get a right and way out to the airport now would be the time to lay the groundwork for that any questions worries Phil thank you for your submission can I just ask you like for example I think you said we don't want railway stations will got the small one at addington to bring say the line in the passenger train saying to the central city would you support the concept of a platform say it with the old christchurch railway station used to be definitely yes yep yep it's not wouldn't really be that close but again in the adelaide district used to drive to the nearest rail halt park the car for free and that's very important enough car parking space is taken and then we could ride out into the country here we could go for a day at springfield or stuff like that so yeah single track line is you know okay a lot of it is single track but I was more than half a century ago as a signal and telecommunications fitted on the railway and you know with with 21st century communications you make it absolutely safe that a single track and handle and all for what a traffic with some passing lane passing lines as well yeah sure yeah yeah a lot of them are already in if you're looking out towards the rolleston way you've got you know okay Environment Canterbury going to do a lot of dog do an assessment of potential for ripe for a rail link yes just wanted it in and they'll recent postings to I just wonder if you had on you't no I asked authorities to please start cheap and build it up from there so often in my lifetime I've seen things that have been you know think big and it really cripples it for a start if you can get people used to the idea and just gradually build from there you can in my book anyway you go long way I'm sorry if you shout at you folks I don't know whether it dropped music or rock drilling but my wife says rock music now I say rock drilling but a bit of deafness sometimes isn't too bad no no not at all you have it almost 60 years of marriage anyway you haven't you have it a shouter there does that all you think you've actually presented a pretty powerful submission so thank you very much maybe a different solution don't worry the pleasure have no choice not to this right it's what we're here for
A david its tone or epstein sorry oops time it's done thank you welcome thank you basically the success of acura I'm here concerning a Corolla and the success of a carro as a destination for visiting ships warrants improvements of many facilities including better Wharf facilities to enable ease of access to more than one tender at a time the plan should address this in the first instance is doubling the present length of the tender wharf and as part of a long-term development to provide a water-based Wharf attraction to improve facilities for both existing and future residents as well as for visiting tourists the paper I've just distributed will show you an idea of such a development my background is that the following I am an architect I've been working for over 50 years as an architect I have initially been in Australia then Indonesia in Hong Kong I've done work in Penang I've done work in China and New Zealand and Hawaii and plenty of different places I've designed housing units where there are two thousand persons per acre capability of what you can do with all the land here if you really want to do something different I've been involved in us in presenting ideas and systems that resulted in the mass transit railway being able to be built in Hong Kong and finance I built and designed and built rooftop tennis courts and golf practice areas and the only projects had to make life a lot more interesting and healthy the my concern is that no specific items of the one-year plan or the three-year plan that I've seen address the ongoing tourism influx in a Corolla the wharf history is in 1888 it was built it replaced an older wharf at that time and it is a hundred and 26 years old in August this year if you inspect the wood peers they are continually requiring maintenance inspections after the 2011 earthquake it was confirmed that major repairs need to be put in place however time at the moment is continuing to be bought by minimal work and it won't be very long before the sea itself turbo leashes the wolf if this time that some money was put towards a decent plan to ensure the wolf continues to the exit to exist it is in fact the light part of a vaca our last year there were one hundred and nineteen thousand passengers in fifty thousand seven thousand crew over that 2013 14 tourist season based on a passenger contribution of 42 dollars per person there be sufficient funds to place a new Wharf if it costs five million dollars and that's what an estimate is on what a new Wharf would be hello long a person sorry kemet five million know how much per person 42 on on the current rate on the job if they all put in 42 this year we would have the money to do it straight away of course if you make it twenty dollars per head for the next ten years the funds of 24 million could be raised and the whole project as in that sketch that's been distributed to you could could be achieved in 2012-13 the average spend of per passenger 141 dollars and fifty five cents so thirty percent that's the 42 so it's possible to finance it and it's possible to do something if you put the finance system in place akaroa is the second most attractive port to milford sounds as it so it stands to reason that the facilities should be made to make visits convenient and welcoming and I submit to you that a plan should be put in place to ensure that the wolf continues to be able to be exactly where it is and that it is improved so that it makes life convenient for tourists cuddle for ships visiting then it don't have to jockey for position one or two or three can be in the harbor at any one time so having a tender system that can allow two or three tenders to tie up at the wharf at once would be a very welcoming thing and I think helped develop the tourist industry in the long term for a corolla thank you thank you very much I'm afraid this there's no time for questions so it's often the way but you can't so look I'll allow two minutes Andrew thank you no I'll keep this brief thank you very much for your presentation I'm wondering whether could you please just confirm an outline cost for what's proposed in the document year so just a dollar value and also any comments on conversations that you might have had with others in the community about this and whether you feel there is a degree of community support for it I I have the the actual costing of it of 24 million dollars is is something that is based on a previous assessment of five million dollars for a straightforward Wharf and allowing for all the other bits and pieces that go to make the shops and everything else and the little bridges and things concern that is a a it's not a confirmed a amount it's it's a sum which should more than adequately cover what what's involved you could spend a lot more if you want you probably could spend a lot less if you want but it's just a start point I have people who usually a regularly user wolf and talk to them about the facilities I've sat I walked along in the storms and noticed how little free board there is at the end of the wharf this last just a few weeks ago when that we had a really big wind as well as a king tide there was basically water lapping the end of the wharf at the higher sections of the wharf there was a clearance of about only 300 millimeters more or less than a foot in length so it's obvious if you go and look at the piers and the if you if you dive down underneath I'm sure you'll find your people are doing maintenance the size of the piers is actually now very very small in instead of being a meter diameter they're down to about a foot diameter so it's really something that has got to be addressed and I think that given the tourism and and the people and and the local tourism from from Christchurch people come to a car every weekend it fills up places to look at and the wolf is one of the favorite places for people to go to thank you thank you very much appreciate your making the time available to come today thank you
And it's soo Steubenville here you'd know okay so we'll move on to Kevin Barclay and Dennis Thompson thank you good afternoon we represent the youngest rural residents association how come I micron little confused that my comments here and Gavin's are more relevant to the city plan as opposed to the annual plan but I did ask the young lady she said we were still allowed to make the submission our rule resinous group the others rural residents ocean yarra for short has been very active for 28 years to try and maintain and improve the quality of living standards in our area we are zoned rule 2 in recent years the residents have been faced with mounting and uncertainty and anger at the council in their handling of new activities and year in the area residents have been forced vectors their own watchdogs for new developments on nearby land as we fear the increasing trend of known non notifiable activities which means that they the landowners can end up with an undesirable and in our opinion non-complying activity on their doorstep with no consultation and contractors yards with the noise dust I saw pollution to the groundwater increased traffic noise heavy truck starting at four a.m. in the morning with roading hazards from vehicles on our narrow roads and non-approved X's ways to those properties there is a property with a hundred and fifty plus camper vans on the boundary which in our opinion causes a fire hazard and potential fires there was another property that is storing temporary buildings that have been taken out of the red zone and have the Associated tracking and other pieces with it none of these activities fit with the environment results anticipated under the city plan the city plan rules zone section lists and the environmental results anticipated a management of versatile saw resources in the zone for activities which will support and encourage the present and future production of future production potential I cannot see how any of those activities there will enhance growing or doing anything on the land low density of rule dwellings consisting consistent with maintaining the quality of the groundwater I cannot see where any of those activities will announce our zones none of those activities will enhance those we see the above-mentioned activities is totally non-compliant so either the standards in the city plan unclear and need to be strengthened or the council staff that approved consents are ignoring the standards or the enforcement team of the council is not adequately monitoring the activities the council under the RMA Ackbar m.a Act and the health X has an obligation and a duty to keep objectionable elements in connection with certain uses of the land and activities to a minimum we're the resonance believe the crisis city council is failing in its obligation and duty by allowing these activities and by giving consents or inadequately enforcement we the residents won a robust plan adequately administered administered and enforced by the council so that we may reasonably enjoy our quality of life now and in the future yes sir don't just he had a reinforcing the point put forward by Dennis and what concerns me the traditional town planning principles have been decide what really and one part we had certain activities and print his own areas and now as this is becoming a wild west town planning situation that's in that area that I would just been given notice that fulton hogan without any notification going to quarry's a hundred forty hectares on roberts road between high high road and pound road now this is right the the watershed of our groundwater and if we think that chlorine doesn't affect our groundwater we've been disillusioned really going back to the enforcement area it seems that they are totally inadequate and it would be interested to know HD how many enforcement notices they've actually acted on in the last two or three years the department just lacks any feel for the future our town I believe another area where the planning it seems to be wishy-washy we've had so much publicity about this TT trickier will that behind of the west of that area though how many six years ago in there this fearsome the preston road area and that's in a very depth low-lying area so we concerned about the general town planning environment that we look at here right well look have been better directed to the district plan review but but given that you're here we'll open it up to questions but I'm going to with the leave of the the council have the submission referred through to the district plan review so that they can actually have a good look at it as well if that's all right with you because it doesn't it doesn't impact on the annual plan please say but it's very relevant to the district plan review so it's not too late to be to push it through into that process if they're serious issue for the future of e allora I'm agreeing with you which is why I think that it's important that we get it into the right process but I'm going to allow counselors to ask questions Becky thank you for your submission the the uses that you mentioned are they temporary ones until April 2016 with the exception obviously of the quarry how would we know because the council doesn't consult us no default so you don't what happens on the ground and it's the prolific ation of it that continues and once it's there we personally don't think a liver disappear people have bought the land and having spend up to a million dollars or plus for the land do you think they'll go back to residential part family no Allen's destroyed once they've done what they're doing to it if you've seen the condition of the road giving up all west coast of all the six months it's a shame believe so and the quarry you mentioned that it's a very large area of querying you mentioned no notification at all that the case this is this is reimbursed in their meaning and and maybe it was only a rumor had not only luck that somebody here to be able to that Robert really real Jimmy came in I remember the you know the last a year I mean your host judo wrestling association at you you know have a kind of a specific cancer and also on your behalf I engage with the council wondering whether after they did you have a follow-up well let that happen but it hasn't all been forgotten about that's quite some time ago Jimmy there would be three or four years ago would not Tim I think that two of the examples you gave which were the tracking and the armed camp avene arm storage with regards that I council of heavy hit dialogue with council officers with regards to those two out an activities not pacifically the last couple we've actually had dialogue for 28 years with your council officers I have here on my head because I don't bash it against the concrete wall and when I find council officers who are next to useless I just don't do it anymore we are considered a absolute nap by mr. towns in one of the enforcement officers we were absolutely not so there's a mr. Townsend something behind you but it's not the same yani I'm thank you v submission I think you rise a really good point and there is actually an annual plan debate it's about monitoring of our district plan of other standards and regulations that we put so I know this has come up before so I do think I can't this is it absolutely the right place yeah it's Peter than I hate we do need to look at it but I would really like to get some specific information around the corrido that if we know we're not supposed to ask questions of staff but I do think there's a communications plan that was put in place for consents being issued to delete affected residents and community groups know so much pretoria satisfied I'm uptown right against the the new proposed one is just off found rated runs god did you know Buchanans road running east-west and robert road running east-west west and that's in an area in the ok so we put in the square of high road pound ride buchanans ride in roberts road there's a there was old freezing works raising paddocks right so yeah so you mentioned this a new waterloo in touch with the vitamin pack nation they were I house ma'am we harness never talked about the orderly pad this is it look it could be but identical within the perimeter of that industrial park there are two different environments that we operate on at the moment so we put our own district plan but we've also got orders and council that sit under the canterbury youth quite recovery eight and they only sit there till april 2016 but so that the council isn't involved in notification and that regard so we're going to get to the bottom of this and find out what the actual situation is but it seems to be there that if we're not not notifying because we're not obliged to then that's not going to be good enough for this council we actually think that we should notify our citizens even if we're not the cause of the of the particular change to the way the district plant operates so leave that one with us and yannis raised a good point about it fitting under the enforcement regime so we can check on that as well district plan review because I think it does touch on some elements there that you have firm quite justifiably raised in front of the whole council so thank you very much for your time thank you for your reassurance thank you ok cheese
