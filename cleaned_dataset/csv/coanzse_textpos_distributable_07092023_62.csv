Me we did a smoking ceremony and part of the materials that we used to make it we got the trunk and crushed it up from the belgae bush some people also call it the corp and that's the best fire lighting material that you can get you don't need to go to the shop and buy fire lighters and we put it into the fire to light it with dead leaves and with some dead born the sticks and then when the fire got going we put some green gum leaves over it to get the smoke the garrick going to smoke us why do we need a smoking ceremony because we come from all different parts of the land and as we're coming here some of us might be in a bad mood we don't want to go to work and we asked the bad spirits to leave us as we walked through the smoke and then I invited the good spirit the merits were to come and once we've done our smoking ceremony we use the karen the bunch of green leaves I don't come in anger you have just participated in a smoking ceremony and a welcome to country with marie taylor noongar yok from the waijak baladong noongar people and today I've got helping me my sister robin collard and we are helping to do our language for the city of canning juncker thank you
Hi everyone I'm mayor patrick hall with a wrap-up of the october ordinary council meeting here are some of the decisions made by your council this month in great news for the local community council agreed on the night to move funding forward for the planned kent streetwear redevelopment what that means is that based on council's decision and as part of the city's covert 19 recovery plans the ken streetwear precinct will benefit from about eight and a half million dollars in investment over the next two years that's great news the precinct plan will include a district level play area which is actually about 10 times larger than the current one as well as an expanded pump track cycle facilities and a number of other great features I really can't wait to see those changes take place down there council also considered a request from communicate regarding their lease on a facility in riverton that caters for outside school hours care and play groups the organisation has changed their business model and no longer provides those services this item did attract considerable community coming along to the meeting and sharing their stories on how this change in services has affected them ultimately council decided not to support a new lease for community care but has agreed to work and negotiate with the company to explore how those services continue to be provided to the community from that facility that's a great outcome council adopted the city's next learning city strategy which aims to foster lifelong learning opportunities for our canning community also on the night council approved the city to enter into release with the willetton football club over a portion of the williton sport and community centre which they will now share with the crow's qriket club currently the club hires this base as a casual booking and have done so since 2015. another item on the night that attracted some attention was a policy review this included a proposed increase to the amount an elected member could be reimbursed for clothing expenses an amendment to remove clothing and reimbursements entirely from the policy in question was supported by council on the evening council then considered the amended policy adopted unanimously unanimously by the council 10 votes to zero as a matter of public interest all of the reimbursements and allowances paid to elected members are on the public record and are freely available on our website for anyone who wishes to view them and I encourage you to do so to find out more information on any of those decisions made by council this month please visit the city cannings website thanks very much for watching I hope that you're enjoying this warmer weather just as much as I am thanks to you all

lots of other fans of yours from all over the state and possibly further we're not sure we know we've got people joining us from albany definitely and which albany is have you you've been to perth I've been to perth but not to album you know not to albany albany's beautiful place through the depths right down in the south so we've got barrages of questions to ask you but I thought I'd start with a really simple one that's probably relevant to right now and getting to know what's going on all around australia how did the covert lockdown in melbourne affect your working life to be true not a lot ever since I was really young I've worked from home and actually my wife does as well she's an artist and we're used to just being in the house together just each working in our own space in our own studio the only difference is that you know usually when you know have to get on lots of airplanes and stay in lots of hotels and do a lot of talking and book signing and stuff and of course that's not happening but that's the least fun part of my my job I don't mind doing all the book signings and talking to people but I hate all the aeroplanes and hotels so in some ways you know it's pretty well life is normal for me I've been busy I've been working on new books I've got a new book coming out we've been working on the animalia digital platform that you you were talking about with digitals so it's been it's been productive because that's usually just the way I do work by myself and if you're if if what I've seen with other interviewers you love to travel and of course everyone here has had put anyone who was going overseas has put their holidays on hold for the time being I'm guessing you probably had a program of travels for this year that be this year well that you're right and that was that's the other sort of travel not the not the airplane hotel work travel but the airplane hotel get out and see stuff travel and it's been really important over my you know career of making books to get out and and travel and see things because that's where the ideas come from um the the uh one that comes to mind immediately you're holding up before the the last king of angkor wat I mean I'd heard of this mystical magical place called angkor wat never thought I'd ever visit it but it's a real place a real ruins in the jungles of cambodia and what you know one year a while back I got to go there and I was inspired I wanted to somehow capture this wonderful interplay of the jungle and the and the stones of these old temples beginning to come apart as the jungle you know builds through it and I created the book last king of bangkok what so travel for me has always been from as as for this year no funnily enough last year I did a lot of travel up into the arctic circle and enter russia and to china um and to some and to morocco and a few other places so it was a big year and this year we were actually planning the same wheel to just stay home and be good so you know our timing was actually good things worked out yeah now I think I'll I'll launch into the thousands and this is death by a thousand questions so I've literally got so much but I'll start with I'll start with the first question if you were an animal this is from louise and I'm not quite sure at the stage probably from a local school I expect louise wants to know if you were an animal from your illustrations which animal would you be and do you and do you ever draw or write about your pets atticus and lucy oh there's somebody who's done their research well actually I can tell you the second part first I have written as lucy the dog although now when I think about it now it was actually lucy's um previous incarnation molly I did a book some years ago called truck dogs and um that was actually written by molly the labrador um lucy's read it since and she thinks it's quite good for it for a dog as for the animals I think it depends what mood I'm in um I i would I would either choose um elephant or or or hedgehog depending on whether I felt like sort of getting out there and seeing the world and trumpeting what I found or whether I just wanted to curl up into a little ball and go to sleep I saw there was a pre maybe there was a picture of you in another interview and you had two big giraffes behind you is that in your lounge room it is there's there's I can show you hang on they're still here I wonder whether can you see them in the corner there are we coming up close to I'm the two giraffes no yeah there we are I'm getting there they are yeah they are fabulous here's my two giraffes nice I i got those in um in africa a long long time ago my wife and I were traveling and we saw this these beautiful in fact we saw one beautiful giraffe in a uh in a shop and I wanted to buy it but the the shopkeeper was very clever he said oh yeah I'm sorry this this one has fallen in love with the other one in the shop you'll have to buy them both so now is this your place you're sitting right now it's obviously it's a lounge and a music room but is that also your writing place no it's not I i no it's it's the only big space in the whole house and there's just there's two tiny bedrooms um so I i I i can't take it over and and so let's call it all my own and when I write I do need to be I use one of the other bedrooms I somehow I just had this idea that in your in your writing studio you'd have big photographs of your books on the walls but not mine I've got them all in a cupboard somewhere my own book right moving along from catherine what has been your favorite project work slash work and why okay yeah look you held up animalia before and it's hard to sort of not consent count that my favorite because it was the book that kind of changed my life uh up until then I was sort of you know just struggling along trying to you know write stories and do pictures and and that one just sort of captured everyone's imagination and became sort of huge and well known which enabled me to keep keep doing what I love doing which is draw but there's a few other really important projects for me one was one called the waterhole which was inspired by a trip to africa and which has many many levels it's a book that um that can very or story older children will begin to look for the hidden things and get in they might even find the names of all the hidden things so it becomes a you know a natural history lesson but there's also a deeper meaning of the waterhole and on the need to conserve the natural environment and to share it and to cherish it and stuff so that was an important book for me another one was one called less well-known called the discovery of dragons and the reason that's important was it's the book I always wanted to do ever since I was a kid I've always been drawing dragons and monsters and stuff and the very first thing I ever took to a publisher to try and get published was a book called a field guide to dragons of the world and years later it finally got published under the under the title bit developed of the discovery of dragons so that was that's a favorite as well now you animalia you were you were young you were in your middle 20s yeah I was and in one one of the books that said uh graham-based author of animalia has sold 300 000 copies around the world then in another one another the last king of angkor wat says animally has sold 2 million copies around the world is are you are you golf smacked by the success of that one yeah I was wondering what it says now in the back of angkor wat because it's probably more like three but I don't actually know yeah look you only get one of those sort of your books in a life I think the thing is every book you put your heart and soul into it it's always meaningful it's always something that I want to spend my time doing and I do the best I can but you can't always expect everyone else to like it and that's why it's terribly important for any artist or writer to first of all do it for yourself because that keeps it honest and it makes it worthwhile even if it doesn't get published or nobody likes it doesn really important with anamalia it just seemed to hit a nerve uh it was it wasn't as though it was a a terribly new idea I mean an english language alphabet book there's there's hundreds of them out there I'm sure um but it was it was a labor of love by just a young artist who wanted to draw everything and I just decided to do it as an alphabet book and I'm sure that that passion is what came through and made up the people enjoy it nice um moving a lot if not from amanda if not an author illustrator what would you have been uh it's terrible to think back right now and realize that I wanted to be a rock star I was really no I was really into music as the other thing that was really driving me along in my 20s and 30s and in fact I i was in a band I started a band in melbourne called ricky tikitavi which was uh riffing on a short story by an author called rajad kipling uh although it properly um but it was a it was a band that played around with the venues in in melbourne um and I remember actually the band was put together as the result of a previous band um and the reason and I i had joined this other band it wasn't my band I joined this band because I really I already fancied the lead singer I thought she was gorgeous and stuff and so I auditioned as the drummer and got the gig now the band didn't last long but robin the singer and I have now been married for nearly 40 years so it was worth it so I didn't become a rock star but I did find the love of my life so now if you if you've been married nearly 40 years it means you were about 20 when you're in the band yes and we we're about the same vintage so I have to ask you were you a punk and did you have a funny haircut oh I did we both did actually my my hair was sort blonde floppy bit that went all the way down past my nose um and I used to have to keep doing this all the time and robin had hair which was black at the back and a kind of a sprout of red bright red at the front so we thought it was so it was actually more sort of like new romantic than punk but yeah those were the days my children keep on wanting to see the photographs but I've I've hidden them very deep um from casey your work is amazing what inspired you to become an illustrator uh well ever since I was a kid I've just been drawing that was the one thing that I i was sort of kind of reasonably good at um when because my my I was born in england when my family came out to australia I was eight and I think any kid who finds themselves in a brand new place like a you know rough tough aussie state school at the age of eight with a really strong english accent it was really strong then start doing it because if you kind of carve out your niche in the playground so and for me it was called my drawing coloring in and within a couple of years uh if if somebody had said you know what do you want to be when you grow up I would have said artists now what I wouldn't have said is author I had no you know expectation of writing books I just wanted to draw pictures for a living and I briefly worked in advertising but it was so uncreative I couldn't bear it and they didn't like me either I went through three jobs in about a year and a half and I got fired from the third one and then just sort of started trying to get work with publishers doing book jackets and illustrations for other people's stories and then I began to think maybe I could write one of these so I wrote first of all a poem called my grandma lived in ghoulie gulch a very australian story and the second one that I wrote was animalia and it gulch that was your first that was that pictures and words yes that was my the first book that I i wrote and illustrated prior to that I had illustrated some some books for other writers but that was the first one that was all me 25 or 26 or 27 something around there yeah long time ago because I know you said you're the only author in the world that's never had a rejection slip because you've you've got accepted by the first publisher and you've stayed with the same publisher that's right yeah you've got to be lucky and that this it is part of the equation people often say you know what's the secret of success um and you've got to have it you've got to have passion talked about that before passion you've got to have persistence you just keep doing it you've got to have um patience because you know all you know because it can take a long time animalia took me three years but you've also got to have luck provenance so it takes all of these as a sort of a combination and I was very lucky that very early in my career I found a publisher who who liked what I did and and uh you know we built a tremendous relationship and he would always give me very good advice about you know the direction that a project was going so you can't work by yourself you must have other people around you to give you feedback and you've got to listen to them when you're editing I'm sure the kids know about this you know editing doing a first draft second draft third draft or maybe even 10th draft 20th draft you just keep on doing it until it's as good as you can make it and you'll always be so much happier with the result because I do both the the writing and the illustrating it does give me a lot more time to do that because I can write a story and then begin to you know work on the artwork and I can keep on going back and through the whole one or two or three year process the story can still remain unfinalized the text the story is fixed but the way that I'm presenting the story in words right to the last minute and I've I've grown to really enjoy that freedom of of of being able to juggle both parts the art and the words right through to the very end of the project great you talked about coming out to australia when you were a kid from england how old were you I was eight years old eight years old eight years did you have did you have did you have a very strong english accent terribly strong yes where were you from I was from a a very well-to-do part of uh england called buckinghamshire where the queen lives you know and um and it was it was all a bit hoity-toity so it's just one of those english accents that you try and get rid of over the last last world g was 50 something years I I've largely succeeded but it depends who I talk I'm saying now works totally as a really australian dinky die accent you just have to say g'day and everyone falls about laughing but but if I if I start talking to somebody uh you know english it begins to drift back into that english accent again so it's it's still there a qui a question when I had read you came out as a kid I wondered have you been back to the place where you spent your early life yes and did you remember it in pictures before you got there oh absolutely I i remembered it very very very very well indeed everything about it was exactly as I remembered except that it was tiny because last time I'd seen it this this particular place I was only five and the house looked like a mansion to me as a five-year-old this was a giant place and and if you had to walk down the street and down the lane to get to the meadow and the train track beyond that was a big big trip in fact the house was a in two minutes you know but but for so for the young child the the adventure of of a park or or a playground is is an enormous space um and and if and the events that happen in those enormous spaces are world shattering I actually did a series called bumble bunnies um subtitled superheroes of the garden four books and it's about exactly that little characters who live in a backyard and something will happen like a ball will roll into a fish pond but this is a huge thing this is you know for for the for the little for the puppy and the kitten and the duck what are we gonna do um oh there you've got you've got a copy that that's the the gate isn't it is that yeah yes that's the gate where the the gate gets left open late at night this is the spooky one yeah the other ones are brighter and more colorful but this is actually my favorite you're right and poor waffles the puppy accidentally gets left outside uh aries there because it's all kind of you know moonlit and but um oh look we just said the whole book here and those are the white rabbits now they look like the most innocuous you know stupid little characters in the world but we are going to come to realize that they have a secret life these white rabbits who look incapable of anything are actually the bumble bunnies who come swooping over they show the front cover there they come swooping over the um over the hill yeah the rooftops to save the day when disaster strikes great excellent um what are from taylor what are you currently reading and will you ever make another mystery book like the 11th hour well I did I did another mystery book because I had enjoyed that one enormously it was the book I did after anamalia and for a long time I was thinking of of a new mystery and it came out as enigma a magical mystery and in the back of the hardback version of the book there was actually a a re-lockable safe all just made out of dials to the right position to to be able to open the little flap at the front it took months of getting of organizing to get that right so that was another mystery story uh with a magical kind of twist um I i I am working on other projects um what was the first part of the question there again it was uh what are you currently reading oh what am I reading that's right now this is weird I get asked this a lot and it's always a kind of a strange answer because I've just got totally obsessed with there's a magazine called new scientist basically comes out of england but there's an australian edition and it's all about stuff like astrophysics and neuroscience and and and stuff like that and and and important issues like climate you know control and and at the moment a lot about the covert virus and so forth but I really find that fascinating so I tend not to read like novels and adventures and stuff like that I'm I'm interested in in loved graham bass's book worst band in the universe that came out in the year 2000 now sadly out of print the book also came out with the cd of music by the bands that competed in the worst band competition in the book I'd love to know what music graham likes and if he finds inspiration from any particular genres or bands when writing and illustrating well yes what music do you like and are you inspired by genres and bands well the worst band in the universe uh actually was slightly autobiographical as I said before I used to be in a band and all of the music on that cd uh had sort of you know come out of my head and I played it all into keyboards and and computers and stuff um probably should have got some help but it was my sort of like my solo moment um I think I've always enjoyed classical music to be honest and complex music um I'm not one to listen to country and western I find uh that there's more interest in a lot of a lot of so much stuff I mean I just I just love music I don't know how I could you know sort of really fine-tune that this this this response um except to say that it's been so important as as part of my life and and quite often I've tried to sort of blend my my good luck in my in my book publishing career with with my passion for music and another one was the sign of the seahorse which was a book from many years ago now and that one actually started off from a musical concept uh I'd I'd been inspired by my first trip of yeah you know you can see it here uh there's there's a um a logo there beneath the title which is actually a musical symbol it's a treble clef blended with with a seahorse and that is the sign of the seahorse you see so the whole thing right from the very very word go was going to be a musical project and I had written uh the artwork was finished it eventually got performed many years later I wanted it to be like a stage you know musical but it finally uh was performed by a local theater company in melbourne called malt house theater in association with the melbourne symphony orchestra and it got and we did I think it was eight or ten uh performances at the concert hall you know the big one in melbourne and it was sold out and it was such a thrill um but it hasn't been seen since because it's really hard to to make the finances of a huge 80 piece symphony orchestra work um but over the years I've continued I've written a musical version of a book called jungle drums and there was another one and the worst band in the universe was turned into a stage play but but I haven't been very fortunate in trying to make these hit the hit the big time maybe maybe I just got to keep trying perseverance when you write sit down to write or illustrate do you have music on playing in when I write it has to be completely silent even if I just hear anything like a tap drooping or dog barking or something you know that it distracts me I just need to involve myself in the story in the woods when I'm doing pictures no I i tend to when I'm when I'm I listen to a bit of you know radio but you get sick of that in the end um talk back radio so I would um put on classical music when I was young when my brother and I were little uh my our parents used to play us classical music to go to sleep by they'd read us a story but then they bring the old mono glorious mono record player into the room and play records of classical composers so I grew up with a great love of that music and that's what I tend to listen to now to six questions from miss or possibly ms stewart or mrs stewart and the year 4 5 class at bannister creek primary we don't have names to go because they're watching right now how many books have you written I have written it depends on how you add them up for instance like this four bumble bunny books that I've mentioned but I think it's somewhere between 24 and say 28 or 29 and some which I haven't got published yet maybe 30 around there somewhere between 20 and 30. here's the curly one how long does it take to write a book the writing doesn't take all that long I can actually write the initial concept of a story very quickly uh the last king of angkor wat that we've looked at before I actually wrote on the airplane on the way home from cambodia although as I say that wasn't finished because I had to keep editing it it's the artwork for me that takes the time a book will be at least a year for me to from from from go to from go to woe um and most of that is to do with the artwork and all the building up the detail and the for your books I was actually lucky that I did a course after I finished high school called graphic design it was really training me for a career in advertising which as I said before didn't work out but I still learnt a lot of the the principles of good design um of importantly when you turn a page that it's not just everything everywhere especially when it's really detailed and lots and lots of complexity your eye needs to be drawn to one particular thing like you know the green gorillas and you know in the in the you know gorgeous glass greenhouse you see one of them first and then you suddenly notice he's holding a goblet and then later you begin to explore your eyes begin to explore the the picture so that's that's good design and I was I was actually trained in that um just leaving the questions for a moment you mentioned earlier about about providence and just being the right place at the right time I guess and and also in one one of the couple of in advertising do you think getting fired from your job was providence oh yes yes it was also just been really bad at it because I you know the people this is it I was I wasn't I wasn't interested I had no passion for it and without passion then you you know you don't take care and so absolutely right I mean I remember at the time I was brought into the into the office my boss's office and he said graham I'm going to have to let you go you know and I sort of I just wanted to go but I didn't I held it together and I said oh okay why and he just looked at me and said because you're destroying my business you know and that was that so providence or not it was just uh well certainly luck luck that I i got kicked out because I wouldn't have the guts to leave because I was earning money um now back to the questions what was the first book that you wrote I think we this before when I was talking about dragons the first book that I ever wrote I i I was about nine years old had just arrived in australia and it was called a field guide to monsters of the world um and I and and it was a colored pencil and on line paper and it was stapled down the side the reason I know this is that my mum kept it I didn't realize but as I was when I was a young kid doing writing and drawing and stuff like that I would just sort of finish it and leave it somewhere and you know for the dog to eat or just get thrown away mum would pick them up and keep them in a box for me and years later she gave me this box of ideas and one of them was this field guide to monsters of the world and it spawned not one but two books first of all the discovery of dragons which is really a field guide to dragons which are a kind of monster of the world and a second book which again goes back to my childhood of of you know the idea of there being like monsters in the house you know there's a monster under the bed or in the trash can rubbish bin uh or something like that you know and I just devised this idea for a book about facing your fears called the amazing monster detector scope and they both owe their existence to that book I did when I was nine so kids if you are writing or drawing try to hang on to the stuff get a box a shoebox whatever and when you finish something you think that's not bad put it in the box because you never know it might actually be a great idea for the future how many colors do you use on one page of a book 17 17 colors always 17 colors I don't know it really really really varies billions I suspect but you know how how could you possibly I do have favorite colors um prussian blue cadmium yellow burnt orange white and black always use a bit of those um the'd started working with digital drawing absolutely you still do you still go straight to pen and ink on paper or do you go to begin on you know begin on an ipad everything no everything starts on paper pencils scribbles um traditionally tracing paper too only because that enables me to refine just like editing your words you also edit your images and you might draw a character once like a dragon and go and I reckon I can make you know that the neck shorter or turn it around the other direction and tracing paper is just an easy way of of working of course it's really easy on screen too the technology now for for artists on computers is fabulous when I went through college it was rubbish there's nothing useful that a computer could do for an artist but but now it's a wonderful tool and so for me now I have you know pencils and brushes and and and and stuff and and and then you know a track pad or a stylus to work on the computer as well so it developed what's your favorite character that you've created in one of your books um um um look I don't know I don't know about favorite character and funnily enough I'm I've actually never been big on developing characters so much as worlds I was thinking then of uno's garden and there's a whole bunch of characters and there's one called the snortle pig who's kind of cute but then there's also the moopa loops and the gondolopes and the lumpy bums and the freckle pods and they're all like a suite of characters I somebody's asked me what what is my favorite animal uh in in those are the lumpy bums they're very rude because they've got these lumpy purple bums I don't know whether that's coming through in the photo or not I have to look at the library copy for that to get there the full glory of those bums um but my I realize that my the favorite my favorite animal must in fact be the elephant just like the because if you add them up there's no he's come alive look here we go here's mr elephant because there's there's ace enormous elephants expertly eating easter eggs in animalia forest the elephant is the hero of the 11th hour elephants make a uh an appearance in in eye to eye another book of mine there's there's an elephant of course in the last king of angkor wat the the elephant king so I guess yeah and I've I've they are an inspiration I even mentioned elephant before didn't I but you know my animal I'd be an elephant or or a hedgehog so I guess when it comes down to elephants who could design such a crazy creature just and they're wonderful to see up close yeah um here's some questions from south sterling primary school what is your inspiration for the waterhole it was a trip to africa uh where I where I got to uh go on safari that this is in east africa kenya and tanzania and the time when you and the or late at night at the waterhole because the animals would go down there to drink um and as the seasons progress the water hole of course gets smaller and smaller and smaller all the water's evaporating and the rivers are drying up and and then more and more animals come there to drink sometimes you get you know like zebras and lions actually almost standing side by side even though you know they should be one should be terrified of the other because the need to for the waterhole uh and to drink at the wall hole trumps trumps everything so that was the kind of the beginning of the idea that I could create a counting book um based on this idea of animals coming to a waterhole one rhino and then two of something else and maybe I think at the time it was two zebras and then three lions whatever and I realized wait on why just keep it in africa this is my waterhole I can do with it as I wish so I picked up my waterhole and after one rhino which is animals the next page I've taken the the the water hole and put it in india because it's two tigers which live in india not in africa and then three two cans so now we're in south america and so forth so it became a global waterhole and the message of the waterhole then came really into focus we're not just talking about a waterhole we're talking about water as a global resource and that it's all connected every drop of rain starts as a drop it comes down to a river flows down the river goes to the ocean is evaporated into clouds comes back falls again as that same drop it's a cycle throughout the every molecule of water in the world is connected so I i use that as the essence of the deep story of the waterhole that's that's its real meaning to do with conservation of this most precious resource from the same school how do you decide the themes for your books well if it's not travel then it's something else uh that one which is just coming out now called the tree it's a new book and it's only only just about to hit the shops now and I was walking through a very famous big um uh set of botanical gardens in london called q gardens and there was there was an exhibition on about trees and there was a a photo or a diagram that showed there's like a cross section of a tree you could see the trunk and and then the the big sort of you know semi-circle of of branches which we all would you know expect to see but then it showed us under the ground the roots that spread out were just as big another hemisphere so it was like this circle with a line through the middle and from to me suddenly it was like a like a globe with the northern hemisphere southern hemisphere and the equator was the ground in the middle so from that it suddenly became a planet floating through space just made up of a tree the branches and the roots I thought all right what amongst the branches and another character who lives down below amongst the roots and they don't know that the other one's there until one day one opens one window and somebody opens his trap and looks up and they go what are you doing in my tree he says what do you mean your tree this is my tree and the story goes on from there now that idea just came from a walk in the park so you've got to keep your eyes open and just be always looking around and thinking about things to get ideas more questions from south stirling primary school where did you get your inspiration for the jewel fish of karnak the jewel fish of karnak is set in egypt in ancient egypt and yes I was lucky enough to to travel there and we went we took the train up to a place called aswan and then got on a a sailing boat a little it's called a faluca and we and we floated sail down the nile to this fabulous temple complex called karnak so I'd had away by this you know the astonishing you know structure the architecture um and I chose a jackal and an ibis because two of the you know the god deities of ancient egypt were those characters the jackal and the eye but there's many others cats were always very sacred as well which is why I've got the cat pharaoh in the story so that that was again travel that inspired me to want to capture something that I had seen and I developed a story so that I could do that when you went to africa did you get that's did you get your inspiration for jungle drones from africa yeah that was that was another trip to to africa um that uh it was occurring to me that how come africa gets all the all the best animals you know you've got the spottiest in in the leopard or the or the the tallest the giraffe or the or the stripiest and then we went around the corner uh to to some waterhole area and there was a family of warthogs and they are a brown a covered in mud with sort of hair sticking out in weird places and these weird teeth that don't seem to fit tusks going up and down and I thought that's got to be tough it's got to be really tough being a warthog surrounded by all these amazingly gorgeous animals and there was the idea for a story about not just a warthog bird the littlest warthog in africa so he's really got it coming in every direction from everybody and it's really a story though about being happy with who you are and being accepting of how other people appear uh so a story in the end about tolerance were warthogs the inspiration for snortle pigs yes probably snortle pigs uh there's certainly a lot of pig going on there and the snortles the thing about all those characters from uno's garden is that there's a musicality to the words snortle pig lumpy bum gondola sprinkle pod you know uh so it's the music of words is often what uh what drives me as well there's're going to run out of time before we run out of questions and I gotta go that's okay three minutes let's let's get through another maybe another question or two how do you remember what places look like well I do take photographs I don't think I'm a very good photographer and I do draw things can I get I'll give you one other example that there was an idea that came from me drawing something there was a lamp on the wall of a hotel I stayed in once and it was it was sort of made of brass and it was spiraled like a shell and the shade was curved like a sail my kids were here as well they were young at the time and I said hey kids look at this he and I said a snailing ship which was dad's joke 536 and they just sort of went yeah what that whatever then but I thought it was really cute so I drew this little snail with sales and when I got home I found it again I remember um and eventually the idea grew into a story which was the legend of the golden snail so it's a combination for me of photographs um drawings sometimes writing things and a fairly vivid memory and imagination now his with just about to finish but your kids are now growing up one day yep all in their 20s I think 50s and 30s yeah have any of them followed in your footsteps yes in in various ways um james uh is a filmmaker um kate in the middle is a teacher and william the youngest one is working on being a rock star so we've got them all none of them is trying to be a children's book author thank goodness otherwise I'd have otherwise I'd really have something to worry about but um yeah they're all doing creative and and wonderful things I'm very lucky so we're going to transition now because we know you have to go I do yes so we're going to transition into me reading your book the last king of angkor want now the the drawings are beautifully original but the story itself is it based on an old story from cambodia no it's not I did look into that um wondering whether to use a folk tale uh in the end what I did was I um researched the uh the history of of the the place angkor wat and also looked into the natural history of of cambodia in those days what uh animals were prevalent and common there which is how I chose the tiger gibbon uh water buffalo and and lizard or gecko so it's it no it's it's an original story uh that that I devised but still trying to channel the things which I had learned about cambodia during my travels so um boys and girls and teachers and everyone that's listening right now we have to say goodbye and thank you to graham and graham thanks for joining us it's been great to have you live from melbourne now it's been an absolute pleasure I've really enjoyed it and thank you very much I am sorry I have into the last king of ankle what and we'll see you again sometime yeah bye now cheers so we'll carry on here we are now hopefully you'll be able to see can we put the master screen up there you'll be able to see that's the beginning of the last king of angkor wat tiger gibbon water buffalo and gecko sat among the ruins of ancient anchor what they were looking at the old stone carvings of kings and parades feasts and battles I would have made a fine king said tiger I'm so strong not as fine as I said gibbon if I were king I would rule with compassion and kindness I would be a ruler who never gave up no matter what said water buffalo I would have been fearless in battle I'm a great warrior said little gecko waving a twig like a sword and they began to argue about who would be the best king it takes many qualities to be a good king came a voice strength compassion resilience and courage the animals looked around in surprise if any of you wish to know if you are worthy said the elephant go to the temple at the top of the hill they followed his gaze and saw an old ruin in the distance none of them none of them could remember having seen it before and there's the animals and the temple behind them I shall win this race said the tiger and he sprang away towards the distant hilltop of the mighty roar nor did I get there first cried given he leapt into the branches and gave chase hooting as he went waterbuffalo slaughtered with determination and charged off through the jungle I shall never give up wait for me cried brave little gecko and he scampered after them on his nimble feet tiger bounded through the jungle until he came to a swamp guarded by fearsome snakes he stopped and snarled the huge reptile coiled itself to strike gathering all his strength tiger made a mighty leap over the snake and on he ran a little later tiger came across a crane with a broken wing the bird called for help but tiger was going to win the race gibbons swung through the trees until he too came across the snake it seemed to be tangled in the branches let me help you said gibbon untangling the patterned coils then he hurried off again towards the distant hilltop gibbon untangles the snake but after a while gibbon became tired he spied a giant pangolin heading the same way and quietly lowered himself onto its back the pangolin plotted on underwear unaware of its uninvited hitchhiker meanwhile water buffalo was pushing tirelessly through the jungle when she heard a voice don't be afraid snake snakes you may pass but water buffalo trembled at the sight of the huge reptile and backed away unable to conquer her fear determined to finish the race water buffalo trek around the far edge of the swamp she plodded on through an endless wilderness of twisted trees until at last the end was in sight gecko was scampering through the jungle when he found his way barred by the snake but gekko was not afraid he dodged this way and that is the snake tried to catch him laugh and he scuttled off through the swamp oh that's a fearsome looking snake gekko ran on leaping from one thick twisting vine to the next a handy path towards the distant hilltop you can see gecko's got wonderful colors so is that snake I reckon there's at least 17 colours on that page when the four animals finally arrived at the temple they were astonished to find the elephant waiting for them each of you has done well to reach the top of the hill the elephant said but let us see what your journeying has revealed now the elephant I think is that the elephant god ganesh I'm looking at the librarians asking if they know one amongst you is clearly the mightiest said the elephant his strength enabled him to escape danger and reach the top of the hill first tiger roared in triumph but the elephant hadn't finished however he ignored a call for help along the way he lacks compassion tiger looked away another showed kindness to a stranger said the elephant gibbon nodded to himself but the elephant hadn ride on the backs of others he lacks resilience and gibbon hung his head there was one who was determined and untiring said the elephant one who kept on going until the end was reached water buffalo snorted with satisfaction that elephant hadn't finished however she was unable to face her fear and was forced far from the path she lacks courage water buffalo stopped snorting and one was the bravest said the elephant he faced a terrible adversary without fear gecko chirped with glee but the elephant hadn't finished however he was full hardy in the face of great peril even now he does not fully realize the danger he was in he lacks wisdom and gecko stopped chirping the four animals went away to think about what the elephant had said and there on top of the hill they understood that none of them possessed all of the qualities it took to be a great king when they returned to the temple they found themselves alone all around were fabulous carvings showing the life of an ancient elephant king scenes of strength compassion resilience and courage gibbon water buffalo and gecko went back down the hill as the years passed the four animals became great friends tiger grew more considerate gibbons stopped being lazy water buffalo overcame her timidity and gekko learned to be less foolhardy none of them ever did become a great ruler but those times had passed and they never forgot the day they met the last king of angkor wat the end that was that was the last king of angkor wat by graham bass and thank you very much for joining us this morning thank you for joining us from south stirling primary school and from banister creek primary school and james in albany and everyone else that joined in this morning it's great to have your company and really nice to have graham here with us too my name is glenn swift I've been your host this morning as has pamela knew as has lily the young person services who's also doing the elephant she's the young person services librarian here at riverton library in the city of canning and thanks also to sally our sitting over there so thank you to your teachers and thank you to all your parents and thank you to you just for being here with us today hope you've enjoyed our interview with graham bass live from riverton library on the 14th of october 2020
 it's relevant as well what do you have on offer at the city of canada for young people we've got a few things on offer and we have two youth centers so we've got our linwood youth center down on mccarth road and we also have our willatomius centre um we also do a lot of term programs dj workshops we also run school holiday programs fun interactive activities and we're also providing some online workshops as well being a protocol member part of city of canning probably for the last nine years I've had quite a bit of experiences I even went to primary school around the city of canada I went to wilton senior high school I've even used their facilities so going to the wilton library even the riverton library I used to come here and study all the time in year 11 and 12. I used to play sports and I think even the wilton youth center even in what we call the end of year 12 in particular I used to go there with my friends and I up after school so we used to go and play ping pong and stuff it was just a good way to wind down was it easy to make friends at the williston youth center yeah I think it was because in particular because I went to walton senior high school we used we knew everyone everyone was like sort of knew each other it was like even a year below us and stuff we were connected in some way especially in that community especially playing different sports I think was pretty easy to make friends and how important is it for those services to remain free for the young people I think it's especially important it's just a it's a way for some people to get away from stuff at home no matter what the situation is and I think being someone that is representative of the minority it was a good way to connect the community because when I first came to australia I think it was not as easy especially when I moved to perth but being part of the city of canada and being me in particular well at the city of canning as you know we've got a few drop-in centers um but what happens is you come through and you get to meet a community youth worker or an assistant youth worker they're all really easy going and love having a chat with young people we're just basically big kids ourselves and we just want to hang out enjoy some activities with you guys and we also just want to run some cool programs so at williton there's a dj room and there's a band room where you can come down check it out and um have a little play with some of your friends or book a session where you can actually try and practice or rehearse with your band we'd love to see you down there we love to just interact and connect and have a good time hi guys I'm lilly I'm the young people services librarian here at city of canning libraries so I work across all four of our libraries at riverton williton kennington and bentley your role sounds bit more about how the city of canning spaces support young people yeah sure so particularly our library spaces uh support young people by providing them a safe and welcoming place for them to come to all sorts of things to study come and read come and browse materials and also access lots of different resources and technology that they may not have access to at home or at school um one of the great things we have is also free wi-fi um so you can get on and check your socials that you need to do one thing that I really love about the library is that it's a place where um young people particularly can come to kind of have some time out be alone but in a library space you're actually never alone there's always always somebody there to talk to planning offer loads of programs for young people tell me about what young people might walk away with when they attend these programs um yeah so basically um it's such an opportunity for young people to grow in things like leadership so um I'm really passionate about making sure that young people have an opportunity to grow in their confidence and loads of other people who work here have that mindset as well so it's really important for us to provide opportunities for young people to have spaces to just be free to be themselves and explore things that they've not explored before so if they've never done coding before or whatever they can just give it go without any kind of agenda or without any embarrassment that they might get it wrong like we just want people to be able to express themselves and find their confidence and resilience amazing hey guys thanks for tuning in today we hope you learned a lot about the city of canning and how local government can support young people yeah and I hope now you know about all the programs that are on offer and the different youth centers that are available yeah we're excited to see everyone pop down and come say hi see ya you
Along with our partners we've been working really hard to try and think of a way to unlock some public open space inside the realm of the city centre project the benefits here are many and varied not only have we got such a beautiful now natural landscape here we blended technology and nature together lots of benefits around resourcing so the technology includes uh smart bins uh which means that we can actually send resources down to the park when they're most needed they've got a wonderful app you can go into the city of canning's website download the app and that allows people to check nutrient levels and obviously water health we had an opportunity to re-imagine what this water basin could look like and that's the result a wonderful beautiful mural a man-made island so that nesting birds can nest we've reintroduced turtles back long neck turtles back into this environment we've created something special for people but also something incredibly special for the local environment
The lake street urban stream is another one of the key projects within the canning city centre it's opening up a place that's currently filled with weeds and just used as drainage function and opening that up to the public creating public spaces and also improving and enhancing the environment there through a whole range of native plants they'll help improve the water quality provide habitat and biodiversity part of the urban nature of the living stream is being within the canning city centre it will provide places for people to interact move through and to see the space and experience it so pathways seating areas and general urban gathering areas will be created as part of the project the lake street urban strain project is also intrinsically linked to the adjacent cecil avenue east upgrade the two spaces sit alongside each other and will be designed by both landscape architecture teams to interlink and complement each other through their design and their delivery it'll create a pedestrian thoroughfare between the two spaces you
By canning its mere Patrick Hall here it's national volunteers week this week and today is a WoW day which is wear orange Wednesday and that's in recognition of the great work done by our state emergency services the SES and this morning I'm down here with all the volunteers at the canning South Perth SES Depot in Wilson what a fabulous outfit more great work they do in our community and I've come along this morning just to say thank you and acknowledge the work that they do so well for our community and we should all be thinking of them so today forget the chance put on something or it makes everyone I guess guys with all sort of things so we do searches for missing people we help with storm damage particularly when there's a threat to people's lives or to people's homes our unit has a flood profile what that means is that we have this beast over here but one st it's officially called so we basically use this to respond to flooding situation we've been we basically will get strategies to either get individuals to attract out of flooded areas or supplies my name is sweet this is my little brother I've been with the unit for about 10 to 11 years thereabouts I joined up when a search happened one day donut Barbaro for some little kids and I was at home unable to do anything and my brother okay yeah my brother-in-law and my other sister and were out doing the search and I felt really useless sitting at my doing nothing and up together choosing the option rescue side of it doesn't that die honest it's made a lot of people made a lot of friends see a lot of people come and go it's has been it's been an enjoyable ride it had a lot of fun a lot of fun every day is different you might get a phone call you know late in the afternoon or first thing in the morning and part of the variety and the unexpectedness of it all is what makes it so much fun and there is that part I enjoy being here helping the community and a lot of fundamental other people down other jobs that I've been inside there that open the top of her around it yeah I would say if you're thinking about it give it a go because you get to learn new skills you get to meet new people and it's quite a rewarding experience to be able to learn something you need to give back to the community
Hi this white goods right there is five items in white goods that you can ring up on demand and the council will come and pick them up free of charge you get two a year and that's washing machines dishwashers dryers fridges and microwaves
Is a continuation of cecil avenue west it's going to look very similar to what we've already constructed at cesar avenue west it's going to continue the paving themes the large trees and it's going to actually embellish the landscaping more than we've actually than we've done already at cesar avenue west there's going to be landscape nodes there's going to be public transport lanes separate public transport lanes and it's going to create a unique environment and entry to the northern part of the city center we're also going to have a lot of smart features so smart lighting wi-fi and future proofing dedicated bus lane for public transport such as trackless trams and light rail we want to see the state government actually invest in elevating the rail all the way through to the train station an elevated train station at cannington this is where the city center vision is for canning we're really keen to push hard to get that to happen cecil avenue east has been broken up into two stages so the first stage east and seven oaks and then after that we've got the second stage which is the construction and landscape work so all that will be done within the next two years
Had the canning city centre regeneration program going for around three years now and we thought we'd take stock and employ a consultant to review how we're tracking against some of those objectives what the consultant has advised us is that we've seen visitation rates increase substantially since uh 2016. we've also found that the number of jobs created since the program was adopted uh was around 1100 jobs and also I think like significantly in reimagining cecil avenue we've seen a reduction in traffic crashes in the area and we've also seen through the the creation of the amenity new amenity in an area that hasn't had it before significant investment attraction into city centre the future looks really bright for the city center we've already delivered the wall street basin a transformational project not just for wa it's for australia-wide it's something that's really unique also cecil avenue west has really defined how public realm in a street setting can be viewed it's a major project before we start moving on to the lakes red urban stream and cecil avenue east
 so today we're going to have a chat with michelle who is our held youth worker and also have a little chat with elysee and hadi who are our youth reference group members really really lucky at headspace armadale we have a youth reference group so that's a group of young people what we try and do is give them the opportunity to have their voices heard have a say on important issues in the community and also meet other young people from values reference group elisa do you want to tell everyone a little bit about why you think it's important for young people to connect up with their local community hi chennai um personally I think it's very important that young people get support from local and city councils communities because I've had a good experience with them I've had I've worked with them on few projects it's really good because you get the chance to talk with the local councils and get involved with them and the good thing about it is that you don't do it need anything they're there it's a team that's gonna go all the way through with you until the end of the project what would you tell young people who want to get involved in their communities well I think one of the things that young people can always do is to utilize the services that's that's available in the community and if there's something that they're interested in they can always go for those for those services and and try to find a space that they feel comfortable to pitch in their ideas their voices and whatever whatever initiative they want to take on so honey if you were a young person living in the city of canning what are some things that you can do to get more involved in the community well I guess in one of the stunning things that you can do is to ask for guidance reach out get the get contacts with right people youth workers and representatives from different governing bodies if there's someone in the council a community engagement person or if there's always have a conversation with them and um and and go from there hi guys I hope you enjoyed today's episode and you learned a little bit about youth advocacy we really try and all work together to make sure young people have a voice in the community yeah and I hope that you learned from their personal experiences of the young people that we interviewed and how they got involved with their local community as well as headspace and I hope that will be really valuable for you moving forward yeah if you're interested in joining any of our youth reference groups or teaming up with local councils get in touch speak to a youth worker and just have a chat with them yeah see you guys next time bye guys you
 hi everyone I'm michelle kelly's working here at headspace in armadale and I'm chanel I'm the community engagement officer here and I'm actually one of the youth access workers so you might have seen chanel on my face out at your school doing workshops or maybe adding your community running some events but we actually work quite closely together don't we yeah we work really closely together we work on developing workshops making sure they're appropriate for young people and making sure we're supporting them in the best way as well as delivering workshops michelle and chanel help young people know how to refer into our from our youth and nasa's actually had his own personal journey with mental health do you want to tell us a little bit about how you use headspace as a mental health support service sure um my journey with hospice family does started back in 2018. um it's I was definitely terrified going in as for everything else yeah um as I built a good relationship with my psychologist there I've definitely copying skills yeah yeah and yeah and how is that coping skills helped you with life now um I still have my ups and downs but definitely much better than I was back then yeah and would you what would you say to other young people that are going through a bit of a tough time um I'm one of the clinicians here I deliver therapy to young people that are 12 to 25 years old and what can a young person expect from a session in therapy okay so normally when um people come in we'll get them to do a quick survey out in the waiting room and then they'll come into here into one of our therapy rooms normally a session is about 50 minutes long and we will be focusing usually on one particular area or aspect so that might be working with self-esteem that might be sketching some things out on the whiteboard it might be um doing some mindfulness sometimes we use chocolate awesome um it really depends on what it is that's one person overall I think by have greater confidence um that they have yeah develops this kind of toolkit and they have an awareness of when to use it as well I think that's a really important part of being able to navigate some of life's challenges is knowing when to actually we need that extra little bit of support yeah I can see how that's really important what would you say to a young person who has decided that they might need a little bit of support but they're also feeling quite nervous I think I would say that that's a really common experience whenever we're starting anything new if you think about when you've started a new job or your first day at school it's really common to have that unsettled feeling but if you take that next step you get to see that we're really not that scary kind of aliens um we are people that are in your corner to help you work through whatever it is you're going through hey guys thanks for watching today we really hope you enjoyed we think that listening to ashley's professional opinion and what an ass went through in his journey will assist you and let you know there are supports available to young people and where to find them yeah and I hope you enjoyed our let's talk series and learn a little bit about youth advocacy how to have a voice in your community and also different places where you can meet your friends visit new programs that sort of thing yeah and we also hope you learnt a lot more about mental health and where to seek support remember if you're feeling quite low or quite sad for a period of over two weeks it definitely is a sign to get um some support yeah and you can seek support by I guess contacting your local headspace and you can also call lifeline and kids helpline as well and we'll pop the numbers on the screen bye for now
The sister kate's kids corporation has committed in the development of our place of healing not to allow our history to define us but actually to be a source of strength and a place of wisdom and a means of connection both to the story that we had no choice in making but we do get the choice to do what we need to do with it and that is in the heart of the relationship between the city of county and the sistercats corporation in creating this really unique opportunity because we can baby so so so I just wanted to connect you and invite you to be part of that story that's been written every day and it gets written in these moments these are the joining moments where we come together this is history making this was unimagined 67 years ago that we would sit together and have this conversation in the way that we could you
 public open space in the local government domain is an increasingly rare commodity what we've done here is we have unlocked a full hectare of open space right in the heart of the canning city centre by transforming a formerly unused and fully fenced storm water drain to a smart park that will provide benefit to this community for generations to come one of the smartest things about the wharf street basin project is the fact that we've taken down the fences they've been up for close to 60 years storm water basins play a critical role in flood prevention but they can also play another really important role in water quality by planting native plants which also provide great habitat and look beautiful we can actually help clean the water through natural systems and processes our sensors dotted around the park gives important information about water quality rubbish bins irrigation and lighting and it's available to anyone through our open data portal the smart canning app takes water education to the next level and brings it into the augmented reality space these kinds of use and to increase the amount of usable public open space so the future is very bright and it's going to enable our community to be involved and enjoy a part that's not been there previously you
 public open space in the local government domain is an increasingly rare commodity how do local governments particularly urban governments find more public open space it's through innovation one of the smartest things about wall street basin project is the fact that we've taken down the fences they've been up for close to 60 years and it's going to enable our community to be involved and enjoy a park that's not been there previously so drainage and storm water management has typically been hidden behind fences and these kinds of sites offer us such an amazing potential to allow community use and to increase the amount of usable public open space so the future is very bright and there are sites like this popping up all over perth through our drainage livability program stormwater basins play a critical role in flood prevention but they can also play another really important role in water quality by planting native plants which also provide great habitat and look beautiful we can actually help clean the water through natural systems and processes this project has brought together a unique part for canning smart canning app takes water education to the next level and brings it into the augmented reality space through the app that the city has developed they'll be able to see real-time water quality data through the sensors that have been deployed in the park that will allow people to actually interact with that data and really get an understanding of how these basins play an important role but how a new approach to stormwater management can have real improvements to water quality they'll also get an understanding of how their own actions will impact water quality from putting grass clippings down the drain not picking up dog poo or letting pollutants like plastics and other things enter our waterways our sensors dotted around the park gives important information about water quality rubbish bins irrigation and lighting the data that's collected from our denses is available online through our open data portal and is available to anyone the members of the public researchers or other local government organizations as a pilot project curtin university will use the park as a research their impacts on urban regeneration the findings will be used to inform the transformation of similar sites throughout metropolitan perth what we've done here is we have unlocked a full hectare of open space right in the heart of the canning city centre by transforming a formerly unused and fully fenced storm water drain to a smart park that will provide benefit to this community for generations to come I'm so pleased with this project and I'm so pleased with the finished product well done everyone and congratulations to our project partners what a collaborative effort you

My name is telemini meyer and I'm the ceo of the sister kate's home kids aboriginal corporation but I also am a um sister kate home kid of survivor of the stolen genes I know a lot about sister cates from what I've read I'm still on that journey myself I know was formed in the early 1930s and I know the history and his connection to the solemn generation and we looked at what was wrong with all of our people and as this decay at home kids we thought well you know even though we have a part of the stolen generation we've got the intergenerational trauma that's actually also been unwittingly passed to our our children and our younger gens we were all felt quite sick at heart so we identified that we were suffering from soul sickness I think to be absolutely frank with you a lot of people don't understand the significance of what happened during that period and I think it's of such significance to indigenous people but at times I think with some shame of my own background you know it's up to us all to educate ourselves about what happened back then but I can tell you quite frankly as a father of four sons I can't imagine what it would be like to have those children taken away I would never get over it I would never recover from it and I think that what we're seeing now is the trauma from what occurred has actually separated families and that is a generational thing because one of the problems that we actually did identify is that we had lost our way we were not just stolen genes but were also the lost children and we were lost kids because we didn't know who we were we were assimilated to a level of not being known where we fit within our family in our community so what we did with our type of programs we looked at the core focus of a healing a healing program and that's a cultural healing program sister cates has been a real shining light for me I've only been on the council an awful lot to do with sister cates most recently as a mayor and I know how the regard in which they're considered at both the federal state and local government levels the wonderful thing about the city of canning and the sister cates is that over the last three to four years we've developed a really close working relationship and that's not just come from going in and ticking a few boxes that's taking a hell of a lot of effort to be able to change people's minds or to even introduce a whole different philosophy within their own selves well this is where the bush block played a big part because we used to run away um and I say that I don't say that that lightly either we used to run away from the regime the strict regime that we were living under in the home over the road to the bush block so once we were there we had that whole sense of freedom it was just it was magic really and I can even though I'm hitting 70 with a group of homies across that land it's more than just a bush block isn't it I mean it's what it means to people we talk about reconciliation action groups and action plans and we had our first in 2018 but the bush block out there as a place of healing is actually reconciliation in action well this bush block is about five acres of pristine country it's not been built on before it's in the city limits it's only about what 10 not even that case from perth and the concept plan that we um devised is only uses ten uh five percent of of of the land you know you can't expect to walk on that healing run alone uh we have to all work together and we see that place of healing in that bushwhack playing a very very significant role now and in the future for that to happen uh it's more than just reconciliation we're seeing that in in spirit and so for us to be able to have the opportunity as a council and with tj and the board at sistercates to make something more meaningful there and to work collaboratively with the group to make sure that what occurs on that side is in keeping with expectations but also that it actually blends the community together we need to find some common ground there and I think we have that's what I've actually seen in the last few years is that we are now starting to work far more closely together well the city of canning knew that we were putting lots of programs around the metropolitan area and they approached us and says well is there any chance that we can actually do a um annual gathering of some kind for the community that is opened up to all of the community and artists as well what about the kent street we are I support kent street where also is a significant place for sister kate home kids because it was a part of our childhood you know I often get asked to come and speak at these things it's very easy to come with prepared answers to prepared and be genuine they asked us to develop a program and say what do you think they said absolutely fabulous because it gave it's big enough to hold a lot of people and our first program which is two years ago we had over I don't know 300 people come along because I were interested how can a city of canning works with a stolen gen organisation but also aboriginal people and they were so blown away with the program that we delivered that's morphed now into an annual event so the sister kate's kids corporation has committed in the development of our place of healing not to allow our history to define us but actually to be a source of strength and a place of wisdom and a means of connection both to the story that we had no choice in making but we do get the choice to do what we need to do with it and that was in the heart of the relationship between the city accounting and the sistercats corporation in creating this really unique opportunity because we can and invite you to be part of that story that's been written every day and it gets written in these moments these are the joining moments where we come together this is history making this was unimagined 67 years ago that we would sit together and have this conversation in the way that we could we've held several programs on the bush block now which we're hoping to actually hold more as things progress and we develop the site but one of the programs that we did I think it was spring 2019 was a gathering of women or we tried to hold men and women's cultural healing bush camps at least once to a year just for home kids and their young youth and the young fellas but this time around what we thought that we would do is to invite other sisters so it's about strengthening the sisterhood not just with aboriginal and noongar and homey families and community members but also we opened it up to connect with other sisters and we had about 66 sisters on on site which took cultures I had quiet moments while standing in the bush looking into the circle of the women and our children and they were just so connected because it showed the bush block at its true potential in how it can provide a space loved when they were sitting on the ground all the sisters were sitting on the ground with the kids and teaching them about the environment we were telling them our story and you could see the elders from a group of indian ladies that came to support us and they were just absolutely blown away with the connection that they could see the love and that that that sort of generated out of the children to the elders and that's really what sister kate's want people to see because I think it's very important that we you know have these times and the sisterhood and the woman's healing camp actually proved that that can actually be a success today we are doing um a program for women's healing it's one of the first bush block uh gatherings with the women today all come together um a place of healing it was for us when we're younger it is for us today and it's going to be us for the future that not just homies or everybody that's the beauty of this place I'm not a sister kate's home kid but I work for sister kate's and I'm not a stolen gen I'm a stolen gen descendant my grandmother was a descendant from montgomery mission but we've all had those traumatic experiences and we've all been you know it's part it's a trauma that's been passed down this block here is very significant to the sisticates people that had been there but also for their descendants because you do need a place to gather and you do need a healing space and I think that the one thing that working in systocates is that I have found that the homies are so generous in giving and wanting to hear when they're healing themselves they want to share you know so they give everyone so everyone understands we can only remove that way if we all heal younger booker there you go yoga anything to do in in cultural like culturally in any indigenous culture where women are getting together and you know gathering and being creative it creates a an atmosphere for them to have conversation and and being able to open up and to also heal because when you were around with other women and that's what we had traditionally you had women's business and you had men's business but in all indigenous cultures right around the world you had that group of women that gave the strength and in those kind of strength kind of things she had that creative essence and a lot of it is yes flowers are healing from you know globally right around the world whether we know it or not we are all connected that's my firm belief and it gives me a great pleasure to be with people and when I see a smile in anyone else's face well if you can help heal yourself and if you're in a clear mind clear intent clear mind in the whole the whole process if you're feeling good then you're able to help your community in a better way because your approach is going to be different so if you start so yeah it's just like you know when you're chucking a rock in into water and it starts to ripple out so if you've got a nice centre of feeling good then you're actually expanding it out and that's how you help a community because you can't help a community if you're not well with any kind of wildflower or any essences a person that is being treated uh within any all shows any kind of symptom the client and the person that's working with them would um you know doing and then I didn't say the word analysis of that person and find out just like if you went to a doctor but you'd be looking at it in a home that's the difference it's a holistic process so it doesn't just treat the ailment whole it's a holistic approach um so you find out what was wrong with the person so if they had a tummy ache and what they were doing and then you'd know what kind of flowers that they would need to be treated I am placing warm water into a bowl for a foot bath and you'll see it's got some little geralt and wax flowers in it um and I'm also placing in some flower essences I guess the bank ship woodland that we're sitting in is an important piece of bushland in the swan coastal plain which includes the area of the perth metropolitan region banshee woodlands are in danger there's not much of it left and it's really important that we care for them so teaching the kids about the bush land gives you an understanding of why it's important and teaches them to protect it into the future we will teach them different species that are common to the bank you would like and we can do the species that are in the venture within here and scientific names sister kate's home kids will teach them our names for those and they'll learn about the animals and how they rely on different plants to survive the strength to me is sharing culture because if you share culture you're educating people to understand and walk in your corner your shoes but also to respect that we're all different but we all come from different places but being culturally grounded to this land and being part of here it's important for the others to come and share and acknowledge as well so when we all share and we bond together then we all walk together and then that's when everything else gets stripped away and we walk with sisters because we're not any different we're all the same thank you boys you're good hey yoga foreign this country is strong these women are strong their spirit is strong and may whatever journey we all take we do it together as we walk forward to the future together the men's camp this time around um was brilliant and I'm that to lip service either to show how our elders speak and work with our young fellas because a lot of our young fellas suffer um you know mega problems they that they that they're actually in you know trauma recovery too so I looked at all of that and I and I watched how um the the the elder spoke and how he guided the young ones through the cultural components kayak I'd like to acknowledge uh sister kates for putting this on for the weekend and I'm going to call on the old people to come in to be part of us and bring their knowledge to our camp to our fire to our carla and we're going to share this over the next day and a half we're not only just doing bush science we're doing all the subjects what our old people used to do and by making glue it's young to farm this stuff the aboriginal people used to farm the land with a little fire to melt the trunks up of the grass trees or the we'd come along and we'd collect it and we'd make glue out of it now these guys are going to show you what to do with this so grab your um boy or your rocks grab your younger winner tap your rocks and start grinding so get it too fine make it fine you've got watching can we do this after step back now you three you saw what they've done do it exactly like they did now you can stay there glenn to keep that fire going and humble over here get to work as a team be careful with it take your time your own wooden building today and this is ancient because you don't understand push it on a point bonus point honest end that's the boy you just made an ancient pool it isn't what's this tool called codge clutch stone axe quite you're the town called kojonup it's got to name the place of the axe how are you feeling right now good good feeling good yes now look here look what you've that's it now come down this way because I want to share share a story with you you need to understand this story for us as aboriginal people long long long long time ago in your netting in the cold time when the land was soft everything you can imagine was in spirit form they all gathered in this place like this and they were cutting they were listening and learning who's going to become carers of everything who's gonna care for everything the trees they dominated the discussion there were that many of them and they just said listen we don't move will you stay in one place we wouldn't be able to do justice to this budget we wouldn't be able to look after this land because we don't move anywhere we just stay in one place they said what we'll do is we'll provide for those who win the right to care for everything mother earth don't see color she don't care who you are all you got to do is show her respect because she of feeling stuff in our stories you've got to learn these stories to cut caring for our country and when you start learning these stories you start caring for yourself your stories you are an aboriginal people you are people caring for the country caring for yourself this story I'm talking about is there and you follow us gotta learn this and know that and our brothers here got to understand this because it's part of them too as well I'm going to tell you the story that the woody wanker he went out and kept all his food got all this knowledge dog people taught him all this knowledge and he was getting tired they went down the street that he never heard sleep but before he did that he had to give back something he had to give back to all the knowledge that he had and all these other plans food everything for the old people so he decided to do a little dance that's the little dance that we're going to do next everybody's gonna be in the circle these times and without being stressing out because we carry too much stress a lot of our people not only not only aboriginal people but a lot of people do not sit down and talk because they're shamed of it ashamed of what they're carrying but in spaces like this this is where we share this is why we need to have these talks like this you need to let it out you need to talk it out because this is good medicine we as people need to see this and feel this and be part of this that's where your healing starts sister coats is very dedicated into threading through a whole reconciliation thread through our programs and the collaborations that we do I think the key for us at them at the moment is uh you know we've been on the reconciliation journey for a very long time and did that willingly so this gives them an opportunity to show the world that they are committed to their rap and also committed assisted cates not just about the bush block but also working as a collective family within the community you

The city of canning has worked hard with its partners to achieve the wharf street basin next generation community park project a key project within the canning city centre that aims to integrate nature within the urban form realising outcomes for a thriving economy healthy environment healthy people and places the next generation park is a new piece of public open space it was formerly a fenced off inaccessible drainage basin through smart design and technology the space has been transformed implementing water's sensitive urban design to the drainage assets throughout the city is a key element of the transformation of the city centre within the wharf street project these principles have been used to create a nutrient stripping wetland to remove pollutants through natural systems and plantings while creating a biodiverse beautiful place to be the storm water drainage flows into the basin as part of the local drainage system and the arterial drainage system as storm water flows through urban areas it picks up pollutants typically these would flow through the system ending up in places like the basin after water leaves the area it makes its street constructed wetlands before flowing downstream and entering the canning river water quality in the canning river is a key issue and this project reduces pollution by providing outsource areas for pollutants to be removed be their nutrients plastics or others through water sensitive urban design in the use of natural plantings and processes it improves water quality while increasing biodiversity and stopping pollution reaching our rivers and oceans the city of canning is dedicated to its water sensitive city vision it has been awarded as a platinum waterwise council the wall street basin project is both waterwise water sensitive innovative and collaborative and embodies the city's vision to be a welcoming and thriving city a place where people and nature will thrive this project sets precedent for how these drainage assets of which there are hundreds across metropolitan perth may be utilized in the future it has been a collaboration with the city's project partners all of which have played a vital role in transforming this area and helping to continue the work to protect the natural treasure that is the canning river
Uh thanks everybody what an absolute pleasure to be here today the innovation of this project is um that as you can see behind me we've got a commercial environment and also a normal urban environment surrounded by busy streets uh and homes where can we find in a in a completely built in urban environment where could we possibly find a full hectare of public open space and it's only through innovation that we can unlock these hidden gems because we certainly can't find that urban space anywhere else we've got the forstner task patriating 13 beautiful long neck or snake neck tortoises or turtles back into this basin so just so you know those turtles have all been microchipped some of them over 60 years of age and have lived almost their entire life in this basin I declare the wharf street basin next generation park open you
Are you a city of canning business owner are you experiencing some level of graffiti on your business please contact us we can help this wonderful initiative between the western australian police the city of canning and clean it and we will do all the work for you we even coordinate that work we simply need you to contact us and in doing so you'll help us deliver a cleaner more attractive canning thanks everyone apply for this program at coming shy it was very easy and helpful they helped me a lot and the graffiti has been here for the last 25-30 years and I cleaned up a couple of times and now look like we're going to be the end of it see nice and clean and I want to put a nice peaches after finish dubwa police are always continually looking at innovative solutions and key partnerships with local government and businesses to try and look at ways of preventing it and reducing it happening again one of the programs that's been out for a while now is the rapid removal what graffiti it then starts defeating the purpose of putting it up and we do know from some of the research we've done is that it discourages people to revisit and put that graffiti back up so programs like this are excellent but what it does it gives local businesses and the community the avenue and the tools to go and remove graffiti rapidly
I think we've all been so busy with our nine to five jobs and all of the stressors in life you know the bills and the kids that we really haven't had much time to slow down and reflect on what is really important I'm valerie weyland I work as a community builder for a befriend in the canningville area a lot of the anxiety that came with kovid the fear of the unknown and a lot of people lost their jobs so there was a lot of despair and sorrow and I felt helpless how can I help my friends when I can't help them get a new job or make them feel better immediately but I just focus on what I can do what is my value in this space for me it's all about creating space for conversations I love to talk and so that's what I did I run a safe space for women of color called brown girl bloom and so I decided to use zoom a great way to chat online without leaving your home some of those women of color during a radical time of unease it was a great way to just kind of unpack and explore ways to feel inspired through other people's stories people forget that we're all human and we all have internal struggles that we don't always express to one another if I'm not feeling okay I'll slow down take the time to meditate and acknowledge the emotions that I have at that time what's really difficult for me is the fact that I'm not from australia I'm born and raised in california and my my family they're in the hot spot in the world right now as it pertains to covid so there was a lot of anxiety there worrying if you know my family members would get sick and what would happen I probably wouldn't be able to leave so I just made sure to touch base with them often and really let go meditating is such a beautiful gift and so whenever I felt a lot of anxiety again I would go right back to that still point in few years back I had a really bad basketball injury that actually ended my career and it was a really dark point in my life but also filled with a lot of light my injury was like that turning point to liberate me because I no longer wanted to do the things that validated other people's desires but I wanted to fulfill my own I was always a people pleaser I always wanted to make people feel good about themselves and it was always also to the detriment of my own well-being it's really hard to see light in a really difficult situation you're often asking yourself why me why is this happening to me but if we can step back and say well what am I meant to learn from this experience and that's exactly what I did when I had my injury and I was feeling really depressed I asked myself what can I learn from this am I happy where I'm at and what I realized is that I wasn't and I was ready for a change I think that a thing but for me darkness has light within it and if you can see the light and darkness you can see joy and liberation within it as well you
Today you'll hear from people acting for social economic and environmental sustainability in a broad range of areas from grassroots inventors to ceos of cross regional peak bodies to inspiring filmmakers and everyone in between a common theme they're all working for a better future I think it's such a good opportunity to bring community local business leaders state and local government together to really look at what are some of the practical changes that we can make in our own lives to start addressing some of these you know really big problems around the surrounding climate change and I just see so many people smiling because they're feeling hopeful they're feeling empowered you
That symbol of the tree standing in front of them means that they don't have to spiral out of control that all they have to do is just say help me and someone will be there my name is eddie evans and I live in queens park my experience with coven so far has hasn't been too bad I live by myself so I've coped with isolating pretty well the blue tree project is any dead tree anywhere that is painted blue to symbolize hope for mental illness and it's not just within australia or western australia it is across the country and it's also gone international as well I identified with that very early on and I'd and I thought straight away that I want to do a blue tree in the city of canning to bring awareness to the community and the city of canning have been very generous in their help with that I'm doing that with in conjunction with the academy city lions club and I'm the president at this point and I'm also very proud painted in massey park and rossmoyne and that's going to happen in october it must be hard with the covert situation at the moment where families can't_''_90.0 be together particularly in times of sickness and when when family members pass away I can relate to that because unfortunately I couldn't be with my father when he passed I suffered from depression pretty badly and I didn't realise at the time what was happening it wasn't until probably about maybe 12 months down the track a few cracks started appearing in my marriage I couldn't I could do a lot of things I couldn't cope with and I was going down and if it wasn't_''_123.119 for the intervention of a couple of really good friends they picked me up and pulled me up and without their help I wouldn't be standing here today getting from that place to where I am today is being able to function efficiently as a if you like a reformed person someone has been through the whole circle and when I see someone who's and done that I can reach out to them a lot better my whole life is completely different ever since I i sought help I'm now president of the local lions club I I'm involved with my children and my grandchildren I love being with my grandkids I think that's my whole well-being good mental health to me is being able to function and get on with things is the way they should be
My name's marie taylor and I've been asked to talk about my involvement in the past three or four months while this coronavirus has been around I care for a little four-year-old granny who was put in my care from the time he was six months old he's kindy at school and when he found out that school wasn't gone he was really upset and so I had to put him back in daiki when we first knew about the virus I think it was a little bit of a joke um because we didn't think that we would get it and um and then when we heard about you know ships coming into fremantle and and people bringing the virus in it started to really worry us and then I said to my daughter who is my carer I said look we need to be making sure that our mental health is taken care of we don't realize that when issues like the coronavirus comes into our life how important it is to support each other even when you go down the shop't know and to see a smile on their face it doesn't hurt anybody to treat the other person how you would want them to treat you when we bring up mental health we forget about the little ones because the little ones worry about things as well so we need to always be mindful that there are issues going on in our family whether it be big or small and we need to know that we can handle it how do we handle it by reading about it by talking about it and by sharing our story with each other as I have today yonka thank you
Hi everyone I'm mayor patrick hall I just wanted to talk to you for a moment about covid19 I haven't recorded a video about it for some time I just wanted to say that we've been particularly fortunate here in perth in western australia but it's no time for complacency we must remain aware we must keep social distancing physical distancing in place we are still in a state of emergency we're not out of this yet and I'm asking you to maintain healthy habits and if you're feeling unwell or exhibiting cold and flu symptoms please stay home consider being tested and those testing stations can be found on the wa health website so help us keep canning safe and western australia safe we need to remain healthy and we need to keep those healthy habits going for a little while longer hugs and handshakes well we need to restrict those to family only I think at the moment or not at all but please we're not out of this yet be vigilant canning and we'll get through this very soon thanks everyone for your continuing cooperation bye
In the beginning I was super cut that I felt like I lost a lot of the work that I had built up through the previous years but as it went on I realized that I i needed that break to to kind of look into myself and look into how I was treating myself I'm tobias mahafoden I go by tobias on stage and I went to limwood senior high school I've been working this music thing since I was 16. I was at school I produced mixed mastered and wrote my whole first mixtape um in year 12._''_37.6 and since then I've been writing I've been producing was played a lot of shows that I was very proud of and when covert came it kind of felt like it stopped all of that momentum and all that hard work covert made me take more time on my art I stopped rushing a lot of things I got back into riding on my guitar rather than just on a computer with my beats I think I started doing what I want to do for something that wasn't what I ever really got into music for most challenging thing in my life in general is putting myself first I tend to put everyone else's problems or like difficulties on me and I want to solve them but when I can't I gets me down and then I also never tend to look at whatever my own problems are my advice to other artists who feel down about not being able to perform or not feeling like their art is going to be appreciated it's just to stick at it because I think that's the only thing we have and if if art if music if acting if painting is something that you're really passionate about it's what's going to help you through these tough times
I've been through what millions of australians are going through right now which is unemployment that causes severe frustration in their life my name is dan and I live in shelly city of canning unemployment was pretty terrible for me uh given the circumstances that we were saving for a house my wife was heavily pregnant and basically I was pretty stressed due to the downturn in the market I didn't know whom to talk to and whom to seek support from so it was pretty terrible for me to restore my mental health and well-being I made sure I did three things I reached out to my local friends and a helpline number from lifeline wa to just to seek guidance and seek support and vent out my frustrations secondly I joined up park runs and went for long walks around the river as well as joined a bicycle group lastly the most important thing that I did was volunteering volunteering through the local council salvation army and volunteering wa volunteering is seen as a good thing in the australian job sector because when you volunteer and keep your mind active and brain active because that's how you get to meet new people and help out which is kind of correlated to the actual in any industry that you work in my next employer in my current field uh identified and asked me that question of how did I spend time during my unemployment and when I mentioned about volunteering that I volunteered with three different organizations to keep my weeks busy they sort of saw it as a positive I would recommend anyone who is in my position of unemployment to volunteer because it helps you sleep better at night it keeps your day active and most importantly you it helps you make new friends who are as generous as you say a
G'day my name's dr tony thatcher I'm the local jp and I've been for the last 40 odd years um I'm also heavily involved with the river center itself I'll point out and uh as an ex-serviceman I i agree with the principles of the rsl and of course this indicates that I'm pretty involved with the wilton football club well eu presents difficulties and if we move away from the economic side of the thing it's um a lot of people are struggling mentally to cope with it mainly because of confinement in their domestic situations and of course some of them are not coping with the fact that they are in a domestic environment 24 hours a day from a personal point of view is that because I'm in an environment where I'm helping people I helping people through the rsl go through their normal struggles and I'm talking about mental health struggles that most sex servicemen and service women deal with um the covert virus issues is that by me helping somebody else then that's all of this the way to get on is you just keep taking a step forward and that's the message we've all got to do in australia at the moment take a step forward how do I value what do I get out of it well my daily chore is making my wife laugh mental health if I was going to offer any advice for anybody with mental health issues talk to a friend now that friend doesn't have to be an expert doesn't have to be a family member just go and speak about it you
I'm gemma I grew up in riverton and have worked for the city of canning for six years covered for me was a time to slow down and reassess I'd suffered quite bad with postnatal depression after the birth of my little guy I actually didn't hit me till about eight months postpartum um and for me I was a happy-go-lucky person I was always positive I had this great attitude in life and for me it really hit home that um you know mental health doesn't discriminate and after you've had a baby for a lot of women this is something that's actually very very normal I knew I wasn't okay but I did a very good job every day of just getting up I made myself busy I did all the act belong commit things that you need to do but my epiphany moment is when I offered to go down and get pizza from our local takeaway shop and I remember driving and just thinking I wonder how far I could drive before I ran out of fuel and it one you can explain unless you've also been in the moment but at that point I went hang on gems not normal and that was the moment I went and saw my gp if your gp doesn't quite understand you see another gp and if things then really aren't going your way you can reach out through our hospital system and we have a couple of really great mother baby units that are there to support you for me that was my journey my gp for me wasn't a great experience and I ended up in the mother baby unit but for me that changed my life very quickly they turned things around for me and I ended up on a really positive path with raphael services it was all free so for moms that are struggling they'll set you up with all of your medication they'll cover all of your psychology anything that you need it's done I remember in there the turning point for me when I thought this is okay things are going to be okay is when one asthma you would treat it gem if you broke your leg you would get a cast this is exactly the same thing quit fighting it and go on the journey to be better you
 my name is nisha I'm a community youth worker at the city of canning I work at the linwood youth centre and I love to engage with young people and support them through their journey during the crowbird pandemic I was going through some personal stuff at that time and I found it really difficult to separate the work from the personal stuff because obviously I was working from my home space I think my experiences through covert have definitely helped me be more equipped to help other young people I've also had people ask me and those really hard moments are you okay and I think just being able to verbalize it no I'm not okay and I need some help it's really hard but it's amazing to put that out there I have a history of depression in our family and I am from new zealand and I have no family here so I'm a single mom and I have three girl twins so not being able to have those connections with my work colleagues was really difficult I noticed signs with depression and there were moments where I would just be sad all the time and I would cry and um I just felt like I wasn't enjoying the time with my children when I should have been and it was then I think I was at the supermarket one day that I broke down in tears because my child wasn't listening um that it really hit home that I need to go talk to someone I would definitely recommend therapy um so if you're out there and you aren't okay it's okay to not be okay I wanted to share my story today because I wanted to show my vulnerability um and if we show our vulnerability we break down those barriers and it makes us more relatable especially for our young people there's a book that I was reading and the author said in it too often we try to survive during the days as parents um when really we should be thriving and for me um good mental health means you were thriving so you're thriving in all areas of a lot of self-reflection I have noticed that I've grown since I've gotten that help and all I can do is ask for more help and keep on growing and just doing the best that I can and knowing that's enough
My name is madeline tetonshi and I manage canning river cafe when covert 19 first hit um we definitely were worried we were quite concerned because we have a family business and my whole family works hospitality so we were very worried that we were going to lose our jobs but the community really came together and supported us my name is lee greene I'm the business owner of canning river cafe and I live in ferndale when covert 19 first hit we had just come back from vietnam and had to self-isolate for two weeks my beautiful daughter madeline and her husband nawaf had to run the business and they were running on the ground trying to sort out all this stuff and we were just on the phone the hardest thing that happened during this time was letting stuff go that was quite difficult we've um worked with people for a really long time seeing them go through high school through uni careers and yeah we had to let them go and it was just one of that was a very difficult decision we found day like even if they had lost jobs or if they were affected and they were just making like buying one dollar coffee or just anything they could afford buying vouchers then they could buy food up later a lot of us have been obviously working a lot more just trying to do everything that we can so we don't have to pay for any extra hours and it has been a lot and if I really had to come together as a family and just work a lot more as a team the role of a cafe in a community is one of connection we can be a point of light make it about people first not about the survival but make it about the people and that way everyone starts to feel like this is a real deal we're all in it together and we can help each other for me being in the cafe here and being with people just keeps me in that really beautiful piece of mind I love being with people and it's been amazing feeling support and that kind of us it starts with the individual and then it starts to filter out into a larger group I think that's super important we've been able to bring back a few of the staff members that we've had a few others have found other jobs and they're really happy which is amazing and we all keep in contact still like they message us we call them all the time so and they'll come into the cafe and check in we're reliant on each other we rely on the integrity and the quality of our relationships and making sure that we are looking after each other in every moment um it's simple a lot of people who just live like down the street have been coming in every day because they now work from home so they don't have to travel they have time for coffee and it's been amazing we've met so many people heard lots of stories and yeah just feel like we've got a really big beautiful family you
Hi everyone I'm mayor patrick hall with a wrap-up of the ordinary council meeting from august this month due to the uncertainty of covert 19 and the increased risks with large gatherings council has decided not to proceed with the 2021 new year's day fireworks event now I realize that this decision will be disappointing to many of you but we must remember that australia is still in the grip of a global pandemic and the wa remains in a state of declared emergency the loss of life in victoria is a tragic and stark reminder of the devastating impact covert can have and so council has taken a sensible and in my view pragmatic approach I feel certain that residents will accept the decision and understand the reasons for it forgoing a 20-minute fireworks display is really a small sacrifice instead the city will increase the number of neighborhood events throughout the year and will partner with local community groups to foster local connection and celebrate the diversity within the canning community council last night also refused an applicant's request to remove an important stand of drive in ross moyne the city has one of the lowest levels of canopy cover in the perth metro area and it's important that we retain our trees this is why we've developed an urban forest strategy that aims to increase canopy cover across the city and why our objective is always to remain retain mature trees wherever possible the decision we made is consistent with our environmental objectives and it illustrates council's commitment to improving upon low level of street canopy council has also agreed to provide land at coulson wayne canningvale to the canning communities menshed for a new shed subject to them receiving funding for constructing a fit for purpose building on that site council also nominated councillors porter and councillor sibiri as voting delegates to attend the western australian local government association known as welga annual general meeting on friday the 25th of september welga represents the political and strategic interests of local government at both state and federal levels by attending this meeting the city has a voice and importantly a vote in response to concerns regarding overflow parking from the very restricted curbside parking on one side of surrey road between fern road and watts road in wilson and has approved a stopping ban on both sides of fern road this decision will address concerns raised by local residents regarding access to their own properties it removes potential hazardous situations and keeps the safety of road users front of mind and that's important the city will also be entering into a new lease with both telstra and doctors for a portion of lot one metcalfe road in ferndale both telcos have been located at that site for almost 20 years and the new lease renewal guarantees continued and uninterrupted communication services within the area using existing infrastructure to find out more about any of these decisions made by council this month please visit the city of canning's website stay safe everyone and enjoy the remainder of your week goodbye

I'm tracy mcgraw I'm the principal psychologist of tracy mcgraw international I live in shelley and I do so many different things but you know basically I help people to thrive I was a lifeline crisis counsellor for three plus years whether you're lonely whether you've just had a bad day you don't have to be suicidal it's there for support people are often afraid of asking are you okay because they don't feel qualified they're worried about what's going to happen if you say you're not and the analogy I think of is it's like if if someone was drowning there and you've got a life preserver you're not going to think I can't throw that life preserver to them because I'm not qualified you're going to grab it and throw are you okay is at that level I've had a business owner that was quite devastated in the early stages of covert because I rang them to say are you okay and they said tracy I can see the business I so we talked about that and so my part of are you okay was just acknowledging their feelings giving them an ear so they could talk that through and then saying to them I'll follow up with you in a couple of days so a couple of days later I rang up to say how you doing you know are you okay and because they'd had their ear the two days before they were actually starting to come up with a whole new program that their business could develop this part of their business is really growing it's really being beneficial being able to get support even if you're in a remote location it's actually easier now than it was pre-covert good mental health to me is actually connecting back to the things you're getting right and if you need a bit of extra help reach out are you okay
 my name is cara walker and I am fairy cara I am the director of eco fairies and I regularly work for the city of canning as an eco fairy at the events you would have seen me at midweek eats and at muddy hands festival when covert 19 hit all of my work was cancelled up until the end of the year we had a lot of work lined up immediately and suddenly everything came through very suddenly for us so I realised that the change was going to definitely affect my children I am a single mum I support my family on my own through my business and I'm also the carer for my fam for my father at first I was stressed I was worried that I wouldn't be able to provide for my family and then I started thinking of strategies and how I was going to deal with it once I knew that we were going to be okay financially then I could just focus on what we were going to do with our days and taking care of our health for for them and that was harder I think to see that happen for them they didn't really understand the concept that it wasn't going to be forever it became a new norm for them and so finding places for them to go and to be busy without interacting with other children was definitely hard for coping 19 the good experience for me was that I worked out that I need to prioritize a lot more time with my family I thought that I spent a lot of time with them being a homeschool mum and really focused on health but when suddenly work was taken away and I had all of that time with them it became a really wonderful new norm for us and now we're bringing in work again I'm finding I really want to make sure I prioritize my family and that time I spend with them because I see the benefits for them and for me as well for anyone else who's going through the same experience as us I think that we need to find community even if it's people good mental health to me is all about taking care of your mind your heart and your body so having plenty of water great food getting out into the sunshine being engaged with nature and my relationships around me are really positive as well
 my name is rafik allen I'm the president of the saint norbert's ex students association football club snezza based in queens park hi my name is david frawley and I live in east connington and a player and life member of st northwest students association the last seven months I've lost my partner which was quite tough and mentally draining and exhausting and at some direction I really didn't have any outlets apart from my close friends and family and especially my football club I've been president for the last five years and we've had a lot of loss a lot of heartache both on the field and off and we were able to get each other through it I got to pick myself up mentally and had the support from as I said the football club and my friends and family and the community to really keep moving forward and look for a brighter picture and brighter day ahead all we try and do is get around them um be able to take them out for a coffee or or a lunch we're here for you the most important thing is to reach out if you don't if you keep it bottled up inside and you keep it to yourself that's that's where it gets dangerous so if my advice to anyone that is struggling please vent out and reach out because there's always going to be someone there for you mental health for me is just as important as physical health if not more if your mind's not right it means that you're you can't make you can't_''_91.2 get your body right if you didn't have good mental health you would be hard to to get out of bed in the morning and and exercise and and do your day-to-day routine where you need to live to be honest so good mental health to me means it's the key it's vital that not just you but anyone around you supports mental health of not just themselves but others a great thing for anyone that is still struggling by themselves I don't think they can reach out please come's going to be people there it's a great community thing to do and it's great for mental health in terms of support and a support network we're always going to be there for each other and we've got a really strong core group that that will see us through for the next 10 15 years my my mates down there at the football club they're more than mates to me they're pretty much my family they are brotherhood to me and everyone that's involved in the football club is great the wife the families everyone foreign

Hello everyone I'm mayor Patrick Hall following the Premier's recent announcements regarding covert 19 I just like to provide a quick update on the city of kennings response and our staged approach to reopening some of our facilities and services Kennington library will be the first to reopen and our library staff are currently working hard behind the scenes to enable us to reopen on Monday May the 18th that's great news now allowing just 20 people into the facility at any one time will be a challenge and so we're going to see how that works before we make any further decisions in that regard the city's click and Collect service which has proved to be really popular will now be expanded so you'll be able to request items and collect those items from some of our other libraries as well indoor and outdoor community facilities will be available for bookings on Monday 18th of May provided that they can be utilized in accordance with phase 2 restrictions staff for planning for the reopening of other city facilities including the city's administration provided to you all in the coming weeks there are a number of practical considerations including new protocols and processes that we need to work through before we can reopen certain facilities we also want to ensure that when we do so we are meeting the needs and expectations of our community whilst complying with covert 19 safety plans that's still vitally important our leisure plexes at Riverton and Kennington will therefore not reopen on Monday now I know that a lot of you are very keen to get back into pre covered fitness routines but we're taking time to consider the impact of reopening our leisure facilities with the safety of staff and the community front of mind normally we have more than 3000 people come through our leisure centers each day so the existing 20 person restriction the need for physical distancing and the rules around not sharing equipment mean it's not currently practical for kennings large leisure centers to reopen though we do expect the situation had changed markedly in the coming weeks as the government further as restrictions our leisure team is working phase three and so I encourage our members to keep checking in on us on social media or by visiting our website to find out more information in the meantime I encourage you to download the get active canning app there are some great at home workouts available and that app is free to download for iPhone and Android users I also wanted to mention that while back golf course reopened a few weeks ago with restrictions in place and whilst it has been very popular it's really pleasing to me to see that people have been using it and club hide with all restrictions and have maintained a physical distancing so I think our golfing community for that it's really great to see restrictions starting to lift for some of our local businesses as well we're keen to work with local cafes and restaurants to identify how they can use our fresco areas to increase their patronage within the phase 2 guidelines and so we encourage those small businesses to talk to us we're here to help the city also has resilience grants available to operations you can check out our website for details on how exactly to apply I know we're all waiting for that day to occur when things can get back to normal but to get there faster we need to maintain our community norms physical distancing good hygiene practices and downloading the government's covert safe app when that day comes and I'm certain it's not too far away we look forward to welcoming you all back to our facilities and just seeing more of you out and about in our beautiful city accounting thank you everyone

Hi everyone I'm mayor Patrick Hall with another update an important one on the city's response to code vid 19 last night your council held a special council meeting and I'm really proud to say that we endorsed a covert 19 relief package worth over 16 million dollars that's an important and vital investment in our local community and one that's incredibly timely it works in harmony with state and federal initiatives aimed to support our residents community and sporting groups businesses and also to stimulate the kenning economy as a whole in total last night 15 different measures were approved by your council some of these take effect immediately and those include rent abatements and a new financial hardship policy other measures will take effect in the coming 2022 2021 financial year some of the highlights of the package announced last night include a financial hardship policy for ratepayers suffering hardship to enable them to pause payments and to set up alternative payment arrangements with the city I'm also pleased to advise that there will be no increase in rate revenue collected by amount of rates next year as we collected this year I'm certain that's in keeping with the expectations of our community there'll be no increase in the waste service fee the transfer station fees or security charge we will defer the first quarterly rates installment due date to November 2024 that we will defer any new underground power charges for 12 months there will be rental abatements for all the tenants of city-owned premises on application and key capital works projects brought forward to stimulate the local economy create jobs and they will keep people in work and how important is that for us right now we're investing more in our newly launched connecting kenning project to help connect vulnerable people to support and services further to all of that we're also waiving inspection fees for our food businesses there's a commitment by the city to pay small and medium business suppliers within 14 days to assist their cash flow that's incredibly important and council also improved using unspent grant funds from this financial year to establish a new caning resilience grant they businesses right across the city accounting so a wide range of people are now eligible to apply for these grants and I urge you to do so as the full impact of this pandemic becomes more clearly understood further measures will need to be considered by council over the coming months as part of the city's long-term recovery plan rest assure that this council and the city of canning have the best interest of the community in mind we will continue to keep you informed and we'll also continue to respond quickly to any necessary changes stay safe everyone look after each other thank you so much for listening goodbye
Hi everyone I'm mayor Patrick Hall from the city of canning with a very quick update on cave food 19 on behalf of the city of canning and our council I wanted to acknowledge how well we're all doing social distancing has been a wonderful thank you but I'm asking you not to be complacent I know we're going well I know there's not too many more cases being reported but restrictions are still in place but in some good news starting from next week Riverton library will be introducing a Click Collect system for all of those who have been missing our hardcopy library collections from next Monday you can order a reserve items through our online library catalog and they can be picked up on Wednesdays or Fridays from riveted library and you can learn more about that on our Facebook page canning libraries while back Golf Course will partially reopen today that's some really good news for golfers with some important physical distancing rules in place though all players need to book online or over the phone before coming in no can't share a golf cart and you must a 1.5 metres apart understandably there is still some confusion across the community about what services are open and what may be closed so I urge you all to go to the city of kennings website and look for our frequently asked questions section all of those frequently asked questions are there and the answers it's a wonderful resource one question we have often received is about our waste services I can assure you all that out out my services including our verge collections and our waste transfer station nothing has changed it remains completely unchanged the city's a waste transfer station is open every day of the week from 8 a.m. to 30 p.m. but please pay by credit card public events and gatherings are still not allowed please don't congregate in groups at our war memorials on Anzac Day as much as we'll would like to we simply cannot instead celebrate on your driveways balconies or on your own front yards at 00 a.m. as part of a national tour which will be broadcast on be broadcast on 6 PR and the Riverton RSL itself will be live-streaming their servers on their Facebook page so go to the Riverland higher-self Facebook page and look for that livestream members of the canning city brass band this is really good news the canning City brass band will be playing the last post live from their own driveways individually so I'm sure that'll be a really moving experience for those residents lucky enough to live in close proximity to a member of the the canning City brass band well don't everyone concerned it's going to be a really different Anzac Day isn't it in 2020 it'll be memorable but let's try to make it memorable for all the right reasons I'm really looking forward to it I'm looking forward to sharing that experience with my neighbors and with you all and I'll be at the end of my own driveway at 6 a.m. on Saturday morning stay safe look after each other and look forward to speaking to you all again soon thank you
Hi everyone Vanessa here again to help you reduce your food waste at home we always talk about the importance of saving water but we never talk about the importance of saving food over ten billion dollars worth of food is wasted in Australians household every year that's contributor about one in every five bags you can avoid bulk buzz carrots for about two dollars or only a smaller portion about fifty cents so you're saving money if you're only buying what you need and the benefits are it doesn't come in plastic it's amazing what you can regrow at home just with water take this carrot carrot tops can grow in water along with lettuce popjoy I have spring onion in here and herbs are some fruit and veg that I found at home looks like it's going off but it's still perfectly good to eat and don't be such a shame to put it into landfill what I'm gonna do is make some zucchini noodles with that by looking at a recipe online and this one I think I before you go shopping just take a look at what's in your cupboard maybe sort through what you have and what you actually need to get so you don't double up you can use an app to create a list or a notebook or even sometimes just take a photo if you are able start your composting journey the city of canning has subsidized Bokashi bins available to purchase at the waste transfer station see the link below last but not least don't shop hungry you're gonna impulse buy it's probably not good for your health or your budget
What we're trying to do is celebrate the linkage between the city center and the canning River and open up more open space and green space aim is to reawaken the waterways that once flowed through here including the protected wetlands in the area and also through the development of the Lake Street urban stream significantly also the wall street storm water basin has been transformed into a new piece of public open space and that's going to also be incorporating a lot of smart elements as well for more information about the canning city center regeneration program go to canning w.a gov dot a u CC

Good evening everyone thank you for the invite tonight there are a hundred and thirty nine local governments in Western Australia and some of them most of them ask the Electoral Commission to run the election on their behalf if we don't run it then the CEO is typically the returning officer so all of the 30 local governments in the Perth metropolitan area and another 60 throughout the state we're running their election and the council here has voted by absolute majority to ask the Electoral Commission to run the election for them they've also voted by absolute majority for it to be run as a postal ballot so that's the context in which I'm going to talk to you this evening okay to be eligible to run as a candidate you must be on an electoral roll you must be 18 you cannot be the nominee of a body corporate you can nominate as a part of a body corporate on the owners and occupiers role Maine managed by the Council to vote but you can't run as a candidate now Luke doesn't matter whether you've been a councillor for 20 years or this is your first time you need to have done that because when you do your nomination form you will tick the box and sign a legal declaration to say that you have done it and my understanding is that the department will be maintaining a list of people who have completed it so that's the biggest change that has happened at these elections I've got quite a few slides so I'm going to race through them fairly quickly there are some disqualifications you can't_''_124.539 be a member of another council and then run or might over go at caning I'm on Gosnell's and if I get caning I'll resign from there no you can't_''_133.299 do that the only you can only run in one election but in within this council you can run in the mayoral election and as a councillor so you can you can nominate to be a mayoral candidate and you can nominate to be a councillor candidate but you can't run in any all of those but the Act prescribes them and I've got some candidates PACs that if you wish to get one from me after this session these are contained on these USBs and all of the details about the eligibility and disqualifications have contained therein as just said including guides for candidates formality guides on ballot papers and things like that and all of the forms that you may need are all contained on these USBs to be an effective nomination you have to have completed and signed your nomination form provided a candidate profile and I'll come back to that in a moment you make the deposit of 80 cash with the returning officer and that needs to be made with returning officer before the close of nominations now the if you are running in an election run by the Commission we have what a product called we call nomination builder you can go onto our website register and go through the form electronically you could fill it all in you can come back to it whenever you like and think about your profile you might do few people get some feedback go back to it and so on the important thing is you can't actually nominate online once you've filled in your nomination form you make an appointment with the returning officer at a mutually convenient time and hand it over it's signed and witnessed and so on when you do go on to the system it'll give you a number make sure you write that number down because if you don't and you forget it you have to start again the whole process so it's important that you take that registration number because that will enable you to log in at other times and the returning officer will also be able to log in once you nominate that's what it looks like you go on to our website there's a link on the homepage of the electoral commission website nominated as a candidate it'll take you here and then you go through the process there's also a little video there which you can watch and that helps you give some guidelines as to how you of nominating because it's what the punters out there will look at in determining who they're going to vote for they may not know you from a bar of soap but they'll be voting and the candidate photograph and the profile is a really critical document don't do what some people do and invent hyphenated words because it ends up with a hundred and sixty-eight words or whatever because if if there's no time for the returning offer he'll or she'll just drop off the last 18 words to get into the hundred and fifty so if you can't say what if people should vote for you within 150 words you probably shouldn't be running all right so think about what the punters out there interested in in looking at what they're a counselor for their ward or their mayoral maybe so think about that pretty carefully you can get a photo you can crop it and so on it's it's a really easy to use system if you nominate you'll be given a role which is electors in the district or ward for which you are contesting and the other is manipulative file of habitations in that district award so if you're going to be doing a bit of door knocking and you want to work out your your routes and how you're going to do it you can play with that particular file so that's the habitation list and then there's the Alpha elector listen it's a postal election it means that every elector on the roll will be posted ballot papers containing the ballot paper plus your profile and some other information they have to fill in and then an envelope for them to return it so it comes back to our central processing center we start lodging with Australia Post on the Friday before that we start with halls creek and esperance and places in far-flung parts of Western Australia till we do all our country lodgements first metropolitan councils will start being lodged from Wednesday the 25th your council decided to go with Priority Mail which means that if we Lodge it on the Wednesday it should male if it gets lodged on Friday then it won't get delivered till Monday okay your returning officer will be advised what day the city of canning ballot papers will be lodged with Australia Post once we have lodged them with Australia Post we have lost control but it'll be delivered in in accordance with Australia Post but your counsel has opted to go for Priority Mail when people receive their mail those who are gonna vote tend to vote quite quickly after receiving it most people who are going to vote vote within five business days of receiving their package so the active campaigning period in a postal election is no point in campaigning too much in in a few days before Election Day yes you might get a few people you can remind them but the real a lot of people who are going to vote have will have already voted now one of the true things in local government elections it's voluntary unlike state and federal elections where people have to vote so it's voluntary statewide average at the last local government elections some mount Marshall had eighty five point five percent and joondalup I think had 25 percent I can't tell you off hand what the caning turnout was but you can see why the minister and the department are very keen to look at ways to improve participation in local government elections but from your perspective as a prospective candidate it's important that you realize the mechanics of a postal election so once it's delivered the people who are going to vote tend to vote quite early they can also drop their package here so advice to people if you're saying of you have you voted and they say I know I didn't get last too late now that's not it's Thursday before it's not going to get there they can drop it in at the council at the ballot box that will be on the doing reception here or in reception here but you as a cancer as a candidate cannot cannot handle a postal package for any other candidate don't say oh look I'll collect all your packages and the law 5,000 penalty or a year in prison so it's a serious penalty so you can't interfere with the process penalties apply it's a postal election so everyone's going to get sent a ballot paper and it will have their their name it'll have a barcode and when that comes back to us we'll scan the barcode to mark them off the roll if they say oh the dogs eaten my package or I've lost it I'm not sure where it is they can come here to the council office and seek a replacement it takes a little while because we have to cancel the other package to make sure they can't vote twice so there it does take a little while but people can seek a replacement if they don't believe they've received it what sometimes happens it comes in the mail and someone in the family Chuck's it out with the catalogs and the other mail and then they say I never received it but they can come and seek a replacement on Election Day here a replacement they can come in here and drop it in the mail in the ballot box if they haven't had mailed it after six o'clock the returning officer will count all of the ballot papers on that night and they'll declare the result on that night it's not like in a state and federal election where postal votes can be accepted til the first day after election day and the real count happens about a week after election night and on election night it's all indicative counts on a you know local government election it's the real deal sooner 6 o'clock on Saturday the 19th there will be a count and there will be a determination and there'll be a declaration of the outcome the results for all local governments that we're running not all 90 of them will be posted on our website on that night if the I said before there's an 80 deposit if you're elected you get your 80 back or if you get 5 percent of the total number of votes you something a flyer and you're going to stick it in letter boxes whether you're doing it personally or using a mailing house to do it it must be properly authorized so the purpose of that in the act is so that people who are interested in voting can contact you and they know that it's been authorized by it could be the candidate you might have your a campaign manager you might have your wife or your husband to authorize it as long as it's authorized by someone and it's that someone has a physical address can't_''_797.22 be a p.o box number it's got to be a physical address so if I'm producing a flyer why people should vote for me it's got to say authorized by Chris having 16 one back present printed by acne printers Fitzroy Street so in other words if it's it's a bit of a quirk in the actus it is an old act as a source they said or Luke said it 1995 if it's been printed commercially you've got to name and address of the printer if it's if you're putting an ad in the newspaper you don't need the printers because that's obvious it's the newspaper all right but you still need to have it authorised I won't go through the various offenses bribery undue influence and so on canvassing in or near a polling place you are allowed a solicit and canvass for votes but you're not allowed to do that in a polling place or within six meters of the entrance but you can you know encourage people to vote for you that's what it's all about on the night you as a candidate can't_''_875.05 be on the count floor but you can appoint a scrutineer to observe the count on your behalf if you receive gifts again I'm not going to go into lots of detail on this it's in on the USB but Arthur as the CEO maintains the gift register and if you receive any gift to the value of 200 or more then both you as the recipient and the donor or if the same person is giving you multiple things and the total value of those multiple things exceeds 200 then it's got to go onto the gift register and that doesn't have to be just cash it might be you're having a big fundraiser and a promotional thing so the local Baker is donating all the buns to you or you might have a friend who's a printer and says I'll print up three or four Nicks that's that's still a gift and the value of that if it exceeds 200 needs to be registered now sitting over here if I could ask you to stand please in it's the most important person that you're going to be dealing with in stringer is the returning officer for the city of canning election thinks they answer a long-standing electoral official at various levels of government he's now spends most of his time Stroup Singh around the world on cruises and so on as a retired from full-time employment he last gig in local government was as a returning officer for and if you've got any questions about the process that's on in will be your first port of call that phone number and so on don't ring it tonight or and so on he won't get his phone until the weekend so from next week onwards he should contact any questions yes no that's okay and if it's a birthday present or something like that yeah I might even ask the gentleman at the back there who's more more expert in that area than myself yeah my understanding is that it's not a gift if it's from a family member from your spouse or your son or your mother or whatever any other questions yes yeah what you do if you're printing it yourself all you need to do is authorised and printed by okay it's good question so you don't need a separate line of authorization yes in the hundred and fifty words you'd have to provide at least one point of contact and that's not included in 150 words so you go be 150 your email account and your address or whatever so that's not included in 150 words eh you can do that yeah not a problem but it'll be interesting to see whether that's counts as one word or multiple words so there is a word counter built into the system and it'll tell you that it doesn't count things like full stops and commas they're not counted normal grammatical things are not counted it's part of it any other questions yes it seemed like it you're quite right there is no nothing in the regulations or in the statutes to specify the point size as long as it is included and you've probably seen at state and federal elections where you've got big posters and tiny little print and so on I think my personal view is see if you're authorizing something you want people to be able to see who's who it is and and who had a contact it's part of the election process but there is nothing specifying the size that it must be it out flies and things like that anytime you like yeah yeah look the again the actors a bit gray in this area I would say if you're having stuff printed best practice is always authorize it correctly and that way once the election period commences with the debt with the advertisement next Wednesday calling for nominations and so on you're okay anyway you don't suddenly get a message saying look stop distributing those they're not properly authorized question yes no now I've got a very quickly described the way it's processed when you vote you put your ballot papers at a ballot paper envelope with an elector certificate a perforated election certificate a testament you have to sign it if it's not signed it'll be rejected under the Act when we process it they come in the first thing we do is scan it we take the ballot paper envelope out of the reply paid envelope we scan it to mark the person off the roll then that slip is torn off that and the ballot paper envelopes and the elector certificate vote those ballot paper envelopes are then opened the ballot papers are removed facedown and put into bundles of fifty and put in a sealed ballot box and then that ballot box is delivered to e and the returning officer on Saturday afternoon on the 19th yes yeah and and if if if someone let's say someone did vote and send it in and then came in to N on on the Saturday and said look I don't think I voted can I have a replacement he will be our Australia way say no you have voted you've been marked off as having voted I can't issue you were the replacement but if he's not marked off then he can issue them with the replacement it's neither at the end of the day the High Court has made it a rule in this on several occasions and the ruling is in a political contest what a person says is only misleading if it at the point of marking the ballot paper the elector is misled so if you put out a thing saying you let's say in a ward where there are two vacancies and you said you're only allowed to put one tick on your ballot paper that's a misleading because it would mislead the elector at the point at which they mark their ballot paper but if if Mary Smith says Jo is a thief and a liar and should not be trusted it's not the returning officers role to deal with that it's up to them to use civil court action to take and defamation laws to deal with that it is not something that the returning officer has power under the Local Government Act to deal with okay but you need to be careful I mean the reason for the candidate induction training being introduced is partly because of some very poor behavior by some candidates at the last elections in social media and if you are establishing a website or you are establishing a Facebook site to do you okay that too has to be authorized not just printed material I think I'm taking more than my fair share of time any other it's authorized on that landing page it's not you can't authorize a Twitter comment or something like that you use your hundred and forty characters with authorizations but on if you're establishing a website or a Facebook site then it does need to be also people need to know who has established that so yeah yeah
Okay here we have example oh boy oh boy there's logs in this one has been cut perfect size for us to pick up the actual the road while there's a lamppost pull our own ups away from there so we won't have any trouble with the loader to come in and pick it up the people have made a real effort to present this part in the right way which actually helps us move through the street a lot quicker and get stuff off the ground we go

As you can imagine many of us are ordering a lot more takeaway at the current time I myself went out last night and supported local businesses and got takeaway and as you can see for two people these are the containers that we're left with what I want to show you is how I can upcycle these containers and use them for something different these are perfect storage containers something that you can use for your cords to stop them from tangling up because they naturally want to wrap up they're also great fun for crafty projects like this Easter Bunny can hide this out in the garden for the kids and hide your Easter eggs inside like a secret
Finally got it that's gotta go it's not ready it's still got a lid on doing well this whole time you think bagging me about my recycling skills I know you've gotta rinse things and take the lids off and it's better to do that in the kitchen before you bring them to the recycling bin I was bagging them but they've actually got to be loose and tip prep so they can sort them correctly well it's taken a while but you finally got this recycling thing in the bag
 our smart pot will use technology to help us manage our resources such as electricity and water we'll be collecting data from the park and we'll use that data to help us make sensible decisions that will benefit the residents of the city of Kennedy Park we're gonna have a pavilion with solar panels those solar panels will help offset the energy consumption in the park we're also going to have some smart bins we ought to be able to tell us when they're fall and some of our irrigation will be controlled smartly as well so we'll help manage water consumption across the back

As you can imagine many of us are ordering a lot more tako at the current time I myself went out last night and supported local businesses and got take away and as you can see for two people these are the containers that we're left with what I want to show you is how it can upcycle these containers and use them for something different now I'm sure everyone's received one of these components but what's great about them is they good for storage for games puzzles and even stationery and they're stackable so they can go into drawers look at these small storage containers you can put a lot in these like screws nuts bolts but what I like to use them for is paint now it's a really good at keeping your paint from drying out and I've had this in here for a few days so I think that's one of my top tips for that one these are perfect storage containers something that you can use for your cords to stop them from tangling up because they crafty projects like this Easter Bunny can hide this out in the garden for the kids and hide your Easter eggs inside like a secret compartment so wooden chopsticks can't go in recycling but they can't go in composting if you have it at home I kind of like to use these as planter stakes so when you're growing new seedlings you can put them in your pot and help your plant grow so if you're struggling to reuse your plastic bags go to make sure that they don't go in your recycling bin however these can be recycled through the read cycle program at Coles and Woolies so when you get a chance stockpile a whole bunch of these plastic bags and take them down when you get a chance so if you are recycling make sure you know what actually goes into your recycling bin so fast six do not go into recycling means nor does wooden chopsticks however what hand go into your recycling I mean are these hard plastics but what you need to make sure is that they're cleaned food scraps and what I tend to use is old dishwater just to give them a rinse out and then put them loosely in my recycle bin
 the canning River is a life source that has flowed for generations it's a beautiful waterway providing crucial habitat for local wildlife as it winds its way through canning the river has been a culturally significant place for generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of the area and it continues to connect all who live here today the proximity of the local natural environment coupled with a thriving business district and growing population presents a unique opportunity for the city of Cannings 10-year city center regeneration program civic ami is a mix of light industrial large format businesses old homes and new homes we're a vibrant and diverse over 50% of our population is born overseas and our community is is connected to our natural environment and actively involved in recreation it's a strong and proud community so it really is interested in what's happening seventy-six million dollars will be invested that's seventy six million dollars of council's commitment this is a courageous commitment by this council to realize the city center vision the investment will deliver new homes new be a city center development that will exploit a smart city technology as well as improved public spaces so these will be spaces that will welcome people that will engage me the canning city center is just 12 kilometers from the Perth CBD and it will be transformed into a smart precinct through the regeneration program the high-speed communications network will be installed across the city center through its own optic fiber it will run through the council administration building up Wharf Street to the canning Tinley sure Plex and connect what will be the next generation community park at the Wolf Street Basin site and through to Cecil Avenue the bustling center of the city this will result in improved implementation and efficiency of council services as well as high-speed public Wi-Fi and will ready the area for future digital technologies our goal is to be a welcoming and thriving city so for us smart cities about using digital technologies to deliver economic social and environmental benefits of our ratepayers and residents the regeneration project will future-proof the area in more ways than just smart tech in communications on improve the public realm while also laying the groundwork for future public transport options such as trackless trams and the installation of electric vehicle charging stations other major opportunities include the undergrounding of Alberti highway and raising the rail line at Queen's Park to canning stations one thing that's missing in the whole of the project area is people Cecil Avenue has just been a connecting road within the city center we've reimagined Cecil Avenue as a pedestrian friendly public transport oriented infrastructure that connects the canning station to the canning River that allows for large trees to be planted wide foot paths and alfresco dining in areas that have not had it before one of the key factors with the city center is that up to 20 percent of the land is vacant or underused that gives us massive potential to do some really important urban regeneration projects we're working with developers to interest them in developing unique forms of housing for canning we want to see state government coming and develop in their large assets opposite pennington train station into something that allows really unique project for the city what we're trying to do is celebrate linkage between the city center and the canning River and open up more open space and green space aim is to reawaken the waterways that once flowed through here including the protected wetlands in the area and also through the development of the Lake Street urban stream significantly also the wall street storm water basin has being transformed into a new piece of public open space and that's going to also be incorporating a lot of smart elements as well the city center program will be implemented in stages once completed that will create 10,000 new toilets 25,000 new residents and over 5,000 new jobs will be created so it'll create a hub and a strong beating heart center of the city we aim to be and will be perfect southern CBD for more information about the canon city centre regeneration programme go to canning W a gov dot a u

Good evening ladies and gentlemen I'd like to thank City canning for obviously inviting the department down to talk tonight this originally presentation wasn't going to be given by me so I've been madly up the back highlighting things so hopefully I won't mess it up too much so if my delivery isn't quite as good as it could be that's my throwaway line to excuse my lack of presentation abilities okay so about the department local government sport and cultural industries okay there are a number of roles and responsibilities that we perform we provide advice and support to local governments the way that we do that is there is an advice and support hotline there's also attached the email address where people can email or call inquiries into to ask particular questions that is councillors staff and members of the public as well now we don't give we can't give direct advice we cannot give legal advice or any clap but we can give advice on processes that remember the community councillors all staff can do to to get distinction is also we also unable to direct get directly involved with that local government about a particular issue that that is not the role of Department I suppose that's what I'm trying to get out with that the other things that we do is we basically in the local government there's a number of powers that are vested in the minister some of those powers are delegated to the department and the Director General to deal with those issues so things that I'm thinking about the relevant to councillors in particular conflict of interest waivers so the Act has certain conflicts of interest provisions if you have one and you need ministerial approval the department is the one that staffs and and and deals with those sort of issues on behalf of the minister we also provide an advisory role with respect to local laws so all the local laws that are passed within this state within the state of Western Australia do get referred to the minister and the department provide comments and deeds sometimes very detailed comments back to local governments about the history and experience with the Joint Standing Committee on sent and delegated legislation another big role that we do is we obviously on behalf the Midd we assist the minister in his role in overseeing local governments in the state the way that this is done is that we receive numbers a number of reports and things like budgets and your report audit reports through the officer ordered ordered general nowadays where we look at that and we provide advice to the minister and also to the local government to ensure that they are complying with with with the law it's as simple as that we also have a investigation to a regulatory function so we have a number of investigators investigate complaints to authorized inquiries and things of that nature probity audits as well integrity audits can come up where they basically look at the operations of a local government to see if again if they're buying the law and I suppose the most recent examples of authorizing choirs at least that most definitely public of the city milk there was a report recent release in the injury as well so that's another function that we provide what I my personal role in the apartment is on part of the legislation team so I do at the moment I'm part of the Local Government Act review so what I basically do is go around talk to people find out what kind of things we need to change the act and provide advice to the minister about how we amend or what he should amend or consider amendment to Local Government Act and associated regulations the other another part of we do is there's also three boards that are boards and communities are attached to that extent by the local government primarily being local government Weiser board that does Ward and district boundaries you've also got the local government Grants Commission as well as the local standards panel which oversees the conduct of local government councillors and it is only councillors okay other things that we do do to provide advice is we also release operational guidelines put out departmental circulars and things like that to advise local governments of issues that have a department views certain things and another part while it's not done by us we also work in conjunction with the officer ordered a general nowadays because they're responsible or becoming responsible over the next three years for our audits of all local governments in the state so we work with the Department of order office at the Auditor General as well see if we get the right button well not luckily I don't have any slides say okay the Local Government Act review as I said a little bit earlier that that's pretty much the function that I currently serve in the department so in 2017 the McGowan government instructed us to conduct a review it's the first significant review since 1995 when the act was basically enacted in the first in the first instance obviously as I'm sure everyone can appreciate a lots changed since 1995 particularly with technology so our view is basically to make a modern act that empowers local governments to to better deliver lis deliver for their communities now we've done that we made a decision a couple first phase phase one of the review the bill attached to phase one has already passed Parliament and passed Lake June as part of that bill the reforms that we have in there is candidate induction Universal training for councilmembers councilmember code of conduct improvements to the CEO recruitment and performance review simplify simplifying the gifts framework changes to the standards panel and also increasing transparency now the way that the main way of transparency is basically bringing information out of necessarily just the newspaper to more contemporary means through publication and websites and things like that as well now in saying that I'm not going to go in detail about those particular problems because most of them are particularly relevant to candidates at this point in time however some of them have come in for example Canada introduction candidate induction training and also Universal training after you're elected is probably the two main ones the gift framework when you first get elected if you are if you're successful will will not come in until a few months after is what my guess is good way because that actually commences there we go okay relevant reforms to candidates the most important one to take home tonight is that there is online induction at that website if you forget what the department's website is yesterday I've got into old Google and put local government County induction and there was a link that came up so hopefully we'll work on your Google as well and then basically the main thing to take home from this is that you need to do if you're going to nominate for counsel or to be counselor you need to do that online induction okay as part of the nomination in forms eight and nine and you can tell I'm a legislation nerd because I can quote the form numbers is part of those forms there is a requirement to make a declaration to say you've done that induction if you make a false declaration it's an offense it's as simple as that now that induction is not hard it's not owners and it's not intended to be a test or anything like that you no longer than twenty twenty minutes probably forty at the very end we do ask you to do some tasks and basically the time that it takes is up to you in the sense that we tell you to do things like look at the agenda for your local government so get on the city Cannings website have a look at the agenda go to a council meeting if you haven't been to one before just to get that kind of idea of what you're actually getting yourself into so in reality if you just want to click Next and not learn from it I can't stop that but what we're hoping is that you'll look at those things that we suggest and you know what I haven't been on account so maybe I should go down to at least one before I nominate just to get that feel of what's going on and I would assume by the fact that you you went to the effort of coming in tonight they're more likely than not if that if you are that's pretty much what we want and that's what we're kind of that's the kind of thing that we're after as part of that that requirement Universal training for council members if you are successful you are you will be required to do five modules I won't go into each five module tonight but ultimate ultimate Lee there is an FAQ page on the department's website that will outline the modules you have to do and the main thing to remember with that is you've got 12 months to do it after you if I feel so sexually successfully elected and there is also no problem with starting the course if you're that confident before you're elected as well it isn't quite available yet but it will be in a couple of weeks it should be available to do the gist framework as I said won't be introduced if you are first elected although it will be hopefully by the end of the year and there is also the new code of conduct and best practice standards for at the same time as a gift framework but will come in is being released for public comment shortly in a few weeks and then after we get we finished that consultation through that we will then obviously create that as regulations and then that will come in as well okay the hands up research project so this is basically a research project um it's a collaboration between the Department University of Western Australia and the Western and local government Association and I'm sure Tony from-from Vogel will probably mention it in his presentation as well so what we're after basically is little known about the demographics and wipe it will run for the local government as a council and we want to know and we want to know so then we can try to do pilot like to introduce policy and other things so that we can encourage a broader ribbiting a representative sample of people that want to run for Council that's pretty much what we're trying to achieve by that project I'm not exactly sure what it says on that slide remember too is it also what we do is we want to encourage candidates to get in contact and there are Flyers up the back about this particular project take one of them get in contact with the researcher that's dr. Jackie Hutchinson and we will also want to find out even if you're not successful why you wanted to why you wanted to run for council so we get that better a better idea so then we can develop programs to sue and I do encourage you to to do that as well okay are there any questions please don't bombard me any questions no seriously I'm probably way too move because I'm on camera so stand Ian Wow happy with that thank you very much for your time and please I can't stress enough please do the can induction even if you don't intend to run do the candy induction because it is useful information just to understand local government a little bit more and that information we don't tell the world at large bases Department has those records and people are naughty so it so basically what will happen is you'll get it once you finish the induction you'll get an email so at the end of the induction you're putting your name date of birth district gonna run in residential address I think for memory and you'll get an email saying yes congratulations you've passed basically and then when you come to the nomination you just tick a box as part of the decoration also says I think the memory you're over 18 and you haven't been charged and dies in diable offense in the last five years how I remember that any other questions please don't tell my boss I'm funny she'll yell at me

Welcome everyone and it's great that you're considering to serve your community as an elected member as Arthur said earlier it's a really worthwhile commitment so that's great tonight in my presentation we're going to discuss what you can expect if you are successful in your candidacy for election to the local government so I'm really going to go into the role of an elected member we're just going to quickly go through a few things roles and responsibilities meetings of council declarations of interest impacts on your home life frequently asked questions and a little bit on training and induction before I get underway just a local government is really important so this is a quick snapshot of what the state looks like there's 139 local governments with 1200 and 22 elected members you know representing the state of W a 22,000 people work in local government it spends 4.2 billion dollars per year and most importantly as assets of forty eight billion dollars of year so really important sector just a little bit of background on where local government sits federal eight state and territories and there's 537 separate local governments and because local governments make decisions that are closest to your community it's considered the grassroots form of government providing for a system of local government is a sorry I'll just go back is a residual power of the states and for this reason there is no mention of local government and the Australian Constitution the power to make legislation relating to local government is found in the West Australian Constitution Act so section 52 of the Act requires the state to provide legislate for for local government and provide it with relevant powers so therefore it said that local government it's a creature of the state looking at legislation in in W a the Local Government Act 1995 is the legislation created by state parliament to provide for the system of local government and local governments are created as body corporates with perpetual succession and a common seal and they're run by elected councils the act is created sorry I'll just go back one the act is created under general competence powers decisions it believes is required to provide good government for the people of its district as long as it doesn't conflict with other legislation or common law local government provides a diverse range of services generally falling under the general headings of people property and regulatory services and as a consequence of state legislation amounting to approximately 18 Acts of Parliament and hundreds of associated regulations local governments must perform certain functions and provide particular services sure if you can read on the screen there town planning building waste collection local roads those things listed there a local government has to provide however there's lots more that a local government can provide and under using the general competence power principle so you know sport and recreation facilities home in Community Care public libraries the list will go on for as much as as a council thinks their community needs now just going to quickly look at the roles of Russell and responsibilities so we'll look at the separate roles of a councillor the mayor the mayor and the council and also the chief executive officer and then Act states that the role of the council is to govern the local government's affairs and that is responsible for the moments of local governments functions and furthermore its to oversee the allocation of the local government's finances and resources as well as determining its policies so the Hat the council has the responsibility to ensure the appropriate structure for administering the local government but importantly it is the council who is the employer of the CEO however the council has no further role with regard to other employees of the local government so we'll just look at the role of councillors here so the the Local Government Act clearly prescribes the role of a councillor it's to represent the interests of the community provide leadership and guidance facilitate communication and make decisions it's noticeable here but the councillors have no individual powers that's the power of the council quickly looking at the role of the mural president so first why is it a mayoral president there is no difference between the role of a mirror or a president the Local Government Act states mirrors the Local Government Act then prescribes the role of the President and as listed on the screen there presides at council meetings provides leadership and guidance carries out civic and ceremonial duties that's it's a spokesperson for the local government and right down the bottom if really important and that the mayor liaises with the CEO on the local governments Affairs and the performance of its functions now we quickly look at the functions of the chief executive officer busy role there's lots on the screen there the functions of the CEO are separate but complementary to the functions of the council so as can be seen there the functions relate to the administrative purpose of the local government CEO is the principal adviser to the council implements the council's decisions manages the day-to-day operations and is the employing authority of all the local government employees I'm sorry go back one and again just wanting to note item II which was the same as the mayor has the CEO liaises with the mir president all good just looking now Arthur did mention the separation this slide on that so that the representative decision-making body of the council performs a separate role to the a political professional administration that provides the impartial advice and guidance this arrangement mirrors the Westminster system at the state and federal level so as as we can see on on your left individual elected members don't have any I don't have any powers the council is the strategic decision maker the plans the needs of the community creating strategic community plans and monitoring its implementation allocating the resources and making decisions that the legally can convened meetings clicking too quickly and on the right hand side you see so I did that in Reverse to deny the the administration is on the other side show where we're carrying out the the administrative functions for the local government and implementing the decisions so although there's a distinct separation of powers separation of functions between the council and the administration great reliance is placed on the ability of each part of the local government to work cooperatively with their functional boundaries to progress the interests of the community board like behavior it's recognized there similarities between a council and a board which can be seen there on the screen with the structure and resources but being board like in your behave we can assist you in developing a trustful respective and constructive relationship with fellow elected members there's certainly some differences between councils and boards that are important to understand councils are democratically elected and do not have shareholders or members instead they have electors ratepayers and residents and as with the board elected members must observe the law principally the roles responsibilities and functions that we're going through tonight this slide here sorry going back nose in fingers out so a knife is a well-known acronym to anyone you know experience working with boards means nose in ask questions be inquisitive fingers out do not interfere in the operational matters or the the CEOs functions it's a useful principle for elected members to remember and abide by there is consequences to an elected member not observing those rules with with our rules of conduct regulations if you are elected to council the first declaration before you can commence your role as like to remember this this is really important by signing this declaration you have committed to represent all the people in the entire district and pledge your loyalty to the future of of your local government of the city of canning it also references the rules of conduct regulations so I'll have a quick look at that for you the declaration requires that you observe the local government rules of conduct regulation so you need to know what's in these regulations the following it looks at standards of general behavior use of information securing unauthorized advantage or disadvantage misuse of resource as we mentioned before prohibition against involvement and administration rules of conduct regulations if you're elected are worth reading because it governs your behavior quickly look at meetings of of council and the rules associated with your meetings and how decisions are made councils you know consists of democratically elected representatives who represent the community provide leadership and guidance and facilitate communication between the community and the council the important work of a council occurs at the formal mayor presides at the council meetings the ordinary meeting see Council convened at least monthly Arthur set out the the meeting scheduled for you a little bit earlier Council will look at issues such as policy and strategy dealing with development applications major projects annual budget and financial management reports and the real range and scope and delivery of services and monitors performance and compliance the Local Government Act sets out some important aspects relating to council meetings for example you must attend meetings and may be disqualified for failing to do so you need to have a quorum so at least half the number of officers of the council need to turn up to a meeting you must vote you can't decide not to vote unless you've got a financial interest and the presiding member if there's a tied vote must use a casting vote and also a council must provide public question time in respect to understanding the rules local governments has Standing Orders local law or meeting procedures the city of canning certainly has that and that follows how the council meeting is carried elected members need to read there's two really important documents that I've gone through tonight the rules of conduct regulations and the Standing Orders that govern how a meeting runs quickly looking at council meeting skills so a number of things contribute to councillors successfully participating in in meetings yet you need to be prepared do all your reading be across the budget and financial management reports joining the debate be an objective decision maker we always say prepare to influence others but more importantly be prepared to be influenced yourself and listen to others opinions I'm not going to do that quickly looking at privilege there's no relevant comparison between the rights of a member of parliament and an elected member of a council therefore great care must be taken when making statements at a council meeting or in relation to the affairs of the local government as a general guide councillors should make every effort to ensure the statements they make a factual accurate made in good faith and not made maliciously so that you can't_''_861.63 be in punished to give rise to or a breach of the rules of conduct regulations a council member can only rely on the defense of qualified privilege was probably discharging his or her duties under the Local Government Act quickly looking at declarations of interest this is things you might have to declare an interest for so there's three types of categories of declaration of interest there's a direct financial interest and there's a subset of that called an indirect financial interest there's proximity interest and there's impartiality interests I'm quickly going to go through these so a person is likely to have a financial interest if a matter is to be dealt with by the local government will result in a financial gain loss benefit or detriment to that person this is the indirect financial interest which is a subset this can be established by showing that you were a person with whom you're closely created has a financial relationship with the person or organization requiring a local government decision and the Local Government Act will provide a definition of a closely associated person then there's proximity matter if the matter concerns a proposed change to a planning scheme affecting land that adjoins the person's land or a proposed change to the zoning or use of land that adjoins that person's land or a proposed development that adjoins the land so any bland adjoining you'll have a proximity interest and then the final interest is the impartiality interest so as on the screen impartiality interest means an interest that could or could reasonably be perceived to adversely affect the impartiality of the person having the interest includes an interest arising out of friendship I'm sorry kinship friendship or membership of an association just having a look at the consequences of those so if you declare a financial and indirect financial or a proximity interest you will not be able to participate in the decision-making process of council in any way if you declare an impartiality interest you will be able to participate in the debate and you can vote on the matter its impartiality interest is declaring that you could have a friendship or something or we could be a member of a we like to show due to the importance of your office as a counselor and the commitment you made to the community it's often stated that elect a member cannot wear two hats where the business of local government is concerned so during your term 24 hours a day seven days a week you're going to be an elected member you can't pick and choose when to take that hat off win so when you speak publicly always remember that you are a councillor I've got a hurry-up Arthur quickly go through impacts on own life on now I'm not wanting to put you all off but there are some things with all all the of work so you'll have fewer evenings at home less time for your normal recreation and hobbies and you might get interrupted a fair bit so is it just a bit of commitment so that can often be seen as the downside to being elected member but there's good stuff you know you can meet the challenges through commitment and effort you contribute to the development of your the interests of your community you're going to make important decisions and you'll feel a sense of achievement so I think the good outweighs the bad how quickly tonight also wanted to quickly highlight social media and the growing influence of social media as a means of communications so many elected members maintain a social media present and do so appropriately and effectively they do this by refraining refraining from making negative or denigrating personal comments about any aspect of their role on council keep in mind our early advice that you're always a counsellor for the term of your office and you can't wear two hats so you just need to be careful what you post on social media again yeah just be just be careful of avoid the red stuff and just use it appropriately I'm gonna quickly Arthur's already answered to elect members get paid and won't you get paid or give that a Miss must I live in a ward to run for election for that ward no you don't have to live in the same ward you council regardless of whether it's a ward election or a district election and and as Arthur mentioned before once you are on the council you'll be making decisions for the entire district I think we've been through that is it true that electro members cannot contact staff directly for example to ask them to deal with a particular problem and after mention quite correctly that elected members are required to follow established protocols so it's finding out what your protocol is at the local government I'm going to this has been covered by Luke and Chris I don't need to do that Lucas also and I would just encourage people to take part in this research project it's really good to get information as to why people want to nominate for council and then be an elected member Luke mentioned that there is going to be there's five training courses that you are required to complete in the first twelve months they're not onerous and they're the essential courses to give you an understanding of being an elected member so two sorry are just electronic serving on council which talks about roles and responsibilities understanding financial reports and meeting procedures and so they just need to be completed in the first 12 months and that the city of canning will help you through that there's plenty of resources around once you're an elected member the most you know obviously we're well Gers they're the Department of Local Government is there for you but most importantly you've got CEO and senior staff and your fellow elected members at your city who are worth talking to to find out information the first stage one was the initial training but if you really wanted to get a diploma in being an elected member you can and you can progress and learn learn more and that's it any quick questions

Okay we've got a pile here of greens that's obviously way over our our six cubic meters that where we're looking to achieve okay now stamp size here is way over what we're looking for and the fact that everything is out in different directions will make it very hard for the loader driver to actually remove the stuff from the verge cleanly and also from a safety point of view for the ground workers as well okay the answer brains in the situation here what we're looking for is to have everything stacked like this which makes it a lot easier for the loader driver to pick it up front with with the actual left end facing the fence and the actual cut is to the road what will happen in this scenario here is it's been laid out in two different directions which makes it very hard for the loader to come and pick it up clearly inside so if we have a look at the two comparisons between the two sides of the stance here obviously it's come from more manageable size for us the other one is still way over sized so what we would like to do see more of this rather compared to that size for us and makes a life a lot easier to pick it up now truck has styling and so it tells us exactly well right there we have a maximum light we can put in the truck so at one house three ton still being removed I can obviously see in the street and other two piles revealing similar size so we've actually only fixed up to a three files within one street which obviously put touch back time frame so the longer it takes hard get the stuff off the ground obviously the more unsightly comes with the community law and start to turn brown and people start complaining so might be more compliant and helping us we set up the achieving gifts up on around a lot quicker files of this size from July on routes putting pair of apron if you have big large waste piles certainly talk to the council talk to us and we can it comes to private contractors please be aware as the homeowner it's your responsibility and not the contractors that makes offers hierarchal fire

Today we are learning about the responsible disposal of litter did you know that every year the city has to clean up around 80 tons of illegally dumped rubbish that would fill over 300 wheelie bins that's a lot of rubbish can you imagine what would happen if this wasn't managed by the city that's right it would impact our quality of life the environment and the animals that live here would be equally effective this is why the city needs ongoing support from the community to assist in reducing litter and help keep canning clean and safe if you would like to know more about bitter illegal dumping and your responsibilities please visit cannon wao VA you
Really exciting day-to-day for canning so today we're opening sessile Avenue West the significance of that is it's the very first stage of the much larger 76 million dollar redevelopment of the canning city center it's important for us it's is important for the future of Penny because this is just a start of a 10-year journey for us we'd need to maintain their confidence in this project and there's going to be great benefit to further on so congratulations to everybody has played a small role and that will play a role in the future of this project I hardly and a very happily would like to cut this river and officially open seven new West let's watch you
The city of canning Emma's quite specific in that it wanted to celebrate the surrounding preserves it's a bush forever site and so there's a plethora of native flora and fauna and they wanted that celebrated on the wall Brendan and I both work very differently I hand draw my designs eventually projected at night I will put a grid around the photo and then enlarger on the wall so I can be quite specific in the size a grid that I want it's really really important for me to use site-specific animals and Clifton Park was a new opportunity for me to have a look around and see what species into within the bush land we had references from Jane Bramley's photos who hosts a lot on the Friends of Clifton Reserve Facebook page I did a more stylized approach to the surrounding flora so if you wander into that Bush land you can see the flora yourself so Brenton did all the animals his animal work is wonderful very 3d and realistic I put it few of the common common species not know about and may not see and I think that's the important part of projects like this we've had a lot of experience painting flora and fauna in the past no matter which side you look at it from you can see both our work together and yeah I couldn't couldn't be more happy I didn't work really well yeah I really love this mural I love what it represents I love the colors I love the people who have come and said hello and introduce themselves it's been a really fun project and thank you to the city of paintings for letting us paint

 what I value most about working the city of canning is working with the staff the resilience that given the history of this organization the recent history of the organization staff have been able to pull together and be and how to have a positive attitude towards working in the city the thing that appeals to me also is the fact that the city has a great opportunity to grab new narrative and that's what appeals to me about Restless organization I think that what I love most about working at the city of canning is the the openness the leadership has for our community listening to the community and being open that no limits no barriers do what it is that we can do say yes and and make sure that canning and the city of canning is truly sort of representative of what it is that our community our very diverse community are interested in canning being like I get lots of opportunity to work with lots of different people within within the organization and also externally I get to work from the strategic level as ground who are actually sort of for example putting plants in the ground and we've got a great team of people here that do great work at all sorts of levels now so I really enjoy that aspect of it what a value most about working in the city of canning is the people the people that I work with my colleague most especially my managers and coordinators is very supportive so the supportive environment I think I found you the most is that I can actually work and I'm living can it so the fact that ever everyday I come to do work is for the benefit of the local community that I actually live I think what I value most is the opportunity to work with a really diverse community working in the libraries we have people for all ages and all walks of life coming in and we get to sharing their stories with them I think I was value most about working pretty penny I think it's the security it's the diversity we're always moving around and getting requests the different us and have faith in our abilities that we know what we're doing so they give us quite a fair amount of freedom so we're left to maintain as we see fit whether one's maintaining so it's really awesome in that respect that we have a big stage in certain that that's nice to feel like they trust us enough to do it I think I've got the best job in Australia I think I think this is a business city that has got huge untapped potential and I think the City Council as an organisation is really reaching out to connect with this community and really position canning is very very exciting place closely and live and work I value most about working here the fact that this was my community I've actually got quite a deep connection to the people that we've here are the people that have made their home to you because it wasn't once my home and it still actually feels like my home so you know I live a good 50 days away but every at home in the morning and even I was at canning lodge are care services building the other day and my great Nana was at canning lodge so you know and I actually work in the building actually about 20 metres from a great man walk so yeah coming and working accounting is very special for me I value being feeling part of the community and just contributing to that I've always enjoyed sort of being in a slight sort of community service role and sort of being able to contribute to a better place to live than a safer sort of more harmonious sort of community so that's what I enjoy about and value about my work I really like city of canning are where it is at the moment because it's really its proximity to the river I think it's a geographic location it's a really beautiful around here and also the work of the city of caring there are lots of opportunities in terms of planning the area that I work and all the areas there lots of opportunities for improvement in work every day I value the opportunities of the community probably most of all it's a very diverse community and working in parks and environment there are a lot of things that can do for the long-term benefit of between I value the friendships and the helpfulness of people so there I've been here for just about nine months now so people have been very helpful during that time and yeah very friendly the sense of community I really feel I really enjoy getting up and going to work every day I enjoy dealing with people it creates a massive social hub for me personally it's not just a job I get to relate to people from all walks of life talk with people very open and very honest we are like a big family and it's just a sincere honest great place to work and a lot of fun what I value most about working at City of Cannings is the opportunities that arrive especially for me I've been doing the same type of job for such a long time and then an opportunity position cannon in the future and create a new vision new values a new mission to the city is really good to be able to step out of my comfort zone and try something different and how to support around the office a wonderful team what I value most is the served to that concert provide to the community in general I think that the environment that this console provides to the resident is very nice much better entirely the people probably the people who work in the city of canning are probably the biggest joy coming to work every day everybody loves their jobs everybody there's because they want to do something for the community we're all service place two areas anyway so that the joys of what we get from from from the guys who are running around the guys who are driving the truck and go oh yeah I did that I service the milk
Within the city of canning The Learning Communities Department looks after the city's libraries and is responsible for setting up a Learning City vision for the city going forward our vision for canning as a learning city is to support people of all walks of life to grow and to be able to safely and confidently operate as individuals within community so learning can be everything from the informal learning of coming into the library and participating in a ukulele workshop through to supporting people to navigate how to use a computer for seniors or how to lodge their tax assessments we're working with different partners across the community from formal to informal training and providers so tapes universities we've got a gentleman as I said who comes in and actually likes to show us how to use ukuleles in the library so it is about looking at learning in its broadest sense and then working with our community to support them where their needs are
There's so much to do for the whole family at cutting simulator please cutting some laser place a place for the whole community
So it is appropriate that in some areas you see higher density than in other areas for example there's a major bus routes and frequent bus routes along a specific I along the specific street it's reasonable to get more people living there because these people are less likely to use their own cars and there are the areas in the city which are mainly made of on houses are not likely to see buildings there so if there's a proposal for change of so-named we obviously go through the process we follow the regulations we do all of the community consultation that we have to do it before the city makes any decision of change the zoning and also ultimately all of the decisions have to be approved by the state government so it's not really after the city staff terms to the specific site and say look we want to keep building there or we want to see high-density there it has to go through a process and the process has to follow the regulation
 stormwater drains have a functional purpose but they can be inaccessible to the community but that's all about to change over the coming year the wallstreet basin and by Water Corporation in the city of canning will be transformed into a multifunctional public green space providing a place for people habitat for wildlife and contributing to the livability of our city this highly collaborative project will bring together designers engineers the city of canning key government agencies and researchers to create the park of the future one that's restorative functional and incorporates the latest smart technology to enhance the public's experience monitor visitation engagement and the performance of the design and infrastructure the Wharf Street Basin a next generation community park is going to show what's possible for more information go to Kenan W a.gov dot a you forward slash smart
I think the council does a wonderful job the bush crew do an amazing job and I think as long as we keep our open spaces and just stay as we are I was very shocked when we were going to be amalgamated and I think the council does such a good job it should just stay as it is and we should just go the way we're going which has been wonderful
The city of canning is an innovative city with a vibrant past an energetic present and an exciting future we aim to be an arrival city that is welcoming and thriving and are committed to making bold brave out-of-the-box decisions for the future which embrace innovation from the canning River to shopping precincts walking trails to weekend sports restaurants to robots the city of canning is a mix of old and new fast and slow nature and technology canning people are from all over the world creating an exciting and dynamic tapestry of cultural experiences 96 thousand people live in Cannings sixteen suburbs with 50% of our population born overseas and 174 languages spoken we celebrate diversity we're creating safe places and spaces that foster connection and allow our business and community members to interact share cultural experiences and thrive both day and night located just 12 minutes from the Perth CBD canning city center is set to become one of the most significant precincts in the metropolitan area transforming into a vibrant public realm the 76 million dollar 10-year transit oriented development will feature premier retail and commercial canning is a major player economically in Western Australia contributing over 10 billion dollars annually to gross state product making it the third largest economy in WI the city's strategic location closed to all major ere road rail and sea freight routes as well as being the location of two major industrial areas consolidate this position the city is working collaboratively with other local governments to become a best practice freight and logistics hub in Perth a center for freight forwarding activities that play an essential role in the local national and global supply chain and support the movement of freight business to business and business to customer canning is also home to the market city logistics complex which handles half of all of Western Australia's fresh produce every week and attracts over half a million people to its weekend markets each year the city of canning is evolving we're exploring innovative ideas that will shape our future and entice people to visit play live and do business in canning think water festivals River taxis talking infrastructure trackless trams and solar farms and you get an idea different in all the best ways we want to break the stereotype of local government to forge new frontiers we're passionate about providing our city and its people with strong cultural connections a sense of belonging and a place for everyone a place people are happy and proud to call home
One of the things that people most say is they want opportunities to sit down and have a coffee and and talk with friends I think our role firstly is to is to know where is to know where people want cafes in the first place they certainly want them around the city center area but we also sense that people want cafes in areas where they spend time at the weekends when they're walking their dog or with their families or going or out there on a bicycle right so we've got lots of river frontage areas and there would seem to be opportunities to build to have cafes in those in those areas but also importantly we're really creating the conditions for investment we need to find people who are willing to invest in these cafes and work with them to create commercial enterprises that actually really really work and and respond to the needs of our community
 today is a chance for you to be creative to explore the boundaries to actually create the vision that we will use when we're having conversations with people the vision where we want to inspire others to the Canon way we want to create a new Canon way when we create a new vision for the future and one that will guide everything we do over the next 10 years I imagine that canning could be anything certainly because of our cultural diversity and our age diversity and every other kind of diversity that we experience we've got the opportunity to have an incredibly unique place that's not like any other lot of cookie cutter and city or local government area if we're truly working with the community and getting projects programs and areas looking the way that community want us to I think that we're going to have something that reflects everybody and everybody will see themselves in Canning whether it's programs or places or the activities that we do only what I like to see the people showing you itself to actually embrace their businesses I know it's all about multiculturalism diverse students the most cultural country but they are being start I would like to see so that we still you know embrace for that we can actually participate and we have someone actually listening the city defense as you can see we are only culture this cultural group but we need to have opportunities to actually you know do something within the community to actually be helped instill respect it can become whatever we imagine it to become now that we are City in our own right we want to actually create a sense of community a sense of purpose and a vision for our community to connect with I think it's one of those unpolished Island has potential to grow in multiple ways and I think that's where it's such an important area whereby we work in an area which has got not just an economic sort of things but we've also got the population-based attack without to make it into something of which currently isn't you know the potential actually be this is what the important area going to become I mean it's already a major regional hub but I think it could be there's things that could do better you could sort out the traffic issues we could have a safer city centre which I think is on the plans anyway which I find really exciting and I just like to make sure it's more disabled friendly because we're getting an increased population especially amongst the young disabled the mayor can in have the opportunity to be the place to be so whether that from a business point of view and we've got loads of business opportunities in Cannon and we want to encourage business to the area and it's a place to be in terms of community wanting to run your community activity or community groups or for from a source in front of you having has fantastic reserves and every weekend you can see young people of the older people playing sports and so for me in ten years I want having to do the pose of three Kenyans going years so I think we're going to absorb a lot a lot of them population growth as it moves out from the city cannon will become key it's very important place to live particularly in the city center because we're so close to the city and I think we'll see I think that their whole new range of people coming to live get the same time I think that our canning has the opportunity to build global connections and work with our business community to do that and I think one of the ways in which we can build those global connections is to also work with our residents who are very highly multicultural in the first place so we've got all the ingredients here to be a city that is recognized as a place that people really wanted to be in but also also city that can punch above its weight and operate globally I think young city of canning is got a lot of potential for development the whole I guess carousel precinct or city centre you know there's a lot of case and there's just so much room and potential for development and if you could see if the city of canning can actually manage that process effectively so we get the right kind of development and I guess increase the amenity of the area what could can become in the next ten years if the sense what the community want this to be I hope it would become welcoming inclusive much greener and cooler place I think the council does a wonderful job the bush crew do an amazing job and I think as long as we keep our open spaces and just stay as we are I was very shocked when we were going to be amalgamated and I think the council does such a good job it should just stay as it is and we should just go the way we're going which has been wonderful chef canning is already a vibrant and inclusive city um I think there are just so many different types of communities living here so we can bring all of them together and you go connect this cannon could become a as great parks great Arturo Rogers very central to the city it easy to get from point A to point B as close to this close to the airport if there's great recreational facilities great parks great river great community we've weathered a lot of stores have been through a lot of a lot of controversy in the past but we keep bouncing back and Najeeb I hurt I move forward and continue to provide a good service to our customers and and good community spirit and we have a strong following and a strong community and the drive to reflect we will be having a place where maybe people and families of all different economic status can be comfortable to live in and rather than wouldn't like to see it becoming a place that's only for wealthy people to live in or the opposite way wouldn't like to see it if it's going to be completely completely filled out with high-rise buildings on our new tour and I need for like a cheaper place to live and most importantly hopefully effort if in there are today and they don't decrease any of them or forego any parkland or housing or industrial or anything like that then that will as I said to our CEO Robert I would like to see canteen become a destination not a humiliation because in the past we've had the commissioners in a number of times because our elected representation hasn't been as strong as it could be I think we're on the right track now but I can see a fantastic future poor canteen and in the same way that people talk about you know the foodie lifestyle and then they say well we can go to alpha moss and have it up there I'd like to have people talking about the canning lifestyle and enjoying our River our wetlands are our easy movement to places and parks within our suburbs and the food services that the city provides water

underdeveloped or vacant so there will provide 10,000 new dwellings to house up to 25,000 new people in our city center this is an untapped resource one of the few places in Australia this close to a CBD with the potential for development of quite of a nature of the quantum of this type through this commitment the city has created a unique opportunity to develop a smart city that meets the needs of future generations and fulfills the state's mandate for high-density future development more than that we envisage a future where development is built over and around the underutilized Kennington rail station creating a true transit orientated development we've also created strong links through state and private land connecting to the huge amenity of kenning regional park to the south and the residential suburbs to the north so how are we doing this kenning has approved a 10-year regeneration program to deliver the infrastructure improvements needed to to form the backbone of the revitalization project phase 1 renewed landscapes including a new Main Street along Cecil Avenue phase 2 creating urban streams from our drains and basins and under grounding power develop their land the creation of strong public realm creating an environment where activity and greater vibrancy can occur day and night encouraging a diversity of housing linking down to the river working with our key stakeholders like Center Group and creating a range of employment opportunities I want to personalize and localize this to show you the potential that can be achieved at different scales and on different sites in the city center Patty Street a small three to four lot privately owned development site and Western power a large state-owned development site the master plan shows the development potential over each of these sites here's what could be achieved this is Patty Street today large blocks with single-family housing here's how it could be this is the future Western power today a site that is undergoing subdivision in readiness for an imminent sale here's how it could be again this is the future ladies and gentlemen it's just about to have breakfast and after that we'll be hearing from Sam Reece from proper TSP but before that I'm going to leave you unfold also you have the video to take away with you it's in the USB that's in front of you on your table so please enjoy the video and your breakfast and I'll see you after Brickey oh sorry I just wish to acknowledge councillor Jesse Jacobs who I'm just seeing I just want to make an introduction and the city in researching the viability and future of the canning city center enlisted the services of Sam Reese from property ESP Sam has a great deal of professional experience in this area and uncovered some incredibly exciting facts about the future of this project please join me in welcoming Sam Reese from property ESPs Thank You arkla and good morning everybody so I'm delighted to be here this morning because last November I presented to the council and I said to them you know you've been keeping the city and its vision in your sights for six years and now is the time to take action and action they did so at their mayor ten years which is actually going to see a very different City canning than you have ever seen before and that's great news I remember being in Midland ten years ago when Kieran Kinsella was talking about the vision for Midland with anybody else at that and there was a couple of six figurines and metal and I thought to myself I so want to believe in this vision and then last year I went into Midland to the new hospital my daughter was having her tonsils out and I was blown away gobsmacked Midland had become the new Subiaco and the hospital had created all these medical hubs which was just exciting to see and I thought to myself if Midland can do this so can canning and it's only 10k is 11 caves from the CBD so we were engaged by the council to actually do research about what was happening in this area but also to speak with about 10 developers who were already developing in this precinct to get their thoughts and ideas about what we to be doing as we move forward and there but underutilized and tithes are fantastic they have a lot to benefit to them and that's why they're the new craze and that's why Metro net will certainly produce a number of them as we move forward you've got carousel 350 million dollar expansion which has already started they're going to create a second level to the shopping center which I have like an alfresco dining area you will not see anything else like it in Wi and I acknowledge the center group who are here this morning and that's 70 million dollars that the council has set aside will actually sync the power line along vessel and upgrade the power station down by the train station they are removing all the barriers for the development can proceed and that was kind of refreshing don't you think apartments already been delivered and I know that we have Rob Shelley in the room who is the owner of red dot but he also had a site which he had purchased next to carousel which he wanted to actually develop into a commercial development and they finally resigned it apartment and he thought to himself what I going to do with this apartment burning I've got no idea of our partners so he hired someone and they build apartments and they all sold so then Rob bought the site next door so certainly if you are the early bird in this process you are going to benefit from this process so what is happening in Canning there have been sounds of apartments traditionally they have been to overseas buyers why because you are one bus stop to carrots or to oak Curtin University so we're actually seeing a lot of people buying for this their family and for their students but what we're actually also seeing which is even more exciting is the values are going up every year and that's a good sign and we carousel going ahead they can only catalyst it further but you know tides also have a very strong convenience element and I was at Collier's briefing last year and I acknowledge table of pulleys over here and John Dodge also said that they caves from the CBD on the train line and when we've done research of people who have achieved have bought on a train line and we've asked them why they fought it's about the fact that they can hop on that train they can go and have a drink or two and not worry about a taxi it's about the fact that generally it's near retail and it means that if you actually buy along that train line you have a greater strength of actually renting it out and here's an example that we actually have from doing some research with Coburn train station and also looking at how that impacted on property values with a at well Coburn and success and we compared that to Ellen Brooke now you can see here that the tracking the prices in terms of property prices we're tracking so Ellen Brooke was tracking with all those other suburbs on the south until 2007 2007 is when the train station went in at that point you saw Ellen Brooke kinda like keep going but these suburbs are 2014 house prices in those southern suburbs were a hundred and thirty six thousand dollars more than Ellen Brooke and apartments were sixty thousand dollars more than Ellen Brooke so a train station is a miraculous thing for property and that's why a lot of developers are putting in basically infrastructure public for infrastructure into their estates it has a dollar sign attached to it but in terms of the broader sense I also imagine director of the West strain apartment advocacy and we did some research just at the beginning of this year and what we saw with our investors was that 61% of investors actually owned more than two properties and of those are owned more than two properties 81% actually owned more than two apartments so it does seem that once you buy an apartment you're a conflict it becomes part of your DNA you may say they also believe 19% in fact believe that their property would go up in value in the next 12 months 67% believe their value would go up in the next five years 98% believe there's no you investors are not worried about the oversupply of apartments which in fact I dispute as well and this is interesting this is a renters survey response and as you can see we had 39% of renter's moved from a house for you 2% from an apartment into an apartment 73% would move back to an apartment tomorrow if they were Archie to rent tomorrow but what is interesting here is that if you look at that they move from a two-bedroom 35% three-bedroom 26% four-bedroom 22 into a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom but then if they were looking next time they'll be moving into a three or a two bedroom that means if you're an investor your one bedroom may give you the better yield but will it sell and the focus now needs to be moving on to actually providing more choice and the market supplies accounting so far has been one and two but when the data I show you further on will give you an indication that maybe the threes are next way to move all those who actually owned and also then lived 52% two-person households 11 percent with family and all those people 20 percent were transitioning into retirement or already retired so provisioning some kind of care into your apartment like while Blackburn is doing in Claremont is also a future trend you have a lot of people living in this suburb who would love to stay in this suburb but who would like to upgrade up style I call and not downsize but right size because they've been living in a very big house now 53% of the people who did this survey had not lived in apartments before and yet 84 percent would recommend living in an apartment that's a KPI 84% pretty much and what's also interesting here is that they 58 percent moves of the only occupiers from a house 29% from an apartment they moved into an apartment 70 percent would move into an apartment tomorrow in terms of they were going to buy again what they predominately moved from though was your three and four bedrooms into two bedrooms and then tomorrow they are going to move again 53 percent are looking definitely seeing a shift and that's important to understand so what's happening in Canning ttyn lots of great stuff happening in Kennington nearly half of the population in Canning turn is aged between 20 and 40 when carousel finishes is going to become a retail employment hubs it will attract more of that age demographic to this location which is great because that actually brings a sense of buzz and if you go out and a Wednesday Tuesday or a Monday night it is that demographic that is out spending the cash so you definitely want to have them in your mix 23% of new household purchases were loan persons there's your retiree market in there as well but they predominately bought 3-bedroom dwellings 60% of the area here in Canning I've been born overseas they're used to living in apartments they're used to having families in apartments and those they said already 23% of that land identified in that canning Center is underutilized where else you have a living cage from the CBD with 23% of land underutilized so here's an interesting yes mortgage is going up this is what I find interesting sticks my box so from 2001 to 2011 I can't wait for the ABS stats for this year look at this increase in professionals is that what you would expect and what's also interesting is when you look at the car ownership nearly 50% only on one car they have all the characteristics of a child without a child does that make sense that is a higher ownership of just one vehicle than what we are seeing at Coburn because Coburn was a retrofitted Tod this is a tall just waiting to flourish so we interviewed ten developers who are developing already in the city caning it's always good to know what they think because it's going to be you in that position hopefully soon and what they all said it was unanimous or that they believe in the potential for the canning city center they think it's a perfect location for a tide because of that chain that the retail makes an expansion of Westfield is going to really care it actually expand new there's lack of competition for the moment but as a good connection with current unis and as a sense of action from Council and this is a council that does put its money where its mouth is and I don't know many of those in purse at the moment but what they also said was that this is a very different council from eight years ago there are more engaging and proactive there were good communicators they were fair they were team players yes we're talking about a council can I say that this is encouraging yes people are clapping I like that yes yes it's good and that they would do other developments in canning as a result of their experience so it seems to me that we have like a bit of a formula going on here we've got available land we've got a council is prepared to put money and they're prepared to go like now we've got a demographic that suits apartment living we've got a catalyst with Westfield carousel to help spruce this along so dynamic so tell me what's your thoughts speak out silence so even one comment home it's also thinking going on yes undervalued well I'm going to tell you I think the caning is also undervalue especially as proximity to the river but I appreciate your plug a friend oh hi I'm Taryn I'm just wondering what do you think the answer site is on the market so sort of the bigger apartment because we've got quite a multicultural population here and people often like this about extended families and perhaps even looking at five six federal time yeah what you'll do is make market information you go so I would definitely suggest that any developer who is thinking about going into bigger apartments would actually need to do some research in this precinct to actually test the market but I think that with the demographic and I just was recently in Vietnam and in Vietnam they have three stories to their houses the grandparents live on the bottom the parents live in the middle and the children with their family live on the would be amazing I could send the kids up all the time but the thing is you have that culture and canning in particular has that culture so every suburb is unique and every demographic in that suburb is unique but I think this would be the one place that you could really test that and try it and I would love to see that because I think we are missing a house in an apartment style and the price point here like I said to council you could build a penthouse for seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars here in Canning and people who would buy that well I'll take that sticking around in your head I hope that stimulating your thoughts certainly if you have any questions please put them to Arthur or myself or the other team thank you for your time this morning I'm not going to do what sands just done which is walk around and talk with great knowledge about the area because she certainly has that okay I wondering with your asking how you can find out more well firstly while some of my key people in the project gray and bride is my director of sustainable development Graham where are you and Gary McCulloch who is the city center project leader Gary please show yourself thank you so if you want to approach and have a talk with either of us please please do so secondly we want to have direct conversations with you our doors are open for business is what we're saying we're encouraging boardroom lunches where you'll have the opportunity to engage with me and my team to discuss creating solutions for your businesses if you're interested in this leave your business card on the table that you came in with the registration table sorry leave your card there so we can contact you and invite you to a boardroom lunch that I lunches that I wish to hold with this council over the year and finally for the digital natives amongst us we've arranged for a virtual reality tour of the new city center so again leave your business cards at the registration desk I am assured that the 3d tour paper bags not the ones that you think they are but I'm happy to receive them anyway so the brown paper bags that are next to you contain information about the project and a booklet which outlines a project in some detail don't forget your USB take it with you and and have a look at the the video at your own leisure certainly I've looked at it many times and I'm more excited every time I look at it finally I'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning please feel

What we should be doing is actually reducing the amount of waste that goes to the landfill site so right now we probably do about 45,000 tons per annum we probably should reduce that amount there are targets and that kind of thing which we should work towards and probably look towards what the with this data you know the state are talking about a 50% diversion probably what we should be working towards

Probably more community event I don't mean as a non there's only what for yeah yeah also I like less congestion like three canning vow and through willetton down south street and stuff like this always packed and hard you get to school every morning in there and were clear so that would be good
Our beautiful river system this great place to recreate and live it's not only us that love Cannings natural river environment since canning has the pristine canning River running through it with an extensive network of salt marsh wetlands the mosquito is very keen on the region as well would you believe the mosquito only lives a few months but during that time they go through four significant life cycle stages eggs are laid in the wetlands on the dam mud and in the water the eggs hatch into larvae commonly known as wrigglers wrigglers turn into pupae and the pupae hatch into adult mosquitoes the adult mozzie can then travel several kilometers from the wetland to find a meal the summer heat rapidly increases the speed that larvae grow resulting in an egg becoming an adult mozzie in six to ten days with each mozzie capable of playing hundreds of x at a time adult numbers can escalate quickly increasing the chance of being bitten so what does the city of canning do about it we actually do a lot more than you might think the city of Western Australia there are many different types mosquitoes however the city focuses its efforts on the salt marsh mosquitoes we choose to target both salt marsh mosquito species as they're well known to transmit mosquito-borne diseases and we want to ensure our residents and visitors are able to enjoy our spectacular environment from September until April the city's officers target mosquito larvae in the wetland environment surrounding the canning River the treatments they apply by hand are approved products that target mosquito larvae and are not harmful to people pets all the general environment the city's program uses an integrated approach with lava sighting the key treatment option lava sighting is the most effective method of mosquito control as it's easier to treat the larvae whilst they're confined to the wetlands rather than waiting until they're adults under dispersed adult trapping of mosquitoes assists in monitoring adult numbers the program also includes warnings provided through the city's website and social media networks during summer the city doesn't work in isolation rather we work side-by-side with neighboring councils and the Department of Health resource sharing and collaboration so why do we still have mosquitoes firstly there are limitations to the city's program sometimes heavy vegetation prevents the treatment from reaching the water below where larvae can breathe another major reason is the changing climatic conditions and the significant tidal changes that can occur over summer coupled with extreme temperatures that speed up the mosquitoes life cycle during summer months these conditions present challenges to any mosquito program the city is doing its bit to protect the community from mosquitoes and works hard to ensure residents can live and recreate around the beautiful canning River for more information please go to the city's website or contact the city's environmental health offices you
What I would like to say to the community given the fantastic response to our city our future is thank you very much thank you for taking the time to put those ideas forward it gives us something to now work with it gives us something to develop and through the development of those ideas will be able to hopefully map out an exciting future for the city of kings
Eating in the month is a agenda briefing whereby we have an open forum in our council chamber where members of the public can come ask questions make presentations and counselors can ask questions of administration staff to get clarity on the report that they're read and the rigor they're reading and the recommendations and then the third meeting is where the official decision-making takes place yeah so it it's a minimum it's going to be three Tuesdays in a month I can assure you that it's more than that thank you any more questions excuse me for a minute folks what I might suggest you come along to a council meeting come along now as part of the the public and see how it's run I also mentioned the agenda briefing which is a week before which is where we get to ask questions and then at the councilman is where you do the debate remember I said that you can to try and influence and be influenced but come along and actually see how it works it's the best way to is a regular attender at our meetings and asks us a lot of questions and keeps us on our toes so you know by all means it's a democracy I mean they're open open forums I mean they're occasionally our meetings will be closed because of a confidential item they're not that often and pleasingly so they're not that often I think we need to be open and transparent in the conduct of business but occasionally for legal reasons or other specific financial issues we do have closed forums but usually that's at the end that is at the end of any council meeting if we do have that I have a question for the Deputy Commissioner are the last election two years ago the ballot paper the flap has got the address which people say fill up your address I think it's very important to bring it in bore if you change your address please feel I think that part is missing and a lot of people were quite uncertain so I think I mean it's not your problem but I what if you change your address please put in your new address I think a lot of people was wondering how to go about the flap I think that was the a slight error there there was calling a bit of confusion caused by that and we've taken onboard the feedback we received and actually have removed that from the back of the certificate and what we're that at this time is if any of your enrollment details have changed visit such-and-such a website so that you can update the details so that's what we've done this time because it did create some confusion you're quite correct are there any other questions like oh yes Nicky good evening everyone I'll just take a moment of your time for those of you haven't_''_200.299 met me I'm Nicky mint jelly you may for those that were here two years ago I was Nicky Armstrong so I am still the same person so two years ago we had a rather extraordinary election here in the city of canning it broke pretty much every electoral record of things so you know good and bad what I ask you if you are intending to to nominate for this particular election go on to the nomination builder I'll give you the thumb drive with all the information start creating your profile now as Chris has already alluded to you can contact me at any stage for feedback the earlier you do that the more feedback I can give you the more likely I am to accept your nomination when we meet face to face now as I said two years ago we had 57 candidates I work full time 57 candidates means 57 nominations means 57 meetings in an 8 day period so I'm not anticipating we have that same number this time however some make it easier on yourselves as well as on me please be organized get those things in place decide that you're going to become a candidate and start your profile early get in contact with me to make an appointment please make an appointment it makes your life easier my life easier we know what we're expecting and we we're there and all of those hiccups can be dealt with before you meet with me the other thing I would ask is in regards to authorization of materials so of the in excess of 100 complaints that we had almost all of them related to the authorization of materials so please familiarize yourself with that particular piece of legislation please make sure you check and double-check everything that you put out into the community and by that we also include facebook pages so just be mindful of those types of things and please contact me early I am available from now my preference is email but I will you know I will return voicemail messages I'm just not always able to answer my phone so thank you very much good luck

What I'd like to say to the people of be Leah thank you very much you're in court has been invaluable your ideas have been great there's been some ones which are things that out there that's a bit like me anyway so I'd like to thank you for your participation it's been greatly received and will be taken on board I can tell you so thank you very much
And people have often said to us but no one knows me as Michael I was a so in that case we would put let's say you you're Michael Miller we would put Miller Michael and if you want we can put was a but it'll be in brackets after your proper name but you can do that okay you've the amazed that the variations that we get I had one chap a couple of elections back is it my nickname's tractor I'm tractor well we said we can't put tractor on the ballot paper but we've since worked it's true and we can do what I just said we could put tractor in brackets after his Christian name in very importantly you will be given a reference number and you'll also have to select a password so only you and the returning officer can access your nomination so when you first go in and you get your reference number write it down and write down your password the number of people relapse I forgot the password because if there we don't know what your password password is and neither will Nikki but Nikki will be over if you once you tell her her reference number your reference number she'll be able to go in and retrieve that okay right Oh time to move along as a candidate you're you're able to get a free copy of the role it's electronic it's in two forms one it's an alpha list of electors in alphabetical order by surname and the other is a habitation list a lot of candidates use that when they're not walking the streets and knocking on doors and so on so that's a file that can be manipulated but it's only to be used for electioneering purposes it's not to be sold it's not to be used for commercial purposes if you're a real estate agent or a property developer or something or a debt collector postal voting I've indicated already that the packages will be lodged progressively with Australia Post from Wednesday the 27th of September respective metropolitan councils if all wards be sending out just under 1.6 million postal packages all right so if a war doesn't go obviously we won't be sending out there's a couple of local governments are also running referendums at the same time so we were sending those out as well but as you'd imagine once we have lodged those packages with Australia Post with lost control and it sometimes takes a while for Australia Post to clear them through so don't expect that ah the packages will be in the letter boxes in Canning on Thursday the 28th it won't be and as you may be aware Australia Post have introduced a two-tier system of regular or priority and most councils have gone with regular for cost reasons it still means that most electors will have two to three weeks to return their package all return packages come back to us as priority mail but the outgoing is typically regular most people who are going to vote as you are well aware voting in local government elections in Western Australia is not compulsory so you're looking at about now Marshall last elections had 85 percent participation rate Gosnell's had just under twenty one percent so it varies the larger urban councils such as your own you tend to have lower participation rates but the people who are going to vote will typically do so in the first few days of receiving their package so that's when your best efforts in terms of campaigning are done if you leave your campaigning until a couple of days before Saturday the 21st which is election day you've missed the boat so it's early campaigning is most effective two key rules as a candidate you cannot say to the elderly lady who lives down the street give me a package and I'll drop it in for you that's illegal alright nor can you say look I'll help you fill in the ballot paper get someone else to help them fill in the ballot paper as a candidate that is an offence under the Act with a fairly significant penalty I've talked about the issue of replacement packages already when the packages come back the envelope we take out the ballot paper envelope which has a certificate attached to it we check that certificate it's got a barcode we scan the barcode that marks the elector off the roll we then remove the certificate from that envelope separate them then we open the ballot paper envelope take out the ballot papers uninspected and put them into bundles of 50 and put them in a a sealed ballot box and that's what's supplied to Niki around midday on on the Saturday for her to get ready to account later in the evening or at some stage in the afternoon so it's still a secret ballot and these as I said the certificate is removed separately and that's done at our central processing center which is in Northbridge in Perth in the North Bridge Center corner of Beauford Street and James Mickey will then process any packages which have been handed in here up to and including and we will then add those to the ones that we've sent her from return mail and that's what she'll count on wind-up so I need to very quickly if you get elected or if you get five percent of the formal vote you'll get your 80 back last thing this is really important this is a trick a trap for young players so to speak if you produce any electioneering material that you have whether it's personalized or or just in with all the other mail that gets posted you just stuck into the people's letter boxes it must be authorized so if you are printing it at home on a computer you need to say authorized and printed by Mary Smith sixteen one back present whatever right it's got to be a physical address it can't_''_448.099 be a p.o box and if you have it commercially printed under the legislation but a carryover of days gone by but you need to have the name of the printer and the address of the printer sounds a bit strange but that's what the Act is requires you need to ensure that anything you put out is authorized if you create a website if you create a don't have to authorize every single page nor do you have to authorize everything every iteration that you might be having in a conversation or something but the landing page should be authorized election offenses obviously bribery and undue influence are particularly important once but there are a number of those you can appoint scrutineers to view the count and to represent you you can't_''_506.12 be on the floor of the count itself as a candidate but you can appoint a scrutineer to monitor the counting process I won't go into any details run out of time here but there is a gift register it's maintained by Arthur as the CEO the local government here can give you further information about your obligations under the electoral provisions of the Act about receipt of gifts but the one thing I will say if you're running as a candidate the gift period started in April okay it's a six-month window leading up to the election if you get a gift from someone and they're going to give you that gift anyway it was a birthday as a councillor a candidate as a council elections didn't that you don't have to declare that but it's relating to your campaign as I said this is a longer presentation than normal allocated here so look I'm going to close there if you've got any questions at the end then by all means I'd happy to take them on board thank you thank you very much Chris there is a lot to a lot to take in so this isn't the only opportunity for you to familiarize yourself with it as said earlier there is a thumb drive that you'll receive also we've given we've put together a package as well for all of you to take away tonight I'd now like to call on the deputy mayor Lindsay Holland to come forward and talk about his experiences as a Anna's elected member with the city then councillor Jacobs and then councillor cutting ham thank you after good good evening everybody look I won't go through a lot of the stuff that's already gone through just tell you about a little bit about my experience I think one of the most important things if you're thinking of coming onto canceled is to do it for the right reason it's not to do it for money as the the mayor said that's the wrong reason it's not to do it for anything else but because you want to serve your community you had a look at some of the stats up there I think it was 28 percent of the respondents heads community was the first and most important thing if you went through that list you on there you know everything on there also spelled out community involvement in some way or another you also got to enjoy what you're doing I actually enjoy being on the cancer and I also always promised my wife the time I stopped enjoying it the time is the time while I'll step down you've got to do it for the right reason there's a lot of work which was touched on before there is a lot of work but more lot of reading to do and Jen sometimes you got to read things twice to have it sink through there's a lot of references made to acts and this and that sort of stuff which you've got to think what the heck does that mean you've got to do some research on what does that mean you've got to work out how why for dose if I do that if I vote for that way what is it going to mean to other people and what's it going to mean if I vote the opposite way your it was also suggested that you have to be prepared to influence people and be prepared to be influenced by people that's when the debate happens at council chambers before that you have the agenda briefings and other information sessions where you get your information you can come up and formulate your own idea the see I was also right once you get elected an award here as opposed to what gotham's was mentioned before Gosselin's doesn't have wards but we do so if bill award that's where you target your advertising or promotion or whatever because they're your electors but once you get elected you will actually represent everybody you obviously look at you've probably got a little bit more interest on your own because that's your own tooth like mine's Belial which is where I live which is Willetton but it doesn't stop me actually going completely right outside that to the whole of the city of canning and especially if you've been the deputy mayor it's even more important I mean being the deputy mayor I've had to go to camera and to talk about the city of canning as a whole a camera politician doesn't give a damn about my award these talks he's concerned about the city as a whole so the only thing I would might be prepared to spend a bit of time make sure you've got some family support do it for the right reasons that you want to help the community that's the most important thing that you can do do it of luck it is a great thing it is a great community service and I hope you do enjoy it and I think you will if you do it for the right reason and just be prepared the mayor said three or four nights a week yes sometimes it has happened as the CEO has alluded to I think this week we've got tonight and Thursday night there but there are other things that you might need to attend do for example the mayor and I every time they have a citizenship ceremony we go to that there's a lot of other functions that you might have to do or you might not have to do so be prepared to do go to community events on a Saturday or Sunday because the community they voted for you they want to see you out there and you just don't go to a community event in Mason Ward that's got a barbecue at the local park you go to the community event event that's down on the Rosslyn foreshore which is a New Year's Eve fireworks you don't limit it to your own thing you go to everything you've got to be out there you've got to work you've got to be a person there that you're representing you're not only just the people who elected you but the actual greater city of canning they also alluded to and I'll just finish up now because we've got a couple more people anyone wants to go home when he gave his little talk he alluded to what the city of Cannings got and what we're striving to do well if you get elected you're actually going to be coming on to cancel or with the City of Canyon at a great time because we are progressing at a great rate of not something that hasn't been done in the city for many years we've got a great future ahead of us there finances a very solid the council is in a great position we've got a great mayor here who leads by example we've got a great so I'll take that back counselors that are staying here and not to be reelected on one of them are all so great we're all on here for the same reason that we want to see the city of kenning thrive and be as best we can the city centre project is a great thing the Bentley regeneration project some of the things we're doing that in Canning Vale are great and all over the place so you'll be joining at a really good time you're actually very lucky because we did all the work before you got here of course but you're actually very lucky so I wish you all the best and nominate enstein good luck thank you mr. deputy mayor Councillor Jesse Jacobs please okay I don't know if I can match that great performance but I'll just do a few other points I've written a few notes down here so I don't ramble away I'm first and foremost I think the common mixing misconception is that people will ask you so also how many hours is it a month maybe like just once a meeting a month is it's obviously more than that so I'd hate for you to sort of think well you know once a month I'll come in for four hours and that's done that would be incorrect also second point is you need to be I think you need to be robust don't take the debate personally obviously you you buy into an argument or you'll think well you know you've convinced yourself that this is the right way but other people might see it differently some councils and I think we've been good here for the last two years is that we don't make it personal so I might go down or I might be moving a motion and I it it crashes and burns and I'm like damn that councillor he sabotaged it it's not it's it's it's more than that and if he if you get to that level I think you're missing the point about how a local local councils work you were here as individuals are not on on the night so don't take it personally something you win some you lose some you just gotta get back up and go out keep going on ward deputy mayor's already alluded to that but you represent canning for most so I'd hate for some we don't do it here but some people and some other councillors sort of do this Ward politics thing where it's sort of it's divide and conquer where my award is everything and if I don't get in my award then I don't support it you know you've got to be bigger than that tax the pays the pays okay but don't get into the trap of just taking it all and when the taxman says well you know I want a third of that you don't have it so it's a bit of a trap that I got a few of a few of the councillors got into the dirt the first year that actually all the money they give you the tax departments going to say well hang on a because it's combined with your other salary election promises don't say things you can't commit to or don't want to do it's just some people say well you know I'll get in and I'll say if you vote for me well what do you want me to do I'll do that you know it's it's more than that and you know some it might happen here it might happen to other places but I think we owe it to the the confidence that people have invested in the democratic process not to take the cheap option and say look vote for me and I'll give everyone no rights it's not achievable zero vote for me and there'll be no rates ever again you know it's just it doesn't work like that be passionate have your heart in it I think deputy mayor's obviously alluded to that you can tell the people that are passionate and people aren't passionate because the people that I should be like damn if we got Council on Tuesday this tongue we've got to be there and the the community has placed a great amount of trust in you to make the right decisions because they're going to busy with their family they're gonna be busy with work they can't_''_1152.53 be here they don't have all the information you have the information they have entrusted you and that leads me to our next next point is don't let the position go to your head I've seen and I'm not saying it has happened but I've seen happen certainly in some places and sometimes more in in federal or state is you you meet the guy and mr. Smith is or mrs. Smith it's a great candidate very approachable fantastic gets elected two weeks later we don't know where they've gone the power goes to the head do they change as a person I think it's really important to stay the same person that you were before you got the job and look it's sometimes it's easy to get caught up with it and sort really the community has entrusted you to look after their affairs for them and be approachable I think it's really important if someone rings you and psychology is they probably just want to talk to you and it's easy to shut them down it's easy to give him all the answers but I think a lot of the time they just want you to listen to them and so I had a gentleman ringing me up last week and he kept talking for 15 minutes straight off and I felt like saying well you know what's the problem but I think it's sometimes important just to I read a book recently written by Richard Branson and he says the reason why I've got two ears and one mouth is because you use the ears more than you speak I think that's good generally generally in good advice last point and I'll leave it's quite a long night for you guys tonight is I did the deployment of governance that was 10 units the city will give you an allowance for educational with well guarded at 10 units it was quite an investment of time said 10 days plus homework but I thought it was quite good so I think getting if you want to do it give it a good hot give it a red hot red hot run if you don't get up it's not the end of the world there's always next time but it's a rough and tumble game give it your best shot I thank you all for being here because in essence you're we're all buying into the Australian Democratic model and I know Ozzy's pay off it pay pay it off a lot but I've trust me I've lived in the country for a long time that there was no opportunity for democratic engagements so I'll leave it like that and I wish you all the well in your elec campaigning thank you thank you JC and now councillor Christine Cunningham good evening folks thanks very much for coming I'll keep it brief and just to add some comments that may not have been here in the city of canning and I'd love to see at the next election that we reach gender parity I'd love to see as we have now a great diversity in Ages and it's certainly a really great mix of cultural representatives so I see that we have that today in the audience and I wish you all the best of luck I have found an extreme privilege to be a counselor here in the city of canning and thus far there's no question that I think that I have learned more and gained a lot in being a councillor and I'm doing my best to pay that back to the city of canning but we do get extensive training I have learned a great amount about how to be good at governing rather than getting involved in the operational positions that I'm more familiar with in my work I'm a full-time worker I'm a mum I have all those hats I think I don't breakdance but I do dance and it is possible to juggle your life it does life but if you're willing to give up some of that then I think that it is well worth your time and if you do have things that you'd like to change in the city of canning then I really hope that you step up a couple of pieces of advice in terms of campaigning it is not compulsory and election so what does happen is that the people who are really interested are the ones who are going to vote so if you are going to Dornoch you're going to be unsuccessful in quite a few of the people who couldn't care less that you're knocking on their door it might be better to make sure that you're very familiar with the resident and rate payers Association the local community groups the sporting groups the religious organizations all of the active areas of your community and they're the people to and the groups to target make yourself known now get involved and that's really going to help you in your candidacy and if you don't think that you have the experience please give it a try anyway because there is so much support to help you and everybody who wants to have a go I just really encourage you to do so thank you very much I think we have a fantastic group of counselors and listening to each one of the counselors talking and I know that a number aren't talking tonight aren't here some aren't here and some are here are not speaking and there's a reason for that but listening to those words it certainly inspires me in terms of the future of the city of canning and they've words from the heart I can tell you that we're now open for for questions so I'll be up here to receive them and then I'll deflect them to the appropriate individual but by all means ask a question what I do ask though is that if you do have a question put your hand up we have a microphone because you wish to record the question and and if a the mayor or the deputy mayor or councilor wishes respond oh yeah it isn't just of me it's question of f sorry our special guests to you by the way okay any questions oh yes we got two hands straight up great good evening my name is yeah so my question may be to the Electoral Commission perhaps when is the campaigning we can start as a candidate what is the time or when does that somebody can start as was suggested by one of the councillors you can start campaigning at any time there's no set time to campaigning from a legal perspective the election notice that will appear next week calling for nominations is in a legal sense the commencement of the election period but there is no reason why you can't_''_1594.849 be out doing what was just said mixing with the community indicating that I intend to run as a councillor as a candidate I should say and starting to promote yourself for that purpose yes in terms of what nikki is just saying in terms of any materials leaflets letterbox drops so that you do make sure that you authorize them're not a candidate am I right once the nominations have closed there might be three or four people who have nominated as candidates so you're a candidate up to an including election night okay so your materials cannot mention that you're running no you can't yes that's what democracy is all about you can tell people I'm a candidate and my name will be appearing on the ballot paper and ballot paper you'll receive in the mail that's not a problem okay because I when I rank the Electoral Commission they mentioned to me you cannot say you are a candidate until leave 14th of September so you can say now your intent candidate yes so that's suppose what is do's and don'ts whether do you have a list so you want to provide it they're certainly saying right now that I'm intending to run as a candidate right in terms of being a formal candidate once nominations have closed at that point you've become a formal candidate if your nomination has been acceptable yeah mr. questions or understandings basically I understand there are bylaws about placing things on or advertising within the city and there's a time at which that buy and that advertising can start is that correct I'm not familiar with the specific local laws in relation to electioneering I know that you can't place any electioneering material on public assets so that would be on medians if it was on private residence of course you can but I my my understanding is unless our local law is different from others that you actually can't place them on public assets yes I understand that the city bylaws restrict the length of time that you can actually am have the advertisements in place yeah so that needs to be pointed out the second understanding I assume is the the length of your tenure if elected will be four years is that correct correct thank you my name is Alison I'd like to the job seems to be very demanding and it may be more than a full-time job we got the package but I just want to know is first of all it actually it's not a job in the strictest sense of a job you're not employed by the city of canning you are elected as a councillor to represent the city of canning councillors can have leave from their due as counselors if you intend to have leave you have to be very careful that you do not miss miss three consecutive council meetings otherwise your position of counselor falls wait you're disqualified so if you intend to take leave of three counts of consecutive three council meetings you need a leave of absence from council and that's voted on by Council however you can go on a holiday and miss a council meeting or miss various council forums our advice my advice to you is that if you are away it's always important to inform me and the mayor that you intend to be on away from your duties as a counselor because materials can be sent to you sometimes it can be dropped off at your residence and the objective is to not compromise any information that would be distributed the stuff we send you is now by electronic means to the to the hub as I mentioned earlier so you're not you're not restricted from taking leave this councillor Cunningham um it's also my understanding that we don't have a ordinary council meeting and the month of January right so from about Christmas time all through January is a great time to take quite unquote annual leave however sometimes the CEO can be a bit sneaky and put in place a special council meeting but if you can miss that because that doesn't count as one of those meetings that you're required to attend but sometimes a special council meeting is called for an urgent matter but councillor Cunningham is right it's very unlikely that we would put a meeting on in January it tends to be the holiday period for a lot of us in local government land as well as outside of local government land the money's it this yeah the council meetings on the third Tuesday of the month is the first Tuesday of the month we have issues that we're dealing with there might be around policy it might be around local laws or any major project the second
My name is Arthur Cohen I'm the chief executive officer with the city of Kenya our city our future is our vision for the future and getting so it's the working title we've given to our future plan now future plan is trying to create a sense of a new exciting city of kenning so we're asking people to imagine canning beyond what it is today imagine a new future for getting a future that is inclusive vibrance that celebrates our diversity that invites new business that invites innovation so we're looking at a city that is probably a little different from other cities what I would like the community of canning to do right now is to embrace the process engage with the council engage with other members of the community and help develop that future vision help to promote the city to take a leap of faith into the future a future that hopefully each one of us will be proud of community members staff of the city of canning elected members
Whatever it believes is necessary for its community examples of that on the screen there with sport and recreation facilities tourism initiatives whatever the council thinks is appropriate for your community main bit for for Maiden ideas on roles and responsibilities so here we're going to look at the role of a councillor we'll also look at the role of the mayor and and the CEO and we'll show you how it all comes together to provide for good governance the Act states that the role of council is to govern the local government's affairs and is responsible for the performance of the local governments functions it also oversees the allocation of local government finances and resources and also determines the local governments policies the council also has the responsibility to ensure there was an appropriate structure for administering the local government important importantly it is the council who is the employer of the local government CEO however the council has no further role to play in other employees of local government it's very important to understand right from the outset the role of councillors councillor this includes as listed on the screen representing the interests of the community and as Arthur mentioned not just your ward but the whole community you provide leadership and guidance you facilitate communication and you make decisions really important to note that an elected member has no individual powers the power comes from the collective of a whole council at legally run council meetings the role of the mayor the Local Government Act clearly prescribes the role of the mayor whether popularly elected or not the role is exactly the same and they lead the council as a team and provide leadership to the community responsibilities includ presiding at council meetings providing leadership and guidance carrying out civic and ceremonial duties on behalf of the local government speaks on behalf of the local government and the Aizaz with the CEO again the mayor has no individual powers the functions of the local government CEO can be seen in Section 5.4 one of the Act and you can tell from the amount of text here on the screen there broad in scope main the first one at the top it the functions of a local government it is notable to that the functions of the CEO cannot be assumed or performed by the council an important aspect of the relationship between the see on the mirror is that they'll EA's regularly with one another it ensures the smooth flow of information between the leader of the administration and the leader of the council separation of roles and responsibilities this diagram shows us how it all comes together the council on the on the on your right is a strategic decision maker that plans for the needs of the community monitoring changes to these needs allocating financial resources and reviewing plans to ensure they remain relevant it performs this decision making function it formally convened meetings of Council where it makes legally binding decisions on the left there the administration made up of professional officers that put into effect the decisions of the council and manage the services and assets of the community although there is a distinct separation of functions between the council and the administration great reliance is placed on the ability of each part of the boundaries to progress the interests of the community and provide for good governance we often talk about board like behavior there are significant differences between councils and boards for example councils are democratically elected but there are also similarities which can be seen here similar structure they use resources to achieve objectives etc it's appropriate for good governance principles and practices to be implemented by councils that elected members should be encouraged to develop their capacity to make sound strategic decisions based on board like behaviour in in terms of strategic decision-making this is one we like nose in fingers out which is knife Oh well-known acraman to anyone experienced working with the board the principle of knife Oh is noses in ask questions fingers out do not interfere in operational matters this is a useful principle for electing members to remember and abide by consequences to an elect a member of not observing the most important aspect don't interfere is the potential to breach the rules of conduct regulations and face an inquiry by the standards panel and I'll talk a little bit about that in are going to do when you're if you're successful to council and you're elected the first duty you'll perform will be the signing of this declaration it's an important declaration as it's an acknowledgment of your commitment to the local government and the people of the district for your term of office I like this one too I'm taking office and signing the declaration you have committed to represent all of the people of the district and so you owe your loyalty to the local government you have a responsibility of stewardship to maintain the assets and finances of the local government that is you want to leave the local government in a better condition than when you're elected do the importance of your office as a councillor and the commitment you've made to the community is often stated that elected member cannot wear two hats where the business of local government is concerned you are an elected member seven days a week 24 hours a day and that's the overriding thing you've got to remember you can't are consequences to that and we'll look at the rules of conduct regulations now the declaration that you made earlier also requires that you observe the local government rules of conduct regulations it's therefore important you appreciate and understand the requirement of the rules which cover the key areas listed on the screen there general behavior use of information securing unauthorized advantage or disadvantage misuse of resources you can't get involved in administration relations with local government employees that means you cannot direct an employee and you've got to disclose interests a local government also has to have a code of conduct this is an open disclosure by the organization on how it operates it provides visible guidance for behavior as code is men a code is meant to complement relevant standards policies and rules not to substitute for them really quickly meetings of council so we spoke about the council's in a consists of democratically elected representatives the important work happens at formal meetings with your legal binding decisions and the mayor or president will preside at all council meetings the ordinary meetings of matters of significance to your community so you know you will have issues policy and strategy dealing with development applications major projects annual budget all the range and scope of services to the community that the city provided also also monitors performance and compliance there are a number of requirements and skills needed for council meeting you need to be well-prepared give yourself enough time to read all the council minutes agendas and attach reports you need to be across your annual budget and find and monthly financial management reports most importantly joining the debate be an objective decision maker and I always say prepare to be prepared to influence others but more importantly be also prepared to be influenced by others I'll quickly go through really quickly important aspects of meetings attendance so every elected member have an obligation to attend meetings and you may be disqualified for failure to do so in respect to a quorum a minimum number of elected members are required to be present to come to conduct a meeting how many councillors have you got yes so you need a quorum of six and all elected members must vote unless a disclosure of interest requires them to leave the meeting and no vote is to be secret conduct at the meeting simple majority decisions most decisions just require a simple majority which is votes that require half of those members present in the meeting who are entitled to vote there are some items in the Local Government Act that require an absolute majority so that's more than 50% whether people are there or not and a casting vote if there are equal number of votes the mayor makes a casting vote Arthur mentioned Standing Orders before really important Standing Orders so you have a local a local law or meeting procedure it governs how your meeting takes part takes place it is the rules that you operate under really important that you read the Standing Orders when you're elected to council I actually think there's two things you need to read your nature read your Standing Orders and you need to the rules of conduct regulations because they apply to you quickly talk about qualified privilege so there's no and an elected member of a council so great care must be taken when you're making statements at a council meeting or in regards to the affairs of the local government I want to quickly talk about declarations of interest as it's important we've previously discussed the expectation of your personal behavior as an elected member but there's another category termed personal responsibility where you're directly responsible for assessing whether or not you are conflicted in dealing with a matter before council it's crucial that newly elected members come up to speed quickly and understand the definitions in respect to declarations of interest there are three main categories of interest they are financial interest and includes indirect financial interest proximity interests and impartiality interests a financial interest is a person like is likely to have a financial interest if a matter to be dealt with by the local government will result in a financial gain loss benefit or detriment for that person an indirect financial up to that so I went you fer yep so in in direct financial interest is a subset of showing that you or a person with whom you were closely associated has a financial relationship with a person requiring a local government decision a proximity interest relates to an estate or interest in land and the affect on that land due to a change the planning scheme the zoning or development of adjoining land and then there's an impartiality interest so this is defined in the rules of conduct regulations and it means an interest that could or reasonably be perceived to adversely affect the impartiality of the person having interest and includes an interest arising from kinship friendship or membership of an association this slide shows you the consequences of declaring an interest in respect to the different categories so if you declare a financial indirect financial or proximity interest you will not be able to participate in decision-making process in any way if you declare an interim partiality interest you will be able to participate in the debate on the matter and vote at the council meeting so impartiality is just putting up your hand that you may know someone or you may be certain may quickly skip through this time commitment that you're gonna need to do and then select remember you've got lots of counseling committee meetings briefing sessions reading and preparation and community and civic duties there's a few challenges with time and interruption and those and the like but is good you can meet the challenges you can contribute to the development of your local government community you have privilege of representing the community and you make important decisions I just want to focus on this because it is becoming prevalent at the moment so now another aspect of your personal life that may change is associated with the use of social media many people are active on social media and rely upon it to communicate their thoughts views beliefs and responses to contemporary issues but if you become an elected member you know this will have to change you need to keep in mind our earlier advice that you're always a counsellor for the term of your office and you cannot wear two hats where the business of local government is concerned so many current elected members effectively and they do this by restraining from making negative or denigrating personal comments about any aspect of their role on council so if you choose to utilize social media do so by maintaining a positive and informative profile um I'll skip over frequently asked questions excuse me I've got too many of these reasons awesome training I'll skip over that too cuz either the city of Kenan you've got a really good training program for elective members you can if you really can work your way up to a diploma of local government by carrying out all of that training over a period of time we at well gur are also available to assist the city of canning in any way and thank you thank you very much Tony none of you will know this but Tony is a Meriden boy and I'm Meriden boy as well but I never knew Tony when I was in Meriden so anyway I'll now hand over to Chris the deputy electoral commissioner from the WI Electoral Commission welcome Chris thank you good evening to one and wanted to introduce Nikki Nikki was the returning officer at the previous elections at canning she's also been a state returning officer and has agreed to be the returning officer at these elections so she'll be a key player and I would invite each of you if you're considering running as a councillor to approach Nikki afterwards introduce yourself she can give you which gives you a wealth of information so certainly introduce yourself after this I was going to stand out there a bit more Tony has indicated there's 139 local governments in Western Australia we've been asked to run 89 of those elections in some cases a council may decide for the CEO such as Arthur to be the returning officer quite a few CEOs will say no thank you I've got enough to do and I don't want to get drawn into the the rough-and-tumble of politics so that's one of the key reasons they often ask the Electoral Commission to run the election because obviously we professionals in running elections and also our impartiality and independence and equity those 89 local government elections that we're running comprised 97% of the states eligible electors so it's it tends to be the small size than the wheatbelt and so on who don't utilize our services so we then appoint someone to be a returning officer so where we have appointed 80 NikI's and each of those from halls creek in the north to esperance in the south and all of the Metro local governments are utilising WACC services in terms of the election the the key dates the rolls will close next Thursday or this coming Thursday a bigger part the rolls for the forthcoming plebiscite on marriage equity will close this Thursday at midnight now that is proving to be an interesting challenge for us because it means that there are going to be referendum or serve a postal vote survey whatever you want to call them Alton in the traps at the same time as our local government postal packages the AEC is handling the wrong clothes for the marriage survey postal vote and that closes at midnight this coming Thursday and so that which we can get the rolls to counselors when they nominate so we just we're working with the ABS and the Australian Electoral Commission on that matter at the moment but in terms of the roles for local government elections they close that 00 p.m. Friday the 1st of September we then subsequent to that do a merge of the owner and occupiers role which is maintained by the city of canning with the state role to make sure there are no duplicates and so on and from that we get our postal survey of the 89 local governments we're running 85 of them our postal full postal elections and so that's where the council by absolute majority has made a decision that will run our election as a postal election the other key dates and nominations will formally open on Thursday the 7th of September they're open for 8 days and then they close 00 p.m. sharp the following Thursday in terms of the mail out of packages we will be starting our mail out with the country the remote country locations first so they onwards there's then a long weekend in there as well and then we start lodging city-based local government packages with Australia Post on Wednesday the 27th so by the following Thursday all electors should have received their package by about the 5th of October replacement packages it is a full postal election so there isn't the situation the big difference between a state and a federal election and a local government election is if we're running it as a full postal there's no roll-up get your name marked off the roll and get handed your ballot papers in a full postal election the ballot papers are issued by a post and therefore if someone says I look the dogs eat in mine or I've lost it and I want I want to vote they are able to get seek a replacement vote but firstly we have to cancel the other vote they can't_''_1369.08 be given to those if they suddenly find their package so it's a little bit of a process some people get annoyed when they oh well I gotta through all package which has been mailed to them so that's very important right statutory adverts we do our statutory ads as required under the Local Government Act in the West Australian newspaper the first of those appeared last Wednesday which was relating to the roll close the next one will appear next Wednesday in the West and that's about nominations is is opening who the returning officer reasons things like that so that'll be in the West Australia next Wednesday the I've just referred to that call for nominations on Wednesday the 30th of August that's when that ad appears and then the election notice ad appears on the 20th of September and that's after nominations of closed so we know which wards and which districts will be contested some people will be elected unopposed with there's no need to send out a postal package if people are being elected unopposed in some cases some vacancies may remain vacant in which case we'll do an extraordinary election sometime after the ordinary elections have concluded nomination is open you can start preparing now but there formerly are opened once you've nominated if nominations haven't closed and you change your mind you can withdraw but once the nominations have closed you can and you suddenly decide or this isn't for me I don't want to run in this election too late your name will be on the ballot paper with your profile and you will be out there so think hard and carefully about don't go into it half-baked make sure that this is what I want to do because once the nominations have closed you're in that election the norms closed at 4 p.m. sharp so if you roll up five past four you will not be accepted as a candidate you need to ensure that you have all of the requirements in the hands of the returning officer in the hands of Nikki by 00 p.m. that day you can't_''_1529.94 say I look I'll give you the money and the form but I haven't done my profile yet and I've got to nip down the road and have a photo taken too late will be doing the ballot paper drawn you'll be at this venue and she'll be drawing the position on the ballot paper the first name drawn out is the first person listed and so on on the election day every polling place has to be open from 8 o'clock in the morning till 6 o'clock in the evening and that provides even though it's a full postal election it provides the opportunity for electors who haven't posted it yet no point posting it on Friday it's not going to get there I can go to the council office drop it in the ballot box at the council office it'll also be the situation we some people roll up so look I have to look but I can't find I know what I've done with it I need a replacement those replacements can be issued up until 6 p.m. after 6 p.m. Nicky will be taking charge of that count she'll be opening the boxes in the presence of any or scrutineers that you may have appointed to represent you Ward's each with a single vacancy so it will be a manual count in terms of nominating or go through I won't go through this in detail here if you are not certain as to your eligibility to nominate then have a chat with Nicky and seek clarification as to your eligibility but you do need to be in a lecture of the district you need to be on the state or Commonwealth roll you need to have turned 18 you cannot be the nominee of a body corporate on the owner-occupiers list and run as a candidate you can vote as a nominee if a body corporate but you can't_''_1655.22 be a candidate the you can't be councillor for Ward barely award and decide I want to run as a counselor for the Nicholson ward you can but you have to resign from that other ward if you're still got two years to run on your turn you can't_''_1674.57 be a councillor somewhere else and and say oh if I get elected I'm going to become a caning Council and I'll to have resigned that position there are a number of disqualifications relating to it again if you're uncertain then seek clarification but you certainly can't_''_1701.09 be disclosed bankrupt you can't_''_1703.79 be a member of parliament and there are a number of other provisions I I mentioned before that Nicky will be having some thumb drives or USBs available and they have a wealth of information on them they have including our service charter for these elections which is where we elaborate on our commitments to the various stakeholders including candidates and what service you can expect from Nicki and the Commission but it's also a candidates guide a scrutineers guide a formality guide to give you clarity as to what would be accepted as a valid vote and what would not be accepted and the nomination forms and so on so there's a wealth of information including information provided by the Department of local government enclosed on that USB so have a good look at that your nomination consists of a completed signed and witnessed nomination form 80 deposit a profile about yourself of up earlier to need to be in NickI's hands by 00 p.m. applause of nominations the profile is a really important part of local government campaigning it's what most people will make their decision on don't decide I look 150 words it's not enough so I'm going to start inventing hyphenated words which I've cites the biggest I've ever seen was 186 words and if if you Lodge your nomination five minutes before four o'clock and you knit you don't have time to work with Nikki on getting it down to 150 words we'll take 36 words off it until it gets to 150 and we have that legal right Nikki also has the power if she believes that you've made a false or misleading statement in your profile she has the power to take it out so it is an important statement but it's it needs to be about you what do you believe in what experience and skills do you bring to the table most people and I would recommend you include a photograph head and shoulders election of a chap who was a kangaroo shooter and he was standing there with his rifle and the kangaroo all right and we're gonna crop that to just your head so you might have taken a photo next to Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie and one of they have them included no it's not going to happen now we would strongly recommend that you use our online nomination builder system it's a great process which has been continually improved over time and you go onto our website find the nomination stage and you start creating your nomination you can do that now you don't have to wait till nominations open the beauty is that you can go in there and develop your profile over time you can do it over a couple of weeks so once you've started that process you don't have to kick go through right to the end and leave it to the last moment you can start filling in the form now you can develop your profile start loading the photo and see what it looks like and so say you start filling in all of your details that are required you write your profile you load in your photograph you start filling in the nomination form all that can be done online and then once you are ready to meet with nickey to lodge your nomination you can't nominate online you still have to give a hard copy signed and witnessed to Nikki along with the 80 and and so on one a trick for young players you'll see on the form it says ballot paper name if you your name is Thomas Miller and everyone knows you as Tom then you might want Tom on the ballot paper and that there's nothing wrong with that but make sure that you put the name you want on the ballot paper on form because otherwise we will put your whole name there okay if your name nickname is water and everyone in the community knows you was was there and your real names Michael
I mean that's already a major regional hub but I think it could be there's things that could do better we could sort out the traffic issues we could have a safest city center which I think is on the plans anyway which I find really exciting and I just like to make sure it's more disabled-friendly because we're getting an increased population especially amongst the young disabled most of the time apart from those biggest go to the layer break for swimming and other stuff and the game clock and walking around the river and yogi and you really enjoy about the parts and helping folks a moment is very nice so we like to go there everywhere cuz there's a party video got a spark area for me what I would like to see the city of coming due in the next four to ten years is for the city itself to actually embrace diversity I know we talked about multiculturalism that ustedes no remorse cultural country but they are being such I would like to see so that we feel you know have someone actually listening because they say difference between see here and we control this call from group but we need to have opportunities to actually you know do something within the community to actually be head in to participate yes that's what I'm talking for in the next thing in mattresses a college or a building the specialized for languages which can be rent out maybe a permanent for people who is doing languages and I'll specify arabic because we feel it and we stop taking kids at the moment and we take talking about waiting lists while still people asking to be in even adults closes we like to do that one sometimes we struggle to the place to do it like even here we have only three rooms for only 10 to 12 otherwise we have only two root beers so we can't run more than two classes at that after 12 weeks and yeah we do so we're asking people to imagine canning beyond what it is today imagine a new future for getting a future that is inclusive vibrant that so we're looking at a city that is probably a little different from other cities what I would like the community of kenning to do right now is to embrace the process engage with the council engage with other members of the community and help develop that future vision
Okay thank you very much for turning up tonight really I'm amazed with the response we have around 20 people who have responded to the invitation to attend at this selected intending candidates briefing session my name is Arthur car and I'm the chief executive officer with the city of kenning I'll be your MC tonight as well let me just run through the agenda I think this is where I press this button okay it works as as you can see up there there is a welcome from the man then I will give a presentation on the city of Canon covering a number of topics then Tony Brown will be talking about the role and responsibilities of elected members Tony is the manager of governance and strategy with the Western Local Government Association Chris event I haven't seen Chris for quite a while since my Claremont days so Chris is here from the Electoral Commission WI electoral commission and he's the deputy electoral commissioner and he will be talking about the election and with him is Nikki Nikki mene mene Shelley Thank You government elections and then there is a presentation from the deputy mayor Councillor Jacobs councillor Cunningham apologies from councillor Coons er I also see in the crowd counsel at brown David Brown and councillor Patrick Hall who's waving at me in the distance of a councillor petrichor and each of the elected members will give a five-minute presentation on what it's like to be a counselor and do experiences as a cancer for the last two years and we will open then for Question and Answer at 7 o'clock if we get there at that time so please hold your questions till 7 o'clock and then we you can ask me the mayor deputy mayor councillors any questions relating to the local government and working as local government councilor and then we potentially hopefully will be closed at 15 tonight okay okay Donna Donna's got control over this firstly I'd like to welcome the mayor mr. paulten to welcome you and to give welcome to country and then perhaps to say a few words Thank You mr. mayor good evening and welcome to the the logic people the traditional owners of this land and to pay our respect jointly to the elders both past and present I will also like to welcome is the Kris Evan who is the deputy Electoral Commission a commissioner from the WEA electro Commission and and his assistant here and mr. Tony Brown from Baga who will be presenting to you tonight I'd like to speak about my experience as a mayor for the city of caning my role as a mayor has been very challenging managing challenge or challenging situation most of the time and for the perspective people or candidates who wish to be councilor in this very thriving city I think the most important thing before one really wanted to embark into this position is to ask yourself can I sincerely give time to the people that I am going to represent time is very important now you must and willingly give 15 hours to 18 hours of your time every week now how does this come about the 15 to 18 hours you will be expected to attend two to three meetings a week 4 hours and as new counselor you will have certain programs that helps you learn the art to be a good counselor and imagine if you have three evening that will be about 12 hours and then you will need another 6 hours for your public engagement and for your constituent so 15 to 18 hours really it's basically the necessity so if you don't have the time you are not doing justice to yourself neither are you doing justice to the people whom you intend to represent and it's not fair and there's another important thing is when we come into the council we must not have a hidden agenda a hidden agenda to grind for certain a party be it be the white party black party Green Party red party blue party or rainbow party we can't help it but some of us may be affiliated to certain a colorful party but that is your personal view you should not use that too for a purpose for your political master then is very wrong we are here we are here to serve the so we are all here to serve the community nobody else so be very fair and it is also important not to take this counselor position as a past part part-time job to supplement one income that is a very wrong with you we are here again as I say to serve the people nothing more and how much I do I will tell you the wonderful thing about living in the city of Kenney the city of canning is very diversified we welcome people from all over the world today we celebrate that diversity together in this beautiful city I encourage those from all culture and background to consider nominating for council thank you very much thank you thank you I have a few words to our presentation to make now Thank You Donna and I'll quickly get into it already covered that bid I think it's important too to start off with our future our city our future which is the title we've given to our strategic Community Plan 2017 to 2022 may have had input into the surveys the various forums we ran the't please get on our website and have a look at the the links to our city our future and strategic plan because it sets out our vision our vision being caning a welcoming and thriving City and I really like that vision people always say are the whole vision thing but quite frankly this is a positive vision it says that people are welcome we are you are welcome to caning we are welcome new ideas we welcome difficult conversations we welcome diversity we welcome difference I mean for me the welcoming message is something that we should be espousing throughout Australia and throughout the world in different countries and in different countries they're doing it differently unfortunately in some countries they're closing the doors but welcoming and thriving city is where we are looking at going as a city our city our future also identifies a number of key goals connect to have an inclusive safe and vibrant community grow natural areas where people and Wildlife flourish build accessible pleasing urban spaces that are fit for purpose prosper a thriving local economy and lead accountable responsible big hairy audacious goals we've set ourselves for the next 12-24 ten months ten years a bit about the city of Kenny we're not small we're sixty-five swear kilometers in size ten kilometres from the Perth CBD a population around 90,000 people but that varies depending on the strength of the easterly breeze one of the most multicultural populations in Perth and I'll talk about the diversity in our populations on the next slide the mayor has already mentioned that 40,000 people are Australian Australian born in our population from India 5,500 people and that's an increase of 59% from Malaysia 5450 one that's an increase of 8% UK 5403 are droppin 22% and from China 4573 an increase of 54% that is amazing statistic in terms of the diversity of our community we are not this homogeneous one-size-fits-all community and as a councillor it's something we nussin must keep at top of mind when we're making decisions in our chamber and on top of that we have a changing population in terms of age as well we've had an increase from the last census of 6% a decrease from 20 to 24 I don't know why but that's down 9% an increase in sixty to sixty four year age bracket or 3% and an increase in eighty-five years and over of 20% I mean this is a population that's young and old it's a mix so therefore it makes for policy local government policy and interesting challenge in public policy and local government policy an interesting challenge for us but a fantastic opportunity to make a difference we have 35,000 658 dwellings in the city and we've talked about the population we have 21 schools and 12 childcare centers there's amazing number of schools and childcare centers in the area and we have a growing residential market this is not a council that's sitting in isolation of the rest of what's going on around it so our policies and our actions and our decisions need to be dynamic they aren't a decision that we take and then we sit back and go well wasn't that nice we need to be that are on this city and on the population the economy our gross domestic product that's our contribution to the Western Australian economy as 9.7 9.1 and billion dollars that's a big contribution we have eight thousand one hundred odd registered businesses sixty-eight thousand local jobs and a growing commercial market interestingly in the statistics not up there one in 20 jobs in Australia in Wi are created through the economic powerhouse of canning the businesses the economy within canning not canning Council but all of those people that are working and generating business in canning one in 20 jobs it tells you something about the significance of this area in terms of not just the city of canning but in terms of Western Australia and we need to think of this council as beyond its borders unfortunately in the past this council has only thought about itself in terms of what it can do within its borders but we are we should be contributing to the regional development in this area we're the Gateway to the southeast corridor we have 77,000 vehicles drive down our Bini alone not counting the other shopping centers within within the city I'm not going to go through all the suburbs but there are quite a few suburbs within the city of Kenny and and some of the most amazing suburbs that I've seen I've visited I've spoken with people in those areas it's and some passion some real passion for the area in which you live this is the map of the city of canning in isolation of the rest of Western Australia of course but this is the map this is a shape of the city of canning there are five wards in the city at the top is Mason Ward then we have Balu and they're the raving fan of Baloo Bannister and then we have B Lea and then Nicholson so we have five Ward's now I'm not sure what Tony's going to say about your role as a counselor although you are elected to the wards your role is to represent the community of the city of kenning it isn't just about representing your electors so it wasn't gonna say it's gonna say it now we have a number of program areas I call them program areas because I want to go away from the traditional approach of calling in departments or divisions we're looking at trying to we're looking at creating an integrated approach to our services to our community office of the CEO which is responsible for leading and positively positioning the city canning community and commercial this is the efficient and effective performance of the city and its assets canning environment building constructing and maintaining Cannings natural and built environment and canning sustainable development planning major project delivery and place design for an innovative contemporary safe and sustainable canning their words we want to turn those words into actions and we want to turn them into actions on the ground there are a number of key projects in the 2016 to 2028 I won't go through them in detail there one one I'll cover in detail which will be the city center canning city center we have the Bentley regeneration community hub and Parks upgrade roads buildings there are renewals Seven Oaks Street and we'll support dual carriageways Ranford Road bus lanes shelly underground power ken street where Clifton Park change rooms technology one which is a technology system we use to support the work of council and learning cities which is about transforming how our traditional libraries operate to becoming learning hubs perhaps business incubators perhaps way places for innovation perhaps places for startups new startups briefly about the city center this is perhaps the largest and this is the biggest decision I think this council has taken of recent times there are three phases to the city center all up there's a seventy million contribution two million dollar contribution to the upgrade of the canting City Center first phase twenty seventeen to twenty one nineteen point seven million twenty one to twenty four twenty nine point one million and then phase three 24 to 28 20 million dollars now this is for roads paths waterways trees smart technology to look at the most sustainable approach to developing the city new thoroughfares new roads and new ways of of operating in the city so Association we have with the canning city center to turn it into a Main Street where we have diversity of offer for people where we can attract people to canning canning to stay in canning and enjoy an experience that most people travel outside of canning for they go to Victoria Park for example Alberni Harvick Park if they want to experience some diversity of choices out there we want to create that experience within canning there are a number of events our aim is to bring the community to get together and celebrate diversity and we do that through events and midweek eats blessing of the river Carols by Candlelight pretty much the same stuff as some others do a New Year's Day fireworks will be quite different in that regard the canning World Arts exchange harmony de anza kwa de Kenny Arts Awards NAIDOC week Friday night movies and many more councilors allocated additional funds to these sorts of events for the upcoming year the next financial year in order to celebrate the difference in the diverse in there and the creativity within this community and I the recent art awards but that were held about three two or three weeks ago the art awards were amazing the quality of the work that was done from young people to not say young people from the visual painted paintings to sculpture I mean that was some of the best art I've seen we asked the community in our survey what are the qualities they want in our counselors and residents want elected members to have integrity and a strong community focus they want the council to listen actively be open and transparent and keep in keep and being kept informed and the top eight characteristics a community focused vision honesty and integrity keeping the community informed listened to the community concerns being transparent and accountable reliable follow through on the promises competent and effective and engage and involve with the being involved with the community that's a pretty tough agenda but I think the community has been very clear in what they expect not only from this council but I suggest from probably most politicians around Australia is what they were asking for community engagement is in our case we are we have a few advisory committees we have the community advisory group as sustainability and environmental advisory group and our business advisory group but it's beyond just those advisory groups we need to establish mechanisms to get real-time feedback from the community doing a survey once every two years it's pretty much like sailing the Titanic oh that's not a good example sailing a ship at night and turning your lights on every fight every day once you know during the night during the evening turning a light on once you can't_''_1325.12 do that you actually need to keep keep feedback going actively otherwise you never know what you're going to hit and getting it two years down the track is too late in many respects so we need to establish mechanisms for better engagement with our public and we hopefully will be able to do that I don't intend you to read all of this but we have a total budget expenditure of a hundred and fifty three million dollars this is no small operation one hundred and by a ten-year long term financial plan a four year corporate business plan and annual operating plans so when you approve a budget every year you're approving it in accordance with our long-term plans and our corporate business plan for the next twelve months so it's not you will be provided with as much information as we can give you in relation to making those informed decisions and hopefully with the training that we provide and I'll talk about that briefly you'll be better skilled to understand that but I'm not going to go through this slide there are some priorities over the next year budget highlights in the waste services security services leisure library and stainable caring and for our environment a lot of money has been allocated to those areas I it's not probably I won't go through them anyway again I don't speak to go through this but we have significant assets in this council we have something in the order of seven hundred and twenty seven point four seven eight million dollars of assets in this council these decisions in the council we need to take the decisions for the long term not the short term because if you take short term decisions the failure to make to maintain these assets compounds and therefore if they compound you then face a far greater outlay of funds to bring them up to scratch so that's the balancing act we have within Council the balancing act between service delivery vers as long-term sustainable asset maintenance final couple slides elected members when you come on council we tried to create a paperless office we do that through our iPads that we provide to you and access to what's called the hub which is a area that we post a lot of our agendas and information to you it's only accessible to you you can't forward it on to anyone else you can't print off it it's basically a confidential forum that you have at your disposal there is also a comprehensive training program provided and my predecessor actually did some fantastic work in the area of training financial management governance community engagement planning customer services asset management and economic development are examples of where you'll be provided with training to assist you in the performance of your duties as a counselor now because this is on the public record I'm going to let you know how much you get benefits or financial allowances are paid to you not all of you will take this amount it's your choice as to how much you've taken and the mayor has not taken his full quota either the mayor is paid 47,000 plus 88 thousand dollars per annum deputy mayor 31 plus 22 councillors are paid 31,000 per annum plus you receive assistance for information and communication technology and allowance for that there's a travel allowance paid and there are other reimbursements for quite out-of-pocket expenses that are appropriate out-of-pocket expenses so it's not as if you come to council without any opportunity to receive training or with any our opportunity to be reimbursed for your time but as the mayor has said it is a significant commitment of time I'm not sure I agree with the mathematics that the mayor of time you will be required to attend at a minimum one council forum but you could be in some instances we've had counselors attend three and four forums in a week and that is a significant hourly contribution plus you will have reports to read and they're not brief reports a lot of them are quite detailed with appendices so you know you need to familiarize yourself with them there is a standing there is there are meeting rules procedure rules and there is a code of conduct that you also need to become familiar with because there is a standard of conduct that is required of you as an elected member Antonia will no doubt talk about that I end on the final note our vision caning a welcoming and thriving City your role is around how you make that happen how we turn those words into reality and how we can celebrate the diversity of this community so thank you very much there will be questions at the end so please resist the temptation to ask me one now I'd like to hand over Government Association and he will talk about the role of well ger as well as role of council Thank You Arthur mr. mayor councillors ladies and gentlemen it's great that you're considering to serve as an elected member it's a worthwhile commitment I'm going to go through a few slides with you tonight really focusing on the role of an elected member so what I'm going to cover tonight we're I'm gonna give you a bit of a background about local government generally the roles and responsibilities of an elected member meetings of council declarations of interest impacts on your home life a couple of frequently asked questions some resources and training acknowledging that off has given you some good information on training available here at the city of kenning and then right at the end I'll be around to us to answer questions as well so firstly just about local government this will look at how legislation establishes decision-making powers before I get to that this is a quick snapshot I forgave you one of caning this is one of in Australia and 139 in Western Australia there's twelve hundred and twenty elected members throughout the state representing the nearly 2.6 million population total workforce of local government WH 22,000 people or 15,000 full-time equivalents it spends 4.1 billion a year so it actually shows that caning is a big contributor to that and has total assets of nearly 40 billion again your contribution is quite high considering that great variety of local government W a the biggest local government in area is the show of East Pilbara in the northwest which says three hundred and seventy two thousand square kilometres and the smallest being a show of peppermint Grove which looks after one point three six square kilometres back to local government so there are three spheres of government in Australia the federal state and local government because local government makes decisions about so many things that affect everyday lives it's often described as a sphere of government that is closest to the people of the grassroots form of government the power to make legislation relating to local government is found in West Australian state constitution section to maintain a system of local government and provide it with relevant powers is therefore often said that local government is a creature of the state and currently there is no direct link between federal and local government in the Australian Constitution although this does not affect the powers or operation of local government under state legislation moving on to legislation the Local Government Act is the legislation created by state parliament to provide a system of local government and W a local governments are created as body corporates with perpetual succession and a common seal and to be run by elected councils the act is a general competence power piece of legislation this means the local government can do whatever is required to provide for good government of the people of the district as long as it does not conflict with the existing legislation or common law as a matter of interest all of the West Australian legislation can be found on the state will publish a website including the latest version of the Local Government Act if you're interested the local government provides a diverse range of and regulatory services in many cases local government must provide provide services due to a requirement of state legislation an example is Planning and Development Act which relates to town planning matters there's also a waste collection dog and cat control that that you have to do however local governments can provide under general competence powers
So in terms of removing trees the city is always reluctant to remove trees but the main reasons are the trees are dead the trees are dying or the trees are dangerous structurally unsound we'd always prefer to take some other remedial action than removal such as pruning but sometimes that's just not possible the other reason for removing is if there's a development or a streetscape project which is going to require the road to be aligned or a driveway or crossover to be put in and that sometimes unavoidable the city has a policy now for every tree that we take out we plant two in its place not always in the same place but somewhere else in the city so we're trying to build up our tree stocks over time in terms of planting trees in street environments particularly street environments are very hostile environments there's a lot of reflected heat from the road surfaces there's a lot of compacted ground with footpaths roads and so forth so not a lot of space for the trees roots they're also constrained to be able to walk underneath them so tree has to be trainable provable it has to be able to withstand those harsh conditions so it has to be a hardy sort of variety biodiversity is also a very important consideration and where we able to use local species that might benefit the flora and fauna those would be other considerations in the selection of the trees
 quite often the community asked whether we're representing those views or how we represent those views so we're very encouraging at the city of planning to get the community involved in decision making but a number a Venusian doing that we're very much interested in what the community wants to achieve and our role is a support and facilitation role so we would be looking to understand what the community's priorities are and work with them on projects and programs to make sure that we're delivering and supporting the things that they want to see happening Hanning I think I've got the best job in Australia I think I think this is a physical city that has got huge untapped potential and I think the City Council as an organization is really reaching out to connect with this community and really position Cannon as a very very exciting place to place to be and loot and work I think I found you the most is that I can actually work and I'm living coming so the fact that every everyday I the local community that I actually listen I love working in the libraries we have people for all ages and all walks of life coming in and we get to share in their story system what I value most is because the ducati provide to the community in general I think that the environment that we also provide to the radiances and I think what I did I value most about working here the fact that because my community I've actually got quite a deep connection to the people that live here and the people that have made their home to you because it was once my home and it still actually feels like my home so you know I live a good 50 days away but every time I come here I just feel like I'm at home in the morning and even I was at can enlarge our Care Services Building the other day and my great Nana was that cannon launch so you know and I actually worked in the building actually about 20 meters from where my great man was so yeah coming and part of the community and just contributing to that I've always enjoyed for the being a nurse like to the community service role and instead of being able to contribute to a better place to live and a safer sort of more harmonious sort of community so that's what I enjoy that and about my work I value the opportunities through the community will be most of all it's a very diverse community and working in packs and environment there's a lot of things we can do for the long-term benefit of the community the people probably the people who work in the city of canning are probably the biggest drawing of coming to work every day everybody loves their jobs everybody there's because they want to do something for the community we're all service based areas anyway so that the joys of what we get from from from the guys we're running around the guys who are driving the trucks and go oh yeah I did that I saw this in
Maybe more AthLEAN cultural events because I believe the city around the can he add award once a year perhaps we could have maybe add a smaller event or public art competition that could feel the city with beautiful Alex
I wanted to say thanks everybody thank you very much for engaging thanks for becoming involved and thanks for providing your feedback we now have the foundation to build upon what you've provided to us and I'm really excited about the future of Kenny thanks so much again
Quite often the community asked whether we're representing their views or how we represent their views so we're very encouraging at the city accounting to get the community involved in decision-making we've got a number a Venusian teresting on what the community want to achieve and our role is a support and facilitation role so we would be looking to understand what the community's priorities are and work with them on projects and programs to make sure that we're delivering and supporting the things that they want to see happening caning
One of the biggest and most important things to me in my role and is the feedback we've been getting from the community over the years with regards to our service we've been going since 1998 as an internal Cydia canning security and Ranger service and we've always taken a lot of pride in what we do we've taken ownership of the job and we want our community be safe and secure and I think that makes a big difference with any organization when you compare it to other councils that have contractors and external agencies running those those parts of the business so I think in and it's been proven again and again with with the surveys with our ratepayers and residents that the service just always provides and and and it's a great service and it makes everyone feel safe and secure and I think that in that ownership is what makes the difference yeah
I generally think it's because it allows us to provide better services and a better solution to our members and help us invest in the facility itself and providing you know better solutions and better that are a better facility that a staff better training it's all about providing a better experience that everybody in a suits are just the way things work we have to do that in order to remain competitive and viable for everybody
One of the most common things I get asked from residents is when we're doing the gardens is putting in a different part or hedging it down lower either for reasons that they can't see through the roundabout or they like kangaroo paws instead of a hedge so we try when we do our part order and we talk to them and come to an agreement sometimes it's unreasonable and unrealistic and other times it's great we have the fresh idea so we always try to incorporate it as best we can
So the revitalised canning city center is expected to be a great place to live a great place to visit a great place to be you can expect to see lots of activities in the city center you'll see shops cafes our offices people living there people there at all times and that will be great that will make people feel safe people who live in the canning city center area there will be really close to shops they'll be able to walk to shops they'll be able to cycle to shops and also to the train station so if they want to go to the super city they'll catch the train no worries about cars about driving parking they'll catch the train and get quick city in 20 minutes if they want it will also be a place that will connect the canning train station and the river because it's in such close proximity and people don't see when then the train station that they can walk 20 minutes and be at the river for me it's about creating a Main and have a cup of coffee meet with people conduct business with people it's a place where where color movement and activity vibrancy whatever are created or is created for people to be attracted to we want to have an environment where people can walk rather than have to drive run okay the environment where families can enjoy an eclectic selection of products where you don't have to go to a warehouse or into a big shopping center to have your shopping experience one people have an experience shopping on the street meeting people as they walk up and down so for me it's a focal point an activity area we've got two major projects that are about to take off one is the development of the canning city center and the other is the Bentley regeneration project both of these projects like the strategic through to the obviously so you have to be done documentation of them will be emblematic from the point of view of talking about sustainability and green culture if you like in in the urban environment and so that I think a city that we can be proud of
I'd like to thank the members of the community from birria who participated in the review of the community plan and submitted their views their visions into the future and these will be used by us to represent you at council thinking
 my name is foreign I'm the mayor of the city of Cali more man hi pong Mihaly got Kanaka CJ I'm looking forward for the community in the city of canning to give us what the thing of the city and various ideas they will like the city to implement and how this city can move forward yo vengo a legacy Jie oh ho hey mum rang or Cosima Nicola how you can be more Tito because seek a lady jung kim young fashion I'm going to get more like joy joy we've lived in this area for 50 years we're getting the same perfect vehicle 50 years it was pushed I love it we really willing with it was push the other side of the road when we moved there what do you value living in this area for that matter so that was a great great city just telling the lady that time we were very upset when it was going to be divided and we wanted to stay a soother kind of could he's got good value in screaming gotta round out our area because really mixed it with X almost next to the church down there and the path from that is great that's the great I love them I think maybe more trees climate and plants and stuff is nice to make it look nice the community is such a nice area to live in we moved from a different am suburb because we wanted to have an area which was safe that had so many things that was close to us like legislate from the libraries in walking distance we've got this lovely Park down the road from us we've got great schools we moved for the school so we were the Riverton zone and the Rossmoyne zone I think um the city of canning has got a lot of potential for development the whole I guess carousel precinct or city center you know there's a lot of basement land there and even around our area and East Canton there's just so much room with potential for development and it'd be good to see if the city get the right kind of development and it's um I guess increase the amenity of the area I mean it's already a major regional hub but I think it could be there's things that could do better it could sort out the traffic issues we could have a safer city center which I think is on the plans anyway which I find really exciting and I just like to make sure it's more disabled friendly because we're getting an increased population especially amongst the young disabled the next 10 years moving forward with large cities you have a better dedicated and Culture Center whether currently the current out center in the city needs sort of a purpose-built building that's applied by the city but it does all four years old and it's really small now to try and fit all the activities and all the community activities that would like to happen in there so moving forward if the city could add into the program a dedicated app center so we could have room for example like for an artisan residence and this everyone coming in a college or a building with specialized for languages which can be rent out maybe as permanence for people who's doing languages and I'll specify Arabic because we feel it and we stop taking kids at the moment and we take talking about waiting list while still people asking to be in even others classes we like to do that one sometimes we struggle up the plane to do it like even here we have only three rooms for only 10 to 12 otherwise we have only two rooms here so we can't run more than two classes at after 12 o'clock class yes we do but it's not up to us it's up to you to provide your views your opinions or what you would like to see in a future city of canning we really want to hear your opinion because everybody has got a great thing to say about canning and we want to learn from you please get involved we need your vision and your ideas what you would like the city to be doing for that they will provide guidance to your counselors into the future so I think it's important for every resident if they have ideas what we would need to do tell us because we're building a 3d community plan that'll guide council's deliberations and planning for the next ten years so we'd like your input we'd like your ideas without any fresh approaches that you've got we'd like you to participate in any forums or meetings you come through me if you wish on wise available especially through my email you can always contact me on the telephone as well and one over also the council we just like you to participate I'd like to just tell you that the the counselors here haven't gotten monopoly on good ideas so we'd like your as well engage with the city tell us what you think this is about community engagement it's not about your councilors know about what we think eleven people you elected it's about how you see the city evolving over the next decade or two decades your children and to enjoy how do you see the city evolving that's what we want to know I'd really love everybody to get involved of all ages so even invite views of your children their teenagers even primary school kids we'd love to hear from everybody what their thoughts are and what canning should look like to the future that we can better plan for the future so the community who have submitted your ideas thank you very much thank you for taking the time to put those ideas forward it gives us something to now work with it gives us something to develop and through the development of those ideas we'll be able to hopefully map out an exciting future for the city of I'd like to extend my warmest thanks thanks the community I want to thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you very much thanks everybody on behalf of the city of canning our lightly thank each and every citizen for their contribution and ideas to improve and to advance the city of canning I thank you sincerely you
Hello fellow kenning residence my name is councillor David Brown I represent the belly award in the city of cannon council I would like to encourage the residence of be Leah to participate in an important process that the city's undertaken currently we are reviewing the community strategic plan which informs how we will make plans for the city we need your vision and your ideas what you would like the city to be doing for the community and we encourage you to submit these so that they will provide guidance to your counselors into the future
I think would be great if we could activate new and current areas and make more places where people want to know sort of come together and then improve the connection to those places by a public transport and just have more of a community connection as well
My name is Ranga cannon I came originally from Palestine and my mother language is Arabic so that's the fields which are going here in Kennington and keep your scanning and thank the letter place which is speaking Arabic Arabic language
The community is such a nice area to live in we moved from a different suburb because we wanted to have an area which was safe that had so many things that was close to us like legislate from the library's when walking distance we've got this lovely part down the road from us we've got great schools we moved for the school so we were the riverton zone and the rossmoyne zone yes
Basically the amount of amenities that we have we've got wonderful things like the leadership plants from library that's though I thought start from something small and grow to something big good shopping reasonable access to things but if they just build the relay that would be even better and because the congestion is becoming really significant particularly for people in rosslyn and Shelly we're getting trapped in our suburbs and that is a problem
How I can even like because obviously we're expecting a baby now so maybe even like more packs like top of coffee shops I don't think there's a lot of that around around the city of Kenny yeah so even that would be something nice to kind of yeah make everyone more together I suppose yeah just get it more interactive
On behalf of the chief executive officer of the city of canning Lin Russell and the mayor mr. Paul moon it's my absolute pleasure to welcome you to the second in the series of the canning business networking events my name is Mark holdsworth I'm the manager of economic development here at the city it's more a great pleasure to introduce you to the mayor of the city of Canaan mr.

Burnett salt and our counselors of the city of canning and ditch our chief executive officer mrs. Lynne Russell PSM and all the directors and I also acknowledge that the CEO of victoria park is also here I am pleased to welcome each one of you to the second canning business networking event the city of canning is community our new economic development directory has a focus on engagement and creating opportunities to support businesses in canning it's not only important that we can provide a forum for council to meet with businesses but for caning businesses to meet and to network with each other as part of our commitment to businesses in Canning the city has launched the business advisory group the main objective being to provide a reference point to focus on areas of economic development strategy ensure that this key sector of the community is provided with an appropriate communication mechanism to the city provide strategic advice to the city and in turn Council on issue that affects the business community in canning and to raise the profile of the business community in council activities and planning I encourage you to nominate to be part of the business advisory group please see all the information in your gift bag please note the application closed on tuesday to 12 of april in closing I would sincerely like to thank our principal partner the Telstra business center belmont for their support in our first session of for the businesses about n BN and how you

the 12th of Oprah I'm pleased to be able to say that our principal sponsor for this series of business events Telstra Business have again provided an ipad mini as their business card draw there was a I think it was a red ball that was at the entrance when you when you arrived if you haven't yet placed your business card in that that will be circulating soon and you'll have another opportunity to do that so we'll draw the winner of that and around about 4 30 and can I just advise that you need to be in the room to take the business card that's drawn out so at this point is probably appropriate that I introduce our guest speaker whose reputation probably exceeds the the few humble words that I could put forward but is widely regarded as one of australia's leading social commentators by business the social media and by the broader community bernhard salts regarded as a futurist who uses demographic and social change to interpret how society and how business evolves so if you ever sat through his presentations you'll know that they're always really energetic they're always a little bit edgy and they guaranteed also to raise a smile or laugh despite the humor though his observations or as really insightful and I'm sure that his observations that he gives us today as he as he speaks on innovation and the aging of our community impact and the impact on business will raise some thoughts and questions for all of us please join me in welcoming burnet salt to the city of canning this afternoon thanks very much mark for that introduction thank you also to the city of canning based in Melbourne my presentation today has the the grand title of developing a culture of innovation and enterprise I want to take a big picture perspective of Perth of Australia of canning and identify what I think are the key drivers the tree issue the key issues the key opportunities in this region in this city going going forward I want to start by taking a big-picture perspective I speak around Australia quite frequently at this next slide is the most contentious and hotly discussed slide at the board level in Australia and New Zealand at the moment and there is something that should leap off the page at you and what it is it speaks to Australian society I think and our values and what I want to start with is a list of the top 10 companies in America and here they are victims sorry about the slide spilling over a little bit but these are the top 10 companies in America as measured by market capitalization so it's the number of shares x the share price if you want to buy Apple as a business gdp for 12 months to buy Apple in fact then you have google then you have microsoft than you have mobile the oil company facebook berkshire hathaway of course amazon Johnson Johnson General Electric and the bankers wells fargo and I have also put in the year in which each of these companies was created and there should be something in this list that leaps off the page at you and the thing that leaps off the page at anyone in the senior position in business is about four or five of those were created in the last generation one in fact in the last ten years now we are an innovative creative enterprising people aren't we the Prime Minister tells us about our agility our innovative culture our ability to event invent concepts and so forth compare ourselves with the Americans what are the top 10 Australian businesses and how do they compare with the Americans and here they are now Australia is one-tenth the size of America so the size of our business is going to be you know barely one-tenth if you like of the Americans you want to buy the bhp then CBA Westpac NAB ANZ Telstra at CSL Commonwealth serum laboratories pharmaceuticals if you like wesfarmers persone bullies of course and the Macquarie Group Macquarie Group has only just snuck in there in fact in a previous in iteration it was effectively Woolies enough and the point there is if you exclude macquarie bank the most recently created big business on the Australian continent was formed in 1924 the Americans have created Facebook worth 300 billion dollars ten years ago let alone Google let alone Microsoft let alone Apple let alone amazon let alone Airbnb at alone uber all of those which country walks the talk in terms of innovation and which country presents as being rather flat footed bit colonial get updated bit on the edge of the planet greater talking the talk but you Australians do not have the runs on the board here is here is the the results of that comparison and I think it goes to the heart of Australian culture around innovation we are suspicious of success the tall poppy syndrome and go to America and a lot and admire and support success I think we need a cultural shift in the Australian continent and nation around supporting business and enterprise I would like to see some way like the city of kenning create a festival of creative thinking a festival enterprise what are the best businesses that had been created in the city of canning over the last 12 months wherever I go and this business it could be it could be vulgar it could be long rich it could be meriden as I've been to and the first thing they'll talk about is someone so as a footballer or a cricketer used to live here it's a point of pride why it's terrific why not why not why not showcase business success here is a 28 year old who started a business two years ago and that now import employs three apprentices I would rather see that community that local community showcase and highlight and admire a local enterprise local enterprise business and I think that enterprise energy is probably in this room at the moment and I think as a nation days of a Japanese carmaker or a German carmaker or a British company coming to Australia and employing the Australian people are over we need to create our own businesses of the future the Australian Prime Minister understands that how are we going to created the businesses of the future unless we do more than talk the talk of innovation we should see a top 10 business there that is created in the 21st century the best we've got is about 45 years old and the one prior to that is almost 100 years old in fact so very different the other point you'd said well you know I get services and mining know where a mining country we should have one or two right at the very top and in fact we're good at agribusiness aren't we in fact when you do the top ten list for New Zealand the number one company in New Zealand is Fonterra it's daring the New Zealanders can do this but we did not we lost an opportunity with say elders or the equivalent thereof to create an out of livestock coming out of cotton that then went global if there is one nation on earth that should be able to produce a world-class agribusiness enterprise as we do with mining then it should be Australia the New Zealanders can do it we should be able to do it as well an observation about Australian culture let's bring it back to Australia what's unique about Australia what is unique about Kenny this is a chart you do get access to the slides and very happy for them to be made available 21 at the end of the presentation here are a number of global cities and the numbers reflect the proportion of the local population that was born outside that country so go to Perth forty-one percent of Perth's two million people born outside Perth or outside australia in fact they're migrants so 2 million people forty-one percent that's what probably 820,000 Perth people were born outside Australia go to New York it's a global city an international City it is twenty-nine percent go to London it is thirty-six percent go to it is twenty-two percent which is the more internationally connected city by this measure Australia by this measure Perth forty-one percent as population was born overseas in Canning that proportion is fifty percent of the population was born overseas in fact the only cities had come near it Miami at thirty-nine percent Toronto at forty-nine percent but they're all Americans just across the border it's a little different a little different sort of getting on a boat and coming to Australia Auckland's at thirty-nine percent Tokyo the biggest city on earth 38 million people two percent misery inward-looking cities Paris is actually an inward-looking City twenty-two percent London is an inward-looking city compared to the Australians and then there is the observation that we are a racist notion well how can you have forty-one percent of a major city being born overseas and and still be claim to be racist we are the most inclusive welcoming engaging people for this reason and I suspect that it's because we've had easy prosperity it might be different at a time when the prosperity is more difficult to to a place like old town and the Western District of Victoria called horsham 15,000 people right in the middle of the Wimmer a week belt not unlike meriden for example you think that's probably the most white bread community ever 10% of horsham population was born overseas go to Pittsburgh and it's four percent we are different we are unique we Australians and the New Zealanders are set apart by the extent to which we are eclectic in our demographics there was a time when we might have been remote isolated British if you like we are the most cosmopolitan people in cosmopolitan cities with cosmopolitan values and behaviors and aspirations by any measure show me a city that offers more than say Perth or Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane or Auckland for that matter these of course refer to as a discussion that refers to the great ethnic tribes of Australia that Greeks the Italians the Chinese the Indians you can't_''_994.519 be in the business of demographics and not have cool acronyms for for the different tribes like yuppies and Dinks here's some of first one of the pumpkins p um say cins and I suspect that everyone here is a bit of a pumpkin stands for the professional urban middle class in Nice suburbs you can tell pumpkin men on a weekend they wear polo shirts chinos and boat shoes and you can tell pumpkin women that we're there activewear absolutely everywhere and of course you kill you can tell if you come from pumpkin household if there's goats cheese in the fridge I have this theory that households that eat goats cheese do not eat McDonald's they are mutually repellent melbourne sydney and brisbane and to a lesser extent perth have what is known as a goat's cheese curtain it's about five kilometers out from the CBD and rather inside or outside the goat's cheese curtain I actually think that the goat's cheese curtain in perth sweeps around probably east perth right through perth right through kings park lolly perhaps subiaco down to claremont and down to cottesloe so it's a goat's cheese sausage I think that applies in in Perth then you couple 35 to 45 kids under the age of 15 both partners working household income of more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year metal stands for not enough time to enjoy life and you can tell if we come from metal household if after the evening meal you and your partner get out your iPhone and coordinate the next day's activities and if you email the schedule to your nanny then you're an uber nettle I have actually seen that done of course we make these terms up my PA came up with the term metal I wanted the term to describe that particular lifestyle so I ran the column in The Australian I think they put it on page three on that day with a big picture story two days later it popped up in the New York Times new word dictionary so you really know you've made it when you've invented a new word then of course you have my personal favorite the kippers these are the young 20-somethings that live at home with their 50-something mum and dad ki double a couple of kippers myself then of course everyone knows some lombards lmb irds lots of money but a real actually you won't find that in the census but again the the great tribes of Astra of Australia let's have a look at earth and one of its great assets of course is the airport not technically in the city of canning but having a major impact on the city of canning from Perth you can actually get to almost 20 international cities the most international airport on the Australian continent of course is Sydney you get 247 auckland you can get 237 Heathrow you can get to 174 which is a global city so we might have the ethnic diversity if you like but simply because of our geography the other point when you look at this is well you know this is a this is an Indian Ocean perspective that's your field of play if you like I actually think there was a role for Perth to play in the greater militarization of this region if you look at where the Americans are they're right in the middle of the Indian Ocean there another one up here in Guam another one here just south of Tokyo called Okinawa and the reason why they're there is actually to watch The Joker Chinese I imagine but I think I can our is looking bit a bit shaky so what are the Americans want this is an area of greater militarization rising superpower so what would the Americans who they'd want a base safe secure sovereignly friendly nation for a hundred years 2012 Obama pops up in Darwin Darwin Obama of course he set up a military base rotating Marines two and a half thousand Marines and this we're base for the Americans to monitor and that's good for Darwin I actually think that what we will see is a military base in naval base down here beefed up at Coburn sound the greater militarization of China and also the protection of the northwest shelf where the Gorgon gas project is valued at at fifty billion dollars we do not have any military anywhere along that coast when the when the Victorians started ee f moved from leviton on the edge of melbourne to sail you put your military where your assets and your risk are you had 50 billion dollars sitting off there weren't got nothing I think we need not just the Americans there the Australians there the Americans here and to protect the Northwest shelf I don't think that this is an issue of actually having to fight we are speaking to the region we're putting our money where our mouth is don't even think about it that's the way you do it and that's why we have lad Rick barracks at Townsville battle of the Coral Sea 1942 to protect Australia from the Northeast we are unprotected from the Northwest from refugees in terms of gas and and other assets in the northwest all of that will go to the core of whether you should have faith in earth for decades to come bigger picture over the rise and reasons why you would have faith in Perth food energy resources commodities security hospitality tourism health education lifestyle and an Indian Ocean command center into a project in this place not for this year and next year five years 10 years 15 years 20 years which is why the American president invested three days of his life and calendar to come to a place called Darwin wouldn't have even known where it was on sure let's take this further and look at in fact Perth here is the city of Perth it's the most recent strategic plan Perth is the city of 2 million people and in fact arises it extends from yanchep in the north through to Mandurah in the south's about 150 kilometers and 2 million people are stretched out across a canvas a long thin canvas of two million people and in fact that is going to double its going to go to 4 million people by the middle of the century more than double over that time frame now if you were to compare this with Los Angeles the biggest Western car-based city on earth Los Angeles east to west is 200 kilometers so you can take yanchep 50 kilometres north mandurah 50 kilometres to the canvas 20 million people deliver an extraordinary amount of tax you can have a freeway here can have a freeway there in a crisscross the entire metropolitan area with freeways you've got a canvas of a hundred and fifty kilometers and you got two million people you cannot get enough tax out of two million people to fund freeways and railways at that extent so if you want to double the population you can't physically extend the city you've got to densify the city and so what we will see is another two million people plunked almost exactly on top the great densification of Perth is what we will see and of course that's great for a efficiencies you get more usage out of existing infrastructure like roads and freeways in railway lines and water mains for example the existing shopping centers and I represented here get identification in your catchment area in fact when you were when you look at it that way the other thing say well you know if perth by the middle of the century let's just say there's four you think we're really going to get maybe four or five hundred thousand people north of joondalup we're going to get them down into the city every day what's on a freeway do you need what sort of motorways you need what sort of railway do you need to get that number of people way up there down to there we have a new railway in Melbourne it's called the regional rail link goes from werribee on the west into the city centre into Spencer Street whatever it's called Thursday it's 47 kilometers long it costs five thousand million dollars five thousand million divided by 47 kilometers is 100 million dollars per kilometer we have another proposal in the ovens called the the Metro going from arden street in North Melbourne to South Yarra that's nine kilometers underground that is estimated to cost nine billion dollars so on top of the ground a railway costs a hundred million dollars a kilometer underneath it costs a billion dollars per kilometer we aren't rich enough to come up with a hundred million dollars per is the government's estimate before it's built there was a story running in today's fin review about the Adelaide hospital it cost 2.3 billion dollars when they started it they said it was going to cost 1.6 billion dollars oops seven hundred million dollars more in 1996 I was called into the major projects unit in Victoria and I've said we want to do the demographics of a new project Bernard we're calling it Federation Square and we've got 17 million dollars earmarked for this project you have it done in three years time can you do the demographic that's fine that project was delivered three years late the Auditor General delivered an estimate of the actual cost in 2005 it actually cost 550 million dollars so when they say is going to cost a billion dollars per kilometer or a hundred million dollars per kilometer you ain't rich enough there's not enough tax if you took all your money and left you with nothing to spend there ain't enough to do that so how do you take a city think well the other way to do it is actually create strong regional centers decentralize jobs out of birth to a yanchep to a Rockingham tool cannington the apps create a strong region like a Parramatta like a chatswood like a box hill like a mount gravatt like a term site in fact Perth does not have that it's the CBD or it's nothing as you go from 2 23 24 25 million people stronger regional centers will emerge and these are probably the ones that I'd look at all of these good for retail retail entertainment office workplace education health would all focus in these in these regions let's take this further and high-altitude demographics might look boring but it's absolutely fascinating this chart looks at GDP growth called by quarter over 60 years from in fact September 1959 through to December last year where you have to negative quarters together you have a recession you don't need to know the numbers I'll read the chart with you come with me at a high altitude review of the last 60 years of recession growth recession growth recession growth growth growth growth growth growth growth growth growth growth growth if you had a choice to be a 25 year old going into the workforce or starting a business for the first time in any year of the last 200 years what year would you choose because I would choose that one 1993 because of I was 25 years old in 1993 I was born in 1968 and I would not have known it at the time only 30 years of economic prosperity in the future you have a better chance of succeeding when there ain't no recessions on the horizon and in fact if you are started a business in say September 1959 as a 25 year old back straight into recession get through that 35 whack straight into a recession get over that 45 straight into a recession and you start to think you know I I don't trust credit I don't want to be in debt I need to save for a rainy day if you are starting a business back here the sort of people you are Second World War don't get too ahead of yourself be more measured plan for a rainy day don't spend all you know these people because they are your parents or your parents parents whereas if you were say a 15 year old in 1993 you would have matured to adulthood in an era of unfettered unmatched prosperity there is no 30-year stretch of economic history in Australian history unbroken by recession between since eighteen sixty to eighty ninety if you have over a hundred years and so the people that mature to adulthood Generation Y I call them the Yolo generation you only live once why would I save for a rainy day when the future is always better than the past extraordinary consumption so at the end of that period 25 years later today and who knows how long it's going to go on a suburban home in canning four bedrooms two bathrooms mum and dad both work in fact branded clothing cafes bars restaurants barley holidays and that is just the entry level that is the standard that we think we're entitled to you another recession or do we think that we have eradicated the recession via from the Australian continent well I think there will be a recession I know what it is I've put this chart up at various conferences around Australia and asked the leading bank economists to tell me when that will be they won't say no one wants to know let's just say it's 2,000 18 or 20 or 22 24 at some point it is what do you think would be the impact on consumer confidence retail spending confidence if there was a recession on a people that have never experienced it before because I Rigondeaux to freak them out I think they would panic but we think six percent unemployment is absolutely outrageous hang on twelve percent their interest rates back there were seventeen percent we think this is normal this is not normal it creates an extraordinary sense of entitlement of created a consumer culture that you should be able to see writ large in a place like canning but at some point in the future there is going to be a would make is there's probably I suspect there is no one in this room that has actually managed anything during a recession you would have to have been you know have to be in your well in g.r 60s to have had a management position in 1992 or 1993 there is no one in government in the state or federal this over here is it there is no one that is actually head certainly in government in federal government pubs in state government that has actually managed we have lost that corporate memory and I think it's worth while exercising your minds what would have what would be the impact on consumer confidence on your business if that happened just come with me very briefly to back to the 1950s and see how we lived at that time here is the 1950s here is a suburban home maybe a typical home in canning at that time three bedroom brick veneer home on a thousand square meter quarter acre block so three bedrooms bathroom kitchen so you came in the front door in the porch into the frontal room the parlor and that's where you enter is a good room that's where you had your best crockery you had a sideboard and you might have a silver tea service in order to showcase the wealth and social standing of this household guests were entertained in the good room here is how we live today the house is not a thousand square meters it's on 500 square meters it's four bedrooms two bathrooms to income earners not for kids two kids come with me into the house it come in the entry entry right into the bosom of the house and then off to the side you have what used to be called a veranda but which we now call and you can see the name of it alfresco what is all Frisco we'd have alfresco back here the Greeks the Italians arrived here in the 1950s and 1960s how are you Australians doing living in an English house you have a Mediterranean climate outdoor living and of course we also embrace their diet out with T in with coffee in with arugula olive oil influences who had heard of bok choy in the 1990s or who in the last five years it who knew five years ago what quinoa was who knew how to pronounce quinoa who knows how to spell kinwa it's actually an Arabic a grain ducker is another one you can see these Mediterranean influences outdoor and if this is the new good room the kitchen dining room then I would want to showcase the wealth and prosperity of the household I would want an island bench and I will want a marble bench top waterfall perhaps calacatta marble and then rising out of the center of that would be the new silverware which is tapware with a gooseneck tab and you are showcasing the wealth and prosperity of this household this is nice this is my living style and you would prepare a bok choy in quinoa and ducker out on the thing you would have a six-burner barbecue with a wat burner this is the Mediterranean ization and the migrant influences on australian consumer culture that's how we live today I wanted to talk about retail spending say well over two thousand and five februari 2005 2006 through to 2016 10 years what retail spending trends can you determine over that timeframe and over 10 years to februari 2016 retail spending and Australia's increase by is called sixty percent so retail stores turnover increased by sixty percent over ten years but liquor store turnovers increased by 91% pharmacy increased by ninety percent stand back from this high altitude what are the Australian people trying to tell you through this chart by their millions of small purchases over ten years clearly it is drink and drugs that is driving driving our preferences but again stand back from this don't get bogged down in the small numbers this is lost our liquor pharmacy cafes restaurants supermarket food where was it just hard to make a living in the last ten years ago what is the worst shop you could have bought in February 2006 I don't care how smart you are I don't care how hard you work this is the brutal aspect of business you can be the smartest person in the room you for 10 years if you're in the wrong space at the wrong time in history you're pushing uphill why not get where the current is growing get behind a liquor store pharmacies or cafes think well you know if pharmacy stores are growing so much and I'm running a supermarket why don't we Nick pharmacy lines and stick them in the supermarket why don't we take a barista cafe and ticket in a supermarket you can actually see the logic by which this is emerging a woman's the last time you saw a Generation Y actually buy a newspaper this is a consumer disruptive shift that has changed Australia that's 10 years what about the last five years over the last five years might be a bit different there we go twenty-five percent well actually the real damage was done five years ago get into a newsagent 2006 get the hell out of it in 2010 you probably could have got away with that because the digital disruption has come to affect in the last five years Eric and this would freak me disruption sitting just around the corner that can change the business model what about over the last 12 months seven percent there's a bit of a revival here around hardware particularly bindings or so forth but the losers are still loses five ten one year the winners are still the winners the Australian people are talking to the reduced through to you through this chart they're telling you about their preferences what engages them what disengages them let's take this further and look at where the jobs are who has the capacity to buy stuff from my business in Canning because of all of the collapse of the mining boom no one's got any money actually that's not quite correct you can make a statement in the 21st century the Australian economy has added 3.5 million jobs from februari 2002 30 2016 this nation's workforce increased from eight million to 11 million so we've created three and a half million jobs you know we've lost three hundred and fifty nine thousand jobs in mining in Perth Alcoa in Jalan closed a thousand over that time four plus the mining boom but the point is this for every job that is lost it is a fact that we create 10 elsewhere and you're focused on the death and destruction of one job but there are 10 jobs that are growing I know in my business I am going to re-orientate my business to the happy end where people are confident where jobs are expanding where people have confidence in the future where people will max out their credit card and build up debt because they are so confident about the future what sectors would they be well let it be health care that's 700,000 jobs there's only three point one mil 700 that was at about twenty percent one job in five has been added in health care and then professional services and then construction at the other end of the chart is manufacturing and agriculture there's mining oh that's about 150,000 extra jobs the mining sector is physically bigger now than it was 15 16 years ago never look at the numbers the numbers are boring in trying to tell you through this chart these are knowledge workers in order to participate in the prosperity of modern Australia you need either a university degree or technical training at the other end of the chart this is unskilled low-skilled barely skilled people who are no longer required because those jobs have now been out sourced to Guangzhou I actually think that what this sets up is a haves and have-nots economy is there well actually do these people sit at home watching daytime television and feel resentment at not being able to participate in the prosperity of modern Australia does that lead to certainly them and us radicalization perhaps I want an Australia I want to Perth I wanted caning where everyone believes they have a chance of prosperity upskilling risk killing relocating volunteering engagement programs in order to bring everyone into prosperity going forward and I suppose from this point you know if cannington is to be a suburban regional center with retail and health and education that's the way you would actually build this and future-proof the community in fact going forward another point that technical skills but the soft skills you require if you look at the way in which digital disruption has already worked its way through the workforce you have a number of examples you know the argument is that automation is going to take everyone's job and manufacturing is going to disappear well the self-service petrol has no petrol pump attendants have found new jobs ATMs and net bank versus the tellers bank tellers have lost their job in the last generation film processing photographic film processing I think you have to explain what that job actually is to a Gen Y at the 2001 census there were 5,000 people involved in the film processing business in Australia that job does not exist today those 5,000 people aren't unemployed they found other things to do just as with all of these all of these have created opportunities or requirements for people to actually fit into other jobs the best thing you can do for your kids is to make sure they get either a university education or some sort of technical training we can't future proof your job are fluid a flexible mobile agile articulate then you will find a job no matter how the economy shifts my job as a as a truck driver has disappeared because of automated vehicles what is it autonomous vehicles but if you introduce yourself to these people over there there is a job going on a mind so now I'm a truck driver I will wait until a truck driver job comes along and besides that I don't know those people but if you have self-confidence if you are articulate if you make friends easily if you can see fluidity then you will take your skill set from the truck driving industry and reposition it in the mining industry if you've lost your job in mining industry how could we actually reposition that elsewhere into the economy it is the fluidity flexibility soft skills fit in ability that will future proof your career and you do not learn soft skills at university I think you learn it at home from mum and dad in primary school in terms of being able to fit in and just finally some on innovation we have yet to actually prove it and I would love to see something like an initiative coming out of canning which is a festival of entrepreneurship where you focus not on the test cricket captain that you've provided or the netball team person that came from tanning 30 years ago let go of that and focus on a 28 year old who's created business employed apprentices pays their tax and is a good example of entrepreneurship at the local level knowledge work global connectivity reshaping Australian business and cities of the future where a young vital country with resources and good prospects for the future there is no reason why you would not invest in Australia in Perth and in Canning going forward just finally I want to introduce you to some new research that I've done specifically on the city of canning I've scanned the city of canning metropolitan area looking at every subtle her every suburb every neighborhood every precinct across the municipality area in order to find the city of canning's bachelor hot spot where is the highest concentration by young I mean 25 to 30 45 years either side of prime marital age and single separated widowed never married or divorced these boys are on the market where is the suburb in canning with the highest concentration of eligible young men relative to eligible young women yes you can do this analysis from the census the highest concentration of eligible young bachelors in canning is to be found in the suburb of Kennington in fact technically 1.68 eligible young bachelors per eligible young female clearly the cannington pub on a friday night is the place to be I have in fact done this for every major city in Australia including my hometown of Melbourne and the bachelor hotspot in northern is in a suburb known as west footscray and I have been told that the odds might be good but the goods are odd in I would never say that about candy cannington okay I did this in New Zealand once and it was actually a prison so I'm assuming there's no assuming there is no prison in in cannington you can do exactly the same numbers the highest concentration is to be found in the suburb of canning vale in fact it's still less than 12 18 point to point a to eligible young women to eligible young male is the female hot spot canning vale is separated from cannington by the canning River which I think should be renamed the river of love bringing together the boys of cannington with the girls of canning vale thank you very much all right well we promise you edgy we promised you a bit of laughter I think we got that in we've got that in spades so perhaps I could try and summarize that what's canon going to be we're going to have an inch entrepreneurs workshop we're going to densify we're going to build big houses on smaller blocks and we're going to sit and wait and perhaps engineer a small recession so having said that we do a bit of time now for questions from the floor from and I'm sure that burns inspired some of those so we've got a roving mic just put we'll bring the microphone to you any thoughts yes just call it out and I'll repeat it if you like thank you probably don't new one our question for you better to having studied social demographics at University one of the rare ones 20 years ago how much more influential is the field now in today's businesses and government than it was five ten fifteen years ago is it it is the skill set which you're presenting today rising in society and in terms of it sorry yeah look I actually think I think it is we I think with we're almost obsessed with demographics in australia there's only 20 million people 24 million people across the Australian continent if you're in the business of allocating funds for infrastructure or private insect revert investment for a piece of infrastructure in like a shopping center for example you need to get the demographics right in China yep that'll do there's there's always enough people even in North America there's always enough people but in thinly populated Australia you need right number of people to fund that perfect piece of infrastructure who is some talk about 18 months ago that the census was going to be removed from Australia and myself and a number of other people in this field wrote a letter to the paper saying that we of any nation on earth need to make sure we get it right because we we've got such a big continent to cover with such a small tax base we can't get it wrong and we need the figures right and for that reason I think demographics is absolutely critical it's very hard to find any business that is not fundamentally underpinned by it certainly government administration anyone that's pushing around large amounts of money let alone your own money your asset your business you want to make sure that there's enough people with the right spending capacity in the area to to make it worthwhile and it's also fun you know I think that's also an element of this area yes call it out yeah I am Wendy Wendy Jeffrey from Jeremiah iron and creating that culture but I guess what I see is all very well to have these seminars and get people together and celebrate but how do you actually enable them given the resources to enable them to get from point A to these billion-dollar companies and as I see the biggest problem well I actually think that it comes down to maybe we I think we have an entire generation Generation Y that is Footloose that's fancy free they're not committed to marriage mortgage children or career until their late 20s early 30s they're all educated they've all well travel they all have digital computer skills if there is any generation in history that should be entrepreneurial it is Gen Y speak 20g NY and our organization all yours but they are actually not quite living like working for an eye on business whatever it is or KPMG but what I really want to do is be involved in a start-up they all want to be involved in startups they're all inherently entrepreneurial I think it's a question how you can tap that have a festival of creative thinking once a year and we've got 6,000 people across astro about 4,000 of them are under 30 well got fantastic ideas so feed in your ideas to this program and the winner gets two week holiday to the New York office or something like that and they love it and stuff that has come out of this were the half a percent of half of the centers that make a difference and that kid feels everyone feels engaged they feel worthwhile feel bound into the organization and say well this organization actually supports creative thought and innovation and then there's the festival of creative thinking of entrepreneurship that the city of canning is going to launch I hope or something similar where for six weeks of the year the local newspaper showcases on page three the candidate for this year's festival Enterprise winner and this week it might be a 28 year old bricky who has three laborers started a business works damn hard plays the local footy club you know I would find that more admirable than knowing than 25's showcasing to a 16 yeah I can do that I can do that well look I suppose the economic development people as any number of government support agencies or whatever to actually incubate ideas I suppose I'm more interested in harvesting from the community a mindset shift rather than a sip their can say you know watching daytime thing another's rich pastures you know or to actually engage people so that they feel included that they can actually make a contribution that their ideas are valued okay one in a hundred might work 99 won't work but I think it's the process that actually shifts community opinion around entrepreneurship whatever the Americans are doing it's working yes there's a lot to not be admiring about America but don't be blind about this there's one aspect where they lead the planet and have for a generation or two we can learn just one or two things from that and incorporate it into the Australian culture yes thank you very much love the ideas around innovation there and I'm council apparent here a little bit in the digital disruption space and just wondering what your thoughts are on how local government might be impacted by digital disruption well I think digital disruption will in fact have a significant impact on a number of businesses and digital disruption might be in terms of payment systems accounts receivable accounts payable all that it be automated eventually so all the payment clean how many people are employed by the city of canning you know hundreds thousands whatever it is but the sort of jobs that are going to be replaced by automation and artificial intelligence a sort of dull boring repetitive chops really I actually in see well actually all of those jobs need to protect it one of those people going to do that's a negative view of the future I say thank God for that humanity should not be doing dull boring repetitive stuff it frees humanity from repetition and frees you up to do something creative I don't know what I mean I don't know what those 5,000 film processing workers are doing there were seventeen thousand people unemployed admittedly it makes a difference when the digital disruption impacts when an economy is rising as opposed to falling but you only have to look at that chart ten to one there are jobs blossoming burgeoning around health education professional services that to me is where we need to we need to and have a positive view rather than in a in a Luddite way be fearful of automation and artificial intelligence welcome it embrace it and and encourage people to think more broadly yes I used to be a truck driver up in the mines but now I'm on a uber driver for example I don't know I have faith in human ingenuity and creativity that we will find other opportunities yes just call it out change if you look at I actually think that this could well be an issue for Perth for the balance of the decade so it's 2016 it's not going to bounce back next year I can't see anything like that but it could scoop out and slowly recover 2017-18 19 that's the best scenario I think yep of view although I will say that I think brisbane is particularly hard hit as well I think there's every possibility that the Queensland for the first time ever in probably since the Second World War is going to have more locals leave the state than Australians arrived into the state so I think Queensland is also going strong that is partly offset by the low dollar high levels of international tourism perhaps the sort of things that I'd love to see in western australia is greater commitment to military spending australia and an American transportation logistics I think that would certainly work well in in canning and then that small business entrepreneurship that is probably embodied in this room how can we cultivate instead of working in isolation actually work as a team Oh still play basketball as a kid there's a place there's a point in the basketball match we get two free throws you stand at the line you have a first one invariably you miss it and you're for other teammates come along and pat you on the back don't believe in you imagine if we could have a business culture in Canning like that you know not every idea is a good idea some ideas are bloody awful but don't what have you learned from it and here all there's business mentors Norns mate we'll get it next time what have you learn from it rather than have a go fall flat on your face and no one helps you that that something that the community the business community and the council can actually foster the council can't_''_3536.849 say that's a good business over there go and do it but the council can provide the framework in the same way that like a KPMG we don't know what those ideas that you know 22 year olds come up with but we can provide the framework here is a festival of creative thinking what's your idea to make this business work better and you get a 23 year olds Hank you know you people up there have no idea if you move the photocopier from there to there it would say this amount you want to harvest by creating the right environment any other thoughts yeah one of the big differences I guess between now and in 93 and we have the last big recession I guess is the big pool of superannuation funds and the fact that they're seeking a place to put their money cuz I'm curious as to your comment and in terms of that pool of money and the impact on potential recessions and places to park that money well that pool of money is looking mighty tempting in terms of taxation at the phone but I would love to see a greater investment in infrastructure in Australian cities but I think we need to get the pricing right one hundred million dollars per kilometre for a railway on top of the ground is outrageous now it's great for some people the contractors but it is it's unsustainable if you're gonna charge that we can do this amount per kalan per decade or so as a people we need to fix the pricing of infrastructure but not infrastructure that makes us feel good you foot yeah right but something that will deliver productivity like a railway a good example of this is the alice springs to darwin railway line was it the gun completed just after 2001 it cost a billion dollars you know in hindsight I think we should have taken that billion dollars and double the coal handling facilities about five ports from Darwin from Newcastle up to a point and when the boom came we could have harvested more more tax at that particular time so having prioritized return on investment infrastructure and also making we at the prop make sure we get the pricing right is what we need to do I think yeah we living beyond our means as a country well the fact that we have more debt and half traffic wardens where you on call if anything happens we're driving down really well in actual fact our level of indebtedness about twenty percent of GDP the UK is about seventy percent the u.s. about eighty percent japan has doubt a hundred and ninety percent we're actually quite good compared to the rest of the world 2007 2008 I er living beyond our means and in actual fact you can continue on that trajectory for a while you know maybe for another 10 years there comes a point down the track where you've got to pay it back I mean I think everyone intuitively knows that you can't keep sticking stuff on your credit card and not have it come back and bite you on the backside eventually and I suppose the logic would be well you know if I'm 55 years old then I don't actually have to pay it back argument super payout whatever I don't think that's the right way I think we as a nation need to be have a very honest discussion about our situation where we want to be and about taking responsibility and that certainly means that means paying your way and making sensible choices look the reality is that you can ignore it in the short term just as you can put to one side the credit card statement you can get away with in short ultimately ultimately has to be resolved too bad and I think that is because we were in such a strong position ten years ago just before the GFC minutes cool drink you need any place
I think development has to be done in a way that I'm going to mitigate the heat island effect will happen when block sizes become more three colors diminishes to almost nothing so I think it's important to look at how you're going to develop these high density areas and make sure you've got really good corridors linking every bit of remnant in the city every part plan and make short work of the causal that will work possible
For me what I'd like to see the fit of coming due in the next four to ten years is for the city itself to actually embrace diversity I know we talked about multiculturalism that Australia's you know in most cultural country but there are things that I would like to see so that we still you know embraced so that we can actually pack estate and we have someone actually listening because there's a difference between the mirror and we compare this cultural group but we need to have opportunities to actually you know do something within the community to actually behave in to participate yes that's what I'm talking for in the next alien message
I'm going and she's my life joy joy we've lived in this area for 50 years you're getting the same factory for cookie is it was posted I developed on it we're delivering william with it was push the other side of the road when we moved there and what do you what do you value living in the area for that mark relating to the great a great city we've just telling the lady that some we were very upset when it was going to be divided and we wanted to say a su di cannon could it's got good values to know but I like all the parts from that we put around our area because we live next to the subjects almost make to the church down there and the plants on that is righteousness is right I love them
It's to be able to bring all collective intelligence into the co-creation of the future of canning as I said if the top down approach doesn't work anymore when the government gives you and this is what we are doing we're running cannon it has to be a combination of both serious illness of the community and the local government to you know to get get a good response to the future because you're coming as I said these global for coming no matter when they want normal
Hi my name is Christine Cunningham and I'm the counselor of our newest Ward B Lou so if you live anywhere from ferndale Wilson all around the kent street we're area I'm probably the person who's representing you if you live in the baillieu board we really want to hear your opinion because everybody has got a great thing to say about canning and we want to learn from you please get involved
So my name is Adam Dolan I'm the co-founder of the anchor collective and I was working as a futurist so helping the organization we do to council to make sense of the future and what's coming in today anything collectively to do and April him personally work with I guess helping a people of silicon change both helping young social entrepreneurs and people's posts University and then we also have been organization said today with the inductive suit of time
I think maybe contrary to a few other suburbs I live in canning vale and to me it does feel quite safe I do see for the security cars driving around and I've never ever felt you know I'm safe before so that's quite important and I guess because I live on my own I value that it's also really nice and green around where I live so some aesthetically pleasing
Jesse Jacobs and I representative Mason Ward that includes people may be unfamiliar with that area it is can't in Kennington welshpool friendly a little bit of surgeon so I think it's important for every resident if they have ideas what we would need to do tell us because we're building a treaty community plan that'll guide council's deliberations and planning for the next ten years so in the end of the day it's your tax dollars it's your rates money that is going towards our council so you are our customers so it's important for you to have your say thank you
A college or as building a specialized for languages which can be rent out maybe a terminal for people whose doing languages and I'll specify arabic because we feel it and we stopped taking kids at the moment and we checked talking about waiting lists while still people asking to be in even other classes we like to do that one sometimes we struggle the place to do it like even here we have only three rooms for only 10 to 12 otherwise we have only two rooms filled so we can't run more than two classes at after twelve o'clock yes we do
I think the diversity of it you know there's so many different culture and fries and the various age range and different from my own to being a very beneficial some of growth but also in canning definitely has some little beautiful green box box I want to call them you know places where you can forget for a wall and hang out with my friends
I'm living in the suburbs I'm only what for 13,000 foot but only been an area where I can register 72 bird species this is fantastic for you know in the suburbs and it's just looking outside and seeing dolphins chucking push up in the air or a series of birds just at low tide on the sand spit on apart this is pretty cool stuff for the subways korean about with the city in the background
In the next 10 years moving forward with large cities you have a better dedicated and culture center so where is currently the current options in the city sort of a purpose-built building that's applied by the city but it's over four years old and it's really small now to try and fit all the activities and all the community activity sets and would like to happen in there so moving forward if the city could add into the program a dedicated app center so we could have room for example like for an artist in residence and also dedicated gallery cafe space where we could have yes everyone coming in
How many it's already a major regional hub but I think it could be the things that could do better you could sort out the traffic issues we could have a safest city center which I think is on the plans anyway which I find really exciting and I just like to make sure it's more disabled-friendly because we're getting an increased population especially amongst the young disabled
The project that I wanted has been completed the legislation that's basically why I bought just at the park year because what in building it from the very start and that was the main reason that we've moved in theory because were those children everything and it's time to do the school parts are kept beautiful

So I've just um do a little bit of the presentation before I ask Pam to come up just so that you know how we started through you so we know generator consultants wearing guys trying to take a full review of the city's Karen disability services the objective of the independent review was to receive affection overview of those services whilst also investigating the changes in the industry in Australia torso report on how the care services industry funding arrangements and the changing preference that consumers will affect with you to deliver those services into the future and the focus has always been on ensuring that our community will continue to receive the best possible services over the coming decades which is that so an amazing a council meeting on the twenty-sixth of 84 they've council Ian George proceeding to engage with the community in regards to the findings of history of you he'll settle on here today and is really important to note that there is no decision that's been made at this time the cows would be involved in all the engagement they can make an informed decision the community briefings we had a staff and volunteer briefing on Monday on Wednesday we had our first community briefing at ten a.m. here in this room and this is maybe the last briefing that will happen this is a demand to have another one in the near future feedback will receive will be received over to a fork live on the seventeenth driven at the end presentation of her through with you and you can actually give us some feedback and we're hoping to report to a special council meeting in July 2016 which will the report will include all to community feedback and recommendations there's our commitment hi Karen well-being is the city's primary concern the city will continue to ensure the best possible care for all our clients and residents so questions will be an opportunity for you all to ask questions at the end of cans presentation and when when asking questions please wait for the microphone we'll have a couple of roving microphones if you please state your name away from it fantastic and we I'd like to introduce you to the project team that are working on the review of the care services of disability services for the city so on the project sponsor we have a human resource projects fishers do young then she's at the back there in the lover green approach we have a human resource business partner Justine lovins who actually works the city Robin plus Community Development Directorate she sent out to be with us today and lovely Lisa Bradley's a manager baffling and home so she stole all the cottage communication well this project and die Alison Cenac is our project administrators and so on which make it today so here we go I'd love to hand over to pan out Superman sources GTG to present his theories thanks very much than you and thank you about your time today an opportunity to wear to talk to you and some positive words around collingwood I'm not sure playing along is doing that work very well for us but didn't hear something positive today is the last of the community consultations as ten-year you a little bit of an overview of what was that we've been doing over the last few months a quick overview of what's happening in the edge here biographies and disability industry to put what we've done into a little bit of context and to talk to you about our findings and our observations around services that are provided for older people and disabled people in the city and finding to talk about some composed options as tenure said this time at the end for you to ask questions and tenure and I will be available then animated laughter if you have any questions if you'd rather not ask the questions and with everyone here and just very quickly first my phone is over that focuses just on a GM retirement living services we live across Australia and to a lesser extent and Southeast Asia of zeeland we are nurses and accountants which is a bit like herding cats sometimes but it's a combination of skills that's used primarily to build people deliver aged care services better and also to help people build background and that's why we were selected to help with this review the review itself is tenure said it had three sort of core requirements the first was to do an overview of the services that are provided in disability aged care and time and living for cleaning to do a bit of an evaluation of those services as they're operating today but also to look at how the world is changing in the future in the industry in the way that the government funds in our expectations about the sorts of services that we need and to talk about different options that might be able to help make sure that caning people to provide those services as best as possible in the future and the priority that was given from the very outset of the project was to make sure that I think that the services can be sustained as best as possible that they can be improved in the new world and that new world is exciting and a little bit grunting and this is a graph that's in your handouts it talks about the number people over 65 and the number of people over 85 in Australia now into the future and as you can see that number increases very much over time in fact this changes the biggest change in an ageing population in Australia's history will have more older people than we ever have in the past and proportionately they'll be less tax payers less younger people available to help them and so the government has been working on finding ways to make it more affordable but also to try and make the services more responsive to the sorts of care that we can meet as weekend and all that it has resulted as well and it been a change in ownership in the sector again when the slides that you have in your hand out there talks about who's responsible for providing care and disability services and you can see there in Australia Australia is a bit different from most developing countries we have a very strong representation of the not-for-profit sector of religious and charitable organizations are responsible for providing the majority of a chair which are generally large groups that may have originated from church type Brooks and they created to specifically focus on a career services in the past local government and state government had a bigger role in providing HTF services and that's been reduced there are a lot of private sector operators for-profit operators becoming more and more interested in the HTS sector with a doubling of demand over the over the coming decades they see this as an opportunity to be involved in hurting a growth market and so we're seeing more interest and investment and hopefully coming with that is more innovation and better services as we move forward the government had responded in and kind of bigger changes took place in 2012 they introduced legislation called living longer living better and they were a series of measures to do a few things one was to try and like us better prepared for this be large number of older people that would require support over the coming decades and in part of that they needed to look at ways of shifting responsibility from funding from the taxpayer base to services and so over time we've seen an increase in the initiatives introduced under living longer living there and that has seen a big change in the way the industry is operating as I said a lot more people interested in investing in aged care and hoping to to get access to to be able to have us as clients as we can order the disability sector as well disability sectors probably always been a little bit more directed towards these specific needs of disabled people and that's going through a big change as well with the National Disability Insurance Commission making changes on the way that the services are provided and how their pay for that trying to make them more responsive to the needs of individual disabled people so as an overview actually a disability and the time at leading industry are becoming more focused on individual consumers giving more responsibility for consumers not only for paying for it but also having a saved sorts of services that they want to receive this big market and less regulation is resulting in much more competition much more a whole bunch of organizations particularly in home care services that want to get into it for the first time and with changing on the regulation and allow more people to come into the market we're going to see a lot more organizations competing to get our services and the largest in the first of the changes will take place in February next year so there's this a lot of movement a lot of changes already taking place in with nursing homes with residential here love the home via changes will start to take place next year and for hackin 2018 so a rapidly changing environment and environment that doesn't need to change a lot to make challenges for Australia in the future if we then use that as a context to have a look at the services that Canyon is providing at the moment there is residential aged care services or nursing home services which is provided at canning Lodge which is a 42 bed facility there is H person's accommodations your time in villages to small retirement villages with the total of about fifty large moment communal care service is over 1500 people that receive services through this three Roman communicator hack services provided by the city and then there are day centres as well providing support and for all the people and their carers there is Commonwealth funded home care packages these are the more intensive services that are provided with higher-level care needs they funded primarily by the Commonwealth Government and the other ones I mentioned that are going to be subject to the first wave of change februari next year and then Disability Services the city provides accommodation services primarily at six different sites across the region our findings in relation to each of those services first start with canning lodge and K logic is a lovely facility that provides you know connect us the environment in separate houses services for people requiring residential aged care services nursing home services we found a very positive feedback coming from people that have received the services people that are working in the services the community consultation has sort of reinforced the very strong community views about the service that has been provided by with lower levels of care needs it used to be that we would have hostels but people with lower level of care needs and nursing loans for people with higher levels of care needs three decades later most people that go into residential aged-care have high care needs Kenny lunch was built for loading their needs and while that's a lovely home and it's a really nice way of it's not being tended towards an original intended to meet people with high care needs at the moment because we've got better at providing services at people's homes most of the demand what most people look for when they go to residential HQ is in high gear and so there are aspects of canning lodge that don't meet a lot of the expectations of people going into the future still providing important service now but we'll need to look at the renovation and redevelopment of that service in the future and that will be there quite a substantial exercise over the short to medium terms of one of the challenges moving forward is to able to make their home more modern to the needs of the people that will need it in the future the second one was around the retirement villages again the retirement villages have been around for for many decades at the time they were built they were built for a different demand base and they are relatively small themselves the scale of the villages is small there is potential in the future to be able to potentially increase the number of units that are that along those villages and they are quite hard to fill because they're not modern they don't leave the expectations of current or future generations of consumers and so work will need to be done on those villages to make them viable and also to meet the needs of people in the future the hack services and the home care packages probably the largest program provided by the city again very well received by the people that receive those services and our showed positive feedback by management staff and families that are engaged and benefit from his service it's a reinforcement of how are improved and develop further in canning and just how important it is for for the consumers these services are based on the current and his historic funding systems which are block funding block grant funding as we move into the new age the way that these services are delivered will be at the consumer level and that will mean that city of canning to continue to provide these services on a viable basis but I will need to look at restructuring the way it delivers its services and then we'll need its information systems its management structures will need to be changed to get ready for this new world the world of customer expectations but also have the changes to the funding model a disability services again hi client satisfaction accommodation is a particularly important verb for the disabled it was in the different funding models that are being put forward by the state and federal government is not a great deal of clarity about how calm patient services will be provided and so the city provides a very important services for disabled people and it's going services are continued in the future there will be an expectation that more than just accommodation services are provided and most of the that will take place in the disability sector will be trying to provide a holistic service so that a dessert disabled person will receive a myriad of different services to make their lives I have the full potential that it can be so having a valuation the services that the city is provided and having a look at the strengths and weaknesses that each of those services can in the context of a changing environment we've provided the counselors with three core options three different ways of approaching it again these options are put forward with the idea of making sure that the services can remain and improve not only because we have more people coming through the system but because we're becoming more demanding the sorts of services that we're looking for there were three main options on how serves might be delivered in the future none of the options suggest that things can continue us as they are and there will be first option is around improving and enhancing the services that can in provides internally and that would mean reviewing and restructuring the systems and the processes for delivering care services into the future the second is around looking at focusing primarily on the home care services and to look to get another organization to run the nursing home and the retirement villages and the first one then third one is around looking to rejuvenate improve and expand your services in partnership with another organization that specializes provision of care for the elderly I'll just take you through each of those through three options and talk about how they might impact on D on the community so the first one is around looking at the internal processes looking at how they can be changed with indicating within the city to make them more efficient that will be a need to be more competitive in to deliver the services at lower costs at greater efficiency for consumers in the future as I mentioned at the beginning will be a lot of competition for services in the future there will be a in the future that will be trying to get as much business as they possibly can and because consumers will more and more have the option of going with the provider of their choice canning needs to be really competitive to make sure that it compete and then expand its market into the future that requires a lot of investment in resources and systems an actual that the city can be competitive and actually deliver in accordance with the grant guidelines it's not in a position to do that at the moment and because these changes take place progressively particularly from februari next year you need to move relatively quickly if this is the option that's that's preferred it also requires that the city will need to find the resources for the eventual renovation redevelopment of the retirement villages and the nursing homes and that will require substantial idiom tens of millions of dollars and these are things that need to be started to be planned now there may be some disruption as there's the city the city went to go about record dating and restructuring conclusion of that the services would be competitive the home care services would be competitive and the retirement village in the nursing home would meet modern standards and still meet the needs of the community into the future am I not letting everybody know thank you so option two is to look at finding another organization to deal with the most expensive changes about modernizing the nursing home in the retirement villages and to look to have that organization work on that side and for the city to work on improving the home care services so what this option will do is if we take out the most capital intensive component of it and probably the area where there's the most demand and the most interesting residential aged care and retirement living and allow the city to continue its largest service which is around it spits hacking disability program how this may impact the community selling the assets to fund the infrastructure means that it's potentially more affordable for the city because there's a lot of demand for HTM retirement living services that be a lot of that could be used to reinvest in the home care services that would mean in the city when the name those assets anymore someone else would be responsible for operating and running them there also would be some potential still be some potential disruption and services because most of the resources would still go into the into the climate care services and disability and there could be some disruption in that at the end it couldn't push the city in a position where it could improve its home care services and expand them into the future and that would be the outcome that would be sought under action to and the final option is to look at improving and expanding the services in partnership with another organization and so that would involve having one of the larger organizations most likely that charitable organization work with the city to help manage operate the services based on their experience and expertise a lot of these organizations as I mentioned at the beginning were created to provide an aged care retirement and disability services and would be working with them to transfer to retain some asset assets and continue to control them but to really work with another larger organization that's specifically created to deliver these services the positives are that it does create an opportunity for the city to remain active and involved in delivery of the services without putting as much on ratepayers and it does create at the potential to work with an organization that's more specialized in providing these services again you run the risk of having some transition issues because a lot of their management systems and processes would be introduced and it would be a potential disruption for the services and it would result in aspects of control being taken away from the city the overall objective at the end of it is to improve and enhance the services with an organization that was created just to just to focus on on these areas so they were the three options that were put forward in summary they are essentially the city going alone and continuing to to work to change and transition its services and try and remain competitive in the future the second the nursing home and their time villages and the third one is to partner with another organization and that other organization would be responsible for the management of the most of the services that are provided by the city of the month and so that concludes the options before I go through Justin where to from now just got a couple of slides it's we're opening up a whole new viewer we would love to hear any feedback that you would like to be the so please raise your hand and when we give me the microphone if you could state your name and address that would be fantastic okay who's first up the back there thanks thanks if you have money store and the greens candidate for tagging and I think the presentation can I had one concern I think we share the same concerns you mentioned that there was little transparency or those little wave understand what federal funding for each can look like and that was perhaps one of the drivers or this study around was killing lodge which is a successful facility um government could do to improve its value its transparency or its commitment to the citizens in each camp thank you yeah it's a dangerous person to ask because if we do a lot of advocates you were ever mean one thing that would have been good is not taking two billion dollars out of the funding for is too late here last week that would have been really really helpful for those of you who don't know that the Commonwealth announced changes in its budget to save me and against all the things that we just talked about an aging population and all the challenges associated with making sure we deliver the best possible care though they pull to two billion dollars out of the budget so that we've benefited our and some it's something that would love to get your support on I think having said that I think some of the changes that have been put forward positive in reducing the level of regulation in presidential interview I think can launch has been a great success story it's it's nearly always full really warm friendly environment and its staff a multi-skilled and you can see that their compassion for the residents part of the problem that that we do have as I mentioned before is for the next generation of people wanting to use those services they need a different physical form then then canyon lodge and I think making sure that we have as much flexibility to help develop and redevelop climbers like any large would be a great assistance from from federal local end and state government get off my soapbox it's very many thanks hello my name is robin and I'm here with my mom Joan he lives in rosslyn retirement village as you can understand that lots of elderly in there there's ripples of fear running through the village I'd like to know how the fears are going to be managed for these people who often have difficulty speaking up for themselves I guess what they're looking for is reassurance that things will either be the same or they're going to be managed that they have a better environment so if somebody be engaged for this process I think that would be really helpful I might just a dress and a part of that complaint is people within retirement villages that have played an entry contribution are protected by the retirement village is acting in Western Australia which guarantees elements of 10 years so that the villages that they have a right to live in their in their units and so what would ordinarily happen in a in a renovation or a redevelopment process is that the residents would be offered and similar or better accommodation while the villagers are redeveloped if that's what the operator decides to do the two villages have queer elements but and they are getting dated it's getting difficult to learn to find people interested in moving into the into the villages and so the needed some stage for all of these sorts of accommodations to the upgraded and improved is important other people that are in the villages at the moment have protected under state law good morning everybody my name's bill police Miley whipped up 107 million 11-year Riverton this is a first and get an answer our metropolitan city council's town and city council's moving into out of retirement villages and age personal care generally around Australia and particularly in Western Australia most of the Metropolitan municipalities have moved out of operating or owning a chair in the time leading so probably is why they are moving out of it is the cost of learning these facilities I have given you an example cuz I've been involved in it the city of South birth but Carlo retirement villages they're having a hard time reaching out the original first group of retina retirement villages I just counted them out because one day like dog boxes that were very early built over 25 years ago and people standard is changed people today one at least two to three bedrooms on sweets all the fledglings that we ever had as kids they want them now the modern person wants them it evenly their retirement villages and the way to do this it's going to cost millions and millions of dollars so there's the big problem with the city there's the home Pierce side of us what goes on in the district the city provides the facilities of gardening and lawn mower and internal housecleaning to me I don't see that as a big problem I think the city to just sit Baker that's it there for some years because I don't think that's a bowl of the city but I think the retirement village of our care is going to be the biggest the city will have in the next 50 years buddy up the back is cold I live in parkwood it concerns me the fact that there are plans to deregulate the mr. with deregulation comes a lesser degree of transparency and accountability and with that group is going to audit that the money flow to the end user and what sort of watchdog situation or complaints process will there be for people to challenge their package and also with deregulation to who is going to be the final person to make the decision when disability chronic health care age overlap because I can see a situation where each sector wants I think as an observation is sorry if we see a lot of that particularly between state and federal government and people at the higher level of acuity we sort of have a lot of people in hospital it not necessarily because their secret because they're all in because it's hard to find accommodation in suitable nursing homes on with disabilities side of things and the checks and balances it depends on the services are provided in it and it's a complicated but if I go to simplify it just in my own need on the one side there's much more focus on individuals having individual budgets and being able to ask the provider to allocate those services in the different areas based on the on the package as you described it that they have that process is is audited by the funders and then for most large aged care providers they're subject to external audits as well from accounting firms to make sure that the mates being used as best as they can tell that the money's been used as as well as with deregulation and it's not coming it's already here so it's happening progressively during the kind of in the middle of it at the moment there are some risks that that the deregulation means that the darling of the is the crossing of the T's and the control of money can sometimes be lost and I guess that the the government's hope and I'm not speaking for the girl that the government's hope will be because there'll be lots of different people competing for our business in the future that will have the option through a less regulated process to change providers if we don't believe what we're even what we're getting is the best it can be hi I'm Helen and medicine and I live in winter and yes I'm a bit worried about the option to which was privatization of the of the services because then city of cannon would have no responsibility whatsoever in what's happening and the option three is well being in a partnership this is not quite a good idea and for me I think the best option would be to Presidio planning to do trying to find a way because if it's within Syria of canning it's like a big family to keep it small and keep it within whether we start delegating to other people nobody would be responsible and with the privatization of those companies trying to compete against each other the service would go right now and quality in all in all the services okay that's my phone thank you I'm hi I'm step Jackson from the militant Progress Association as we've been talking people in our area a lot of people of phrase that they need more services in relative and particularly villages in militant we're a very large suburban we have a lot of people who are interested in staying in our suburb as they get older so my question is out of the three options which do you think is going to have the biggest potential for allowing for more services in the different areas around the city I do understand the comments that were made group that is a risk but in the likelihood of another larger group with special skills in developing time living in aged care services it's more likely that we have a partnership to create more opportunities for more old people under the third option approve of patterning is a professional provider hi my name's Glen Campbell I live in package label so this is a this is a matter that affects a huge number of people in our community not just the enormous number of clients that access these services whether it be in the aged care or open care or disability sector but also their families and the people that care about them there's also hundreds of employees and volunteers that are also affected by these changes and I think what most people want to see is some certainty so I guess I have two questions one has ansel made the recommendation of which of the options that is putting forward or do you have a preliminary view of which option the city could pursue and how can the sea make an informed decision on these be in the future with the changes that are upcoming and the opportunities of whether or not there are organizations out there to partner with and the sort of costs that those sorts of models will result thank you so on the first question and the options are being considered by the council at the moment and the decision that the council will make will weigh up a series of different things part of them will be around the enormity of the reforms that you described but most of it as I understand will be weighted towards the best interests of people within cane and so our work will be finalized when the council's had an opportunity more questions about the options and so there's been no final decision made yet the second one around certainty on the reforms and the funding streams some of the detail around that that is is not certain but we do have a lot of information broadly about how we expect it to roll out it's that this time it's happened in Australia that we move towards this less regulated help get an understanding of what normally happens in this environment so I would disagree that was the level of certainty that we mentioned then the council has also asked for high-level costings around the financial impact of the different options and I expect that as they get returned more narrow towards a decision they want more specific information on financial consequences of the different approach that their priority has always been thus far that the highest priority has been around making sure the most possible services and the best possible services are available for the hdcam any more questions or comments so fighting Whitehead Queens Park just a quick question the budget was on when the third but the council met in a thought to discuss this up and get your console so was there any prior knowledge of the budget and no no I mean most of what we heard in the industry that what was likely change funding was numbers around half a billion dollars you know I gently introduced around the indexation of subsidies in for estimates which was over 40 years not only depicted the of the funding instrument was wrong so that they actually their actual cuts according to our nurses was 350 million too much and we had no we had no knowledge that they were going to cut that hard what the domain get their numbers wrong yeah well I'm hoping I'm hoping it becomes more of an election issue and to be perfectly frank with yawning in some ways it is it has been hard to make a gym more important subject because most of us are in denial about our own aging it's hard to get encourage people to take a greater focus of it but because we're all aging now so many of us going through the system unplugging and that the politicians see this is just such an important aspect and we need to make sure that we get the funding right balance between what we had to pay ourselves and what we need and taxpayer support with hi my name is Lizabeth received your home care packages I have cancer and he has a lung disease so the packet is set up so now we're back okay we don't have met up self-funded retirees we we live for lunch fortnight so all I see in a lot of this is Don science and that is freaking me out so can you ask answer me a question how much is across going to be or do you not have any idea oh you know so right I'm not the only factor in this room surely I know that people want to know you know because if it goes up anymore I have to cancel her since simple reason that we cannot afford it yeah just a couple of things to clarify and so these are not my programs I don't represent the government I've just here to know you've got the changes taking place are taking place the only element that I can present on this beneficial position of the council which is never been about the dollar signs has been completely about making sure that people like yourselves and your husband have access to the best possible care that they can give me 10 he only gets costing us quite a bit of a look at these statements there's rudder in construction fees and we're getting paid we're getting charged something like 21 the day I think it is and he only gets two and a thousand a Wednesday so how could that be correct and that city of Katie probably there's not gone as I said I'm not here to reflect on on the government's policy on that all I can tell you is that this process that we've been involved with as being to make sure that people in canyon get the best access and services in the most efficient way so really we still have to wait to find out the reasons I know so the funding programs with a relatively certain so we do know the way that the funding will roll out in the future and painting has no say in that it's a question of whether or not painting is responsible for delivering those services for you and your husband or whether or not they do so in partnership with another group so anyway they could go up so I'll have to be similar to cancer yeah oh just broadly speaking it doesn't make a big difference as to from the city's perspective generally the government will subsidize and support people if they don't have the money to be able to do it themselves part of the focus of the changes that we talked about today is to find out if people have the money themselves if they had income or assets themselves more and more of us will be required to use those assets to pay for care so that the financially disadvantaged have the access to the limited taxpayer funds that's part of the weight of the program is intended to roll out so this discussion is about this city in the best position to make that as efficient as possible and as appropriate as possible for the needs of your husband than yourself or are you better working with another organization that specializes in those services to make it better and efficient okay it really isn't an answer anything possibly not but what we and we'll put you in touch with their manager care services our emotional you may be able to help if you're going to be able to answer my question about one raising it actually turns on the back up on the bow I actually live in boring but this particular debate you talked before about people being hospital waiting for residential care sometimes people in hospital waiting for services in the home but they aren't enough hours they are important and we can talk to you provide counsel to central and get about protection to reduce a piece but these particular services now save hard care package but one time used to be about 20 hours 19 notes but now we're looking at eight nine and ten hours which when people have complex needs aren't you so that really concerns me because you know not everybody you know it's got lots of money or assets to sell but these people are still in need I am not quite you need to be yet but I actually have to wonder and for my parents and it's all right I didn't know about the two million or two billion dollars that the government's taken out this is an aging population and yet here they're taking money out and then they say the one hand those husbands are being built with people I can't move and I don't see quite the logic of one or part of the organization of the person talking to the other and actually trying to balance these things I understand you're going to probably answer my questions so I won't answer the question but I'll just a group of human and just give you the example so want one of them that you mentioned around people staying in hospitals either waiting for transitional care or waiting for care in a nursing home one of the only yeah and waiting for very quaint care packages that would allow them to go back to their homes but feel safe and and cared for and one of the challenges that we have is the state funding of the acute sector and the federal funding of the hospitals which costs the taxpayer probably 11 hundred dollars a day one thousand dollars a day compared to being in a nursing home bed at 250 s part of we have begun different layers of government don't don't talk to each other and I also find it that frustrating the vast majority of us would rather stay in our homes then go into into a nursing home and that's becoming even stronger within us so being able to find a system that delivers services efficiently so that we spend less time on administration and more actual contact hours so that we can fulfill I wish that we all want to stay at home as long as as as humanly possible and I believe we're going to get better at those services and every part of the environment that will move into in in the coming decades is going to make providers of compete with each other to give you that maximum possible time that in the meantime it's expensive to deliver those services we're living much longer and the things that used to be home with them very much more so it's very complex to deliver a lot of the care services but I think we'll get better at doing those services particularly if different levels of government talk to each other the other thing that came to my attention the other day was that we talked about changing I was talking to a half of our choosing better ten year and actually go to change and you were saying that it's not going to be there's gonna be no how there's going to be I know you already go through the boxes does that mean so they're going to be care packages of like one which is very similar that back anyway to their all the hack which going to be awfully that what you met okay yes sir though amalgamates between one care program come on a program and the hack program unconvincing from 2018 the network that will continue progressively but it doesn't mean there won't be hacked type services in the future they'll just all be bundled together again instead of Commodore funded program to do exactly the same thing they'll be amalgamated and hopefully find fusion sees within many so that those maintenance services and those logo level or lower intensity hack programs can continue to be viable yeah yeah so there'll be more of an assessment of us as individuals to determine what our level of needs are whether or not we need domestic support with only we need assistance with activities of daily living or whether or not we need clinical support more medical type support and then the packages will be a line based on that that level of need but then also they'll be looking out at us as individuals and sort of say I know that mary has no financial means tenure might have financial means and so what they will do is that if tanya has the means to pay for more of it herself she will be asked to pay for more of it so that this taxpayer available bubbles can compel barrier so that's the other plants the other balancing act that they'll try and do in testing and stuff well that'd be part of this try and make get that double dipping in that inefficiency out of the system where the remote is going to be successful I don't know so thank you everyone a big round of applause if you have any further questions there's lots of stuff here came or possibly need to be here for about five minutes or so if you'd like to us but I'll just finish off just to couple of slides to let you know where to from here okay so all this information from the community forum on Wednesday in the one today will be available there's a copy of the presentation

the end of the presentation and Mickey that'll be lovely um okay start my little presentation sorry to someone else for one okay so just a of disability services review we know Gary 2015 answer strategic or engaged by the city to undertake for you those two areas the objective of the independent review was to present a factual overview of the city's aged care disability services whilst also investigating changes in the care industry in Australia and also to report on how the care services industry funding arrangements and changing preferences of consumers will affect the city's ability to be able to deliver those services right now and into the future so they're making some big changes the focus has always been on ensuring that our community will continue to receive the best possible and high fiber services over the coming decades that's present so the service is included in the age Karen disability review our all those so we didn't have that on our presentation on monday so we popped out in just so that you know that the review is inclusive of all these service sites so they've got counting larger residential aged care accommodation our retirement living room soon and rosalyn retirement villages our independent living home and community cares I think currently receive approximately fourteen your dollars in that area the services including domestic and home and garden maintenance and there's a lots of other different services I think it's about 10 cm starts in the heck area our home care packages which we have 125 our meals on wheels or our transport services we have a community of visiting service we have three day centres we have a regional assessment service and in our disability services area we have very respired supported accommodation and school holiday programs I mean you actually do it from them yep an excellent there we go so at the council meeting on the 26 that April council officially received a report and that was the endorsement that they made that the city to imagine the community here in regards to define as if the review it was overtaken it's important to note that there's no decision that's been made yet the council we will be involved in all the engagement activities to gain as much information as possible before they make a decision proposed a Monday over at riverton lesion flex today is our first community briefing and thank you very much for coming along and again on the twenty first of may which is Saturday here in this same room with eleven o'clock we'll hold another community briefing feedback and I'll talk to you about that at the end of the presentation feedback we received up into a fourth-year my 17th of june and I'll talk about the ways give us feedback and we're hoping to put a report to a special council meeting probably towards the end of july and that will be inclusive of all that feedback and recommendations for the council to make the decision this is our commitment client care and well-being is the city's primary concern the city will continue to ensure the best possible care for all our plants and residents okay I just like to introduce you to them we have another project team working on this project on the project sponsor I'd like to introduce you to do Mila Marcia boost up with us on friday Gianna Gianna Indiana we have a human resource business partner Justine lovins is employed by the city of works in the community development area looking after approximately a hundred stuff and doesn't wonderful job we have Lisa Bradley our manager of marketing and comms here at the city so she's put all the communications plan together for this project and we have Diana sunette who's our project administrator their shoes in the front so that's the team everybody okay so in terms of questions they'll be an opportunity to answer questions at the end of the presentation and we will we will have some roving mics for you and we will ask you to state your name before you actually nice the fishermen and we were actually video are you this so that lovely gentleman over there in some during the video in the briefing it will be filmed and uploaded on the city's website for those people that are unable to make form and we're also had a couple of phone calls from Monday where people have actually said that they can't attend and we're more than happy to send that out that's not a problem so easily great pleasure now to introduce you to pair Mansell finance or strategic and feel go through the five mins of the review please welcome him good morning everyone Thank You tenure and great to have the opportunity to talk to you today I held that proceedings a little bit today I took a left on painting highway instead of manning road for about the tenth time so apologies for signing things down a little bit today I have sorry Lisa yeah there we go today I was going to talk through a quick on introduction on on who we are and tenure spoken about the project's scope I just wanted to summarize it a little bit to give a little bit or backgrounds of the work that we've done I wanted to give you an overview of what's happening in the industry at the moment programs and services for older people and in retirement living and disability and then talk to you about our observations and our findings about what an opportunity to talk about what needs to be done and what can be done in order to make sure that the city fulfills its objective to provide the best possible services in the city okay and personally just about us I think you've got the summary their answer strategic is basically a firm knows accountants and our job is to help providers of aged care and retirement living services to improve the way that they deliver services and make sure that they say around in the long term so most of our work is in australia new zealand and in Asia is that area emergence so that's our background and why we were asked to come and help with this project the scope has tenure said had three primary components the first one was to do review of the HK overtime and living and disability services and second was to having had to look at the services to think about all the changes that are taking place in Australia at the moment in the reform process we're about to talk about and then to come up for the council to decide upon to try and make sure that our services are not only kept but their expanded along with an a large number of people looking for the services the first one is an overlook of the industry and you'll have seen different versions of this graph what it's showing is the number of all the people coming through in Australia and the number of other people that are coming through in the future and we have a rapidly aging population in the 1930s the number of children that were born over the next couple decades increased substantially and more after the Second World War and what has happened is we have a large number of people that are coming through roundabout the same time over the next 20 years and what tends to do is it puts a lot of emphasis on making sure that we can deliver services for the many more people that are going to require services and what it also does is that group of people have much much higher expectations for high quality services and making sure that services that are provided are relevant to the needs of the people that will receive them in the future on positive side as well is that it's also encouraged a lot of people to want to move into the aged care in retirement living sectors to really focus on this as an area for investment in Australia most of those organizations are not-for-profit organizations their charitable groups large charitable organizations and their sole purpose is to provide the best quality services that they can to all the people this one you probably means if you go outside like mine you'll need to refer to your handouts but basically what it's showing is at the changing ownership of these services across the country as I said most of the HK over time in building services from Australia are operated by private operators generally charitable organizations and we're seeing an investment from for-profit private sector operators as well local government and state government used to have a big role in providing aged care services historically but since these groups have emerged and the funding systems have improved a the government has had to respond to these changes we have a system where there are fewer number of taxpayers to provide a greater number of consumers and what the government dealing in 2012 was introduced a series of her films they are changes in the way that we provide services and fundamentally what these services do is that they seek to make better efficiency in the way services are delivered so rather than giving big blocks of funding that providing individual budgets for the people who use the services and unfortunately when they asked to pay for more of those services ourselves when historically when there were a few a number of all the people requiring the support we could afford to have it more taxpayer funded increasingly that's going to have to be paid by us as we use those services moving forward so there's been a major change in the way services are to be delivered and the biggest changes take place in February next year where we move from a situation where the government controls supply to releasing that supply so that consumers can want to deliver those services retirement living and disability as well in your handouts there's a brief summary of some of these changes there but they are very consistent we're moving into an environment where we have much more focus on the individual the individual is also more responsible for choosing the people we provide those services next slide please and the next one and that makes it very very competitive and so lots of aged care providers in Western Australia at the moment looking to get as big as they possibly can if they can achieve that scale they'll be able to sustain themselves much longer and provide better services to the people within those areas the big one of the big challenges that is changing as well that will be a big impact on the city of cannons management is that we will have budgets going with individuals rather than providing money indeed blocks the budgets for home care services will go with the individual and that means major changes to the way that we operate and the way that we manage our system so the future the second big challenge for the city is getting really really competitive lots of organizations that haven't_''_865.64 been in aged care before coming on to me aged care and they will be fighting for services as much as they can be years to come ten you spoke about the services that are provided for older people and the disabled in the canning area you can get a chance to talk about canning lodge for you to bed aged care facility a nursing home we've got the HP HP a person's accommodation which is retirement villages to relatively small the very tiny of time villages with about fifty four units in those two villages and we have quite a substantial hack program home and community care delivery of services to people in their homes and programs operated out of their care centers and then we have disability services which are largely around accommodation type services but people into women with disability so we spent the time analyzing all of those services and firstly just having a look at canning lunch can I watch this beautiful facility levels of care needs it's been really well maintained and it has a lovely home like environment it's enjoyed happy staff and have your residents and families and the wave of the services have been delivered and the feedback that has been provided shows how very important it is to be able to have an aged care home like this in the area the home was built as I mentioned for people with lower levels of care needs it does make it challenging for people who have higher levels of care needs and basically what's happening in as we get better at looking after people in their homes that generally either don't go into a nursing home or if they do go into a nursing home it tends to be at a higher level of care needs the change that we've got with planning lodges it's not really built for with higher levels of care name and so one of the challenges in the future is for investment to be made to make sure that it is modified and changed in such a way higher care needs but also a 42 it's relatively small and to get the scale and the ability to be able to provide services to many more people it needs to be expanded and which is quite good news on that site because there's this there's a bit of space to be able to do it so lovely I'm not built for the future retirement villages the retirement villages are also very nicely maintained there in fantastic areas the building stock is not the consistent with the sorts of buildings that we build today retirement village units would tend to be larger the access ways and pathways that are probably a little bit easier for people to navigate and they are very small and because they are very small and because they're they're old they don't have a lot of scale they're expensive to operate and there will be potential for those sites in the future to perhaps increase the number of units that are provided there again to make it better prepared to look after a larger number of people that that we tend to find to with with retirement living today is to help people to stay at home as long as possible and if people want to age in the retirement village and stay in the retirement village would also look to have support services on that site to make sure that the people that are able to get people to come and provide assistance with anything that they want whether that be around catering around food or just help with with keeping out of the place things here the next one was around the community care services and home care packages this is probably the largest area that the city of canaan operates the feedback from the users of those services has been positive also the feedback from volunteers and the staff that work in these areas providing services to people to remain at home remain healthy and happy at home and operating the community centres running activities and respite services this is probably also the one area that is going to change the most over that not just becoming invisible the coming months as I mentioned much really the future of aged care people ordinarily want to receive their services in their home and as a result it's becoming very very competitive and the government is changing the way that it's funded so that it is the consumer it's the customer that makes more of the decisions and from figuring next year the customer is going to be able to choose whatever provider they want to provide up until now the government's decided who's allowed to provide the home care services and the customer would be with that provider that's going to change now so it is the customer that can choose the provider the best meets their needs if painting is to continually services it needs to be responsive to those needs and competitive the other thing that that customers can to look everything closely as well as how much it costs you have to provide them individual budgets and show they know much it's costing and that'll be another area that will be competitive moving forward finding disability services I mentioned six sites around the area hi amount of different services and it is somewhat think that it's mainly around accommodation but there will be scoped to be able to provide more services in the future and the government would expect that people are able to provide more services for the future so we found it up to to explore or service offerings so that was the appraisal basically speaking we found that the aged care services and accommodation and to be but quality we found generally that the customers are happy with it and the staff are happy to work here but we have also found that in retirement living and the aged care facility the nursing home is going to be in need of major change in order to make it current moving forward and home care services are going to need to be restructured to be competitive and surviving in the longer term and within that context and the council's main the priority that the services in the area not only remain but get better and expand to meet more all the people in the area we've come up with three but firstly the first option is to restructure and redevelop that means within the city of cane to review the services rebuilds expand and improve the management systems so that the home care services can be delivered are competitively and differently than they are now to to me a brave new world the second option is to look to provide another organizations to run the retirement villages and the nursing homes and two for them to undertake the modifications and expansions over the over the coming decades to expand them and improve them and to use those funds to reinvest in home care services and disability and the third one is to expand and rejuvenate all of the services in partnership with a professor organization that is established to deliver those services most likely one of the large religious and charitable organizations that are working partnership to make the services stronger so I'll just talk about them and mainly just touch on some of the impacts that these different decisions might make moving forward the first is for canning to internally redevelop and restructure the services and what that villages and nursing home services would need to be modified to meet the changing market that would mean that they would need to ideally be larger so that more people can be accommodated in services the redevelopment of that particularly given the nursing home and the villages are decades old now the investment in that will be quite substantial it's likely to cost tens of millions of dollars and then at the same time the home care services at the hack and the package services would also that whole area we need to be restructured it would need to be changed to make it more more responsive to the needs of consumers in the future and also changing the internal systems to make sure that it can run to the new way the government will fund from next year so that's the internal modification some of the potential impacts in this is that it will take a lot of work to do and that work has to be done very quickly given a lot of the changes commence from februari next year it's going to mean a operate and there is a potential that this group that sees some disruption in service delivery most organizations though providing home care services are going to run into disruption because nearly all organizations are built to the current funding models the potential negative on this is that after undertaking this work and significant investment there is a chance that with all of that done the services and systems may still not be competitive in the new era and it could be that other organizations move in to to to take up more of the demand in which case it could be that bound the city accounting services would reduce in size and scale if the if a redevelopment and restructure could be done and if the the money could be found to undertake the redevelopment of the physical instructor of the buildings then it could bring them up to a modern standard and that would mean that future generation consumers would have access to the sorts of services accommodation that dominate and services in the future the second option was to look to address the most expensive part of the nursing home at some point in the future and to look to another organization to acquire those assets to run them and to bring them up to modern standards what that will do is that the money received from the transfer of those assets would then be invested in improving home care and disability services and those services could be improved and rejuvenated again there is the risk that the improvements don't meet the standards moving forward but a new create an opportunity to reinvest in that in that focus area and it may create the opportunity then if its competitive to be able to expand those services and the city enjoys a good reputation in the area and so using that brand and their reputation could help for the expansion of the services the final option was to move towards a strategic rejuvenation improvement and expansion of all of the aged care and disability services and to do that in partnership with an organization that was created for that purpose and so in Western Australia a lot of the most of the eh care providers not-for-profit organizations religious to run a chair services and retirement accommodation if the city was to partner with a group like this it would be a matter of understanding who would be responsible for operating what assets the city would retain ownership in all circumstances of some of the assets and the new organization would share responsibility for the management of the services moving forward some of the impacts that might come in with this on the wider community and the users of the services again like if it was to be done internally there is a potential disruption the disruption under this model is usually different that's usually around the change in the management styles and the processes that comes up comes with working with a big provider because most of the big providers are already ready for tooth point near ready for 2017 it's unlikely to be a disruption in the delivery of the service itself so much as as a change in the way that the organization's management systems run it does create the potential to provide an expansion of the services particularly if the organization organ the metro area particularly around an area the partner organization would then take the primary responsibility moving forward for delivering those services and because these organizations are created just for providing aged care retirement living services you end up I guess with a pure focus on delivery in the expansion of those services in the area so those are basically the three options to recap very quickly for the scene to try and address the big challenges ahead excellent infrastructure and services to make it appropriate for the future internally to secondly to look at focusing those efforts on the home care services and the third one is partnering with a large organization which we involve and include the transfer of operations to that new provider for the delivery of services in the future thank you very much so just before we young hand over for any questions that you may have I just like to acknowledge some of our elected members that are you today so our mettle in losing the crowd mr. mayor if you like to give this away and sitting next to hear me is marble David Brown welcome hunt around and to my left ear we've got council bedrooms up so questions we've got some roving mics when asking your questions please state your name and address prior to asking will start with mr. Gleason in the front Jason everybody everybody my name's bill Gleason 11 107 vanilla w written I have an interest in this because one of my my citizens of Candy and too I may have to be placed in one of these facilities so buried on the trail my first question is to the presenter could you really expand on the first paragraph of the leather that were setting up by the city of candy which reads you have mentioned it you may be aware of the Commonwealth and state ready to change the funding arrangements for a chair disability services which allows consumers to direct their funding dollars but you really put them in simple simple words but I don't finish my questions you can do that first thing sure okay and so historically what has happened is on two levels firstly the government will generally those services will use that bucket of money to be able to provide services for people in their homes basically what's happened is over time the government has found that not to be the most efficient way of providing the services because you've got this big bucket and if there's potential for it not to be used efficiently so what they're doing is they're providing the individual consumers with an allocated budget so what happens then is that that individual consumer they can can choose that provider that they want and that operator then will access that money and deliver services what makes it so challenging is that it was much easier when they just gave us a bucket of money and you can just sort of drawn it makes it much harder and much more competitive when the consumers can choose who they want to deliver the services and so that's that's probably the biggest fundamental change and it starts to change from federal us next year my second question is is it your view that somebody on the future that the I need like rifle and swan college have done in the last 10 years and we will be the cost of that would be illegal the city and county main path which will cost millions and millions of dollars or will it be to the mayor and council was the view which they probably won't give me now that somebody on the tractor could go to private enterprise dude does any cell have an interest in this as well as providing the service to do it now I here so we have no interest in it and it will be the council's decision as to as to which way it goes that the answer to the first part of your question is yes there's no question that the retirement village and the nursing home will need to be redeveloped it's already quite difficult to market the units in the retirement village in they're in lovely locations they're not built to current standard it's going to be hard to get people to use them and it costs a lot of money to write a it would be much better to have a nice modern village that looked after more people say yes I'll just leave it there mr. booth in the frontier yes when you do they do it Queen Street in Bengali there's two very quick come more comments that you could put into a question if you want you highlight choice but you know how would intellectually disabled people like my daughter and a husband met choices you asked him a question is it look at you so who's going to make choices for my one desire 80 were both in very poor health I'm going in for a hard operation next week might not come out of it and somebody's the other side there's no other path no other family the so that's the concern the other thing is that 90 years ago the city of caning opened with homes west a7 unit projected for intellectually disabled people it's magnificent it's wonderful and the service that the city of Kano provided twice daily every morning every evening seven days away for 19 imitated to put my daughter's life in their hands however I all of this series has a cost error sent the government through hack or whatever have paid for everything and I read in this paper that you passed out here on three occasions that the council may be required to find it costs through charging fees and charges and rates so I certainly would be concerned about that because obviously a disabled person's income is very low thank you thank you that where they work with comments and not questions that the aspect of choice I think particularly within disability has probably the level of choice and consumers say in the way services the delivered is probably always way better in Western Australia than it has in NH in knots knots not so throughout Australia but I think in Western Australia and hopefully will provide that in terms of the the cost of services and in the future for people without financial means let's unlikely to change very additional fees that come with the government changes means-tested care fees which means that there if people have to contribute towards their care services they're going to be asked to do it in Australia at the moment for every and retired Australian there's five taxpayers over the next two decades that drops to about 2.7 and what it means is we've got half the number of taxpayers to the garter of a growing number of older people and there will be additional costs associated with providing services that's that's inevitable mdas disability funding particularly people in financial disadvantage is unlikely to change because they have don't have the capacity to be able to pay I think the comment in the letter regarding fees and charges are likely to be around the concept and correct if I'm wrong tenure but and the retirement village and the nursing home won't post medians they'll cost tens of millions to rebuild and redevelop and then funding in the future will need to come from from somewhere there's I've been to the young the little village that your door there's in agreeance beautiful it's it's unlikely to change or in the future will be around the retirement villages the nursing home and the improvement of the home care services to meet the future altima kathy and I live in Kilmer note I'm 81 and I just have a service but what happens if I'm given so much money and that money runs out good pays for my service and other people who do it now will they still be doing it or do I have to employ somebody to come and do that service yeah I guess so ordering an if a person is receiving services has the ability to be able to contribute towards the cost of those services there meaning that would be required if they have the money to do it they don't have the money to do it then stay in the Commonwealth generally subsidizes that that care so that if you don't have it you can be subsidized so in terms of the services that are being delivered to you then the actual people who provide the support to you change in actually as we change Johnson and employment it doing that the handling of the care services under these three options are unlikely to change let's go check this out just thinking what you're saying obviously can you see cats will be about being open and there's right matter if we didn't have too heavily cost of redeveloping things mecosta bring hat programs is paljah council services as far as I can tell you options be just a hand over to property to pass and the council p.m. providing what is that right nice that's an option and it really depends upon the council's preference for whether they want you can control of those services because they think they'll they'll be able to do it well in the future or whether or not they do they want someone external to provide the services for all I can say is that to have those services in the area is fantastic and I think the best option which is the one that the council bodies will invigorate those services so they're not only good but they become great and make sure that the future and I migrant atoms are live in wisteria where I ferndown and minor just comments they are not questions we all know that this city is the best practice to express events and also outside services that was a fact that that's highlighted during the film amalgamation fiasco and they have to be applauded for the work that they put in it seems to me that these options are skewed to the handing over to outside of organizations and I fear in this society if you watch television the ads etc it's all fear based you know funeral insurance definitions this time the other look even illusion homes all this sort of thing and I think the sad part is that the aged and I wantam and we will pay our taxes and we pay our taxes and expected you looked after in the future and and all this uncertainty about possibly and maybe doesn't do all the people anymore we pay the honey we've paid our dues and it's not our fault but the government don't have a bucket let along were known I'm a resident of rossmoyne retirement village generally be very happy with the services provided in the village but myself in the wife of the youngest couple in the village been there two years and cost with one of the main factors involved in coming there plus location and what this other thing but with the realm improvements that a necessary in there I canna cost a lot of money and will increase the value of our asset in the village but if we're getting an increase in the value of asset do we have to contribute to the cost of that web where do we finger down on in read when we have to move on and have we cut the paper them to get a better value that we had yeah thanks Bennett and so residents in navy retired village inn on rental retirement village in western australia protected under the retirement villages active of WA which makes sure that the residents that are in there at a guarantee in 10 years so that they are able to stay what normally happens in a years down the track is that the organization will generally that is operating with original generally look to develop the areas of the village that are not being used they'll create improvements in that area and they'll either encourage residents if they're like improvements to move across or you remain where you are that they don't mask existing residents to contribute to the to the cost of the village you've already paid your entry contribution and you have a right to that to that unit that you're in I've just inherited because she had any children she's very much if you are a pathetic going to read about that where they go and what happens to the stuff they just now it is time to click with them it's only been since December but yeah what happens to them when they move to what's the disruption or narrowly with the redevelopment and there's a couple of approaches to it one is that the home stops at meeting new residents and particularly in cluster housing because caning large like a are built in a cluster design which enables you to provide separate accommodation in a cluster redevelopment sometimes the redevelopment will start in an empty house and will be built progressively over time most organizations will stop at meeting new residents on average in Australia and people saying about two and a half years in a sec oh man that's that's coming down all the time so wouldn't early in a redevelopment those soft admitting new residents and as the houses become available they'll start a redevelopment program larger organizations that have lots of nursing homes in the area might offer the accommodation in better accommodation or closer nursing homes all for our residential aged care facilities that allow the people to move into areas that are more attuned to their needs especially in then in the case of your auntie if they have behavioral or dementia challenges then they need to find an accommodation that says Google better than what she's receiving at the moment what happens with staff with it often if the nursing home is in an organization that just has one probably about 18 months to rebuild the nursing home so they won't work from for that 18 months quite often they'll look to find other employment with large organizations with multiple sites they're normally redeployed to the other sites they may come back when the new nursing home is built but in a smaller in an organization that only has one nursing home general adult dolt seek other employment coffee on introduce trailer showing I've got this an interest like 93 year old my buddies in chem emotion and I think the facilities are absolutely fantastic four star for the most committed of any group of staff in the city of can it's a big statement live that I made it we've got friends that have got mother or father in our city related care facilities our source quality is pretty ordinary and I've got a real concern going forward particularly the way the whole thing's for instruction it's really been stood restructuring redeveloped it's going to cost tens of millions and I don't want to argue with that sets of houses in tangora set aside for high care and the other ones are quite okay that's not going to cost tens of millions option three rejuvenate and expanding partnership with something else if you figure the right it's still going to cost tens of millions which will then leave to plot it off and there's only 42 people then it come to a vote certainly it's gonna be why spend tens millions on such a small facility and I think it comes down to over the years I'm City Kenny hasn't had the greatest record now that they've changed their record is absolutely fantastic and I'm really quite proud to say I'm in the city of cam whereas five or seven years ago I'm not too sure would ban put my hand up it comes down to the morality of it and the social aspect of the city and to me the tens of millions and I thought they cannot argue with that it's got it should have anything due life it shouldn't have the other organisation city a can acknowledge that's working really really well inhale of unpaid out on those guys do in external activities for those it's really a family I'll be devastated if the city it can take the easy option sell it off the majority of the right places so you do that because they young I think I think we just gotta slam take a deep breath and say the three options as I've been thought there's only one option that really can carry through and that sell it off and I think it's good think about it raise the number of good points and I've taken you like them first of all our findings were consistent with yours is that we think I can acknowledge provides a fantastic service staff are not only dedicated but they're multi-skilled which you don't always get there because of the the small houses they have to do multiple services which is not not not often or quite often not the way that's gone and so yes I agree with your observation there but with their home is that it won't make the needs of consumers in the future it is too smooth it's forty two beds in store for people with lower levels of care just calling one of the house a high care house doesn't make it a hike their house it's not built for people with higher levels of canyons and with mobility issues it will find it very very difficult to look after people as they become very frail about 80% people that are into nursing homes today are very frail it is a fantastic site and it has the capacity to provide I care services which will be areas that are most in need in the future secondly in terms of the other skewing of the options we developed the options with no prompting from anyone but in the council and the only prompting that we had was that was the best outcomes for the customers the older customers in the future and flogging it offers as you as you point to is not one of the options that will put forward their recommendations that forward primarily around what can be achieved and what the consumers of the future what they got with customers of the future will hi I'm Kara banks are you going to drive machete but I'm also discharge coordinator for the Frog Prince hospital so I deal a lot with the elderly patients and a lot of patients come from the city of planning on that subject and I can't judge so much about the reservation facilities but I do have a lot of concerns about the home care packages and at the moment I don't know if you're aware of that the health department's Gosselin staff in the 18 so right now I cannot get people encountered in hospital and without a name Carter to allow engineer assessment you cannot access these home care packages and so that's a real concern as not going to get better in the future so what happens is a lot of our patients have to start paying for private services which at minimum cost forty five dollars an hour learn to have some becomes your house and horrendous so the people who need to leave hospital that cannot get home care packages from me as a discharge organize the hack services are the lifeline for these people and I'm going to write a recommendation that the hack services are fantastic they have a low threshold it's easy for people to get into its cheap relatively much much cheaper than the home care packages is local it can be implemented really quickly people love it even without a wait for a professional home care packages kicking in later they're really happy with that so I would really really urge you not to give up those hack services to quit can hand them over to a big private organization now I deal in long with pride service providers as well they're all very willing and very professional people but a lot of the money is gobbled up by administration as your ma cracy so let the gradual process and I'm not be negatively I'm just warning everybody here before you handed over to big organizations think about it like the leg in front hours of help and how and the rest of your money is gone without by administration and fair right you so maybe but what happens then then you have to start paying private people again now that's fine if you can afford that but what if you are the same tool impatiently kinda for that so these are colleagues but the question is are you aware that you cannot get a pass at the moment they are on waiting list for three months so the hack services are their only lifeline so just think of all these bureaucracy things as well before you give away the heck services of the council sorry I guess so just an answer your question yes I'm aware that package is particularly they were 12 Commonwealth packages that the demand firm is coming down and pirate Raiders it's not just they have to be get a catered for the referral process so happies is a live in demand at least part of that as well as the means test anymore ok is almost non-existent compared to the Commonwealth hundred packages I would to that system in the future anyway and the one thing that I just would portion about bureaucracy and administration costs is that the city is not w sufficiently my name is Mark Maria come from rostrata new bulletin and I like the second footage they wrote their I'm employed by a chai tea to see this in kids I knew exactly and I absolutely do not under any circumstance for try the charity more religious body because the money is not for people this supposes before it has not Lisa VI response from the audience but it is because that people that only in it for the money and I think it has to be very careful of how good it sounds Diane Matthews from Ridgid person sharing and that brings me to my question and the nicely because I was concerned about the management of the budgets and how it was going to be managed an assistive into the community and how they're going to be guidelines and priorities set on how to be managed so that we all know whether or not a provider is with the customer to go through their budgets and Rihanna program for the services that would be provided to them so that actually provided the services with yeah so they're accredited to work within guidelines and they're okay standards that they have to repair too and they also have to tell you about their overhead costs too so you get an opportunity to see how much of the costs are going into actual care hours and how much of the their resources are going into administration into the unit which was the comment race before about the amount of money goes to running the organization as to what you've actually kept because you want obviously as much as possible actual contact hours and key rounds and ideally that that operator can do it as efficiently as possible and also you want a diversity of services potentially as well so the services of not only being in maximum contact time we also buy the right people my name is Margaret Jones I'm here not for myself but it goes back to what the lady up they said now this letter came to a person here are the account details by direct debit for the city of painting please ensure the payments were directed it with the band set up for every four weeks as we shall be sent out every four weeks and it's only be ingerson and what we had but came with it is what you're talking about now this personnel percent to cannot make the decisions about whom he wants to deliver his services in where is this gentleman here at the beginning ask the question and I think you cannot really answer it and so this comes out I do understand now how the change has been maybe consumer-directed here but it's a big assumption on the part of government to think that everyone who needs the services will be able to say Oh wouldn't like you that I like you just put my services yes I didn't answer the question because that that is for so that's the way that it will operate from here so I'm not here to argue for the way that it's just the way that it's going to happen the question is around whether the city decides to run that program itself or in partnership with others doesn't seem to me to assure the people I mean if people have a family there in case the family can help the person to make a choice however it may be that then the person has to pay an advocate and the other thing is I like to ask is when was this commission was this commission before we have a new council or things been I'm sorry the winner was the review commission November last year since the new council okay so late I've been here I'm sorry sorry there was a budgeted figure on the city's budget before the council came on to untag with you in cause stafford in the area of waited around and start to do about the changes and also if I may you mentioned your head feedback from certain people so who the people who you consulted for you and so the city ordinarily goes through and gets as part of its ongoing operations and was so we were able to have a look at their you also visited all of the science we spoke to people who were receiving services people burglary management physicians and staff as well Oh I'm smelling another BBQ street is Shelly it's a selfish question but we've had gardeners for a number of years very good what are they just going to lose their jobs how can we still get them to come yes so ordinarily no matter what decision the council makes if you're in partnership with another organization if you're operating themselves the people that are delivering services they usually continue to be engaged so they don't normally change changing I just think to remember now I could just say that one of the points that can make the new guineans presentation was that Australia has a very asian population it's just increasing all the time in the city of counting it's going to increase so my personal opinion is I would expect be expecting to see more services non-decreasing service delivery air transport we're always going to need that and probably more of it into the future thank you can very much pleased you came around thanks and gentlemen I haven't quite finished re for you but I just finish so again the proposed timeline for having another community briefing which will be run exactly 40 miles with you today on 720 first of May feedback will be steamed up until four on 17th cheering with over to put a report to Council in 2016 with

I would like to begin by acknowledging the verge of people the traditional owners of the land on which we are meeting today and to pay my respect to the elders both past and present I would like to specially welcome the Honorable Bill Johnson MLA the Honorable Nick Goren mlc and our very special guest speaker today dr. penny fled Australian order recipient by deputy mayor Councillor lynci Hollen and all the council of the city of canning mrs. Lynne Russell the CEO and all the divisional heads I am pleased to welcome you all to the first scanning business networking event the city of canning is placing a high priority on engaging with our business community our new economic development directory has a focus on engagement and creating opportunity to support businesses in canning it is not only important that we provide a forum for council to meet with businesses but for canning businesses to meet with each other as part of our commitment to businesses in canning I am very happy to announce today that the city of canning is creating a business advisory group now the our business community with an objective to provide a reference point to focus on areas of economic development strategy and to ensure that this key sector of the community is provided with an appropriate communication mechanism in the city and to provide strategic advice to the city and in turn cancer unusual that affects the business community in canning and to raise the profile of the business community encounter activities and planning we really need people like you and encourage you to nominate it is important that our business owner have a voice in this city if you are interested in nominating you will see all the information in your give back this morning in closing I will sincerely like to thank our principal partner the Telstra business center of Belmont for their support in our first season of business event they are here today and have information specifically business for businesses about NBN and how you can benefit from this new technology please take a moment to speak with them as the NBN will be rolling out across the city of canning very soon thank you very much and to Lynn Russell the CEO of the city of canning will provide a quick presentation thank you Mike welcome everybody it's fantastic to see so many business people on our first event and this is about us being actually open for business as a city which is something we're delighted to be able to announce so what is this beast called the city of Kenny for those of you who aren't familiar with our framework obviously we're in a very strategic position in terms of Perth southeast suburbs only 10 k's to the CBD 65 square kilometres it's a sizeable city with over a hundred thousand residents and many people don't know but we are the most multicultural counseling Perth which is wonderful and I I think the constitution of our business community as also reflect that multiculturalism which is fantastic and the exciting thing for canning is that in da 2015 in October we elected a new council after three years of not having a council and our brand new council are very keen and very determined to be actively involved in groups so I think your presence here today is the first of the number of activities that are going to signify a strong partnership between the council and the business community back in 2014 we did our embryonic economic development strategy arm and we've now produced a new strategy that you'll have copies of and when you have a look at some of the information about canning and when you realize the volume of business in this city we are an economic powerhouse for Perth we've got term you know 52,000 people manufacturing is still our largest sector gross regional product of nine point six four billion dollars which is just extraordinary 8,000 local businesses 73 going up to 80,000 jobs and a population as I said close to a hundred thousand so it's a big place and it's got a lot of business and every day 41,000 people actually come into cunning to work as some of us know who try to get here in the morning with the congestion on our roads and that's another issue that council is working on but where people are coming to work on a daily basis a retail of course is one of our highlights and we have the strategic metropolitan center westfield carousel and I acknowledge we have a representative here from center today thank you for joining us this is w as largest shopping center it would you believe they get 11 million customer visits annually across the road here at Westfield it's just extraordinary and they're really exciting thing for all of us as businesses in our city is the fact that a term center are investing over 250 million dollars in the expansion of the westfield center and of course around that will be built a brand new city center and you may have seen some quite significant development occurring around that area in recent months with quite a bit of particular medium density housing occurring host of the train station we are that we have other district centres of course that Bentley which is subject to some major investment in development of the present time riverton's our phones in Livingston and of course a number of neighborhood and of you are involved with this are industrial and commercial part of the city and we have two world-class industrial areas we have can avail and we have welshpool and it's interesting to watch on a weekly monthly basis the changing nature of the activity of those areas with more office and more warehouse and distribution because our economy while it has traditionally been manufacturing based is now in transitioning into other industries we're currently undertaking an assessment of industrial supply and demand and that will assist us in terms of things like our land use planning and our investment facilitation and marketing and we're also a landowner in these precincts we do have substantial land holdings and we're looking to see how l and parcels can actually contribute to the growth and development of those two very important industrial areas we're also very respectful of the value of small business in cunning in this particular region we have 54,000 small businesses with an average employee size of seven and so to support those small businesses in this region there is an active program of the town hall and in a number of other venues across the city and you'll see in your pack a number of new events that are occurring in coming months obviously a small to medium enterprise growth is vital so we want to support you and partner with you and our business partners of credit net economic impact of 2.5 million dollars from the delivery of advisory services to small business one of the things that city is very proud to earn is the Welsh core business enterprise centre we beg and this is a flexible and space which offers services to a range of businesses currently tenant in that facility with factory units and office units a cafe in a training room some of you may not be aware of its location in welshpool it's a very substantial facility and it has wonderful opportunities in the future as a base to broaden the delivery of services to Cannings business sector through things like business advisory services and training and events so currently we're working actively with the way back board to establish a new focus in to 20 31 just as a matter of interest this is what they're telling us is going to happen in this particular area we're looking at increased demand for net leasable area in particularly retail in the canning city centre and district centres for office floor space in the city centre in welshpool and canning bale industrial areas and some of those in terms of entertainment floor space is quite interesting with some of the potential growth areas such as areas to do with archie entertainment and activities around sporting another so it's not necessarily going to be traditional and uses so to sum up I guess what we came to do is to move forward to position the city as a place that offers a diverse investment in business opportunity actively open and looking for assistance to business and in some ways part of the way we can support businesses to get out of their way and not provide too much red tape and it too many constraints to the effective expansion and growth of our business sector our strategic planning is important that we actually have certainty about their future growth engagements such as the events we're doing today and looking at our infrastructure requirements to meet your business needs whether they be things like roads or whether they be things like nvm to ensure that you do have access to the digital economy so for the future the estimated growth in population to 2036 will be about 126,000 people and dwellings we're looking at twenty-three percent increase in dwellings to 42,000 so there's real opportunities for business here in looking at that growth so that will lead to more jobs and I guess our role is to make a better make sure we fully understand what the future will look like for canning so we can work with business to ensure that that is successful for them individually and collectively and I'd like to echo the mayor's final call our business advisory group is going to provide for the first time of voice for business into council this will give a chance for business people across our sector to be represented to give us advice and feedback about the plug for those of you who are interested please nominate for the business advisory group we'd love to see your face again in the future so welcome thank you very much ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry to interrupt the networking that we've encouraged

Fludd has currently pro-chancellor of the university of wa chair of the WA aged care advisory council and chair of Methodist ladies college council please join with me in welcoming penny flesh well good morning everybody what a lovely day what a great gathering of people what an exciting venture thank you very much for that I'm going to trouble with google is you can't_``_901.13 wipe what's on it about you and that's a bit of a nuisance because I don't look back I tend to look forward um mayor thank you very much for and you have a wonderful a wonderful time in front of you and all your counselors and I know what it's like when organizations go through tough times then you have a rebirth and nothing can stop you so it is absolutely fantastic and from what you just said Lynn canning is set to absolutely freight flourish and how so welcome to all business leaders and special people of canning and everybody else and thank you very much for having me I was just reflecting before I start and I just need to make this comment the multiculturalism and the great diversity of ethnic backgrounds is not only in canning I have two thousand two hundred and something staff they're all amazing people and amongst those people I have 60 different ethnic backgrounds which is the richness of diversity is absolutely fabulous but it brings its own challenges to people who are supposed to be managing all leading because you have to understand or make the best possible effort you can to understand when people come from what their cultural background is what their expectations are how they think it's a wonderful thing but it's upon all of us to make sure we know each other and after each other I'm not australian-born either and I remember it took me two years and I did not expect that were really really tough and I spoke English and I thought I could just walk in and become part of the community so after one week this was in Adelaide after one week back in nineteen mid 60s when I'd heard about these whinging pom Xin Elizabeth excuse me if there's any English people in this room I thought that's it I gave myself one week to turn into an Australian and I've been proudly australian ever since and since coming to wa in 1984 I'm very proudly I was he except I still have a pawn shop for the cats in chalong but we won't go there and what I I'm not going to give you a didactic anything you can buy textbooks on leadership there's a whole industry out there that will tell you how to do really simple I'm going to tell you a very very briefly about my own organization not to sell it or brag about it but just to reflect on how complex it is and how we've managed to go from where it was when I first went there to where it is today just as a bit of a story an example of coping with and leading mostly successfully into great diversification and or expansion and keeping up with the times and keeping one step ahead and all of that sort of thing and then I was just going to make some comments from the heart about my personal experience in the sensitive if there are things in there that I can share with you about how it has been and what I reflect on what's being useful and what helps and what actually works the trouble with when I make comments is people go yeah yeah that all sounds very soft believe me none of this is soft but if I put it into the the sort of colloquial and not quite chat language if you go'll be in tightly different language so this is just me talking to you and I think the question and answer at the end if you choose to use it is probably going to be the most valuable for you so turn it into a discussion at the end if you wish my own organization I'll keep this really quick because I could be here for at least a month explaining it to you and started a hundred and ten years ago so it's quite an obviously well established and it started it was called the home of peace for the incurably ill and dying which sounds pretty dreadful but these days we talk about palliative care and chronic disease it's the same thing different language sounds better but it was set up by a couple of extraordinary citizens of Perth in when perf was a very small place to try and assist people who had nowhere else to go and to be absolutely framed that's exactly what we're still doing today and we pick up all sorts of people who fall between the cracks or all of those sorts of things so it's a wonderful mission if you like that we have and it tests us at every corner because it's all very well if you stay mainstream but if you double around doing other things and have to scratch around for a bit of support and money and everything else that you might need and lead people your own people through coping with that it's an interesting exercise you gain an awful lot of experience anyway when I first went there in 1986 not as CEO but as the old language medical superintendent it consistent you probably remember it some of you a very large nursing hospital really nursing home at subiaco and a very large one out at Englewood and these were really institutional the buildings were institutional the hierarchical arrangement in there was institutional the people who live there were called inmates they were just beginning to shed that with great respect they were called inmates but it's pretty pejorative and the nursing hierarchy started at the top with the mermaid shin and worked all its way inmates did what they were told etc and everybody was highly institutionalized it was state of the art it was what you did in those days really really well and it had a huge reputation and all sorts of important people in Perth used to queue up to go there when they thought perhaps they needed a bit of care and attention we are now a very on the game in many respects ahead of the game because I can't cope with the status quo and I've got to be looking into the future we are now on 13 residential aged care sites from joondalup to Mandurah we have at home services right across Perth north of June alot and south of manager and everywhere in between so that's our age carrots and we have a number of special units for people to transit out of hospital so they don't have to stay in hospital and can get out and while they come to grips with what's their their situation in life is and can have assistance to move on to wherever it is they to the homes of peace I saw a lot of young people lying around and I couldn't I couldn't cope with this really big and really what it was was these were people who'd had massive brain injury who'd been written off didn't get better in hospital put them in the home as a piece that's we had a lot of young people and over a bit of time I saw some of these young people actually get better and that was completely contrary to music medical wisdom and anything that's written in medical textbooks and still is to a large extent because that's the way most of us were brought up and taught that you don't get better after a very bad brain injury if you haven't got better in three to six months that's it where you are at in two years is about the limit of it's going to happen to you well I won't_''_1405.02 I can go back to that later if you want but to cut an enormously long story short we a really fantastic little team of people around me all trust at each other and summoned up every courageous Bolton up bodies and we set up a brain injury rehab center out in oak street in east victoria park and we have been in that particular program and it's very special and I've got to tell you it's the only one in Australia and we believe it's the only one in the world people come from all over the world to see it it's a real groundbreaker we give people time because your brain doesn't recover very quickly it takes a couple of years or more sometimes 10 or 20 years to get back to it that it's best we surround every person with a very special rehab package they make their own goals they are in a home-like environment in a community setting you cannot rehabilitate in an institution hope nobody here is a hospital tragic and with great respect hospitals for our what hospitals do but they don't know what goes on after we are returning hundreds and hundreds and off home to run their own lives most of them actually end up running their own lives they may need a bit of assistance but it is a magic magic place so I guess what I'm saying is you never know when you start where you're going to end up but getting that thing going and keeping it going it's been going now for 25 years and we're about 20 people a year move out so you can sort of stack up the numbers and even at a very conservative estimate and I had this independently done by a very good economic group we are returning at least a four to one on a dollar basis to the community every dollar it costs we're returning at least for it we probably returning about eight or nine that is a massive investment success not to speak of people's lives anyway I wasn't going to talk about that's just part of the diversity and we're also doing quite a lot of research I ran I never thought when I was a medical student very large laundry that does about 160 tons a week it has very large washing machines which are longer than this room and I like submarines and it's a seriously commercial laundry and that started because we had to do our own and then it grew and then we thought found we could sell a bit of surplus and then we thought oh this is at least one way of trying to drive a little bit of extra revenue and because as you know governments are not very generous with their money and old people are going to get more and more and more and live longer and longer and longer and so it's going to become more and more of a burden to the Commonwealth this I'm not even going to go there because it's we all know that this is complicated and difficult but I'm proud to say like many of you from what Lynn was saying I'm in a growth industry as you are too so that's bright water there's an awful lot more I could tell you but we went from two very large institutions to this massive diverse multi-site multi-service we're right ahead trying to keep people at home etc etc that's that's diversification and expansion in in my mode if you like so put on the specs to make sure I don't forget anything here are some comments that I might offer you from my experience and as I say it may or may not be useful leadership is a very nebulous thing that there's no such thing as a description of a leader and everybody has to be like that and I might say to you remember this it doesn't necessarily reside in one person leadership excuse me it is found at all levels in all sorts of people in an organization so watch out for it because it's very precious leadership works really well in a team it's you do if you are the leader you do have to keep your own counsel and lead as an individual but most of the actual practical leadership goes on the stronger your team or team of teams is trouble you're going to have and you work things out together because a team isn't just a collection of people a team is a group of people who all contribute everything they've got and it's all different than more diverse and bring in all the right sets of skills don't have the same sets of skills sitting around a table that's useless you can put might as well only have one person but making us diversified as as you can and everybody focuses together and pulls their contribution now building a team can sometimes be a bit difficult because people are sort of I do this you know I don't do what you do you don't do what I do but if you can bust all the barriers and get people to really contribute you'll have a fantastic leadership potential the thing I think we we don't one of the reflections I have is that leadership is about two crucial things it's about change because if you're not changing you don't need a leader you need a people now I usually get into trouble at this point and I apologize to anybody that has a financial bent to me the world's made of people money is a means to an end it's terribly important but if you start off on the financial goal honestly you're missing the point your people will make it happen so that means you have to think deeply and learn a lot about and use your experience in change watch other people who are making change happen and learn from them and you need to really think about how good you are with connecting with people some people do it naturally other people don't doesn't matter you need to understand that people are crucial and you don't always have to get on with them but you have to be able to connect with them um so here are a few words I think and I'll come back to that people and change in a bit you need a lot of courage to be a leader and it's a human natural characteristic the future is unknown is wherever you're going and it's a bit scary so you need to grit your teeth and be courageous and get on with it you need a lot of courage to direct dream big and bold a lot of people will sit on the we can do this by tomorrow if you don't dream something really big and stick it up on the horizon like a shining light you'll never get halfway there so you've got to have a big bold dream be prepared to change it that's okay but you've gotta have it so that you've really got an idea of what you're trying to do change is very threatening to many people that's scary too so you have to be courageous tell them that it's going to happen and take them with you and they will get a bit of courage from you if they're a bit frightened so you have to dare to dream you've got to share that dream you've got to use it to inspire people get their minds and hearts them to be willing and trust you that you're going to be able to do it the second thing is wisdom now it's a funny word wisdom I I think it's the sort of accumulation of your experience your learning your ability to learn from other people to admit you know when you haven't quite got it right you don't know what they had to do go find out wisdom is that sort of collection of being sensible enough to do what you're going to do and don't be stupid or foolish and if you're not quite sure go and find out and the longer you live the wiser you should be getting if you reflect if you don't reflect and just barge on you'll never be wise so seek wisdom it's a university of wa thing but I couldn't agree with it more there's a few let us see now I'm capture your people you've got to get them on side you won't get them all on side but go with the majority're going all right they'll always be a few who will sabotage refuse resist but you deal with them separately and mostly you can get them over there frightened or they're not going to help you so all this change management thing to capture your people you've got to start by trying to inspire them telling the story that we're you know we're all going towards but you have to sit down with them sometimes individually and say this is what it's about why we're doing it and everybody's got a different way of interpreting why whether it's for the big picture or the little picture or for yourself and you've got to answer that question what's in it for me so ask them what they're after and then see if you can deliver that because if you do that on a personal level if they're being a bit difficult or or scared you'll get them over the line because it's it's fear a lot of this sometimes it takes a while to cross another one confident your role modeling is is more 24 hours a day and more subtle than you will realize you can stand up like this and talk and people say wow or hmm but your role modeling every inch of every day is what people are watching it's verbal it's nonverbal it's how you walk out of the door now no matter what the news is good bad or indifferent you've got to be calm serene and don't let it bother you because if you panic or look as if you're upset they say yeah I knew it was wrong or I'm right it's scary that the leader thinks so too so you've got to keep that calm face or demeanor confidence you have to appear confident not overconfident and sometimes you do the confidence thing and you think Oh crikey what's going to happen I think this is going to work or gee I wish them the check would come in the mail and it's a week late or whatever it might be that play is be C word which is crucial and lots of people forget it you've got to celebrate often every milestone you get to and even if you think while they're trying really hard let's have a cup of tea or sit down and a sticky button doesn't matter but celebration is really important because they've got to have positive feedback and besides it's fun to take five minutes out of a day and let your hair down I don't need to tell you this because I'm sure you're all good at it but you've got to plan you've got to have a plan knowing that this roadmap whatever it is and you can plan down to the my new tits detail and sometimes in some bits you have to some bits you can't because you don't know you haven't got the information but you've got to plan everything so that everybody's got a roadmap if you hit a barrier or a dead end or you've got a diver do it together but at least you reason having said that in the top drawer of every CEO or leader you should have a contingency plan just in case plan B is really important ok you don't have to produce it unless you really need it and hopefully you never will but it's important that you've thought about what because you'll do risk analysis everybody does if this risk comes to pass what am I going to do so contingencies are important and I'm nearly at the end of my comments 0 but this one I find is fascinating and to be perfect it's all about recognizing barriers and I am I hit this when Lynn and I have something in common as I'm sure you probably know if you don't what I'm telling you we were telstra business women of the year and a long time ago Lynn preceded me and it was all in the early days I think I was number four you a number two so we sort of pioneers here and that year that it happened to me 1998 it changes your life know what do you think about women's chances in the world and what do you know how do you do business and and you're asked to speak at I don't know how many times about leadership and all of this what it did for me was made me reflect very carefully about how the heck I was going to get through this year both my parents died that year we were building a lot of new nursing homes there was huge changes going on there are a whole raft of other things in my life and I didn't_''_2224.43 I thought I was going to drown and they just I used to say I wish there were more hours in the day I learned that year to say thank God there aren't because I just didn't know it was seriously difficult and I was remaining calm and confident and all that stuff I just told you excuse me and you know doing as much of the invited speaking as I could and I sat down about four o'clock one morning because that's what I thought to myself I think my biggest problem is that I'm putting the barrier up because I'm thinking can't cope with this how am I going to deal with it I thought I try 50 different ways of fitting everything into my day and I thought give it up penny start at the beginning keep going till you get to the end and then stop and if it didn't happen it'll wait till tomorrow that was a big lesson for me the barrier I had was the one I had made I just share that with you because when you're in your very busy life sometimes you have to just take a step back and say that's a big barrier I can get rid of because the minute I got rid of us stop worrying big emotional effort worrying do away with it that's one sort of barrier there are barriers you cannot get around at any given time and they're often the external rules and compliance requirements and funding and government policy and all of those things you have wait long enough they shift but you have to accept the fact that that's something you can't shift there are a whole lot of other barriers you can fix if people aren't getting it right have you trained them if they got the skills if you've got them organized all the rest of it so identify the barriers you can fix and fix them so make a bit of a practice of identifying barriers otherwise you bumper now there's another sort of barrier which is much more insidious and when you're moving from institutional to a modern organization or you're you're you're trying to get rid of the way things have always been done this barrier is called a sacred cow I'm sure you all know about sacred cows there in the you know the language every now and again but they're really important because they stop you doing what you're trying to do and one of the ways they manage it is because their insidious and invisible they're the things that happen when people say oh had this that will never work if I count the number of times I've heard people near and closed including at times government bodies telling me that'll never work I would have stopped a long time ago when people say that will never work you think ah there's a sacred cow drag it out from behind the curtains wherever it is it's hiding give it a good look and then kill it the best thing to do with sacred cows is actually make hamburgers because then you can eat them they're very hard to identify so you've got to be tuned in for a sacred cow one of the biggest difficulties when I first started in those two big institutions was to undo the hierarchy well it was nearly impossible then I took away uniforms well you'll never know who the nurses you'll never did we never do this the wards maids are in green and the doctors wear white coats and the purple ones or something else and when we the other thing we did which was outrageous to most of homes in little houses in the street Wow and I gave everybody their own bedroom and bathroom well my board said why you having 30 bathrooms in a 30 bed little five house place and I said well would you like to share a public toilet with someone you've never met and don't like for the rest of your life 30 bathrooms it wasn't_''_2473.29 that progressive I could achieve it that these are sacred cows you'll never progress unless you make sure those things are out of the way they're not as easy as I have laughingly said to get rid of but you've got to get your little leaders who are at all levels in the organization the ones that influence all the people around you and completely change everybody's focus and paint the dream of how it's going to be if somebody's got to leave their home because I can't cope anymore and they've got all sorts of dreadful conditions the least we can do is give them a home our home or their home our home wrong building home like environments and you know it's what it's day return and in my generation which is the baby boomer one is not going to put up with any old institution anymore or being told to go into one really the whole expectation of our consumers our customers is shifting as we speak I just want to come back in my last little sentence to that people and change my favorite definition and this is my last word before questions my favorite definition of leadership sounds too simple to be true but the more you think about it the more there is in it and it was Dwight Eisenhower and I have to paraphrase what he said because it was you know said a long time ago and it was a little bit it talks about men and leadership is the art there's a lot of science and leadership but remember that art because that's the human intuitive flexible experience requiring bit leadership is the art of getting your people people to do what you want them to do because they want to do and I love the language and the more I think about it the wiser it gets because if you can actually do that you're the most fantastic leavin leader that ever lived and all the lessons are in that sentence it's the art of getting your people people to do what you want because they want to do it thank you but wonder if there's any questions for penny you can disagree okay must be someone out there that wants to proffer up but here we go please counselor Brown did you find that trying to get people to open up and be transparent and open about how the organization worked was beneficial did you find that keeping things closed worked um I think when whenever I suppose when I turned up I was a bit of a threat because they'd never had a medical person there before they'd had visiting general practitioners but nobody that was going to do anything in particular there was an awful lot to do not that was anything wrong but there was an awful lot of things that had out by the hierarchy for quite a long time and I was quite surprised at that cuz I'd never had difficulty ever and I I still don't now relating very well to any any health professional particularly nurses and I must have been a very grave threat because they were terribly polite they wouldn't let me in by an inch so for a while I maneuvered around the edges and got a whole lot of things done that they told me I couldn't do and I think without being threatening without demanding anything of them I just set up a whole lot of things I got my infection control I got my medical records I got my pharmacy I got a whole lot of things done which they weren't particularly interested once once they'd sort of let me in as you very perceptive lee see it the sacred cows were very large in those days and I understood that I I guess I sort of maneuvered a bit I helped them when they had you know when you're setting up a business it what is it that people need and then you supply the answer so I I went at it like that to make life a whole lot easier I had a couple of battles did actually put my foot down but I was I knew I was going to win those and I wasn't_''_2763.3 disrespectful it's really important not to have a personal Rao but to make a point make sure it works and I had one I'm telling tales out of school it was a long time ago and I had one with a GP he told me he came in one day and he said well what are you doing about this I'm not going to write in the notes and I'm not going to do this and I'm not going to do that I've never done it before and I said well you are because this is it's actually legal and it's professional practice and he thought here's a girl she wouldn't know what she's talking about I was in that sort of situation so I on this one this is actually got to happen he said right I'm going I said now or are you giving me notice he said now I said goodbye and afterwards I sat down and closed my door and I shook for half an hour because it was not very pleasant you know to your own professional colleagues you don't do that sort of thing and so I suppose in a way I'd sort of been able to people get to know that you know around the plaything or God she sacked the doctor and I actually hadn't he chose but people understand that there are there are places beyond which you will not go this is correct and proper and it's the right thing to do but in every other respect we all got together eventually got a few teams going got some nurses on it and suddenly we cheered because we've succeeded at doing something or other that they hadn't been able to do before and I took over some tasks that they really didn't like doing I got other so we weren't isolated anymore so sorry I'm telling it the long way round but you have to work at it and if you start at the beginning and it's all very big you got a nibble at it look for opportunities get some wins be always respectful and pleasant and include people whether they want to be included or not so it's a bit like they can't quote that Mahatma Gandhi thing but you have to behave the way you want other people to behave and sometimes it's a long hard job but you just keep going and then the momentum gathers and then you get some bright spark and if it did say that to matron so-and-so but actually it's a good idea you think good I've got another one on board and so you build up and when you get to the tipping point and then you have you dare to dream and you do something excruciating Lee different they say we can you know and so you pull them over some and once you've got it like do all sorts of wonderful things and then you're teaching them how to resist the resistance to change outside and it's exciting and you do have sticky buns and cups of tea every now and again even if it's to sit there and be catty about people and I can't cut with that anymore and everybody gets a chance to pull dump and then you get more better and go again it's reading your people sorry this is very sort of intimate personal stuff with your staff but and sometimes you go and rescue someone and you do it very privately and sit them down if they look what can we do to sort this out and they emerge nobody knows that you've had the conversation they come out and they're doing it and you think yes and they go are fantastic it's just intuitive in a way but you being sensible and not giving in to what I consider to be power demonstration by somebody for the sake of it just to let me know I just ignore that sacred cow that game and don't if you've got somebody that's really pushing you around or thinks they can stop you when you have conversations do them on your territory not theirs use your language not theirs because you're actually drawing them in they have got to communicate properly but if you go and see them in their office and they're sitting there saying I'm not going to do this well you've got to then get over the hump but if you've got them halfway over the hump in your office or out for a cup of coffee down the you know the plaza or something you've cut out all the nasty obstacles that they rely on and you don't smilingly and you got them you don't always win without a few failures that wasn't a very scientific answer but you know to mean yeah sometimes it takes a long time but if you're still there in five years time saying the same thing they will give it in hand yeah once in my life I've walked away hi and wood will call coming I'm not sure if you want to give the lawyer be known that might be a bit dangerous I'm really interested in your leadership style I feel like you had a really personal touch to talking to your people and I'm wondering how you managed to do that with 13 sites yeah and more than that all over the place and I can't get out to every site very often but whatever the arrangements are and sometimes when there are difficulties I'll certainly be very involved to support not tell them what to do so I stay I keep my finger on the pulse in the organization I'd like to know what's going on I have regular meetings with all the people I need to have regular meetings and and that's very important but I I need the corridor conversations I don't mind if it takes me five minutes to get to my office if I'm picking up or exchanging something that actually adds to I just need to keep my finger on the and at the moment that's happening every fortnight so it's called and I explained to them very clearly and it fixes them up sometimes I stand there I'm being fren explaining that bright water and I say who are the most important I'd make them work out who the customers who's the most important people in this organization and they generally come up with the residents the clients of families and all of that yes they've got that who are the next most important they look at each other and they say well the careworx I said absolutely because you guys are next to dealing with coping with washing them looking after them making their life the life they want you're the next most important people so then I draw the triangle upside down and like you know I'm at the bottom my job is to make sure you can do your job and then I finish it off by saying just to make sure you really understand you think I'm the boss you can do without me for a week and so I treat them as equals when I go out on sites I trick everybody is an equal I don't know all their names but I'm not called dr. fled I'm call penny whoops when I go out to the laundry which is where I'm going shortly to for my goodbyes I go there for a dose of hugs because I've known some of the girls that work out there for 25 years so we disappear down the back corner it's a bit of a ritual and we do a bit of gossip and I find out about their families at anglo indian people and I'd love them to death and we've gone through all sorts of thick and thin together they treat me with a lot of respects and I treat them but I know that we relish that relationship so I'm not being silly and business at work relationships are always professional but there's that personal touch that you can bring in and if your sense about it and as respecting it you can you can do's that's all there is to friends but professionally even amongst my senior people and I know them really really well and we've gone through some really difficult times together we have the huge benefits of knowing each other Our Strength's whatever's and I've confessed to them are being pretty humble and I've done things wrong and vice versa so that's a very close personal interaction but when push comes to shove this is professional and it's an interesting you know in at times it's important to be very distant from people and at times it helps to be closed because you can ring them up and they'll say I'll do it or you know I'll help you out or whatever it is it's just a personal thing and I'm not an extrovert believe it or not I have an absolute introvert if I'm in my office I shut up I drive to work I shut up after work I go home I don't I'm not a big introvert so I'm not question on the back and then we draw the morning to a close with wood stove Gaza staff gossip well I ignore it I do not gossip I'm not interested and I'm aware it goes on I don't of course it goes on if it starts to gain momentum about something obviously I know about it and I'll go and sort it out it usually happens when somebody is really disgruntled and then making trouble I'll go and sort out what that trouble is that's what I mean if you work on the premise that ninety-five percent of your people are with you and you treat them that way and you give them your trust don't wait for them to earn it the 52 percent whatever it is that are a problem you sort them out separately in a different way altogether you sit them down maybe it gets to performance manager or whatever it is if they're generating gossip that's a major problem and I won't have it if the come and tell me what the problem is and sabotaging some people just have to leave in the end I can be quite ruthless people will think I'm all fluffy know underneath every now and again I come out with something like oh whoops she actually does know what she fixes things yeah so always respect people you can have fights you'll have a union person coming in very strongly supporting a person who's actually isn't getting it right I always we have a terrific relationship with unions we choose our battles to win the wars I have a lot of respect for unions they're doing their job to help their members and we're quite heavily unionized and I respect that and I'll say to them I'm doing exactly the same the staff are the most important people in my organization every now and again we have a little battle by and large we don't but if you have to you do respectfully because if they're coming in all aggressive and you're sitting there being very polite and respectful they've lost the conversation I can't I _''_3406.86 back forget it choose another day on another time I just like to bring the this part of the event to a close and and if everyone could thank penny very much for
Michelle kickert fish traps this painting represents the manang fish traps that aboriginals traditionally built with sticks and rocks along various river beds that allowed the tide to come in and out the ancestral beings who were the direct descendants of the Aboriginal people taught the manang people how to construct these traps as a way to catch food these traps were used for thousands of years to catch fish and other swamp-dwelling creatures such as turtles the two larger circles represent these traps what's the two outer circles symbolized the fish the surrounding dot work represents the plants and the colors in the swamp environment

Prior to the geothermal war we were quite dependent upon fossil fuels natural gas coal fire from the grid in order to power what we do here but now we've got to your thermal board that helps us to reduce our dependency upon fossil fuels the project started 15 months ago and we've been up and running now for about three weeks the city received funding which contributed to about half the cost of the project we had 700,000 come from Department of Sport and Recreation 947 thousand that was contributed by Department of industry innovation and science really was probably the catalyst to make sure this was a viable project for the city it's a it's a fairly complex system when you get to the nitty-gritty of it I've certainly learned a lot through the process but operating the system itself is fairly straightforward it's all controlled through our building management system so there's all it's basically all automated it's more of a matter of us just monitoring and checking temperatures on an ongoing basis the geothermal boy at the of renewable power a geothermal boy uses heat from underground water to provide heating to the leisure plex pools reducing the ecological footprint the heated water is extracted from an aquifer over one kilometer below the ground and pumped into the plant room where a sophisticated heat exchange system uses the heat to warm the pool and the pool air the pool water and the ball water do not mix and there is hardly any water lost from the aquifer when the heated water from the aquifer has passed through the heat exchange unit it's returned underground to a depth of approximately 800 meters to recharge the aquifer it's anticipated at approximately 170 thousand dollars savings per annum it makes it more affordable for the city to to run and maintain the facilities which means we can keep the prices more affordable for the community approximately 12 months ago we had a 30 kilowatt solar system installed on the roof of the Riverton leisure Plex and that's helping us to reduce our monthly consumption figures and also our monthly utility costs for electricity we get an outstanding the all sorts of people and many others I feel to name them you know but there's always a smile it's always a pleasant experience to be here and this parcel of time that I spend that this particular Leisure Centre is very precious to me and it is the best part of my day it's not like you're gonna get to do this too often but of course the city this is their second geothermal bought in the last three years so those lessons will no doubt be asked upon us through industry partners when they look to do their balls in the future I've sometimes meet with other sustainability officers and everyone the sustainability officer is often talking about having a lot of fights or battles to make this stuff happen and they're having to drive initiatives like this I'm not having to drive initiatives like this in the city of canning it's kind of its core business it's being done by a whole lot of different people it's becoming mainstream and every day

deliver quality services the goals increases increasing the amount of public open space in our order suburbs improving Community Safety by maintaining and if necessary expanding our Ranger service and by building closer links with the WA Police another priority is to keep our neighborhoods as great closest to live by a lot of different modern design our crime practices by not allowing radical design and by tackling graffiti and the darling of rubbish converges and by ensuring we have a long term waste strategy so that charges living rubbish services are controlled and so that our existing recycling and hard and greenways pickups continue I particularly look forward to supporting services to seniors and the provision of youth sport and recreation opportunities and protecting the canning regional park I am NOT a member of political party city in a springboard into Parliament I am sinking your vote solely because I have a long-term commitment of a city of Kelly and the people who you namond thanks Dean so he has a good time for Question Time 2 to Frank to David to Kurt to tom or de su would anybody like to raise a me to any of the candidates some of them have mentioned the issues have dumped in Robbie's around areas what about just general littering some councils and backing all those most councils used to have rubbish into a scoffs is that something that could be booked out to us booked into cannibalism just a casual throwing away from k to the really those five speakers like to comment on littering kill thank you how they turn up to any of the other candidates those five as well very briefly yes I think that you know it certainly should happen it would be part of any waste management strategy I think there are a number of lower level but very untidy issues that really need to be picked up on part of it is the general waste part of it is verge occur is the dumping of rubbish particularly where landlords or their real estate agents are cleaning out their houses I think we also need to take some action to get rid of shopping trolleys I think sometimes it's almost as though we have one shopping trolley else council do and I think that stands for both working with shopping centers educating people it's working with the Rangers some of the powers they have and also just having a report back mechanism we have dozens literally dozens of council vehicles out on the road all the time and so getting reports back from them so I think there are many ways that we can tackle the issue of improving our neighborhood home on a world scale that's a small issue but in terms of feeling comfortable where we live it's a really big one thank you the other candidates like to make a comment wrap this around where I live I live near the Bentley shopping center and every day there's two shopping trolleys outside my front gate I'm constantly on the phone to Coles and Woolies now they're a national chain not a lot I can do about it except ring them up every day and just harass them please come and get your trolleys the other option the other problem with with bins around again where I am pumps and but they kept getting centaline so what do we do about that I call the cops I call the Ranger that's all I can do making although I'm pro-business I'm also about responsibility and maybe some of these businesses should be made to be responsible for the rubbishes for the rubbish they cause thank you thank you no sorry definitely take a seat this address to the address again a place yet please learn can you might go to so why not unicom promise full kids alike together okay thank you any other questions from the floor or colleagues all right on that note we might be wrapping up a little bit early so that's good

backgrounds community inclusion Youth Work counseling and teaching what I do is I go into communities and I listen that's what I do that is my key skill my job right now is to go into communities listen to its citizens and with their input create innovative structured solutions that will help this community connect to each other remember the shopping centers and we wouldn't know the people in

people with disability as just being an integral part of our community well I'm instrumental a lot of those projects those and many more throughout WA that's what I do so I believe it's my duty to offer these skills to this community the community where I call home the first thing that I would do which is something I do on a day-to-day basis is communicate with the community have a forum just like this where you can actually use me as a conduit to get information from you threw me to the council that's what I do just imagine more remarkable than a pair of spectacles they wouldn't let me something thank you my name is Wilton Thank You woman we've got a few extra moments of our sleeve now okay now speakers been very very timely and if there are any questions for those two candidates from the video or earlier that somebody's since fall off please feel free to raise those questions as well so now over to you do you have sufficient for our the people spoke to such a move so before I

first already I changed our April district I think we are bound by certain requirements is to local government advisory board actually set some of those so unless some people like to particularly respond to that mr. Prince how do the wiping up an act we have the right to review the name of award I think it can be done outside the total review but I think that's something accounts to look at in a selective I I don't mind me I'm sure I don't like the fact that we've got three wards beginning bb-but below I am saying has some some negative warmer if it is relationship that's okay so the city just semi came another bishop you'll get your chance sorry and the emissions of the back again you had your question well the gentleman here in the forum shopping my name is ken more I've already spoken dr. oz conference I sent a group down to the recycling the products are going to the yellow boom are not actually recycled that they're actually dunt are you aware of this and if if this is so I'll be moving towards recycling products of going to the other than an hour extending our recycling to a red green and yellow bin which will will make it easier for the recycling centers Thank You mr. Prince would you like to take the home I am in favor of recycling I'm not too sure whether I have to look very closely whether I introduced third being a very good rubbish service as these and the reason confer been by not be necessary thanks Prince bristles probably middle and then down the lake thank you I'm keiko stein again like asked questions and this is teddy bear oh now I totally agree that the security of streets and homes are very important issue for all of us now do you have any specific idea how to strengthen be security Manta so your question director to right thing thank you very quickly once we get into council and actually have a lot of security vehicles that go around from the council and also to talk to the local police about neighborhood watch and those sort of things in to bring into play and also go back to the community and ask how they want us to do the security of the streets safer for everybody thank you but a pressing down the back thank you thank you I've got for you again residue doesn't curve and you talk about community department which is great and then I'ma speak at all says they'll have forms and consultable the community yeah that's wonderful except that you're elected as a council to get on with the job so you know you have more of our community forums and obviously wrong with the job is there's a line between consulting and you know one job would you see that line me more okay it's too good thanks me a question yeah I understand that and I understand tations of I guess Council and what councils can and cannot do but what I'm saying is my eyes spin around a circle and whoever I point to around here will have something to say about money ok I know a lot of people here know a lot about money now people have been saying that they connect communities they know how communities actually work and how they can that's my expertise so yes I understand we're saying forums and you're dismissing with that but what they're talking about here is how powerful they are this is what I do it's almost nothing for me to do this the next day I can run one of these as I can't do it like I was saying information to the council that's what's needed a conduit for information and that's what I offer and that's what go towards being that country that's what I do so thank you thank you any other questions please that one did not oh well the back there we go thank you why not try Wallace and I think your is the Chairman was striking for another question there is no such thing anyway I'll just make a open question to the candidates when you think when you talk about vision of not that many people did but with you cancel people were talking or making suggestions about what they like is anybody would like to have a response to this what sort of visual would you like to see maybe a as a comparison with that with maybe another council south library community to you maybe a council that has a lot of different events throughout the year or I'm just making significant zip in pocket like okay I wonder that questions of the people from the Velie award is well David David Granton Perry come I think had a response am pleased we have a multiple response on this one hi I'm now as someone who works with other local governments what I have seen that other local governments are doing and they're doing very well is that they have seen that there is segregation within the community yeah the dreaded S word it's still around today I'm not talk about institutionalized segregation yeah I talking social segregation where you if you look into the statistics one in five people have disability one in five people have mental feelings I'll make money right now one if I'm in here don't represent that so what we should be doing is seen on making spaces ordinary accessible to everybody and that is how we get communities to grow better than others now other communities out there I'm doing a better than us I said Gosnell's paper very vibrant very diverse but way to do that you have a great idea events yeah more events more access more inclusive events such as I guess my mind might place or using the part but not right there is perfect not not happen there we have some ordinary space it's accessible everyone get there so why we start doing that take I reckon we can continue with that thank you any of the other candidates do so they could never get out here yes please Barry I think the best way to unite the communities and on the exemplar my friend Michelle best way when I started here the only way I become about the community when I joined I was a part of that family and the only way we're gonna have is a beautiful odds-on only have the festival blood indian function on the Wonder Pujols why don't we have the other culture of wind that we got that beautiful damn sugar beautiful facility and we were more three cultures honey we're 51 different nationalities living any we should be promoting that is our strength that is our culture that it's comes into the song number how to present behind to hang the board in its and more community involved thing thank you very much like one father coming from going Aaron can be done for thank you very much we've had so far I think it's important for us to start getting a matter of sharing best practice so one of the specializations that I have is a lot of work I've done within social media space that's a great way to the really great things are going on broader community across the this is the best place thankfully I want anything more because we were reserving as part of the be Lewin abelia candidates and so those were confined to those particular candidates and one we won't have time we are on time and present so I will pause now
Wendy Hayden reflection on many waters dear sir I tell you my story from my broken heart when I was a young girl I worked with my dad out in the fields one day a black car came and took me far far away from my mum my dad and from my sisters and brothers I never saw them for a long long time until I grew up this painting depicts a little girl looking across the many waters and land I am still looking for the years that were missed with being with my family no price could ever pay the heartache and pain that was deep down in my soul this painting represents a shining light for others to see especially those who were taken away during the stolen generation x may my painting bring peace and joy across many waters Wendy Hayden
The Billy award hasn't got the same water obviously there's only four candidates for the Billy award to affirm with us and the other to send their apologies Robert Moore skate and Robert bunny so I don't think David Brown to the podium to speak on where he stands as a candidate for the video warden good evening ladies and gentlemen I'd like to thank everybody for this opportunity to speak to remember the community I'm also an independent candidates and they've never been a member of the party preferring to make individual policy judgments and weigh up on balance which is in the distance is the community and vocabulary as a counselor I only see my role as reflecting the views of the electors in the ward that I'm elected to and the wider canon community in the past I think the views of small groups may have been more persuasive than the silent majority due to the lack of compulsory voting I have attended too many german council meetings prior to the enquiry and during the organized meetings during the amalgamation and cost they seem to have been some positive outcomes there has been an accusation that the executive has been running the city as they see fit but it has be under the supervision of the commissioners the starter worked under extreme uncertainty and difficult circumstances have kept their to be going with good grace and the improvements do with structure and finances and opportunities have been due to their efforts the city is above all service it is a delivery structure and relies on people to build delivers to be surprised at half the budget goes on salaries seem strange the electors want high quality services from motivated reliable and self-reliant people my own particular interests are in development of public open space for the advantage of all members of the community this can be done sensitively and with regard to maximizing our environmental mm Sport and Recreation are also very important including the village and basketball association development in the video thank you David just before inviting Perry Perry column to the podium just like to acknowledge also that we do have two other representatives in Lindsay Holland were hearing from them a little bit later in the evening but they are part of the video proof of candidates Harry would you like to come forward but good evening my name is very calm and I'm standing for a castle in a video would I have lived in the area last 25 years with my family and I've raised three children in the year my children have attended the local schools and they have played at the local sporting clubs I have been a coach and coordinator at Villa de la quinta for many years this is my home this is my community oh I'm here to work together to make this a better place for everyone we know that the council plays a very important role in to making the community stronger my vision is to bring the community together by having more community involvement in the decision-making process at the castle our more family-friendly events or improve the local facilities and I support the wilton basketball club there the expansion I know that I looked at the proposal it's 15 million dollars the state and the federal government so that being foolish for me not to support we are getting at a fraction of the course and that's jewel in the crown for the media room I think the castle in the past has not communicated well with its people the recent great drives of 75 four percent it shows that council is focused more on its bottom line without providing any additional services or looking at the negative impact on the lives of people I'm favor of sustainable development any additional development should be complementing the existing accent any high-density development should be seen in the light what impact have one indeed seen sporting facility this is our council our community and we should all work together to make it better thank you alright so those the only two speakers at this stage on Delia and I invite any any questions speakers are now doing those also that we rob all skaters an apology is with Robert Vadra tunnel here for Lindsay Holland and pulling a barrel candidates later in the evening so many questions so David or Perry further point of clarification sort by either of those two candidates will press on and that will give us a little bit more time for Question Time perhaps with other candidates as well

from and this is the first time I've ever been to Western Australia oh so thank you so much I want to build up marks comments and what you said but this is such an extraordinary time that we live in and you know oftentimes it's when you look back you realize how extraordinary something it's not so much in real time and I think we'll look back on this time and the thresholds that we're approaching and that we are traversing and see this as a transformative period not in human history in human civilization and I don't think is a the drivers of it r us we did it their population the economic system you can call it that that we have the living systems and climate change and those four together are converging in really remarkable way to change how we think how you see the world how we act how we come together is causing divisions and polarities as well but primarily I think it's causing human beings to come together and drop the projections and biases that divide us and simply stated on on a population level this month we hit seven billion on earth according to UN we're going to go to nine plus apparently and in the the population now compared to 7,000 years ago there's a long time but there's a thousand times more people now than there were seven thousand years ago but we also use from one hundred to a thousand times more we have impact for person than 7,000 years ago so we're talking about an impact every single human being a hundred thousand times greater than what seven thousand years ago so we do in earth happened in a year seven thousand disco so just the exponential quality of human growth and development is is hard for us to math and imagine because we grew up in it so we can't compare and secondly in terms of the economy we were seeing the slow-motion train wreck and the economy you've not seen it so much here but please come to America or reese's there too but you're seeing basically a kind of come to Jesus moment in the economy because we've had for decades basically or more of different kind of mechanisms to stimulate consumption Tim Jackson said you know we have that we were simulating people to buy things they didn't need you know with money they didn't have to impress people they didn't really care about and and that's simply really what we've been doing you know we've been accumulating but we actually didn't have the money we've been sort of talking about sustainability on an ecological level but the fact is that if sustainability truly is a systemic understanding an economic level which is that if we were over consuming which we had them then it's going to show up and it has showed up and the piper wants to be paid we don't know how those debts will be liquidated and payable but one way the other they will be but what it has done of course is Craig this great arising around the world Occupy movement which may have started in wall street which is appropriate since it's where most of the criminals reside in the financial world but it was true I mean I'm not trying to be an hominem these are just facts and and at the same time we have to understand that we've been told since we have children that we live in a capitalist system metals I can say as I wish I wish because in a capitalist system you you actually protect your capital and you try to increase it and you spend income and you invest partly income to protect and preserve capital and that's the opposite of what we've been doing we present at a discount calling it GDP and basically we're stealing we're stealing the future you know Christine planner he said future eaters good term we've we've done it on every level and then with respect to living systems it can be put very simply which is it every living system on earth is declining and the rate of the client is accelerated and there's not one peer-reviewed scientific paper published the last 30 40 years that contradicts that state and lastly we have climate change and I'm so I'm sure it's true here too but the United States you have people say well I don't believe in it and it's so cute like I don't believe in gravity I don't believe in physics I believe in you know Jesus well in you know Savior and half of spiritual path that's fantastic but the idea of complaining physics you know with the religious path is really extraordinary and climate change is really about physics and it is impeccable on the beach of all the science in terms and that is they do something that you know diatomics don't do who that is they're kind of like you know oh you know ozone or water or co2 and that is with when you have three molecules that three atoms with you on the side flap and they set up a residence and they vibrate infrared energy back down to earth it's how that's the mechanism we've known that for a hundred years it's nothing new about that the question is is interpreted as well what's going to happen and when what raid and how much moisture will be in here and what would be the rate of trans evaporation what will happen to ocean currents and and things like that and there's you know wild cards in this thing which is what about the Sun and all this and is it going into a minimum period after 24 sunspot period which is we've had before the maunder minimum you know in the 18th century and 70 century where you know you had a real freezin or Northern Hemisphere and they want to find food and you have the Dalton minim so you have these amazing different you know forces at effective none no one knows for sure but what we do know is that the IPCC reports it come out of every three years I believe it's every three years and so forth have consistently underestimated the rate of change and impacts and its course anybody can say well you cannot correlate you know Black Saturday that particular drought or the EOC cyclone you know in Queensland with climate change and that's absolutely true you cannot correlate a single event you have to go back to sustainability and sustainability is about seeing the world as a system so it's about pattern seeking and pattern seen and so if you look at as a pattern then is in need and so forth everything the climatologists have predicted is conforming the weather is conforming to that pattern
Rod Collard hunting crustaceans during the winter season our people sing and dance and hold ceremonies to bring big rains so our country can be full of fresh water this water is needed to fill up all the rivers and creeks and provide a home for all the creatures who live in them our people need to hunt these creatures to survive in this land after the rivers fill up the water runs into the ester es and into the oceans were many fish crabs and other crustaceans live and provide good food for our people we only catch enough food for our people and never take too much this way we will always have food in the future we never take animals that have X or babies in them instead we leave them in order to have food for next year by doing this we have survived for many thousands of years and that is why it is so important that our young people learn this way of living to ensure the survival of our people

you think we'll show concern I appreciate if it also I what they think real Prince they put up a damn good fight to stop amalgamation an IVP on the it he and a half the class tonight that's why I think that because your hands will be so now what am I bad I don't go right into the housing that's the main reason will personally my big thing is conservation but that doesn't buy those so but another thing I am serious about is high-density housing most of the people in the area of FGM don't like it and we can get shelved eyes by from all directions and the third bracket we've got ugly development openings to the cop shop on the corner there and no one wants it exactly and yet has happened and what's happening is the state government is overriding a local government who wouldn't choose it wouldn't choose the local govern it wouldn't put it there but it's turned up and we've got high dizzy a big bottle flats up towards canning to the railway station that's ugly as far as most local concern we've got control of their community thank you and clear the place out back is to get this council going on I see there's a lot of roads of being resurfaced the other side of company highway and well those working here Scotty business model those after these rogues been resurfaced funny what are these resurfaced they looked all right I don't think we need to do that and one of our potential candidates have talked about inappropriate strength tree plantings I agree you know how multiple conservation I like the right trees and Don thinking of a couple in particular summer the bird's name ever forget no interest in the tip of our new tree that they planted inside Wolfe Street it's great for regular footpaths it's right for reckon curbs who why didn't they stop planning avoiding someone work ever though the wrong tree in the first place and people plan Queensland box trees and cancels cleaning Queensland box trees underneath power lines in seminyak street no wrong wrong tree it's the wrong for 30 years they shouldn't be doing it's a dental treatment native birds but not there but also going to talk ganun up you got a clear idea bomb about no only going to be

they will drill no thank you thank you Mark and explain mr. toad Oh take it thank you good evening it is good to see that our rubbish bin empty voyage collection continue the city most basic obligation is fulfilled we are grateful for those services however times are increasingly tough and tough times require top measure to ensure our key stakeholders look out of Fame and for the long term as they say in business don't lose focus on the customer applied here we must not lose focus on our repair enemies in by you our ratepayers are facing and unfair know the unfair know they have to carry exorbitant rate times in a set of eight percent versus inflation of one and four percent and this is not one of similar increase has really in focus I see waste acres rending of expensive of his face in carousel horse and assessing full-page newspaper emphatic and gross glossy brochure repetitive use of research and also a consultant to support and French opinion I see inefficiency some paint volunteer to plant which from the examiner I will just increase not so much a staff problem because it is normal to ask for good increase in salary but we have such a huge increase and proved by one person these are some of the problem solution because of hand constrain our mentioned just who the mayor this city needs a mayor who has a good head on list of Earth so loud I am professionally trained as an engineer to be precise envisioning the problem and you choose and implement the best solution and the person chosen as mayor must be strong enough to do the job I have the courage to say and do what this one I have served as president of riveted Rasta Mon Cherie resident Association for the last seven years the mayor must be a team player I have served on the response in have just been asked to serve yet another term I do my work and I do get get along well with other board members cooperation and equal sacrifice we need the city of Kenyan team to be United the server community as best as we could pull together don't pull away for personal gain and the extent of the state folder it is possible to make a personal sacrifice I will lead by example if elected hmm mayor I will cut myself by fifty percent or bonita fifty percent back where is needed he is bad for everyone to have a job by each sacrificing leader exercise restraint xov necessary increases without an exorbitant rate increase reducing hostess something cutting services it if we focus on doing the right things effectiveness efficiency will follow thank you ever thank you for that makes me nervous lindsey haun could even tempt me to come along to listen to me and quite actually quite humbled to see everybody coming on here to listen to us perspective candidates I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself if you don't for quite a number of years not to given over 20 years like myself to community service whether being was seven years of the president of the bulletin child care center five years on the bulletin particles in war three of us three is his chair and I've learned something from that is that another way the council should be run the council should be run block award you haven't me if you have a chair of the board you have other members there they're all there to do a job the mayor or the chair runs the meeting that does not run the council which is what was happening in the past everybody just got a view of you everybody's got an opinion the mayor's opinion is only one of 11 everybody else has got an opinion of equal value and it should be restated favor question time should be not only but they should be listened to which is something that was also bees in my community service or something in our proven or a background I do this is a big one _''_866.04 homies or was also six years president of the burned our chrome school parents association was on the board of the bulletin scare in the world border that was it internally football I've been involved in the baseball cut everything that's what happens when you have kids I've got the experience and also in my professional life of a paralegal so I understand the way of applying and interpreting legislation which is also very important function of the board of the cancer and after that I be there is a profession and I feel quite well I think so I can bring that sort of experience here to the cancer there's a lot of everyone if you don't let the policies that they're I've got the policy that I'm very interested in one of the main ones is the expansion of militant basketball center it's a grating it's not just bulletin benefits from that is a whole community that's also incanting bar hasn't fought the redevelopment of the old same core idea to that to be sports around years and years and years is infrastructure the best infrastructure for the development of our children is thought was mentioned before he did kids are playing they guess since it well been because we're part of the team it's a great feeling it's something that I will be advocating for if I'll get on cancer you will drink to that the other thing is like the solution before I have no agenda here I'm not a neighbor a political party another one with anybody or anything else on here is completely independent during during it for as a community service walk up in Durham for the last 20 years that the relative childcare center for example more crimes of a potato biscuit and but it's really not a potato Barnett before so we're asking to please consider both one night and appreciate all the other candidates I wish you the best of luck and thank energy this is just this good performance I am I'm SH butters like to say Who I am introduced myself and talk about my form and things name just give some games I'm 34 years old this year ago two beautiful young children once Chelsea is three years old and gable is five Martha what do I do I'm a language interpreter sets the training the languages of English and Chinese what else to do perform at by teachers pwa in the translation program and also at the same program in central path also that's long enough part of the power reserve I use my language skills dead and I also in him so that's a little bit about me I Leah pop lived in the area I came back to Australia in 2009 I'll be popping in filling the air since you might have known me I ran two years ago instead campaign kayden I don't find that I conservative by nature I think that we need to pack some conservative values into the interim management of the city of cannon and just quickly my four main platforms that are we running on this one is the portability of race another came on a council bash on the campaign is residents I'd like that to continue I know they would have a few economic headwinds recently and I can't I can't promise the work couples everything but I will make sure that your your buck goes further because a lot of people you know if the economy has not so well people are people would I mean if we'd all saved that I can save you it's a think a dollar you can spend someone else on your children or things in expenditure secondly I'd like to streamline local government services Cannings one of the better chances of that comes to this but I really like to have an attitude service where instead of you ringing after council where this film where's it going gone maybe a online process where someone is responsible for your application and so you don't think I can play you know telephone ping pong they know replication they don't holidays and you get your application smoothly done third thing is safety and security this is a big thing I was just drawn up in yesterday and by this also another quick story my wife was out with my youngest daughter when I door knocking a few weeks ago and finally got stolen so well I must not just say oh ok um I know it's not just a council issue but we'll need to work bed with Barbra wa police and our security he does a great job and we can improve on that and just fourthly conscious at the time is integrity I think it's previously I think the the counselor position of man has been a bit of a property developers club I'm not a property developer and I believe that we need in the new council that you will let choose people that we nearly lost our council once what we're lost twice needed it's ruined it's a miracle that we're here to not talking about the future of camp so if you're confident about the future of cannon with me then let's join together and make any stronger be everybody make your votes go further streamline services get better safety and security you and they speak butterball good evening everyone and vegetable Atlanta thankfully Candace I think yes fabulous we simply a little thing that why should I be sad if there I'm him to go this opportunity to introduce myself originally from the Netherlands and just having actress belu of nine bulu was beautiful fish design which my parents had a fish and chip shop in ela Menon wrote in 1960s and when organized that feel it was going to be another war dein and in felt the chair and I thought was deceptively fun fabulous injustice ever anyway a person with passions of community service and my decisions stand the mayor is motivated by the desire to contribute back to the community canning is a large city and I do not see this as part time job and I'm prepared to devote myself full time to the role I have had a successful under any career will experience in diverse john generals and in a variety of industries in my role as president of the International Business Council I know how much can be achieved by working together the canon city council the council staff our local businesses all cannings residents the civic canon has a large multicultural community my interaction the various chambers of commerce has provided me with experience in communicating with residents for many cultural backgrounds I have experienced carry out civic and ceremony duties and communicate effectively with all politicians are lauded that's my experience in business and other roles have renewal you go to to provide leadership promote a positive image of the city read and understand budgets financial statements and communicate late and actively participate in meetings I have concerns regarding residential infill while residential infill may be necessary it needs to be consistently and carefully managed to avoid negative outcomes I have concerned service with a chair and have recently had experience of Seven Mile 92 Europe it alert see I understand reports of the land elderly citizens through that dignity right I support the Bentley regeneration project the expansion of the city center the need for this morning facilities especially for a young I met before a house w achieving center dr david hopson's morning to discuss the conference facility that will be great for the city center to commissioners and the gym ship of Commissioner stole the CEO and staff have a inverse into addressing the governor's and financial concerns arising from the action of the previous counsel and have positioned City prods return to democracy I'd like to continue in soil and I would like to thank the commissioners and senior thank you hey guys we might take em to the flavors thank you very much ladies and gentlemen neighbors and friends my name is play Campbell and I would like to be your hand smear the quality not just the quantity but the quality of candidates info from tonight and your presence here tonight reflects a great truth that is sometimes we don't appreciate what we've got until we see the risks of losing it I see that your presence is not shows that you and I share something in common we love this city and we care about um I'll use for the destruction we both played a little oil or two so we know although very few actually back to add in any only the whole areas powers going out so I won't mention the l word what I was going to say was that although I am one in smuggle you know I do actually have a heart love is squarely based in the city of canning this is mike where my wife and I have chosen to make our home this is where we chosen to raise our family this is where our children attend local schools I have a number of pulses rather than going to the mall invite you to check out my flyer which is I to look at my website Blair famir calm and my facebook page which is also clear for me however let me just mention a few key points I want to change the way our virtual collections are wrong I'm sick of seeing our Burgess sending two tips every few months I'm sick of seeing waste sitting on our Burgess for months at a time I want to see our suburbs be free from the most and change our collection system to an on-demand system be headed over not just to an auditor but to the state office of the state auditor general and I propose entering into an arrangement to make sure that happens I want all councillors to have ethics and governance training one of the criticisms made by the Canada report was that induction preceded procedures for the city were inadequate I want to make sure that not only we have broad community consultation bills but we set up a youth consultation form so that we can engage our young people so they feel they have a safe city and that their views are being heard because we love this city and I know you love it as much as I do we serve here we love those silly serve and we serve those we love which is why my family and I have always tried to do what we can my family service in our local pensee my wife is sitting over there she's the president of our local PNC when the city accounting needed a community representative I put up my hand when my ratepayers Association vice president I the president of the Association until they can find somebody else the very existence of our city wasn't out at that time some people chose to put up their hands and I was one of those he petitioned who wrote letters and delivered a substantial petition to one of our local members of parliament for tabling in Parliament when the battle was won I livid I led the charge to ensure that the people who saved us see the residence in south east fremantle in Hobart received the gratitude of our city I arranged for certificates of appreciation of okay supplies to each of the community leaders who had led those challenges they told me that that was the only expression of gratitude that accuracy from anyone there are thousands of people in this city who feel that their voices are not being heard we feel betrayed by the back that s Australia recently deep by reneging on their promise to give us night time Resta from overflights there are people who feel that they are no longer being listened to I want to make sure that this city I want counsel to go to the people I don't want the people to have to come to the ivory tower here the this extremity of the sea Ruth I want the council to be response I hope that you will join with me to bring a fresh new start to see you can thank you thank you very college is for that disruption to your address nexus s leader see that party hello William I Munsey pop I hope you ok thank you very much for entertaining the hosting bill I have to save the moment but the group as Marlie Hall said would be well served by study everyone repeat here that's the only thing that means well you go to gala box I'd like to order to tell you all about myself my say this council now in my plans for future but for now it's just if there's enough that your week so the first thing I wanted was asked you to have a look at wyland inside my facebook site in biodiversity and my profile there and at various community out a little bit more about me and I also like to thank Commissioner hole and the group that been running cannibal the last few years before we had a slight hiccup I think the spot evening that was headed at a very very good job and I have to say I want to their strategic plan and while some of the because I sort of question a summer strategic intentions or strategies may happen are you question all gentlemen sweet nuggets of people look so thank you for those people who that and of course as everyone else has said thank you for the people who added headed to keep getting this can I'd also like to point out that I am actually a chairman Jiang kegs absolutely where that time JK group it goes when you complain about aeroplanes so perhaps you might like to think about that next time and they're kind of talk to you about it speaking of talking to me event in st. James revenge in two years my wife and I have six children were also foster parents and I have years now and my home is always 0 I hope you realize that it's open to you as well so please find my brochure outside and have a look at ways to communicate with me abstract at my home english I am a lecturer at university I also said on academic council there are the transnational director there as well and I'm also cansada coordinator for the academic stars a little busy life there but those roles have faced new world for the job l mayor of the city I also happen to be a graduate of the Australian secure company directors and have had ethics training when it comes to a board work and also a dependent director of the aboriginal medical service now as parents and we look after people in human and above that area they're just speaking about guys I thought I might mention something to you there's a reason why I lose called Balu but I want to stand on a point of correction by our Commission on others in fact the local people here are not the varjack people they have that name so I would like to pay my respects to the big lou people or general relation of this area ok so when we think about canning and you know one of the things about being young is that it does it has had its history of troubles you know that but it is time for us to move on from that history of troubles and look at what we can do for the future a few of those things have already been mentioned by others I hope you have talk to go one of them is the problems that occur within Filipino about boats we also know about the advantages one of the problems that occurs is safety in crime we know about that we also cause it allows street parking because of element codes we have our houses that are easy to break into because of our building codes we arranged us I lived in our city in different ways so we have to look at what we've done in the past and we have to build on the great work that's happened and we do what it is you want us to do as long as dis fiscally and socially responsible thanks very much thank you Steve at its biggest Eve it was fairies come over thank you good evening and thank you for joining us here today it's wonderful to see such a large turnout and such great interests from community before going on I would like to recognize the original custodians of this land then be little younger pod people of this area before nominating for council I correspondent with some councillors and met with the mayors of two adjacent councils to ask them about their work and their role as mayors and councils the first thing I've reminded of was the importance of council as being non partisan impartial having the ability to communicate well and reach consensus for the benefit of all stakeholders and ratepayers not just a souther or award or a special interest group a council should be like a jury made up of people with open minds and without bias this became one my reasons for your motion because I believe we need a and state of the federal government I would like to be a part of that I was also reminded that the role mayor and council is not to run the city our roles are counselors to listen to you our red parents interpret what people want negotiate fair outcomes and set policy I'm pretty sure what everyone was is better value for month and fiscal sustainability for Canon Commission colors pointed out but we are living beyond our means and we will have to work hard to change that I care about delivering fiscal value sorry value in fiscal management and I would love to tell you exactly what my plan would be but the truth is that it is not until you are inside the organization that you can really understand it is easy to point out the cat appears to be spending over a hundred forty percent of spreads on staff costs while class norms and Armadale appear to be spending only sixty percent of their own sourced articles in the employee to resident ratio at Armadale also appears to be better but is this the one financial man financial problem at this stage I honestly can't tell you but as a mirror I will find out what the problems are and work to resolve them carefully sensitively and sure as a new council we will have a lot to learn and a lot to think about I believe my understanding of business and total quality management will help me do that and identify where real improvements will need to be made while avoiding some optimizing the system or making services worse our streetscapes green spaces and infill policies are another issue I care about can overall was recently reported have one of the lowest levels of tree canopy cover in Perth making it up to six degrees hotter than a leafy suburbs also meaning that ratepayers use more air conditioning and have higher costs I'm keen to change that by developing a policy to maintain our large trees regenerate our land reserves and work lead developers on a green economy but before I run out of time I would like to go back to another reason that motivated me to run for council hears we would get free iPads to me this is symbolic of spending we've should and can avoid it is a small amount but many small amounts add up to a lot so one of the first things that I would do if elected when elected is to move that we all return the iPads and start asking ourselves how we can deliver there's a value the road fails finally one more thing I learned from talking to other councillors and mares was that most of their work was not big grand projects although sometimes they were lucky enough to get one most of the work was making small careful incremental improvements in the working of council and the overall my exam results of those many improvements was the measure of their success thank you again and for being here and I Felicity to me I hope you share my feelings and will vote for me you can contact me through my website now tell they give us reference all right we've now heard from each of the mayoral candidates who are with us this evening and now time of questions and everybody's more than welcome to ask a question at this stage because these mayoral candidates will be representing all of you I think I have one down the back to us to stop yawn thank you I've got three lower given written by question the first of all is to Mindy Hollen that it might also be one that other mayoral can't abide by my part one of the key roles of doing the mere is to actually manage the council and the living today but it is not a simple exercise I'm sure the commissionable testitude you've got 11 people all strong ideas sometimes there will be disagreements many so contentious issue to deal with so first of all in Zeke hell would you bring your experience to dealing with the sort of how many and getting castle to be you think adult and you look like the first day that I do know Godfrey just so you're aware of that but the way I do with a mission school board is by missy advocating everybody got on the certain people here a locked operands who got hauling professional big money diverse backgrounds so they've all got blockers have different opinions you just got to work through you come to a consensus but also if you met which weather does become men will have to make decisions at the end of it but as I said before everybody's got an opinion and everybody's entitled to their opinion and everybody has to be equal way you come down to a consensus at the end that's why I would thank you I've got a question of the back of that one many of you have surfaced of your leg first place oh sorry Ezra Mouse cold and many of you have said you're independent of political parties however how you vote particularly for state the state government effects so much of the parameters in which any Shire can operate so I would like to know who did you vote for last time who will you vote for next time you son directed to any particular candidate or any other that just need two words you the politics when I was young and solarium Victoria Weir everyone suffered before Melbourne bone flavor I came over here and I join the light of day and after 3 b's uninvited when you leave all the do not focus cuz I speak my opinion I actually told Roman to there was but I didn't know I was having concern disease I'm currently a member of the groom's party but I certainly disagree with them on a lot of things and I think I've already on the dude only violence for them are ugly ok thank you very much they just don't make it well and you I do understand your question but I think perhaps in my case I would answer on a swing motor but in the end I think what we're all trying to emphasize as independent representatives is that we're not strongly affiliated with one particular group or another and that we will do our best for you as best we had thank you for the question down the front and then Thank You mr. commissioner my name and Christian Cunningham it's basically unsaved a process of the other one my question is how can you how can you reconcile your political affiliation with your Muriel aspirations your views will always be colored by your political masters there's only two of you candidates who were brave enough to stand up and say that you had political affiliations and I commend you for that but I really would like to hear your answers on my question thank you thank you Jesse Jenkins follow the Sun ok so I used to live in china and they had one political party and you wouldn't dare say that you from any other political parties my point is that we're in Australia we have different views we have different political organizations I don't hide that I'm consuming now I'm not ashamed of that but I know that if I'm the man of canning I will be looking after the people of cannon I don't get confused and I want to make sure you guys looked after and I've come to push comes the toes maybe state government or federal government then I will do that I'm not the type of person that hard under the table and puts my ears why my hands get my ears intezar I didn't hear that if it needs to be said for us pointing cases the 1.6 million dollars at the state government's told us that we need to pay now when I get in to get if I get if you if you let me as your men the first thing I will be doing is saying we'll hang on a minute every every other inquiry you've ever done you you've bought the tap the state garbage paid what makes it different why do we have to pay this time I got they get back hello and thank you very much for the question I believe that everybody here who is running is politically active and whether or not they actually sign up to a political party we all have our predilections now as an academic and as a teacher for over the last 25 years I've always had work and that is exactly how this man now regard to being a progressive believing in social justice the environment piece of non-violence I will always stand for those things but I do not answer to any politician of any style and if I am elected me the only people to who might be accountable be the residents and ratepayers of this thank you better before people do question they thinking and then lady behind again normal Drake congratulations to all your mayoral candidates well done putting in the time of the effort and hope you to service my only question is where were you I don't Blair was there but where were the rest of you where we were fighting satisfied in so far to say seriously I can't recall seeing many of your faces if any of your faces here the public meetings of a lot was attended we met under parliament house I can't know that you coming on the bus with us helping us movements they're careful and others but not here tonight especially your prince was a great outfit but can fighting hard for so hard represent thank you thank you ever coming to just come for internal hoping I can tell you that I did work hard to save this in your opinion you can tell you that I was in contact with lead I think they are in contact with anything for all that I can tell you I don't know how many consoles on the damn radio pardon for this it's all work during the day so I can't go to tease I don't want anybody else about it time operas or tsunami of the situation I could go to calm the enemies of court with the Commission on certain things we disagree like what but I decided how it did that's gonna take it and one of them just speak up a little bit I'm not sure that microphones make my mother thinking of their blue try again hello yes Ben sorry about that guys I was just going to say thank you for your questions are very well in line what you're really asking is it would be a that perhaps the best way for me to answer that question is to say that there are many ways that you can fight for something and not all of them a public perhaps what's more important is the way you influence others and the things you do I'm sure in my case of example commissioner whole did get some of my emails but that's not important what's important to understand is that there are many ways of finding and many of us did lots of different things and it was a combination of things that actually caused the decision that was made not just things that happen canning but all over the state so I would like to thank those people you know that you demonstrated but it also want to thank those people who work in other ways towards retain king thank you yes thank you David Harris and I just like to know whether is for you councillor come chef order they would be mez I would just like to know is there a limit to the amount of money spent I would be limit as such I think there are some disclosure requirements particularly as far as funds coming from third parties in support of a person's campaign and there's a threshold over which organ else must be disclosed I'm not personally aware of any absolute limit as to what they use vent but now see you for your information we have a register of all political donations which akin to my office and get the Memphis themes of the public group to come in and they examine that register and see what donations Thank You Helen questions the ladies down the back and then we'll come to the middle thing in the web from fern dog and just some questions to stay calm and just in the middle look at here r dot points on your flyers today I'm here just wanted it very briefly and what kind of them made then transport surcharge on rental housing and cost of underground power which is no further at this point I think you ma'am I appreciate really nice that you're reading that I can't really politician and we talked underwent some and as you know here just a couple of things there one of them that I knows what I was talking to people is that underground power will issue and once upon a time we used to be an it may still be the case I third was paid by you or third by the council neither by the state government I'm not sure that's true anymore there's also connection between others and one of the things we hopefully know is that we have to have only been para ventually the rail which we have only we pay for any mounting party is up for is that is the question that's the point I was trying to make in my very short term summary there we have to consider how we how we get the rate payers to pay that will pay their portion of it maybe they find it very very difficult so I have some plans in place we can talk about it afterwards about how we might make that more affordable or a more affordable over time about that because it is a via swagga money now the second one was about transport was it I'm sorry transport steps I trans what I mean but ok so one of the things we know about canning is that we have about 43,000 workers here but only 20 percent of them actually live here we also have lots of schools and hospitals other and what that means is that a relatively cold we also know that a lot of people have difficulty paid the transports pretty expensive so one of the things that I'm voting is that we use public transport more often now I actually by masters on public transport ratchet one part of it anyway and I can tell you that ninety percent of time probably transport drives around empty it's actually true they actually correct about as much money in fears as a cost of fuel in the bus and nothing much else so that's just crazy we've got to increase their neutralization rate of fears and one of the things we can do is you can say well why don ways we can do that we know about twenty eight percent of all of our properties are rental properties is to have a 300 surcharge and I looked at the three hundred dollars specifically there six dollars a week which is typical spin and I said okay we can head that old Antonio's in a rental properties then public transport can be free for all their residents in Canning which will have their road to have a utilization at that last so that was the plan there if you liked anything more about that please come and talk to me after Thank You Christian girlfriend in the middle sorry thank you Thank You Commissioner call now I have questions one to miss the poor monk first of all I think it's a good gesture you'd like to just have a fifty percent of your soul away now big question is have you ever faced unfair low in the past just flick the one question and we'll pass for some wheels a little would you like to respond to that can you please repeat can you please know what about an unfair go every for the laws of the depression is have you ever such unfair though I think was that is the question it no not really I think the noise is basically our own space on the Westminster stop it basically have a way to appeal and solve a problem so my gesture of putting in or cutting mine pay as a major by fifty percent is just to set up a momentum so that everybody would actually sacrifice you know everybody's a box and if everybody sacrifice then there will be no jump so everybody will be abroad is no good to see people losing your job so that is a matter everybody Plus what we call equal sacrifice not equal amount higher this area immediately more the law of the ceri a little bit equal sacrifice so that all of us and still work together but I've been using the course it has not been reducing the study the service to improve because of effectiveness and efficiency see I have actually just now he find you the problem here and I's Margaret Adams from thunder and I'm no stranger to people here I'm sure lived at this wonderful city for 43 years actually thought about running for council and so I would have been honored to be part of your group but my husband said don't you dare they married I thought I good after you person very interesting things tonight and I just like to say my concern is that we have a council that runs in harmony and hand in hand with the administration there's a lot of people can be very critical on the outside I've got to say that I am honored to have normal people like Lynn two runs lead the condition of hold row and Smith they have really done was prank what I want to know from you guys hear if I could have your hands please are you going to be combative and aggressive or are you going to work in home as you're asked a double banger question there nothing anybody could do have any other questions I've got one down the front here I think there's another lady's hand there as well thank you and though the last three questions I think for this round thank you David Harvey a question for Jesse Jenkins Jesse you you declare yourself a liberal and your campaign for mayor looks like a political campaign it's a lot of my cards around never seen-- vehicles there's a lot of money or resources being spent on your campaign so why as a liberal candidate for the man why doesn't that appear on your notices it's james stone choirs damn that us lastly between you which witch notices are we talking about well all the placards that we've seen around the suburbs the vehicles that we now seen why isn't it got I'd the Liberal candidate for mayor in cary well first of all you have to be pre-selected to do that the Liberal Party doesn't do that and I don't think it's appropriate either I've gone with my colors I'm not hiding my cars I haven't turned my colors from some from my blue I'm conservative if you want to haven't put the gifts registry any any gift that I receive from residents is that's over two hundred dollars I have put that in the registry I've also invested significant value my own money and this data shows how passion them about this job and I'm willing to give it a go I have spent a lot of time like for example today I got off work at three o'clock and I went door knocking for three hours so I am investing a significant amount of resources I don't hide that but that shows my passion for the city of camera thank you thank you lady just a little their tools I want to know what everyone thought but if I could direct it to miss Cunningham mr. Campbell preserve from my ward if you will be able to tell me you'll excuse me permission on right position on right happening and if you do support it what other revenue stream would you anticipate the end to access to care for the world to question question I don't support a break capping I I think that the city of counting needs to have the flexibility to set its own rights and since own budgets that said I'm in favor of keeping rates low but we need to remember this is a very low rating council although we've had a substantial increase we are still one of the lowest rating councils in Perm I will support a rate cap for local governments when the state government accepts a tax cap for state governments thank you think again I'd like to agree with what Blair was suggesting there I am also not supportive of a cap however I will listen to the arguments if I was in privileged enough to represent you in as a counselor in bellew or as the mare I guess for me I've spent a number of years of my life outside of Australia in two places resonate with me one of them is east timor timur there stay where I spent a year and the other is five years in south America and I've seen the and not put it in infrastructure but that's not the city of canning and our rates keep the lights on kien our bike paths working keep our parks and recreation areas growing and so I'm very very supportive of community-based services so I do believe that we have to be very careful with our rates but they are reasonably low and so at this point in time I'm not supporting the cat thank you that one of our special lady in various every other day they're your nurses cannington it's not a political question is a matter of water which is going down the drain when we went around what I want to know is what will the city of can you do with these new infill development sites do about asking people to conserve water in full of rainwater tanks or huge tanks underneath these new buildings are being built so that we are not throwing away all of these shopping centers I don't believe we've got water catchments so that they can risk water back into the shopping center for the closer to my heart I came from the country and we had to survive on rainwater tanks jalan to address a question do any particular candidate know anybody that's right enough to anybody break it up to respond but bug report you open today your question was about the water well I was at the grey house this morning and from talking to David he was telling me that they are catching all the water from underneath when pitches was it seemed to construction at the moment and I was absolutely fascinated because they're using that water and they're going to reuse the water so all the new developments that is going up in the city of cannon and the carousel where this new building is going on its new beautiful taverns going to go up convention centers it will be absolutely fabulous s what the city of cannibal at the water is already being no doubt that they are conserving it and using it updated with this morning otherwise I couldn't have told you about it thank you thank you I think we're in to say can we encourage our ratepayers who own homes to install thank you I think you've got to a message over to a bullying group of ears here thank you all right um I'll close off that Q&A session

big speaker Burgess Robin good evening and thank you for talking about it's appreciated yes I'm Robert Burgess married and I had three children and my three children have all grown up in this area in the back where yoga's daughter 35 so I've been here a while one what does this mean I'm aware of the local issues now what do I do now unretired I've been retired for 12 months two others mine so why do I what did I used to do I used to work analyzed government organizations and I'm 37 years I started as a clerk and I worked up a bit senior managing I managed up to 25 people on fridays I still catch up with whom those people for lunch on occasions I have phone calls from those people and we catch up to see how each other's going I still belong to the social club and I still attend some of the social functions what does this mean it means I can relate to people that I've work with and I've managed and that's going to help if you work on the council now I'm retired so what does that mean what do I do I walk the dog go to the gym I babysit I did some volunteer work on mondays and fridays on the local area but what does this moment in to be a counselor I probably have to drop back on some of the housework think of it back to the way but I think I can do now what I get involved with my play sport yes I Noah free to all the play sports are still do it but now my coach and I get involved and this is what it means if you get on committees and your help of the association's and if your help with the sporting committees and you do the right thing I've been on the canning Softball Association committee 15 years and I've been the chairperson for 10 of those years what does this mean it means I get involved now what's going to happen in the future is and you've probably done said it right now but this is the new face now anybody looks old but I am new to the council and I think the problems that this cancels had in the past what it means is is party looking for a new face so I thank you for your time for nine be with us here an apology right all right well we have two of those candidates for Nicholas award who are with us other than for those Cyril sustains barrel candidate would anybody like to pose the question to either federal or to Robert so many things give a question if there's no specific book yes but we here we overthinking what say you yes you don't need a microphone yesterday we're recording it Nicholson we do need to record the question oh okay figure those who are for Nicholson we would like to actually see you because I over the years of 43 years a very rarely ever seen a counselor and it's because of that this is why we don't know what's going on it's all right being in the paper but if you're not a reader of paper you don't know so we need to know who you are and we need to be involved with you thank you if that's all right come on Robertson Robertson do like to respond to it thank you for that hardly ever met my previous counselors and I was wondering why was that and they're looking into a bit more realize we have very little representation up until recently we only outlet were like one counselor on the council which made very little representation here for one counselor to walk around meet everyone in I can appreciate that hopefully now with the two councils we should be able to do that a lot more thank you Robert would you like to make you come in on them it's very hard not to agree with those comments and I agree entirely and there are some people here some people that are probably just left because their stomachs were probably running but they do recognize my face and they have seen me round about but in different forums but I agree with your comments and we will have been more upfront I have to admit I've not one for blackouts and posters I'm not one for facebook but I love vol ours so I'm pleased if anyone has any questions or comments I would love you to on that response thank you another Christmas for the middle thank you so my question Ford's to mr. robot bugga now will you please tell us for seven thirty-seven years you served for the government could you please let us know what it was and I understand you play or played sport and encouraged or what particular sport did you play again what coached did a couple days ago should be out of it and I actually work for the Water Corporation for 37 years amid throughs are not one for a change on a very on a regular basis but I p establish myself as a good employee I didn't have a lot of time off I had a hell of a lot of long service leave and annually when I left and I worked really hard to get where I was I don't have any degrees I'd have them come from universities I actually worked mile out through that organization by proving myself to the management and I got on very well with senior management and fact when I retired I actually said on of water and the chairperson of water corporation so I was pretty happy in that company I do play our sport Edea softball and I have got involved with people I have gotten involved with a great softball I've gotten involved with met sophomore and and now I this year vacation be one ladies down at stem sir but I not only do I get um of all of those sports but I get on those committees and I think it's important that you not only play and coach and talk to people but you have to do something for those committees for those associations being evolved sponsorship is one of the things I've sought for a lot of those clubs and in some amazing how much big business is prepared to give you if you need a little a little bit of support figure out of trouble because we've had a number of apologies to see think with a little bit of time of our sleep so rather than West tell me there are questions to any of our candidates for any of the wards over to you now to see if you'd like to ask any other questions and we'll see we'll have another five or ten minutes of questions if you would like that so as anything else anybody would like to race yes gentlemen wait for the microphone baseball mentioned that you were keeping a register of the candidates have received could that not be more publicly available it's a public park it's like I'm legally available document and your office which is available for inspection if you'd like to contact the city it can't bill can be made available to you pick up online I'm not sure will I think it's available at the city I think you need to contact there are we are dealing with regulations here and so I don't know the specific answer to that question but it is available as a public document it is donations over two hundred dollars coming from a third point yeah Thank You Christian Vader thank you yes I've got a general dish or later first place so Maggie heard a lot about building community and ways of doing that and how do you achieve I'm glad to hear candidates general vision for the city of canning and check through the row of us and can achieve anything you said director to anybody in particular or anyone who has a vision anybody who'd like to talk about us got a curb down the back I'd like to responses I think should be on its own hello um before living in canonizing lived in victoria park or a rose my own family and what they do they're extremely well is the arts so they have plenty of music free music festivals which are family orientated and that is something that I would my vision for canning is to bring the arts to the families in the public open spaces where families can go down they enjoy the arts with their friends and other families enjoy a picnic and that is what they did well and that's one vision for our thank you thank you us to tell the front first I think we thank you an objective thank you yeah I'm gonna so I range been stored in case you've forgotten since a startled evening I just want to point out that I'm at last night's council meeting Commissioner great actually broom emotion than the council considers requiring any new developments to include a one-percent allocation I believe on budget I wonders and out of their budgets to our community artworks to be enjoyed in the new spaces I mean that's a great initiative apparently it's in line with what a lot of other local governments and the state government does so I definitely commend that move by our commissioner and you just point out we have a lot of great events in the city of cannon but we can always have more and I think we can always increase participation in those events so that's something I definitely want to do if I was to be elected just get out there actually to be honest you won't be able to keep me away from malignant or not but get more and more people going to those else was just children and then Blair Thanks hi um in response to your question about the arts now my background I didn't mention this before my part-time job is I sing in a band and also come from a large history of performing arts my my father is an active we live just down the road and professional actor who performed from Doctor Who to Gallipoli to all kinds of things now I've got my finger on the pulse of a lot of different organizations out there and so from my point of view it's not council's job to put on events but with our finger on the pulse of different organizations out there that's where we can attract organizations whose job it is to run these events such as catch music if you ever heard of catch music that's an organization where anyone can come along if they want to play an instrument I don't know how they'll walk away at the end of the night playing an dc song or a Creed in sauna or whatever so you find that's what I would do contact organisations who can come to canning and provide those services for our community Thank You other and I think they're coming to thank you Maggie let me just say that the canning arts group does a fantastic job and our awards are also an impressive event the city accounting has had for a long time an arts acquisition policy but it hasn't had a developer contribution to public art requirements and I'm pleased that the commissioners that decided to take that up because that policy has been on my Facebook page now for about a month it is standard practice now in local governments around the area that any development over five million dollars makes a one percent contribution to public harped on the planning panel that I sit on occasionally it comes up that it's strange that these large developments in the city of counting aren't making contributions to public art I think that it's essential that we do that I think it's important that we don't just recognize sporting prowess we recognized academic should value one particular achievement over another that are all significant they should all be valued Thank You Trish I'd like to basically look at look at the whole lot whole picture I was working with big white on trying to get troubled youth into various activities one of those involving the birth football club now I'm just wasn't that I think you have to look at troubled youth and all activities if for example we can identify those people identify those skills and get them into sporting clubs cultural pubs art music and all that sort of thing and most people adopt them then that would be a great vision how we do it he's going to be very difficult but I think it can be done all you need to do is have the world was thinking okay I've got the crystal of the back and then the lady in the pink there and then a gentle down the front I'm just hoping that some of these workshops could even be reached to the homeless because there are a lot of homeless in I'd like that to the uterus thank you I'll take that as a comic rather than a question and I think we have got the comedy lady of the the frame with your legs finger yes you might say thank you I have been working with a group out on Wall Street who have just started a community garden they're feeding homeless people two times a week we've also just started a breakfast club so that hungry kids are getting a meal in the mornings school uniforms care packages for enfermo elderly and our disabled it's one of those things I am passionate about I'm a humanist I care about all segments of our community and in a city in the heart of a state this wealthy there is too much help homelessness and there is too much of that social problem out there Queens Park East cannington and Bentley so yeah I'm working on it thank you the lady in the pink have a question and then we have a genuine down the front hi I'm linda campbell um I been mentioned here at all today which is something that I think is very much the soul of this city which is a beautiful river I would love to hear from a selection of you people here to tell me what is your plan for maintaining and continuing to restore the value of that resource inner city Thank You Carol those are first and then has been fun of effectively it's an excellent question along the banks of the cane river we have an outstanding organization called greeba who do magical work the British in rosslyn Chile liaise with them but we also decisions means to people that wander the trust on water quality things like that there is a very solid basis for working with those people and enhancing what they do and also bringing on board other organizations like dolphin watch who look after our pond uthi also then we are active in the wild care aspect so that their animals live in the river also have homes I think there is probably a role for almost certainly Royal Council to perhaps look at increasing support to and particularly along for sure is big group out waiting not very long ago but it is important is that area is the jewel in our crown and it needs to be lush it needs to be healthy and it needs to be loved and respected by all those who visit or if they're so I mean we have a good basis for working thank you responsible thank you for asking such an important question having been a member of the canning rib regional park Advisory Committee for the past five years I certainly have had a lot of involvement with it in terms of use to the future I understand the working parts of it which is swan river trust city of kenning Department of Parks and Wildlife and looking at the planning as being down there is good work in terms of listening to the community but there are two major things that have to happen over the next three to five years the first one is to pick up on the huge strategic plan which will see major changes to how people access it how it continuing to tackle the exotic plants that are invading and at the same time supporting groups like so called the chemical group down there rossmoyne riverton you've got the will of the wetlands action group you've got a whole grains there you've got creeper all of those need to be supported and in the slightly longer term we've got to build up some really strong links with the city of Gosnell's because at this stage the reason regional park finishes at nicholson road and yet there's a whole stretch out there that we need to tie into together get the protection of a park that is of equal value to the ecosystem to the birds to the animals and to the water quality is equal in value to anything that kings park or any other region in perth can offer everyone you I agree to spreading the park air certainly I was just another way to spread park here along the streets of Kennington and all the other suburbs well that's my area but yeah like God I was here some of the nuisance when it comes to me and your pruning in all the rest but they don't attract birds the Queensland boxes are dead men tree not particularly suited that strength doesn't attract a lot of birds and up where I am in 78 street we've got the not indigenous to the area but the air the the West Australian flaring gums and the new holland honey is absolutely love them and they invite my backyard and I think it's fabulous I've got a backyard full of native trees ER that the birds love and that's what I wouldn't want to do plant more native trees that attract birds into the every street so that in fact the regional park is spread through the entire suburbs the entire city of canning thank you thank you hi yet a great question because there's certainly something that I've found a little bit of while I've been out and about and the development at the back part of militant is certainly one of those things there's also been a fuse you know I family day care centers and and things like that and I think what's important is that the commissioners are doing what they think is best in the same way that an elected council would do what they think is best what I've been talking about to the people who've raised concerns with me is that there's always a way maybe the decisions been made and something's gone ahead but if you really have an axe to grind if you've really got a complaint to make them the council is here to hear that there are processes in place the family day care center example I was able to find the exact wording about what the council has approved and the conditions under which has been approved and explain to the residents the process under which if they think that has been breached they can bring that to the council's attention than that an investigation will be undertaken by the environmental something-something team but that there's someone they can call if they have a concern after the fact answer decisions being made who're in without a vocal counselor but the staff here do want to hear about that kind of thing and they are here to work for us that's why we pay rates or we rent a property with it over the pay's rates so yet getting involved and just maintaining those lines of communication that's what we're all your fault thank you any final comment from any of the other candidates or I might close off the session at that time it's just pushing 930 now and we did promise to try to get you out by nine-thirty I'd like to thank you all for coming along and saying it a bit later and in particular like to thank all our candidates for their coming along this evening for their bearing their souls and for their responding to your questions those who are successful I can assure you there is an extraordinarily rigorous induction and training program which which has been carefully crafted and with hopefully with the support of those who do come in to come our people and new counselors and envious soon as possible so they're going through it all they'll go through go to the boot camp and get up to speed on the issues and the concerns of the community and some of the issues around the city of canning so that they can hit the road running a little bit quicker than might otherwise be the case I'd also like to acknowledge the passion and the commitment that everybody has shown here this evening our job is commissioners has been seeking to ready the city of Kenny please return to democracy and the elected representatives

We want the city of canning to be a fun safe and great place to live in order to make decisions about what that might be we need to work together and listen to each other when we do this well we call this effective community engagement let's talk about just what that is when a decision needs to be made about something that affects us we often have different ideas about what that should be we all have different wants and needs one of our fundamental human needs is participation which is to have a say in decisions that affect us so what is community engagement well there are two really important parts to it speaking and listening it's also not one person speaking and drowning out all other people's voices great community engagement is a two-way conversation a dialogue with a variety of voices heard and expressed ineffective community engagement you're not sure what the outcome might be when you go into it because the conversation will influence the outcome it requires speaking listening and understanding on all sides of the conversation at the organization that understands community values and priorities we recognize the need to listen and work together to co-create sustainable solutions and a city that we're proud of public input into council decision making processes is key to good governance it recognises the collective knowledge and capacity within the community to produce better outcomes we want to hear how we can improve or create services facilities and infrastructure in setting the vision and direction for the city we want to hear our communities values and priorities now and into the future as is in the case for the strategic community plan we will also engage the community under legal requirements such as the local government act planning and development act and local planning scheme to better engage our community we've chosen five guiding principles that will keep us on the right track 1 inclusiveness and accessibility to integrity 3 communication and information for evaluation and adaptability and 5 timeliness so now I'll tell you a little bit more about what we mean with each of these 1 inclusiveness and accessibility we need to ensure people affected by or opportunity to have a say to integrity this means being open to diverse views and being honest about the level of engagement being used for example is the decision really open to being influenced through the conversation or are we really just providing information about a decision that's already being made we also need to be open about how input has influenced the final decision three communication and information it's important to provide people with information so they can fully participate and be clear about why and how they can be part of it we need to make sure they're informed about the kind of constraints we have for example financial costs or planning for a future with fewer resources and growing demands upon the limited resources of our planet for evaluation and adaptability we need to learn from our projects what really worked and what didn't it's important that we document these and continually look for new ways to have a conversation with our commune in a way that they want to participate five timeliness we should allow enough time to plan and engage the decision when appropriate and that engagement is done at the right time for example not during school holidays Christmas break or at a time when the decision has already been made so these are the principles that shall guide us in our community engagement to find out more you can read our community engagement strategy which is what we want to achieve our policy how we will achieve it the plan a template to help prepare and do the engagement and our guide which is for when you need a little bit more help visit your say canning and begin the conversation

Michael cummings order ways this symbolism in the painting marks the journey of the Woggle the spirit serpent he traveled from water holds of water home the Woggle travels underground and lifts his head at each waterhole to see the direction of his travel if the wobble altered his direction the waterways would change the painting shows the different direction the wobble has taken to create these waterways
This is a story about home our home it's a story about the city of canning and our larger home planet Earth it's a story about what we need to understand and how it works in order to live a good life now and into the future let's start at the beginning here in our solar system we've got this great planet called Earth on it we have all these great things like trees and birds and beaches waves butterflies kangaroos sheep and our favorite of all people like all other forms of life people need certain things to survive over time we've got very efficient at getting these things well some of us have we want more than just survival we want to thrive to live a good life on planet Earth and here in the city of canning research done by a Chilean economist named Manfred max-neef shows that in order to really thrive human beings need more than just survival basics he spent years exploring the question of what it takes to live a good life on planet earth what he discovered're in or the time in history are experiencing we all need 9 basic things to live well subsistence we need to eat we need water protection a roof over your head a safe country to live in participation being able to have your say in how things that affect you are decided idleness having some down time lying on the beach fishing affection we need a hug we need a smile understanding learning creation might be writing or drawing or painting identity we need to belong we need to self express and freedom we need to have a choice in how we live our lives what's interesting about max Nick's research is that it differentiates between a human need and the things we do to satisfy that need needs and satisfiers are not the same thing for example if the human need is subsistence the satisfier is food if the need is affection the satisfier might be a hug if the need is understanding the satisfier might be professional development training these nine human needs a constant across all cultures but the satisfiers the ways we satisfy example the wayward Jung young are people living here two hundred and fifty years ago satisfied their needs for subsistence or participation is not the way we do it here today in the past humans would trade actual things to get their basic needs met these were the first economies nowadays most people on earth use money to purchase things they believe will meet their needs but it's interesting to notice that not one of the nine fundamental human needs is money you can't eat drink or sleep under money to keep you warm and dry you can't get a great hug from money or have a really great life with it but it can buy you food to eat a bed to sleep in entrance to a movie or a guitar money has become a convenient tool to allow things and services to move between people as they try to meet some of their fundamental needs what has remained constant is that the basis of the economy is our natural environment we use the natural resources of our planet to meet our fundamental human needs this healthy planet and our ability to have a good life it suggests a challenge to meet our needs without wrecking the home we depend upon how do we do that before moving on let's take a recap of what we've learnt so far all human beings have nine fundamental human needs the way we meet these needs it's called a satisfier we are all satisfied needs in different ways and human beings ultimately depend upon the natural environment to meet their needs if we have to be able to meet our needs without wrecking planet Earth we need to understand its operating system the rules by which the game of life is played let's think of our planet earth as a spaceship it's energy sources the Sun nothing except this energy enters nothing leaves except infrared radiation well occasionally we get a few meteor bits that crash into Earth and we send spaceships up that might not come down but we can call that negligible and altogether we have what we call a closed system for matter energy flows in from the Sun and plants the process of photosynthesis what is waste for plants is a resource for animals and vice-versa it's a dependable cycle that is underpinned a life on earth for millennia all of this happens on the only part of the earth that we can actually live on this is called the biosphere on the scale of the earth the biosphere is the thickness of the skin of an onion under this fragile living zone we have the Earth's crust we couldn't live there in the past there's been very little movement of materials from the Earth's crust into the biosphere and vice versa a few volcanoes might bring up minerals and erosion and plate tectonics over time we'll return them to the crust this system has worked well for millions of years and is the natural system that all living things have to work within so how do the ways in which we meet our needs affect this operating system turns out there are a few key rules we're breaking firstly we're taking substances from the Earth's crust and releasing them into never seen before secondly we're creating substances that are difficult for nature to break down and releasing them into our biosphere so fast that they are increasing at rates never seen before and thirdly we are physically degrading the natural ecosystems that we use to meet our needs so they are less able to provide the things we need this includes not only things like wood for guitars but larger processes like water filtration and climate regulation in turn this means that we're undermining each other's ability to meet our needs in order to address these four issues at the city of canning we've based our sustainability policy on these four principles our policy asks that when making decisions or planning for the future all offices at the city of canning work towards reducing and eventually eliminating one fossil fuel dependence and wasteful use of scarce metals and minerals reliance upon persistent chemicals and wasteful use of synthetic substances 3 encroachment upon nature for example land water wildlife bushland soil ecosystems and four conditions that systematically undermine people's ability to meet their basic human needs here are some examples to reduce our fossil fuel use we've put a geothermal or at canning Tinley sure plaques and are putting a second one at riveting ledger plaques we're putting more solar panels on Council buildings and solar hot water in sporting change rooms we're also working on energy efficiency measures throughout Council buildings to encourage staff to use more sustainable transport alternatives we've got council bikes corporate smart riders and we're in the process of purchasing a green pool pathway to reduce our use of toxic and persistent chemicals we've changed the way we manage mosquitoes to use substances that nature can break down more easily and we've stopped fertilizing some of our key River foreshores to reduce the on flow to our river systems to reduce our encroachment upon nature we're creating a framework to encourage urban infill in the city and reduce urban sprawl we govern the waste disposal of our industrial areas to reduce pollution into our waterways we work to protect maintain and expand our natural conservation areas and we do a lot of wetland wildlife we also rescue a lot of our natural wildlife such as snakes and birds to help people meet their fundamental human needs we provide a lot of aged care disability support and youth services we are working on keeping costs to our facilities low to keep them accessible for all we engage with our community on decisions that affect them and we work towards delivering their needs through the strategic community plan we provide community events and educational workshops many of our open spaces will have signage that teaches people about our local history our local culture and our environment we make people's living spaces better by monitoring noise pests and pollution so these are some of the things we're currently doing to work towards a more sustainable canning now that you understand we can do a lot more together how can you use these principles in your life in your work do

Wendell Berry said be joyful though you know all the facts so it's not about am boss Ian sort of you know pretending everything's going to be okay it may not be okay I'm not saying that but the question you have to ask yourself is this or all the things that are happening that we understand as being problematic probably happen to me are they happening for me because if they're if you think of having to you then what you have is a short end of a bunch of sticks and it's got pretty tough existence but when you realize and you understand that this is happening for us because we did it we created the situation is happening for us and for means that this is happening for our own change our own awakening for a transformation that is also unnamed and you can see that so clearly in the Occupy movement and and it's criticized just like the abolitionists you know and you're mentally you don't know what you want you know you have a turban you teach trying to peel out from the song oddity to say that somehow these people are strange and out in the problem is you're not there us again we you know all the young and students and laborers and Union people and policemen ex-soldiers current soldiers you know they're all coming together in occupied and not with violence and not with shrill demands not ideologically in order to have them they're all different if they can have them individually but collectively they're coming together in a very very different way than you've ever seen on this and where we'll end up I don't know but it's emblematic what I was writing about and talking about and as I say this movement has deep deep roots in history and our culture in our hearts and our soul and and I don't know what else to say to you other than it's so nice to see you people ask me to me while you seem optimistic and gone and I say if you read the data and you're optimistic then you're but if you meet the people out there who in a sense are humanity's immune response ecological degradation to political corruption than economic disease and you are not optimistic then you don't have a pulse because we are extraordinary I don't_''_196.34 say that to build a stop or two anyway minimize the dangers and the parallels we face I'm not at all but we have each other and the fact is that one by one by by one you know we get larger and we do and then we can larger because the tent includes everybody there's no litmus test except love care generosity you know which is hardwired in Italy thank you very much thank you very very much Paul and thank you for coming to canning and Perth for your first time we've got an opportunity for a few questions but I'm really really indebted to you for that journey back through Emerson and further back because that's some of the stuff that I really really found joyful and blessed unrest and I'm going to ask the first question is so so powerful that paul hasn't really explored is actually the title and where the timer comes from which is sort of part of where you got to in the end of your talk but I really like you to expand on where that title comes from because it is about the rage of the heart if you like in that sense so if you could just expand a little bit about that wonderful quote that the title comes from I think you should you love or you can correct the errors the quote talks about a conversation between a choreographer and their mentor and it talks about the the fact that this choreographer is really really despondent about a piece of her theater that has been put on a dance has been put on and she's talking to her mentor and the mentor basically says there is no satisfaction there is only a blessed unrest and that's the very short version because it's a much bigger bigger quote but it's really it's really a phonograph past but it's just this really resided so I will read it thank you Paul so this is a good copy this is the one that's falling apart but there is a vitality a life force and energy a quickening that is translated through you into action because there is only one of you in all time this expression is you need you have to keep open and aware directly to the urges that motivate you keep the channel open there is no satisfaction whatsoever at any time there is only this queer divine dissatisfaction a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and making us more alive than the other the government I'm pleased that was Martha Graham and Agnes de Mille and His Highness dan ellsberg actually and Martha grant had they had Cena the show that the card back from you came at six months later and it was terrible so they had this conversation at the stoop of Hunter grams back anyway right now yeah it is anything about that quote because I had several this book two years did take years to write it took years to find the title ride it until I got a title all my other books I wrote the tile kind of emerged and and and when I first started it I called it uprising and then 911 happened that's not a good title and then I I had a title called have forgotten or was it was from Zapatistas common not a Marco sues the Forgotten excluded in the uninvited I thought well poetic but little forlorn why would you pick that up and then I said I live to humor and it was called we interrupt this Empire for a special nose and but it seemed a little bit frivolous and I was in the middie actually when I found this quote and gosh when I I got back and I just need to get right here so because I felt like it had arms big enough to hold and embrace everything all of us so that's the origin of time

Thank you very very much surely it's a great honor you could be spoke of this supposed item of this evening with you with it worth your wisdom I'd like to introduce sir Gordon order of australia and a well-known person from the area Commissioner for Aboriginal planning the first of all time fav original magistrate in the state's history and as a result of the work with Aboriginal people in the communities affair she's received the order of australia in 1993 and soon it's been very active in things like sister cape which is going to talk a little bit about their growing up in Queens Park and involvement in their project thank you I don't pay them digitally and women are not allowed to anyway I don't dance I don't steam and but I do a lot of talking and I'm like Richard if people are booking me for conferences or flights on planes I say use the doctor part because I might get an upgrade and it also impresses people and and I'm fundraising so I all on it might an honorary doctorate from you WA where I did my law degree but too rigid very correct and the interesting thing about to hide if they're all related as reaching world knows but my cousin when is here to green is a mecca for a girl but Jersey currently lives in Alice Springs and so we once called New rogering new month now I it was 30 years after I was taken away that the government had kept an eye on me from the age of two with my in the negev our area and I was born on the relay station and I'm this little light-skinned desert blonde here at the age of term the government in my file is keeping an eye on me inspector so and so you know so observe in another government officer and I thank God for public servants back in the 40s because of their copybook handwriting and all their letters that they wrote and all the files have every detail possible on them and that's the only way that ever tional people like myself who were all down there was also the derogatory comments about Aboriginal mothers and Aboriginal people as well but my quick history of before I came to queens park was I was four and moment was it now James and the decision had been made even though the station people that said mum was looking after me that I was to be removed and taken to a more bigger Mogambo and somewhere along the line someone decides to like to go to my gumbo and the whole color thing and I was called an OP true under the accuracy you're either a quarter cast or an octoroon same thing half cars full blood so in a word it was decided that this little lot true shouldn't go to my gumbo should go straight to sister case so at the age of four taken from Mount Jones handed over so that's not just up the road in 1947 it's dirt tracks remount James to make it there it's about four or five hours I'm for I don't remember any of it because post-traumatic stress I'm I didn't know that her name was mrs. Webb according to my file and remembering we're still in the war years with my little ration book and I don't know where we spent the day or anything like that but night the country and western song they put on the midnight train to come to earth that's when the trains used to run for a mecca so I get to I'm not taking straight to sister kate's on take it to mount Roy East birth girls receiving home which is still there which is still owned by the Department and saw the corner of Mordor whatever the other strategies and therefore next day I'm taking her sister cater and people wonder why there's post-traumatic stress aren't fall and the girls artistic aides who looked after me who are still are Sno_``_281.63 is this skinny little kid then who's quite derogatory comments of the era skinny little Jim legs sanjeev's no laces candles hanging right down my nose this guess it belong to be taking picture this little soul and into sister kate's and about four or five years later the George kids came down the second wave of the George had also from Edith error and they were all born on the rabbit-proof fence and they would bite Farrell and I am at this now ripe old age of a dotting their mean because they're feral and I've got a good at hiding you see because I was the same because there when I got there so we were in in Queens Martin assister Cates was different to every other institution there was contact boys dormitories Castle Daire the younger boys dormitories some josephs girls home it was been doing a hell hole out there where the kids actually made and quarried and you'll all of those buildings for anyone who hasn't been to big nerd you should go just to see the buildings those kids slaved over and of course the Forgotten teens who came in with two Fairbridge so these were the institutions around earth and we were in cottage homes sister Kate had been a park at all and at the off to go live in a nunnery because she was too old so she told the church to get lost and with the farming family miss Phoebe Ruth lefroy mrs. refri bought some way the best in there and then at buckland he'll cut up there come on to that buckland hill right now all right then they bought miss Laphroaig about 40 acres in Queens Park and that went from a centre street right up to cross street and back down to watch the rope around the school what's left now is 10 acres still owed by the Uniting Church 5.35 acres of the group that I chair the older original residents and five acres which you know a group after me of bushland near the school they've got that lab they're going to build a healing center so growing up in cottages in in sister kate's sister kate's idea was that we would be raised as a little family so we had much like market all boys and girls mixed as young kids in a cottage there was a central kitchen where at a primary school age because we will then train the girls as domestics and the boys were being trained as farm hands so at tech school in the morning little grade 1 kids across to the big kitchen stand on boxes to peel the veggies now young people in here would not know an era of where he didn't have frozen vegetables and all of those sorts of they only buy potatoes that are wash in those days our boys had a farm of kindling so that you thought the potatoes up we had the joy of them washin ism or if there are new potatoes well the old women will remember this it had the little copper then you scrape the potatoes and then beans and oh you had to string the beams and slice them these you have to shell the peas now that sounds quite easy if you've got a family of two winners a hundred kids insist okay that's a lot of beans just you know just ring when you're six we went to church every day before school were always this dicate used to be there and we'd be still singing songs and aberrant go in the school that we work to hurry because we were in church in the area that I was there Aboriginal kids were not allowed to go to school by all participate demand that we be allowed into that school and that's why this older generation or sister kate's kids make so much importance on education because it is the future it was our key to getting out of lots of things but growing up in sister kate's wasn't as bad as some people think with us where's the only home you've ever known you don't have anything to measure it against we had some tough times but it was the era of the war years and people were coming out of the depression we used to think we pretty crummy meals piloti on Sunday mashed potato cabbage and tomato sauce every Sunday you could remember every meal your head and the cops came and went the housemothers came when they were usually in between husbands and the little kids and that's why they always mr. Cates kids are extremely close because we were brothers and sisters in the sense of the word and we had the farmer Ken week where we had the bigger boys where could worry Polly farmer jack and almost voice you play for East birth and they used to grow the veggies and do all the hard work and we still have trucks and veggies at sister kate's older people here tonight those have gray hair and those with the color theory still over age will remember you only had chicken at Christmas son I'd like these people today they've got to go and have chicken every day we had chicken a Christmas time but just didn't appear magically on the table now what I happened the boys is to go to the chip in and there grab whichever chucks they could catch we all went up the back of the wouldn't to watch the boys ceremoniously chop their heads off and then the boys would let the tewks run around without their heads on and off and chase you around particular people remember and chase you around with the sinews in the church liquor like that and then the girls has the unenviable job of lighting the big covers and we didn't have to pluck the trucks and gut them and then get them ready to for the court I am NOT I was really a great Chewie to a Christmas after more on there but we only had a good Christmas so the era de Mars of sister kate's to that was when we had Guy Fawkes mo live birth and we were just even our little peeping firings or whatever and we stood around this bonfire and we weren't allowed to do anything except watch and then we have all this occupational health and safety that we don't have Guy Fawkes anymore so all of those things went out the window at sister kate's square which is now our homes in off center street used to be a big meadow see how English rule of water a mirror which had a pond in it and we had cows in the mirror there is this pond and there were junkies and of course what comes with juries in swamps leeches and the boys used to get lectures and stick up on news and also as little kids we were taught how to catch juries and how to catch Julius is a big boy standing behind you say put your hand in there you know or I'll hit you so we're at catch stories and then the boys played this trick on us little kids they had a tin can know that they made and they would put two or three kids in this to canoe and push you out into the middle of the pond push you out bear in mind for sure and leave us there and walk off and we'd be screaming in this knud and slow learners here we didn't realize that actually walked out and push the middle and it wasn't even deep I think it took a few months before we go into messenger so we also had we learned about procreation and since the place that's a to delete cows have cars standard lived in welshpool road which is now factory's it was all dairy down there Stan used to walk the bullet once a year just a case that we all run around telling everybody the horns coming their setup of the fence of watched a ball like before and then talk about this at school and at Queen's power we were the bulk of the kids of the school and so I think we ran the school we were in most of the sports teams and we had a lot of benefactors top page Buffalo Lions all those people used to come and show us once a month we would have movies top edges to come because obviously in the 40 there was no television it had the wireless which stood in the corner a great big thing and so Tom pagès to come and you would see the movie tone use but not before you counted backwards if you really think everyone's remembering that ten nine eight seventy and then the movie told the copper barrel would start and you see and we'd all have a good laugh and get some food into us and then back to our houses a lot of us were taken out on weekends and I've got taken out the top edge ladies I just go to South birth and I used to go to be packed for holidays that was a long way away when you're only a little kid

And so for Emerson is what's the nature of mine what's the nature of governance what's the nature of just you know what is the nature of everything you know then how could anybody claim supremacy or dominance over another person or try bro culture how could you do that but whence does that arise that is mental sickness you know and in the sense nature become the metaphor of the mind for him and and I'm going to read you a passage from his journal at that time and he said if I go this is I was if I go into the forest I find all new and I'm described nothing has been told the screening of the wild geese never heard a thin note of the ten thousand his bold ignoring of the bystander the fall of the Flies pattern of leaves like rained angry hiss of Sundberg that credit ated at me yesterday the formation of turpentine and indeed any vegetation any animation any and all are alike undescribed each man it goes into what seems to be the first woman pipe waters for article dry leaves his grass bends and Russell's now was he in altered state of consciousness was he smoking something or is that a natural state of mind and I say that's the natural state of human life and the altered state of consciousness who is Western civilization is long but which has this delusion of separation because this is a person again who is having this extraordinary experience where somebody else's walk through it and past we would not see anything at all and when you see yourself as separate you won't see much except yourself kinda boring I mean think about it I was talking earlier about depression study came out recently and said that doesn't sound very hopeful but there was the depressed people actually have a better sense of themselves and people are happier before estimate their how good-looking they are house party at my news for you upset but it brings up this idea of hope and what I'm going to recommend you tonight is going to be so enamored when you hear but I I the future and the reason you should be hopeless this hope is the other side of fear if you don't have fear there's nothing to hope for if you have hope you are carrying your fear alone in a rucksack behind you everywhere you go and what we need to do and be is we need to be fear plus it doesn't mean we will not experience and won't confront us but we need to be fearless as we moved into this transformation because that's how to be effective and then what are we afraid of any where are we afraid of dying how stupid we're all we are that's the only thing outside of that you can count on phenomenal for sure so if we're afraid to die then we're not alive it's that simple and you're afraid to die when you think you're yourself only and so this is what this awakening is about and once you have that then you free your free and we can approach the overwhelming issues and problems that confront us fear and be full of anxiety and trepidation and approach of that way which do you choose because the problems don't care whether your joyous or morose they're still there I say sing and dance all the way right but what happened to hear going back to Emerson is that in this is this that the next point I want to make it so I thought okay you know here is this man he wrote just came back and wrote this book nature the first hippie at Harvard University was where the first people to buy the book and we david thoreau all right and any read it again invited Emerson to be the senior the speaker of the senior class graduation Emerson was the speaker Thoreau asking if you can have tea with them he went to his house in Cambridge and asked for his advice what to do and ever since said to keep a journal which he did then from that day on for 7,000 pages until he died that's where he had Walden and so many essays came out of that Journal but he was arrested for not paying the poll tax he went to jail bring a knife in a day but he did something that had never happened before and the apocryphal story was ever sin going there and saying you know Henry but what are you doing in jail and he was in Waldo what are you doing outside of gym why are you out there and in that apocryphal it didn't happen but it's a wonderful story that story is emblematic of something that happened there which is the row made going to jail honorable and it was not honorable anywhere in the world at that time you did not good why is that so important it's really important because 50 years later almost in day after two rows essay called civil disobedience is published Darcy 50 I'm in 44 years later there is a young lawyer durban south africa who's met with his Hindu and Muslim brothers and sisters and they're asked to register under the Asiatic registration act from South Africa apartheid and they elect to not register and he knows jail and he may lose his license to practice and he is gloomy in his journal he's writing in journal and I knew in his journal he's not happy this is Mohandas K Gandhi ok and a few days later somebody at the Indian times gives him to Rose essay on civil disobedience and he is overjoyed and a few days there he's arrested and he holds it up is he's going into gigolo that in ruskin and the thing about that essay is that the road never used the term civil disobedience no one knows who titled it no one knows where the term came from but it became extraordinary anthem if you will for nonviolent resistance and what he said though in SA is it when the government is unjust the just man is in jail and so for Gandhi as I thank you and then and then then 50 years after that almost you know the same thing happens again this time is a young Baptist preacher who's been asked to come to Montgomery Alabama to lead the Montgomery bus boycott and the front porch of his house is blown up with his wife and two children and he's not there and when people come from New York from civil rights leaders this new young eloquent handsome creature named Martin Luther King then go into his house and they sit down on the sofa chairs and there was a guns under everything every cushion has a rifle or pistol it's like an armed encampment and they're all like whoa whoa and they asked Martin Luther King have you ever heard of Gandhi he suggests I've heard of it we should read it you know his autobiography and so they given GandhI's autobiography and two rows essay on civil disobedience in that Sunday he's completely changed what he's saying about resistance now the reason mention he's not because you know about King and Gandhi you know to row course what I'm talking about is the people we don't know we don't know Joanna Robinson who actually brought Martin Luther King and started the boycott never heard of her but she was she person who really made that happen we don't know about friends or Rosa Parks who actually got arrested and a white cup of her send her to the Highlander school where she learned nonviolent resistance from miles Horton who learned it from Gandhi we don't know who is his person who handed Gandhi the essay we don't know who changed the title yes a syllabus videos what I'm saying here is we you and I we don't know the results of our actions those are very innocuous simple things that somebody did they had no idea their repercussions and how he would echo through history and you can run tape backwards and say what if they hadn't and who knows we don't know these are men and women I'm not trying to say they were made great by these actions but history changed because of very simple acts and the thing is what change there's no action if we do it is inconsequential the most consequential thing is in action that's so it's it's what I'm asking you know the burden of what's going wrong in the world don't do that that's all you have bad dreams you wake up to your list sir and have worse dreams but now you're awake you know what the world wants from us from you is what you love where are you respected what you have passion about that's where your effective that's where we need you to app and a reason I wrote blessed unrest and started to do this database of all these organizations in the world so you would know so we would know if you're not handling it somebody else is I tell you I guarantee r that there are millions and millions maybe 130 million people out there who are thinking and taking care and worrying and focusing energy on something that you cannot so you're going to relax into this extraordinary family of brothers and sisters are out there and you are smart and educated and courageous and fierce and kind and generous you know we don't know these people but tell you they're tribe every culture every country I'm not sure about North Korea no I'm coming yet come in generic near you soon you know the north but but we are Oh me and and we can't see ourselves and so thank goodness yours counselors are here this is fantastic and thank goodness you know circles here I think I don't know you I don't know but thank god you're here and this is what's happening you come together we connect in what we know from ecosystem science and ecology well we know about our own health about immune systems is it the way you heal the system is to connect more of it to itself it was a healing is innate we know what to do you may not have figured it out but in a deeper level we do know what to do or very intelligent we really are so again you know it's like we can relax into this

I think he ever had to add to their as well as about our personal people here's the stolen generation people such as myself those of us who are lucky enough to have found our families that that is breaking down other berries barriers within Aboriginal society and white society and because my children my grandchildren they all know who their family are now I was denied not allowed to have that for years and years and years 30 years after being taken away but my children grew up knowing through their family were once they found there are any little kids and now my grandkids and they love all their cousins to visit and everything like that now they're hold but they're all this little United Nations mark and this is the important part I've got a little or is not that Lily's 11 points bear here strawberry blonde blue eyes is going to Wesley and he goes to them would each classes every Monday that's the new my classes because he's mate goes and the school allows him to go see goes off too much classes every Monday and is so proud and this is this is the barriers that are being broken down amongst the kids and it's because they know they are there going to be whole people where a lot of the kids who are going through and the ones in the prisons have had to go through all that anger and family disruption but once people become home and they can contribute to and I mean Aboriginal people can contribute in any sphere and a council but it's just that they haven't been given the opportunities and we're only talking about three percent of the population three percent it tips if you're looking at that and say it's not a big issue if you're looking at three percent do about it's great new but the Maori people are ten percent to New Zealand with one language we are three percent of the population ended up to five hundred languages so that complexity is different so but it's about what Richard said I just finished with what Richard said know about little kids and it goes back about 18 years she's 21 now a little four-year-old ready and mine was down as a cancer kid and you know how you walk around the house and there's a four year old saying never said in edison you're saying yes lovey lovey were walking around doing all your jobs and this little kid grabbed me and she said to our patina and I sat down and she said she grabbed my face and she said listen and see that's what's missing people don't listen it's full-on listening it's not there's a little bit of listening it is it's got to be full-on listening to a person you know and we do it every one of us does it in our daily life we're half listen and if you listen to whatever itional people are saying you get a better understanding where we're all coming from and we're all totally different people rather the beverly school today I said to the kids in no way have one mouth two I thought was right I said I will remember that any other questions please well Richard does it every day tell you what we'll see the culture is evolving as well if it's not it's not still so we can keep we can keep the identity but we also expanded our belonging my my brother lost my uncle's Central Los non-aboriginal people we're in to intermarry where I'm one of the most cosmopolitan groups in this country we've got tendon aboriginals Russian aboriginals we've got French aboriginals every Duchy originals and there are first cousins and in this in these so so there's an acceptance we are very accepting in the society where Muslim a pro tools we have people are capital to practice a Jew states where r represents who are seven days Adventists we have Catholics and methodist ER there's a lot of them eat in different married you got a place like home ensburg and they they speak German its listeners and Lutheran's so you know it's if there are there are the what we's also other practices that we accept and we bring into the back so you can see a traditional which corner mirror or robbery now and there were actually pants and shorts so that's part of it it's not the dress and it's not the it's not to cuddle the skin it's actually an energy what Cora feeling or the longing that's something that everyone here has got got at the learning from another group or people or background can relate to you know that I might be Australia but I still respect my point genealogy that come from Europe in some way shape or form or South America and there's nothing wrong with that so I had this debate on the what's you name the report the bot report he said to be honest Australian as you are said you are definitely you know yours as plain as I'm working a colander but you're as Australia's the shipping and the cattle because you introduced on the strangers they can't believe you mr. Australian you still came here but you are still not your introduced species and there's nothing wrong with that because the sprayer is the title aoyama gene you're now you're now young and you where I right was that area that's the difference belong in here so that's where you can separate and you've all got the same that it's not making any difference inside your same you say we're from this area so we're all tribal din some way shape or form everyone us just like yeah it's like when Richard was talking about at the beginning of his talk earlier and when I told you about you in the mood when I was there is what you go to a function and you'll say hello to Fred speed and Helen to Tom Jones but whenever itional people go somewhere so when I was in the territory and when I've go to communities here I say Who I am where I'm from and who my family are and said people then can straightaway link up with are they related to me as a person and where I'm from and then so that's people have identified so it's just a matter of relaxing now that's our you know you get on in these places you don't just walk up and say hello see the other thing to remember about that is that one of the sciences we talk about is the science of genetics we were the forerunners engine X actually through your bloodline systems week and carry through that had strong genes that's the forum Jennings today people are studying all the university as well to try to find how you can cut off a lot of the diseases that around the place we had that there was none of that pre-settlement so that genetic structure and that's that bloodline system is still here today that is still there so it's not embraced in the medical world but it still exists so people can tell you who you can marry the ax-cut marry you stick to those rules and your family very healthy you'll read about it sometimes where a traditional person probably remember back in the 50s an old couple out of a lunar because they married wrong they just disappeared into the peasant and they came back they were found in the 70s a man seen painted main ciated means a painter that's cool man see agent and in a really bad way when they came in they didn't last long back in civilization that they were on country but that married wrong and they knew they married wrong and this would reach saying you know that people knew where all the bloodlines and even now there are still Aboriginal pep so when you really should be going with that that person and try and keep it and that's how people did it all those centuries ago any other questions please if not I'd really like to know other questions would really like to thank our rich into please long that's what I say the shots were invited impatient my wife she she's a doctor not a medical doctor but she took the philosophy and put on Clarence about all that against me I one of the things that we have there we talk about licenses but costs cultural relationships that a couple of men coming one was Tim you ahead and until bridges they debris the Sun and just enumerate Sun and it was very helpful about something like that you know a better understanding between Aboriginal people and non-aboriginal people have something like that show us could introduce into their workforce a lot of things that look at me said been talking about and we've we've come sister we come from now that night when the Tory spies it was for us they're brittle people but we come through that and we to looking at ways and mazes at which we can build a better society known for ourselves but for our children their grandchildren and great guarantees and first if you have another one of these would be good to see my Aboriginal people come along so if you knew where they were cut you send a personal invitation system I shellings now quite a bit where they are and it's in vital knowledge it's come understand each other a little better than we have in the past so like a healing thing for us and all I'm very pretty darn I think my wife is a sudden we're very appreciative being here tonight and thank you for the invitation and for our need to speak well they're not completely act a law street it's a heavenly street I'll just draw the evening till close just with a couple of messages one is our speaker series at the moment is sort of drawn to a bit of a close and then on the thirtieth of August we start the engagement process in this little flyer talks about that process it's basically stakeholder easy on the 30th Tuesday the 30 of August you're all welcome to attend and we will be doing more interaction and talking with different groups over the coming months as we move forward from there we're also very keen for people to interact with that there's a community survey online survey at the moment there's a website there if you want to have little flyer about that as well and the stakeholder workshop is being facilitated by an old friend of mine and when you say kiss you who is going to help us work through the issues of working out what are the real big topics that we want to explore as a community as we work through the Community Plan process there's opportunities to be involved in a range of processes as we move forward and booked and we'll map that out a little bit more explain them learn more boo and they'll be advertisement in the local newspaper and on a website as well around that so they're really important parts of the continuing journey for me this evening has been a little snippet into a topic that's really near and dear to for something I'm interested in it's that link I s'posed between the fact that we live in a land that has 40 or 60 thousand years of indigenous wisdom but we are in fact about the youngest multicultural country me my favorite forebears come mainly from from Britain but on the coastal plain here and really proud to have a little bit of insight about that wisdom or the Edit indigenous wisdom but it's how we actually bridge that especially when we think about the future that's what the community plan is talking about and a lot of the planning talk these days is perth going from the 1.6 or 1.7 million people that is now to 3.5 million in the next 40 odd years 2050 where three and a half million people there will be already now more than fifty percent of the population of perth doesn't come from birth they might be some other parts of western australia the most of them from other parts of australia out of other places in the world so how do we actually stream that indigenous wisdom that 40,000 or 60,000 years of special insight special sciences richard refer to you know into the way we live and work and play in this place that we call came around here or the other suburbs or greater perth and that's the journey that the community claims about it in many ways
Dennis kick it rain dragon during the Dreamtime all of the animals were arguing over which areas they came from they continued to argue when the rain dragon decided to go up to the top of the mountain and dance after performing his dance it begun to rain until it flooded the area the waters are rose to the top of the hills and the animals begun to drown only a few of the animals managed to get to the top of the mountains and survived the birds due to being able to fly above the rising waters managed to survive the most this painting depicts the rain dragon dancing to teach the rest of the animals that they came from the same land and it belonged to all of them not any one of them today he still dances causing it to rain and is now known as the Rainmaker
What happened for me was that like you circling so many of you I'm sure here you know I work for years in the environment and written about it and just like all you just did the best I can the best I could and looked at the sort of terrible odds and then said well doesn't matter this is what you're going to do it's not about when you're losing it's about actually being effective and where I couldn't be effective and in the process over several years speaking afterwards people would you know reach into the pocketed you know give me a business card you know and this is a tea bag was pretended certain death and getting a car you know and and I would take it and if I had when I give him one and needs to accumulate in my houseboat where I lived and in a drawer got full my housekeeper put in the bag and bag is in my closet and that was full and spilling out and I didn't have any to do with just couldn't just so precious but what I noticed was almost every time I got a card it was like never heard of them never heard of them never heard of that group never heard of that organization wow I didn't know that existed on that recorder wow isn't that great and wow this is a bird this is the crane association of Siberia okay and just on and on and on and so I grew up at the University of California Berkeley my father worked in library in my family Marion the librarian was a hero heroine you know we thought libraries were cool and and so and I when I was a child who went from grammar school to where my father worked and then I would just hang out stacks you know and sit down on any aisle and just plop myself down start pulling books out by the spine and reading and so either walk or library to find out how many groups are I want to know how many organizations are there out there working on the environment and social justice and they didn't know and then I tried to find out what who did know and I'm if Oxford and go personally but I went to Oxford University in Cambridge nobody knew people had tax records for those who registered and so then I took that as a challenge and I want to know what's going on here and so I started counting myself and I got to 30,000 organizations I thought okay as a lapsed Catholic I said this is this is a big as the Catholic Church this is interesting you know then we got to sixty thousand seventy five hundred thousand a hundred fifty thousand and then we gather was your anything remotely or vaguely this big you know in the world and I couldn't figure out what it would be in terms of organizations and then a kept going and it went to twenty fifty thousand five hundred thousand went to a million went to two nite organizations and and I'm still can and these organizations did that directly work on equity fairness women's issues water food climate I can list a hundred and some-odd page appendix which is the taxonomy of these groups it's just and it was so much fun you just gather the names and they said well what do they do what do they do you know and and named it just we felt like we were the first botanist of civil society we could make up our own binomials and and then the question for me is will yeah but where did it come from why are we doing it how how do we organize this way what where our roots you know then they went to to really basic things in history and there's a wonderful book by karen armstrong you know her she's x-none and she is a fantastic writer and she wrote a book called the great transformation and but she talks about the actual age between 200 and 900 BCE and he was a time of great frankly barbarity war and cruelty and in civility and during this time an extraordinary thing happened in terms of a people rising up in leaders rising up in mentions and Confucius and philosophers you know and then she calls us against the actual agent axis of change and the axis was a recognition it hadn't occurred before which is these teachers and philosophers basically we're trying to create a new human being they were looking at what we were what we were as humans and saying no we can do better than that a lot better and if you look at the readings then there's a commonality which is all of them touched upon like rabbi Hillel said he said never do something to somebody else you would not have done to yourself he said that is the Torah read it the rest is commentary right is there all teaching the same thing and in the elaborate at all but it was it was really this idea that our well-being was inseparable from other peoples and who we learn how we identified ourselves was inseparable from how we connected and treated each other they weren't interested in theocratic religions and monotheism in big cathedrals and if you really look back at this time these were social movements these this is social movement and the the kind of leapfrog to 1783 and you had the rise of the abolitionist movement in England and they were really killed and scorned and locked in his abolitionist because the fact was you know from the conservatives point of view these people didn't know what they're talking about they were going to ruin the British economy my god don't you people should not be meddling in areas that you don't understand economic area and you have to remember at that time three out of four people in the world were enslaved it wasn't just a slave trade it was three quarters of humanity and so here are people standing up saying stop and what surprised the minister's people of Parliament and other critics was through why even doing this you don't know these people if they're free you have no benefit whatsoever to yourself direct or indirect so why could you possibly waste your time to NBC because at that time the perception was that if you have a social movement it was to improve was the first time the people organize themselves to work on behalf of those whose benefit they would never share who's people whom they would never meet her no and now we do it without sticking to us we think it's normal it was not normal at that long ago so here are the two kind of roots of civil society and in in America in you know if I get into a store here I'm sorry but I think it really informs everything we do and we have to know that this isn't new this is deep in ancient in us this is oh these are core human values that were expressing you know this isn't trying to go in and metal this is about transformation this is about who we are as you and the item okay in America which is very powerful in terms of environment and social justice give you have to go back to 1832 and you have to go back to this completely sad depressed moody preacher who had lost his wife and took ups about in 1833 Christmas of Italy and so forth and de France and his name is Ralph Waldo Emerson probably don't read much about him here that he's a big deal where we come from and and he in his journals his wife is on he's young he's given up preaching the church he's given up his work he's given a family he said mess his wife dies of tuberculosis ease and hasn't recovered and he gets to Paris and he gets to two places the rod and Roy which is the Jordan Dubois and a cabinet naturally there's two one's a botanical garden like the King's garden which is a research center and the rod and Roy was a research center a major European recent research center and herbs and silviculture botany and the cabin of Natural History he goes in there and what he sees is the plants arrayed by the Jew shoe that Bernard did you do to shoot and his nephew on tom delonge did she and he sees the plants arrayed according to taxa and and Wallace and Darwin that the dishes were really for mothers of this revolution and they didn't have a name for it but there it was and then he went to the Capitol Natural History and there was again the bones the fossils the the wings the preserved wings are bird and get birds array in this way where you could see or fala G you could see evolution and you see that nitin and ever since journal these rhapsodic entries he the first time in two years it's actually has anything the sailors joyous because he sees the web of life he sees it and he's just gobsmacked do you know and he's not the first person who said that he's one of the very first to see it in the West and he he writes them and four days after well everything is nature we are part of nature this is what I was talking about in the beginning is realization that there's no separation and within you or the molecules of every species on earth in your lungs right now guarantee if they breathe it air you know oxygen and nitrogen from bono and Cleopatra else you like or don't there are you mean it is fastly interconnected in intertwined you know this illusion this delusion of separation of separateness is is just simply our eager and what we're talking about here is waking up because when we wake up then how can we treat people the way retreat and how can we treat the creatures the way between how can we treat the land and we're treating because it's our self this is an ecstatic realization not of glue

So I had a chance the zoo years ago and I was invited to go to Greenland by the Prince of Denmark and I'm an english major so I was pretty yes it's like because when we've had about the Prince of Denmark he was quite something Hamlet and and there's also princess Victor crown princess of sweden the crown prince of Dorne at a conference of Denmark and so we went to the northern part agreement to the name is research station and his extraordinary trip we went on these c-130s that were seconded to the station by the Schenectady National Guard in New York and you know there's these classic military cargo planes where you sit sideways you know not back and forwards and you have nets and ropes and you pee into a 5-gallon plastic pocket pants at the bathroom and and we landed in a place where your 500 kilometers away from the closest human artifact and all talking like candy bar wrapper and you land where there is literally nothing and there was no life there at all and just years and who knew it cold was the go-to guy when you want to know about survival and how to be there and basically gone out underdressed whiteout did that then you never do which is not is instead of staying right where it was he started to walk and walk further away and and became a double auntie you know so this is very very this is summertime very very strange environment you know minus 30 degrees scientists from all 14 different countries there for 90 days and you got to get out you know just got to get the heck out of there and what they're doing is drilling down this ice caves or drilling these ice cores down to bedrock and the bedrock and Greenland is the amean period and the e mian period is the last time on earth where it was 450 parts per million which is at the present rate of greenhouse gas emissions we will be before 2050 and it's amazing in one hand you go down this thing you see six stories down the slippery ice and and these ice a lubricant I have no idea why but cuts they don't use mineral oil they use vegetable lubricant and so it comes up look look look 11 is white bubbling liquid coming from you know a mile down and the ice and it's kind of like a bee Hollywood movie looking doubt it what else is going to come up from their head and and take these ice cores which I about as tall as a florist to the ceiling here and then lay the knob horizontally and then they you can run these down on cathodes these readouts and you run them very slowly and and get this extraordinary you know history after of what was going on on earth at that time and he was like okay they stop you see this is look at the sofa aerosols this was a volcano but this was southern hemisphere and and how do we know that because we work with our colleagues in the Arctic and they also have the same thing 1328 something happened down south you know in terms of volcanic activity and in pollen in that time when they got down to 8,000 feet and sort of the Union period is that there was hippopotami lounging in the swamps of the Thames River ocean was 13 20 feet higher giraffes and lions and zebras were gallivanting around Germany that way alligators were munching in Alaska I mean this was a very different period and I'm just saying is like what they're saying is well that was the last time I was 450 ppm accept differences that dhoni mian period it didn't rise that fast it didn't go to that level as quickly so again we have unknowns here in terms of climate change now the these forces you know these are all I've come about because of us so it's not like I'm not pointing fingers here if I am I'm pointing at myself and and this is what we've done but but I also think in 22 marks introduction that we consistently underestimate the gravity and the severity of the situation that we face I also think in why I wrote Lester the mast that so because for some reason it doesn't seem to be an interesting story for the media what's interesting is scandal and corruption and false and grace and and and God all know what up soon and and that seems to be that dominates you know what we hear about ourselves and but underneath all that something very different is happening the reason I wrote blessed unrest was the same reason I write any book which is to learn not because I know but to learn to ask a question and when I wrote that to capitalism with Amy lovins my question was what happens to a society to economy to a civilization when the limiting factor to human prosperity and development is natural capital you know forest five or water topsoil fisheries you know all the things they provide the sustain life you know and when the limiting factor from the industrial age up until recently was human-made capital and schools and roads and infrastructure and in hospitals those are the limiting factors to human well-being but now we are moving to another age in which the limiting do and the thing about human beings is you know they have always Justin adapted it changed to focus on what the limiting factor is and it really goes back to sustainability itself which is that sustainability is hardwired it's an eight it's not something that is really conceptual for us and I understand there's a tiger snake out here just you know not here but right outside and if I ask you to go pick it up you know you won't_''_423.82 and that's because you're interested in your sustainability that's what I'm talking about with sustainability is what we do an interview individual level which is we always take that action do we think furthers our life and our survival in our this this is common sense but when we have a situation where our individual actions do not collectively support to sustainability of us as individuals or as a whole and so there is the tension the tension really isn't in the concept the tension is in the fact that collectively certain people sometimes many and to certain stand degradation we benefit from an economy that tells this is cheaper to destroy the earth in real time that's because that's what the economic signals are right and so as we have become aware of that the question is how do we change that how do we change that in such a way that we actually not go backwards so because we're not going to do that there's too many of us how do we do that in such a way that we actually improve the quality of life for everyone so sustainability is not fixed it's not an add-on it's not a tweak you know it's really about to reimagine ation of what it means to be a human being in relationship to living systems and at the very core of that is actually perception see being it's not doing its being what I mean by that is that the the only difference between people say who talked about sustainability and and in practice it and perhaps those who do not yet is that they are looking at the world at this is not so hard to do because children born that way this is again innate when you who are parents or siblings you know certainly remember the young child you know 8 months 10 months 12 on sat at some point he or she then utters their first word and it's just you know it's it's like a miracle every time it happens it really and it is because that child has been hearing language and the language is all over the map and it's melodic staccato and sometimes is baby talk and most of time it's not and the child although not able to express themselves is actually looking at facial characteristics and gestures that happens the sound all these things are going into a child and registering big time and out of that comes this first utterance you know mama like big success you know ball or cat or whatever it is and pretty soon the stream words together and then her sentences and sold well the child wouldn't be able to do this unless they were perceiving the sound listen how could you possibly learn language from unbroken streams or sun but they do can do and so this ability is innate and it takes about 12 to 16 years and three hundred thousand dollars to teach children not to think this way and to teach them that everything is separate and did you need to specialize and it's silos and that this doesn't have any under of that and that the world is actually disconnected surprise surprise you know you didn't get that well you know you got a nap and we'll work with you on that I mean because if you look at like in my country like four years ago we put a man and an electric car in the moon pretty good you know think about it and we still don't have electric cars in Los Angeles you know so you have to ask yourself what is the difference because it's the same people and so therefore it's really about NASA was thinking systemically and you know Los Angeles until recently it's really changed was not you know you know making these connections but it's deeper than that and the real disease I think in this world I'm not talking about medical diseases but of our being is this idea that the wildly between modernity and nature that the somehow that nature is outside the window that's nature we are people and citizens accounting or whatever you know to somehow that there are two different things and when you really look at all all indigenous cultures they never made that distinction then it didn't even occur to them but they didn't even know that it is a distinction and they were right we are nature everything we do is nature and that is a more of a realization it's not a concept and that realization is best have frankly outdoors but it doesn't matter how when it happens and that change is is is astonishing in terms of then how you literally see the world because you're seeing a very very different world and so this movement that we talked about this unnamed movement that combines ind Anjaneya and social leaving time to in a sense put these back together because in indigenous cultures the idea of social justice and environment being again this thing's are separate is incomprehensible because what you do the land you do to these people and what you do to people is going to affect the land and this is like obvious and you've seen it historic
My name is very creepy I have a ver at the good fortune to be involved in local government and media for the last 20 years it's acacia wood counselor deputy mayor and then eight years as men I decided to run for local government to become a counselor basically because someone asked me to there was a very major environmental issue running in our community at the time and a lot of us were very concerned about the direction that the community was going my own background had been in working with the community and I thought that I could make a contribution I guess what motivated me was the sense that sometimes if you really want to change things you have to be prepared to be part of that change so the motivation basically was I wanted to try and make a difference so my experience of local government there's 20 years in local government aid of those as mayor and two popular elected elections but the first few years I think were quite critical and I learned a lot in that period that I think local government like many people do because of a particular issue the first thing you learn is to really keep your mind open because you might have a concern about one thing but when you get into local government you realize the local government has to deal with a multitude of things I think there's something like 149 X that the local government has to answer to as a counselor you're really the tip of the iceberg are the amount of work that goes on with the staff is just so significant and I guess one of the things I learned very quickly is that I was on a steep learning curve yes I had a professional career yes I'd lived in the community yes I really thought I could make a difference but I was only going to be effective if I realized two things those things were I had to persuade others to my way of thinking so that the vote carries in the chamber and the second thing was I had to be prepared to learn about what the enormous roles were that were with just one fixed idea really limits how effective you could be and one of the good things about local government now is it does provide a huge amount of in-house training and also training both through the Local Government Association and other sources now I know there's been a lot of debate about whether counselors should have have mandatory training but I would say any intelligent person would understand if you enter a whole new world our common sense would tell you that the more you learn the more you understand the greater the impact you could make if you're going to go to all the trouble to be elected to serve your community and surely you owe that community to be the best counselor that you could be there are so many things I've enjoyed about being in local government I won't be Pollyanna and say that it was all easy it wasn't_''_216.55 I think the first year I was on the losing side of a 93 vote for just about every item because of the the mixture of people on counseling the aren't going to get your own way and that's when I learned very quickly that you had to really persuade people to your way of thinking you couldn't believe them you couldn't just talk at them you had to really have a good argument and and then I guess the next most important thing was the establishment of relationships you don't have to like and socialize with everyone you work with but you do really need to respect them and their point of view and I think the more you show respect them or you get respect it's interesting now the research that's being done ah that when you show respect it has a physiological effect on people and that's now well documented conversely when you show disrespect at has a negative in there so as well as being prepared to learn think that I guess helped me the most and made my time in local government so enjoyable was an understanding but it's all about the relationships about the relationships with your colleagues on council you know they're not been elected by the community they hold a very unique position the relationship with the CEO absolutely fundamentally important if the relationship between the council and the CEO is working in your off to a flying start and while the counselors are not involved in the operational issues with the staff having a way of showing you respect for the work the staff do is so important this of course all goes to what we're talking about basically is leadership are you are an elected leader but being Elizabeth does not give you permission to be rude disrespectful or think you know everything doodlee does learn so I think counselors in this era are really now understand that they have a huge responsibility to develop themselves as leaders not just in terms of that I have authority because you don't you have an obligation now you have responsibilities I was recently talking to a counselor who had helped to mentor and she was so excited that she had got a significant policy through a huge research consultation with the staff engagement with the local councillors and what we effect on the community for many years to come that's what that's what being a counselor is about it's having those kinds of skills to research negotiate persuade listen but then having the courage to say I think this is the direction we need to be going how can we collectively do that and when you find people who are prepared to do that working with them is a sheer joy you are really coming in with a fresh start and that's it's going to be an enormous privilege because you're going to pioneer a new way and you have a terrific foundation to build on so I personally want to wish you well you can do so much for the community if you equip yourself with the right tools to do that if you enjoy learning if you enjoy people if you enjoy seeing things really well achieved we'll find local governments of a fantastic you you
Thank you very much so it was a wonderful journey through three Queens Park and around Australia in any way and through a through a life of challenges I wonder whether Richardson would take a few questions either you can come up here if you like to use a speaker it but if there's some questions please if anyone's got a question for ritual soup actually sound gone home because of the impending bad well so she can't take officials anyway I guess please what time just to dr. subordinate just tell us what what is the healing center and what what's it all about what does it mean it sounds intriguing about what is it well I don't actually know it's the younger sister Kate keys they're just in the middle of setting up their foundation and obviously they'll have to come from Council I believe that the healing center will be a place where they'll invite academics and others to come in to help with some healing programs and by that henan the delay work was work as a to Canada and I think she's brought back some ideas from kennett Canada with the first peoples up there and I think it's to take the form of counseling of people and other methods of healing but the way the older home kids sister kate's kids heal ourselves is through the various trips that we do and the get-togethers we have so we might go away on a bus trip and have an overnight so we'll have a good meal few charges and go and see the wildflowers and just all have a good time together and just getting together and spending a day together is a great way to heal because you're all on the same level and you're talking about your past you're talking about which all about growth growing up and I'll give you the best example of that healing is we went to the hundredth anniversary of the Queen's Park Primary School I think it was 2005 and I gave a talk on behalf of a sister kate's kids and one boy one boy man came thought it was a boarding school we used to love coming there to play with you see so even then people didn't understand what was happening to us they just could thought these kids were in a boarding snap the other Christians and some are really simple one which is what can the city do more for the community there has been obviously some things over the years but but part of our challenges to go through the process of the community painting set and talk more with different groups follow the national level one of the things that I was pushing was to try and I suppose I've been I board with Ricky the CEO at welcome well I got one difficult wa doko government to ascertain Association and would like to see the various councils around Australia encourage more local Aboriginal people to stand across Australia we've had a lot of additional shy presidents we've had quite a few Aboriginal counselors but not enough because I see it as a way of Aboriginal people in the community who are capable of being on the local barriers and you can see I mean even in horse creek when Josie far was the Shire president up there people never thought anything of it because the bulk of the people in halls creek are black belts but down here white colors are more than breakfast and it would sometimes feel awed I suppose so I just think council should be encouraging more Aboriginal people to to stand for Council not just a single person one or two although sadly too I know and I won't say it wasn't this one this council but I do know of a couple of councils who when Aboriginal peoples decided to stand various factors in this country town pulled their numbers against this person and encouraged everyone not to vote for the black fella and that's quite sad really I mean as surely see we all live here and things have changed remarkably and we really have to get past all of that and break down those barriers because it's the barriers that are put up by individuals without thinking about it you cuddly enough areas as llega mother care program that there's a number of things but first of all look at look at your own constitution what you were in your guidelines are you operating or what are you guidelines and you find that is inclusive of the community yet when we took at averagely issues we put it on a site at night as inclusive I think it should be all inclusive first that's a first forget about Aboriginal Italian German French whatever it may be we as of people and and be to gain the two difference between the cultures and so notice quite well and most it would do on a council that the things like responsibilities and and and the legislation laws that you operate under is that the Western world operates under from looking at the weakest links so you will cover all corners in case someone starts a fire or do something silly you look at whatever the silliest person can do and you'll cover that in the wall whereas in our society we look towards we used to look towards the ones who can actually two different ways of operating so our councils were made of not those through collectible but those are actually that whole stuff so that those who did then transgress we're actually isolated and we'll felt to be isolated in that way so I think the likes o same to get to know how you as a council can improve your own operations and say well let's look at some of the indigenous neither do science that's behind some of the practice that's been for thousands of years we may be able to incorporate into our practice rather than saying well we've got a right because you judge of society on it's too big buildings any society can be judged on its too big buildings and the biggest buildings in most societies and in most towns of most cities are the hospitals and jails and if you come from a society that did not either of those there must be something that that society can contribute to the mental well-being of a society because it's your mental well-being that actually stops lot of into the air into your health and which took the work while being sent us we will we were round and will visit our well-being tenders were our family and our existence that was a wellbeing centre and like Suzanne you take someone away from that wellbeing centre and you've got a lot of things as to meant to actually get back to that place and like auntie Shirley are very lucky to be brought up in the bush and brought up this my family but my older brother was a part of sister cakes and we didn't cited medium to last 22 yet every every Saturday every Saturday talk about five saturdays a year but God to sister kate's me and my mom in a taxi with a bag full of lollies and a bag full of clothes to see my brother on a Saturday and we never ever story because that always say he's gone away on a Sunday there's the dress him up after I'll spank you until you meet your parents are coming today to see you and of course because we're there on a Saturday all day that's the sort of thing to do to my brother took me five years to convince him videos taken away not given away five years so we were very angry that there may be this calmness and diplomacy irrelephant there's also a lot of anger amongst our people amongst our young people very very angry because I can tell you these stories you go wow I didn't know about that how people are living that that's why we have a lot of the antisocial behavior there's a lot of anger out there we must address that anger it's not been addressed by building bigger gels and and war gels there is there is a way of looking at it in the community of rear dressings people well-being and their balance and that's not just an Aboriginal think it can work for everyone it is an Aboriginal method that if it's incorporated into the Indians of society is for all of us and if you go back long enough yet sides not only the as well the kelps out in there there's people in different parts of Asia out the different parts of world lot of the ancient practices were exactly about that about respect balance and well-being and I think that's you know that's something that the council can actually look at it's a it's a big picture but life's always talking about here we are big picture people hold on the australia centenary Federation Council look at how we can do things in the big picture because whilst we've got that umbrella view then small things in the place like auntie Shirley says talking to people saying hello looking at everyday issues makes a big difference simply serving someone because they were the first ones in the shop we have number of times and we've been looked upon people going to be served for stupid hidden eyes you know the Aboriginal people how to relate to so there's a lot of these issues that there are simple things but I think councils now have also are very mature and also looking at looking really good and this is a great example you've actually you're a long way down the road by actually speaking and interesting issues and other councils will take notice of this sort of stuff when you say them this is what we got from it and I think that's that's very important because when we peel away the other things what we talk about is the difference is now we've got a lot of things we can put in common whether we dock as a regroup we have say debates amongst family and among friends we do have this whether we like curries or the chickens or the porter there are things we can have in common that we can provide ourselves up and bobbing with a briefing you know my sister when will be the bridge consists of all the bill sooner would be a good group over here that we have differences as well but will it be be more common with you in those likes and dislikes and face and those are sort of things by saying by getting on councils and start to realize hang on I can talk there's people that more than just the aboriginal issue but we can address that while we do this and incorporate some of the aboriginal
And then when I was in high school on fast-forwarding when I was in high school of we started to get sent out the girls to work training us for we were old enough to get sent out so long the time you ran up a primary school if you'd work to his well thats cool you work out as a domestic kids as young as 12 and 13 were out being housekeepers on farms and there was abuse of some of those kids out there but sister case was a charitable institution couldn't afford to keep the kids there my father committed suicide in 51 and then the government had to make this decision and as a hold of a law degree I still find a brother strange I had been declared a native and a quadroon when I was taken away under the law the native app and then when my father died their Native Affairs Department decided we can't give sister kate's a subsidy anymore because she's now a lot of native so the decision was that sister kate's had to other kids and having me declared destitute and make me a ward of the state I didn't know what it was all about artists at the Children's Court thinking what what avoiding doing here and some bloke up on the dead said what state award that was so that the department could their pay a subsidy from the ancestor case because the Department of Native Affairs didn't want to pay the subsidy which was I think three and six a year or something and so I was suddenly not a native and when I do my law degree I did research on this and wrote a paper saying really now take the government to court for false imprisonment for 10 years I mean if Cornelia ral can do it how can I at ten years but I didn't do anything because my son my youngest son who is a partner of nelson seated I think you have to think about whether we could lose your house in costs whenever we take the government of course I would put that one aside so that's what the time I got to high school I put my head down because I knew I didn't want to be a domestic I still hate housework and no I am I doing that but we used to get sent out on the school holidays and mostly centered only very flesh house and the owners of a liquor store in perth so I used to get sent there when the other sister Katie was set to off on holidays but a sister Kate to keep nibbling on holidays I just went to live with another sister k kid because they didn't learn enough to go on holiday so I meant then I never got paid and are you always there just to look after these two absolutely rotten spoiled kids and what there were those Joseph's kids and other sister kate's kids in the Dell clean peppermint grove area all doing what I was doing on the long school holidays babysitting and they all in those days have gray tific English black pants people will remember them absolutely wonderful parents of beautiful suspension the we used to put keep I think they killed us it found that other there so I did that for a while but at the end of my that one year there my first year the owner of this shop took me in and he said to me you can have whatever you like on this side of a stall which to me was like Christmas because when you have grown up in an institution where everything is second-hand to be able to say that has something new I didn't know what but I've been thinking about this and I was in third year of high school so I said to him and this is summer mind you at the end of the law school holidays I said I would like that three-quarter-length suede jacket and he sort of probably apply do you want that I was thinking from into the next year because I was about to go to business college and I never had coach and so that's what I want you to have my coat ready for next year I didn't care about pretty dresses or anything a timing teacher who took an interest in me got me a seat for scholarships to Underwood's which now load no longer exists it used to be above beds which no longer exists and at the back of the off bench they're building is still there this is some shows your age nothing's there and so I went to Underwood's and for those people here who may have short and I still have my shorthand for homework we had to go home and take down ABC News that was your homework in short head but I was there with girls from very posh families and they guarantee you a job and I went off to the calm of Bureau of census and statistics now known as a BS and it was a year of the census and I did nothing for three months except Piper who lived in this house how many people how many ships and dogs and then I got sent to skipper dhoni Motor Company and as a shorthand typist and supervised I was still growing from sister kate's each day sister because once you started work ahead to leave there was no way they could keep you there and it was very hard I didn't have anywhere I didn't have a family I was told I was an orphan and so sending how could I get away from this but its capability a little 9 16 year old I was madly in love with the huge car salesman because I thought they were certain that must be important how gullible owner I am sure so they bought me my first scooter which are very trendy and fashionable now but I had a Vesper in nineteen sixty year sixty hatchling and so then looking for accommodation became a nightmare and I wrote to the department because I'm estate Ward and I said please don't tell sister case so I get home with weeks later for the Mabel and I'm dragged to the office to us why am I right into the department I told them to keep confidence but they didn't do that and I want to replace with no kids I said when you grown peace and quiet so can find any and I'm in francis street one day and games one barracks is not fun barracks it's a youth or still I saw this poster I've joined the army and I thought I can do that and I went in and found out they were going to pay me send me to sit then you know where that was and give me uniforms and it's another institution it wasn't anything to worry about so I joined with five other girls and I'm still best friends with those five girls in 61 we jointly a woman's Australian Army Corps and we were signals so that was that was my getting out of sister case but the full circle has turned and about Ted in 1988 we decided to loosely form ourselves to try and get some land Beckett's indicator because the church had let it run down and I say that to the church themselves and successive aboriginal groups and so we started to in 2001 ask the church for a release the in our group we we found your education so that we had eight lawyers which are children promises to case or their children so we looked at the leases and we didn't want that so we went to the indigenous land corporation who brought two persons of layered one for us and one for the younger kids and the reason they bought the land for us is because we are classed as the dispossessed of our land because we were taken away and so we represent all regions of Western Australia so if they've bought the land and we have them fought for years that people who believed in us and we now have 10 trillion eight persons units above people in most of the units I've got a five bedroom unit we've renovated one of the cottages we've got the place of the sprinkler system all the work is voluntary by our members this is 82 she sits a little cheer and her job is to read the rose beds near the chapel no one else doesn't_''_543.279 as well as she does Tom Hanson his wife junior high 20 bit more edgy patches and so everyone's very active they have carers we've got all the money through various submissions that I've made with our little community to do our chapel let er buck ridge has been excellently rewired our chapel did the roof rewired the chapel for free in the roof at cost it's just looking beautiful and if anyone wants to come out one day they need to ring out first or you know can't just give you a number now because we're not the office is not open every day we just have as apple tree I go out a couple days a week and my niece does our newsletter bio monthly but we're all happy because children most of us it's the only home most of the sea
But the good news is 30 years after I was taken away when I like it in the northwest Aboriginal people in Roman where I was working said to me that I do have a family and so they started a long slow process of telling me where my family was and it wasn't_''_25.84 that was in the early seventies and it wasn't talked about 1977 that a cheeky young 16 year old nephew of mine auct into the Commonwealth employment service and said I'm your nephew us and apathy family you know but I've been working for NASA income Adam at the Trading Station and I played basketball gifts or cousins but they were children embarrassed to talk to me in the 60s so when my nephew or something rang a bell and I said come back at lunchtime okay babe and I said if I got a brother called Joe who's known as the way and he said yes that's my uncle so that was Wednesday Friday night were in the car and with my two kids who were primary school we cousins who I didn't know and driving to mia farrow 12 hours away and it was the Gymkhana race weekend and suddenly I'm meeting a thousand relatives as Richard said we've got so many family and it was very emotional with my mother so I affect my mum for 11 years but only in recent years my cousin when and I were coming back from a funeral in meekatharra or a meeting in May kythera and she's driving and I'm writing again all the family history I could possibly get out of Gwen going right back to the English Edwards who are all from so it's like it's been a long roundabout journey but we've got all the kids sophisticated back we're part of a queen's park community where we still have our annual fete we've revived that three years big fundraiser we have good supporters and from our own fundraising because we're a self-help charitable organization we don't get government funding to run things we have paid for all of bonds all the vertical blinds and we've paid for three fans in each unit we have paid for shower curtains and through a donation from hendra virus with a water tanks rainwater tanks in all the units and so that's the sort of way we've been raising funds as a self-help organization and our younger members and our grantees or coming on board to help us so that's the sort of thing that we've done in this big full circle but my own family which Richard when a part of in mega Thera and I mean gwynnie and I'm tripping up to me kythera but it's too dangerous now because there's so many big trucks on the know how to say to quit I'm reluctant now to drive my elder son says you're not driving in that little thing I've got a high or do I 30 not driving all that way it's like 11 hours so he leaves the he's before we will drive you but even that's not a match for some of those big trucks with three or four bus but the good thing about my family is the the acceptance of me back into my family you know I know that I was accepted back a couple years ago when you organize that things there because there's native title in different areas and aboriginal groups and families and the with mining as under the native title act everyone is required to do and so we put on part of the big energy torturing land claim but my family through when they are speed to be on the negotiating team with crosslands mining to go to the meetings and as my older brother said to me said we know the country but you can talk so how useful for something so that's the full service I don't you a whole person because I know my family and as Richard said we've been here for 14 or thousand years the 12 months that I spent working in the Northern Territory general Chalmers said to me we went round to all these 73 prescribed communities in doesn't matter where we go so much related to you there and people were up in arms about business of this not necessarily at us and whenever is your lady stood up and she came out she just told him to all shut up and she said you don't know this girl she's that I've been talking this girl I've been talking to this girl and she said she's in her family and everyone's they required then and so she was talking about how everyone is connected back through the Sun lines back over to the me fera area through our always XO there after that everyone's quite happy as Richard said once people know who you are it's not the name or the middle or any of those things I mean even when I was a magistrate nor finish year I was doing a big inquiry and I had to travel around Western Australia in Gordon inquiry in 2002 and I got out to Warburton and I know the lands people and I knew that as a woman I would be last at the big meeting to talk so I said women and we'll just wait now I have a young lawyer with me and a seasoned another way Aboriginal lady who knew Aboriginal communities of the white royalty and I said to this young lawyer sit here try and be quiet because the men will all be speaking first I said just watch out for occasional dog fights in them don't ever go everywhere I was kids frightened anyway we just got on the ground 2002 I could still get up and down off the ground reasonably well that it hard now but I've just got comfortable in the dirt educator in the dirt and the chair person says well we think this this inquiry that serves doing is very important so we don't ask her to come speak first clue I'm so can up off the ground and it was traveling out of order because you know Aboriginal society is a male-dominated society and I always respect that so it's it's never mattered what a title I've got I know I'm an Aboriginal woman and if I'm at a'm there to do a job people then put you in to do that job

my granny you all this kind of information so one of the things I heard that would be a big part of the future for our people that kill me in a human I say our people I mean everybody because everybody in the community makes the future in Iran ways we all do so much and we can accomplish a lot while holding hands and walking together yeah yeah the amazing thing that come out a lot of things just quite recently we had what we call an eye doctor a Bentley hospital and they want some information about everything people intense and we went down to Southwest everything lantic City Council and they started doing some research and today I'm very proud to stand up upon T and say that research is open so many doors for so many of careful and just making our people and I say our people the Aboriginal people safe route because they're wiping out things that they didn't you about the history I was struggling gives one of the same actors go back a long long way as what you said and in my mind to get back I wondered what happened yes because there is getting proof is being found in different parts of Australia our old Australia rid of his and how long to spin around and I'm getting very nervous I'm like you're standing at the front and talking I hope that can share shy because they've already proven that they can do it by just a simple act of paper three original Poquette to knowledge of talking and we were waiting to see who else is going to be up here but being target now it's only three original people and that's quite an achievement for any Shrive to do and there are so many doors that are open today that are making differences to our people we've been given quite a record of what people think we are and how does it we should be and where they think we belong and half but one of the things that's happened with me I sworn and yet I know where my country is where I am Who I am and what I have to be proud of and that's a mighty mighty saw it record I know I have family event up in prison and things like that and not even proud of those ones because what they did they stop with their kids to make sure what their kids could exist in them and be I gotta grow up education and be something within community oh yeah I did have other plans of talking but after christmas in georgia know what I was going to say is running out the window when your window so it flies away very quickly didn't but I really am proud of the involvement that my husband's had he would shower over many years and an effect involvement we together for some band on what was the original model reserved to run an organization and unfortunately is not here it was been a very proud person if he was here tonight because it was easy and objective to bring people together and to be tea lee yong he got talking and being with people oh yeah we'd love to see this fantasy carry on and if we meet each other on the street sake of it has I wouldn't smoke as a long way because we never know when someone's very depressed and ready to go and do something for bishop and some are saying how I can make such a big big difference it opens it lets you know to some kids without the suavity to say hello to you and not ignore you and look at it because one of the things I've been doing as an Aboriginal woman is sitting down and thinking to muscle and writing little he said and one things are right there was did anybody see me today as I walked past I've showed it one quarter on the street for two health nobody spoke to me nobody said hello don't they say yes or is it kind of asking that they don't want to see simple things like that because of the history that we had behind us but't able to go to school way I wanted to I had to be reporting and I end up in braids by as it was me and never completed education because we went from one school to another and today we have children's in university learning to be architects doctors and nurses you name it they're trying to achieve so we have a lot to be thankful for today and then comes something you can all achieve when we become one and talk to each other and you know it never thank you very much
Thanks very much like a federal acknowledged sham my answer and the elders here at parts and also speak of it in your language and of course I'll interpret for you to english margera Delano doing them now Abuja not get any of your marble yeah well what would ya Iowa it's good to see you in the land of our people at school you have people would say my peoples country Marlon you're going up and up getting them now again corridor paladin podium now I'm not running in confining put on I oh I plan your landline brought on by video so I good spirit doesn't everyone the cork encourages come to learn and listen absorb when I was speaking with my RT speaks festival so my sister that she speaks speaks later mum and get I got up and I walk or what I wanna know more tire and say witnesses face Medusa to take you safely back home to your families um titles are a wonderful thing when you look at the titles is when I go to different places they reporter of Australian occur and what they call is a the indigenous leader of the year bevel cover things like that titles are really rolled into where you are and what you're doing where you're presenting so in this area real life title is and he surely flesh you just give us closer familiar else here and I'll tell you a little story about that is one of my big introductions was going back into one of the desert communities and in the desert community they did this like I worked already introduction is titled two very important that your that your brand of the person of who you are and whilst I didn't is one for the introduction as a doctor or of Australia travel around the world charity Australia Council and the total was quite elaborate be stayin on these people in the community and one of the old ladies just leave across the nose if that's Madeline's bra that hope was up early oh then you work within that community because of more important being medleys rather than all the other to within that area in that community I am original within the council boundaries and I'm a good person being there for many many years and so I think the perspectives that are quite important I want to get you sit sit with some simplicities for you simplicity is the most complex thing you can actually address and when we look at our culture our culture looks so simple they look the drawings will have so many times and listen up ladies people say why are kids can you leave like that well they hear our stories are so they're wonderful stories but there's actually some big meanings within the simple stories all they say the dancers are so simple dances until actually trailer I will demonstrate to you first before I started out that complex of simplicity we may look as a simple people or simple race of people but we are extremely complex on a little exercise to you and all your required and follow me in these exercise the first one is two hands you want to energy to join me now the first put a thumb up like that it's up to you your point it's up to you you can tell any child of any person only adult in the be successful is up to you now reverse that factor times now that is very simple the other part of the initial capital the knowledge we we have we have is passed to us how old is this another link from this one here it's important what we know of you knows and it's important to us you know so you can I use a reverse about that that to me is simple you don't need any tools you don't need any exercises you just need to practice it for a little while and you also find that if you're working on a brand or you working on any presentation the the challenge is to is to get all this information material and hold it down to something simple that you can actually have as a tag so when you're looking for your mission statements you actually have these big workshops and so within is a one liner or you come under the logo which represents your whole company from us to think if you make it should be simple and you know that secret or logo your 0r down it looks pretty good on a literate that big it's a good layer simplicity is complex our culture at home down simplicity and how we can use things in a simple term for thousands of years it is a science it is not child's play abra to philosophy a little culture isn't science and if you study that steady rhythm you will find that all these actions and all the reasons for the actions have a much complex data behind them he's been gone for thousands of years and so there's two types of currencies that we have and those of us well we're the first ones an economical currency that you can gauge your wealth by how much money event where you live and what car do you drive the other currencies respect and that's a very important one because that it respect currency gets you image respect you had in the different communities and that's our currency it's very unfortunate that the Western world really looking at the economic currency per ticket in the early years of the valley old Earl and the gold rush didn't sheet and probably embedded into property it can have not actually looked at the other currency the respectful and respect for people that come she was very important so that currency was actually broken down to the early stage because in the Western world you don't have the complete collective families you have the small units and our families go a lot wider and someone said to me a couple of weeks ago you average of people have lots of friends what's the family's ever we go run into the family I said well if you stayed in one place for 40,000 years you'd have a love you go back to where you're originally mall your other people that left those origins and you'll have just as many family as we are we are here that's the difference the those sort of things show that we are not a complete different race than the Western world just that we've honed things over thousands of years into simplicity there are three principles that we gauge and our culture on and those three principles lead to a fourth one which above Joyce the principles are identity belonging and responsibility your identity you're a company if your person your identities you individual what you are what you stand for your belonging is your collector your family your friends your club your association your counsel your board it's belonging and with that blogging comes responsibility and after that responsibility is another thing called choice unfortunately the choice should be left up because responsibility to be taken away from people and they don't have that final one which is a choice so when you remove people from a family or you take up a new system of education what you do and you're imposing a responsibility without the inclusion of a choice and that becomes very destructive for us as a community because what that happens it breaks down taken many many years to build up a currency they've raised children have actually done the responsibilities raised great children they've built it up and what happened throughout the years that responsibility be taken off the grandparents and the parents and into the hands of your trip papers like community welfare native welfare into these places where they say we will be responsible for your actions in your outcomes I can talk to you for this about what like super saying when you talk for about two or three hours so like an officer got a lot and he should call a lot longer shooter because she's older than but I was told by my uncle many times go when you get out of talk ticket even when others are around so which ones do you make sure you talk longer than them because why I talk some of us of the most important politician just to go and rap on and on the preachers have come and they talk to us on and on a month you will be able to talk longer than that because this colorful a young people outside panera my mother's argument and we're going on one side of your mother grandmother the journey but we have connections to battle on bed and gallop we also got my jacket Europe yummy so all these connections are a part of my identity and that identity gives me a belonging to a wide range of people and that would prolong it comes with responsibilities I responsibility for those who need assistance but I have a choice to participate in other perhaps where we can actually enhance and amazing is a lot easier for most of our people I don't know that we have questions and answer session dear but I'll probably probably use my 15 minutes up I'm gonna watch and build outside of my employees as they don't carry a way to active in no time for anyone so I'd like to go thank the council for providing this this platform for us to work to address because the most important thing that we have as people is communication communication is fantastic that's why work is a communication between the artist and you as an audience there's no interpretation and unfortunately for many many years the aboriginal person as we need to everett by anthropologists by government people and they haven't been listening to our people ourselves and Tony first might say we go we actually the four stages of speaking the first type is speaking and we can all relate to this is when you're spoken about that comes on previously when actually you in the womb you're actually spoken about with other people with spoken about both here and Buzz abroad you doing back in that but called mother England which is father again sometimes in the king or queen another but that's that's the first time it is fun again then you're spoken to say you the googoo gah-gah used in a brand so that's a it's a spoken to it's an evolution that we were spoken to as people then you're spoken for so as you're growing up people are overrepresented nothing beyond until you get to a certain to that forced stage where we're speaking for ourselves and we're still being challenged because there are some committees and communities that have non-indigenous people cheering major organizations and major programs that we have we benefit from those average of people share my non-aboriginal people so we can't say we are speaking for ourselves in those forums the next one is listening and that's important listening is very important because from the listening we can actually then bridge the gap of difference and go back to that simplicity we're all one under the one son we may have different language grammar different by briefings the sudden happens one son us the plants the animals all of us are all level under that one son and I think that's very important that we are responsible for plants and animals
My name is mike Maurice and I go to MC for this evening I'm one of the executive here at the city of cutting and it gives me great pleasure to walking over for here this evening first I wanted to acknowledge the past and present traditional owners of the land that we meeting on this evening I also need to present an apology for the mayor about the deputy mayor and council carcass evening all of the neuron available the mayor and deputy manage me to state at the moment I would like to also acknowledge some of the council's that have been able to give you this evening a counselor Lucio a counselor all sort of capital we lead counsel very and counselor spin Boylan so then Kathleen a ghost in character with me yes sorry so think of counselors for being here and this speaker series is part of a bigger program that the city is running referred to as the community plan and the speaker series starting in march and there's been once a month until now until july and it's really a far more interactive way the speaker series is really good to start to stimulate some ideas and start to think about the future of the city and some of the challenges we face the aim of the speaker's here is really good ready to start that conversation to really begin a journey that's been going on or these are gone for a period of time and then feed into a process of far more in-depth acknowledgment in the coming months as the city works towards preparing a community plan as part of its requirements to actually engage better with the community develop a city of the 21st century one of the things we really like you to do before you leave leather seating is just fill out that little questionnaire that's on the table if you get a chance but tonight for the final event in this part of the series we'd really like to welcome our three guest for this evening the topic is about indigenous perspectives as one of the important parts of our local community we have three important guests this evening me great pleasure to introduce the first of those speakers Richard walling Richard was awarded an order of australia medal for his contribution to the Performing Arts and another culture in 2001 murdoch university recognized Richards contribution to the Roman culture and the wider community by by honoring him with an honorary doctorate of letters Richard continues to push the boundaries and continually developing and as well as helping his community in this area particularly in the arts and culture and environment and we've given which is a pretty open opportunity to speak to us about the perspectives from his point of view around indigenous perspectives in the future and any city planning so thank you Richard welcome
Then you verbally presentation I'm just like oh I smoke question to the whole panel and there's no right or wrong but a big issue for the city off in this community safety diver swimming care you if you would like to comment do you feel safe in the neighborhood be living and do you feel safe moving about the city does everybody heard that big in your night been yeah definitely I reckon especially in the city of caddy I think it's got quite a reputation thank you I think you've got a lot of quite a good reputation of having safety throughout and even such a shopping center as carousel there is maybe a little the complications but still at its wireless a community especially came but I think I'm actually quite safe but for more young people I think of thing for us because I just feel like we're more aware of everything that goes on the day when I was walking home I saw this old lady and she was just terrified and walking around the streets and when I was like okay and I'm I think about that I'll go through the window but I was just like oh you're an insurance no I was just scared you know the other day somebody snatched my purse and I was like oh and it's my neighborhood and awkward side really expect that but I think we'd young people for like us I think they feel more safe look for the older generation I think it's a bit more scary to them yeah okay here questions yes please tech companies use my local job people live on a beta me also commenting on issue of safety our community I'll I suggest maybe a better communication between the young people and the old generation as I can't really sorry now the deficit how the unsaved the old lady didn't feel as safe as open with the young people often have a greater sense of confidence in our community than the older people do maybe it's just the teenage years you always feel confident I'm not sure either way better communication between negative stereotypes it's actually young people and everything like that yeah that's will have to input so thank you and back to you okay I anymore you want to go alright so you know I'm gonna quickly I just like to you one sigh yep down some of this famous figures and events are young tonight down football but also I decided to see be okay has done some of the things that you have said and unfortunately it seems to me that we have been in the communicating with ever in a better way but we will endeavor to do that so we've done some of the things that you brought up probably some is not so notice what the universe step is you get up in the morning you step up your law that's the sea of Kenny and also we are looking after media environment as an extent but we would be more towards that and also in relation to the jump for the youth might be just as an interesting to you that over a year ago I but a proposed the Prime Minister dinner but they're she's the problem is that it is about last week up with the same proposal up because since I talked to her he said that she now change their bond which is what interested in training to youth so what am I have to do is the mobi old circulated to the local schools to get a petition so they might be able to present their do it if someone would see it and so that we can convince say that right in to give Thomas ourselves trace people we watch the area road suddenly and if so the few people can look forward the young one and when you get to the age where Lisa delicate very good by the house if you can play the head EEO so there are issues that we were like engage with youth because unfortunately if we don't have you on board we as like nadri the dress worn on to pay the tree somebody go to any Houston so that's the way we think about okay now let's gently we get to you whether your arm on the way home miss drive safely always things that you know the other thing was the same to me earlier was that you know what youth you know it's the way you feel but you may be says you don't pay attention I'm boat and my identity issues said if you know the other things are there to die you know they think they'd always fly so just be careful because smoking is very very gracious again thank you
So we need to recognize that subcultures are you different needs they have an interest subcultures have non traditional communities virtual or physical and I bring this up because when our previous speak is probably the best speaker no offense to the odds was the first one which was Jim guys and he mentioned about all these great initiatives for the community that have been doing in seattle for the past 22 years and I had great success engaging the community and allowing them to cut the red tape and just do what they want to do just volunteer make great things happen in community but the problem is one thing he said was I don't actually find virtual communities that important he didn't actually think much to virtual communities and to me that's a generational difference because if you ask anyone under 40 that what it's important it's virtual communities these days people often say ah if you're talking to someone internet it's not a real conversation you're not talking to a real person it's just a robot on the not actually someone on the other side but there is it's actually just a new method of talking it's just a new method of communication it's a new language and if the actual think about it they're actually communicating more than we ever have in our lives working with long distance relatives that you might actually get to post a letter to like once every six months now you can be video calling them every five minutes so that's not always a good thing um so virtual communities I think are very important and they actually are ways that people actually engage in community so community can be a whole community but of course to have multiple communities within it and within that mean or more or two ago different communities and all of them are valid that should be expected me other do there anything without having to participate everyone else but we should always support any opportunities that I would like to take up with that and of course different sexes different age is going to be different a thirteen-year-old might like Justin'm then I'm a digital life virgin community said porn so so so trying to be the suckers would be behind time stay having a curveball Facebook speeding around since 2004 councils have only just maybe been getting some get paid Facebook pages in the past year or two if some still don't actually have it so how many years of that that's like seven years that's a long time and especially in this fast and generation when things are changing by the time you actually get your Facebook page Facebook pages public I mean Facebook spotty actually going broke and someone else's taken over love what happened on myspace myspace was it the social networking in like if councils took five or six years or seven years all organizations I'm not the same counsel that any organizations dealing with young young people if they took five six years to go on to myspace they find it not won't be able to use it because the user interface is completely unusable now and no one's on it except as families if you ahead of the court curveball we've got to be on the lookout what is actually the new happening thing so you've actually got a facebook page and everything or Twitter or whatever before the young people even know about it just waiting there we're ready to engage them so that you've actually learned how to use it you're not trying to play catch-up all the time because you've already missed this ball already on demand culture we kicked 1 everything now now really now so often we find theocracy of things can often slow things down and that doesn't really work on it on demand just sort of thing so we're going to figure out ways to be able to serve a community in a quicker way we've got to keep the quality of we're going to research all other options but we're going to make sure this quick and responsive and if this is what it's like now what's going to be like in 20 years because who knows what technology we had like 20 years on my hand they would expected I would have the creative engagement that's kind of all I'm involved in which is trying to engage people through creative stuff and I thought I just quickly and very quickly talk about a project that I'm was involved in this is a skate park and there's keep doing an awesome skate park skate move as you can see there's all this scribble stuff going on which some people call trophy and this is often a problem with a lot of our skate parks and other sort of facilities like that so I want to figure out a way to actually try and combat mix because graffitis never been defeated but if you want to call it that um not being tackled right it started off maybe the modern form in New York but they still have solved the problem there so while we're here if they were already ahead of us so they always told originally when they employ me to try and see what we could do about your fee to put up some posted like 93 how will is upload the past whatever meant years not too well so what I believe it is long-term programs actually give people development and actually keep going so that when a program finishes the kids not going on what's the next one can tell when I believe in making sure find cost-effective ways and get the support to actually make sure that program is ongoing so that they can always have somewhere to continue on so we started escape part claim session and we do designs on weekly cleanup so they're learning about the design process and then those designs have been the designs of actually paint on there and they have to be to a specific theme so they actually learn all about the design process as well as I'm decorating our wonderful skate park there and it kind of works so what was all screwball is now like that and if you put an answer graffiti coating on it probably say like a thug disagree with that idea because they're not be just a one-celled program we tick it off and say to next but those young people are still in full I'm interested in being creative than that so we want to keep engaging people and you know what those kids might get over in a year's time but number times might get older and then they are interested in so we need to keep it going so we keep going and that way we don't actually put a coat on and saving money but it means it can get tagged still which then puts ownership back with the young people I've spent three or four hours painting this and now someone's tagged over word now I'm not so happy about it and now I'm even God can't come up to me he's told me not I go around telling people off whenever they go tagging people so it actually self-releasing this so each month we change it and get fresh designs so even counselors have mentioned in minutes oh wow great skate park looking we can actually take photos of escape I'm so God swear words also vary in the same section we're looking at before all scribbles in there you little fishy months and that leads to other things well we do now a canvas exhibition some transfer those high skills to accounts exhibition and we sold them off so the young people can actually earn money out of their artwork but they also learn about the actual running of a business in a way because actually only get the profits so they have to pay for the costs of the actual canvas and natural pain and then anything on top of that from their bid from their silent option if they get to keep so someone could some of you can walk away with seventy dollars from like painting some few hours and someone gets something awesome up on the wall and then there's also the thing where people have a perception that sort of urban art so the stuff will reveal whatever you want to call that is also it's an iceberg it's only for young people well it's not it's for old people as well this is at age air because we always deploy professional us in this project open them I would never do about it because you need the skills or whatever thing you're trying to do done by your art people not just people trying to figure it out or just get whoever half as grant get the best if you can afford and we do get one of this his name is Tim Rowland and he helps that and he offers design this one and then two young people but they assisting on a professional euro situation don't they but if they wear a particular by this time and in the process a whole community benefits because the aged care service people get to see that every day they walk in instead of a blank wall which looked really ugly and depress them so the picture about ten points to consider for the future engagement of you trust the people we invite as many as many people doing things not over management we can often get too caught up in all the bureaucracy think we need to actually research things properly and make sure things and not just make plans and if the providers plans revive those plans now we need more people on the ground actually doing things and not doing funding applications that part out six months later on you can get it and then after do it again placing a lot of time but I couldn't is actually going out and actually done something long term consistent projects as well as you before less loss of engagement at less than disappoint which which some young people might be often left disappointed by the other support that works so you want to make sure you've got that consistent network going so they know the odds got some line as Jim said cut the red tape provide opportunities respond fast and nurture young people if they decide to step up now all young people want to it's I've been a niche people that one step maybe like some of these young people here they actually have the initiative to come out and say I want input sine honor organized this honor but that's something different not only are okay but for those that do let's shock make it is it easy as possible as it can market your communication is key you're competing with coke when you're marketing the young people so let's market it like Coke not like you market it to a bank or something else there's no blanket solution we can think about if you're an advertising agency you'll adapt do a different campaign for different clients so we must think about that when we're actually trying to communicate with young is a different client if you will to another client technologies are keen 10 years 20 years ago who knows what we're going to have now what do have what go 2,050 what we're trying to predict right now be absolutely jokes laughter so we could actually try and think ahead it use our imaginations what we can do and jobs going to change so that's really important for young people some people mentioned it earlier in their species I'm seeing in supermarkets now you don't need people actually to scan machine you do it yourself anymore so that some people go to see my employer that include my mom mom um and so obviously we're going to be moving to a more technical future so we're going to make sure the resources available for young people to actually learn from technology more easier and make sure they're all fluent with it because they're going to need it in the future create realistic expectations is often a pressure I feel to create and achieve their strange dream of owning a house and all this other stuff which is often pushed on by the mining boom because I had people talk about audio clip out of my house in three years you know what my parents be paying off their house 30 years and they're still doing all right they're not the richest people route that I always had shoes on my feet and stuff I think so I think we need to recreate what actual strange dream business boys been mentioned by other speakers such as Marion and also Richard well our great recognition of look is often lacking the representation and we need some really strong indigenous leaders in powerful positions to really make a difference as far as that reconciliation goes reward young for doing the right thing is a program that runs and the council to the workout that does exactly know they have an awards ceremony two or three times a year whatever more young people to do the right thing they're being nominated they get a prize a cash prize and they can even use that to go buy an ipod or whatever or they can actually use it to do a convenient project so that's also a great thing for young people and contemporary arts culture is needed to attract young people and creative people to the community will talk about why do young people want to leave all the time like that well I've got it all the way from when I study how to take nobody move up to third why don't you go to the east coast why don't you move anywhere else is always somewhere supposedly better as far as creative thinkers out there so we make sure whatever area you're living in that you actually create an atmosphere where young people creative you actually want to stay by point some weird boxy set of building in it like that one nothing whatever it's what I mean cared if it looks cool um and the last one is experiment that'll fix the vital off well many many many many many many many many many Germans don't give up on them because one time won't work and one time at one work expand the horizons of young people works poison into culture and new things happening maybe in America or England aware about my work it doesn't matter if it could be great things happening that don't even seem like a Sufi why not try it out and see they would I might go lucky hit and you want me to start a renewed subculture completely and finally remember a young person till you're 40 yeah you
I think my speech and also Evans going to be a bit up Sean for young people's it seems a lot of a bed and they sure alright I'm not sure what I was going to talk about really to be honest talking about you what exactly do you actually talk about so I've tried to narrow it down to sort of areas that I know before about whether it makes any more sense at the end we'll find out is the nesting works for cool so who is this speaker guy I'm not a cane citizen I'm from a foreign land or manager I'm not a million-dollar think tank or university research person or someone 22 years success record low previous speakers that we've had a few bit into those speaker series which after you haven't heard anything because there's a lot more young people this time soon that's really good to see everyone here these are just basically my experiences over the past decade or so dealing with youth engagement in the local areas councils and also a creative jack of all trades whatever I'm interested in on Cuba go and I think we're young people you'll find that's often the case as well because they haven't been worn down yet there's still got the Spirit says sort of think so and that can often happen with all the people and objects generations which often are the decision makers their kind of said I know that one work I know my work has it been working I did it but young people would think something different to that so the optimism in young people is always going to be a good inspiration for the older generation to take into consideration when they're making because maybe in work when they tried it out there maybe did for us for me I started out when I was about 17 and I watched wayne's world 2 has anyone seen that movie I think it's kind of in between both the generations here right now I think the younger people were born there and older cool probably like better watch it ever why you besides we've all that youthful optimism that he wants to organize a concert so I watch that and I thought yeah I'm going to organize a concert so I just went down to the local recreation center and said I want to put a concert on here I mean nothing about local music scene at that time or anything and I quickly learn at that and I did it all by myself and before I knew or through the council notice what I've done because they've organized to all ages advance myself with local recreation center just kind of ticking the boxes for me and you've arts officer from the local council notice me and got me on board to help out with all the events council there and if that can happen that engagement between counsel on myself y'all wouldn't be speaking to you right now from there I went to start in film and television which is obviously different route how to music background for making people I'm using electronic music but I've moved into film and these features a sitter there in front of the camera and from there somehow became the chair of the young people in arts funding panel for the department culture in arts which is always find hilarious because I failed by the ice cube and I've always you need agree people sitting around me and a few visits a neighborhood saying and basically now I somehow stumbled into surviving doing creative production and our youth project coordination and program coordination for the local councils in up worked for various councils mainly south of the river I'm so biased of course it just happens to be aware of what we're driving to um and um yeah from that I'd get to see how each council works and each council does work differently and they can often act quite separate as well because all the separate budgets so we can't live right next one because yeah you know everyone's kind of a bit more after herself so it's hard to get a collaboration between council sometimes of your and that's something to make consider and and future because they're talking about actually combining some together so that's some scary ideas for some councils no doubt click what is using someone under 25 someone under 25 anyone else anyone else anyone yet that person idea that it's how you feel this is what wikipedia says use this the time of life between childhood and adult your tea definitions of the specific age range that constitutes eat very an individual's actual maturity may not correspond with a chronological Magnus individuals exist at all ages like myself I have a thing called PBS which I like to call Peter Pan syndrome I'm actually 30 what was that waffle purposely get shaved to make myself with more manly person arm okay so it says something off to the side there the age in which a person is considered a youth and thus eligible for special treatment under the law and through our society varies around the world united nations general assembly and the walbank Lycidas 15 to 24 the commonwealth youth program callosities 15 to 29 national highway traffic safety administration where the hell bigger under-21 Wilson School District I love Wilson School District wherever that is wherever it is 14 to 21 alternative go Wilson alternative homes for youth Inc 13 to 19 the Danish Youth Council 15 to 34 city of Canon uses since I just met with Evan the coordinator today and he show you wanted programs it's for 11 to 17 and this talk is for people under 25 so what is you what I each not sure life expectancy throughout history as you can see throughout the years we've got all sorts of here is a massive a single sorts of wars and moved out of a crazy stuff going on and throughout it on our rigid looking at they're you're so until we get out to the 20th century and we start doing technology and stuff and suddenly we we can fix ourselves when we get shot in your ball or something like that or fall over or whatever or just don't fall off the end of the earth because back then before the 20th century was flat it's always a safety'm a crackpot theory if life expectancy is doubled their so has as the process of being young double as well is 32 new 15 and we always say that when I've just turned 30 I yeah daddy is the new 20 or 40 is the new 30 maybe it is is 40 the new twenty is 52 new 25 as we define 18 normally as when you become an adult at the end of you I'm current standards we live in to 67 years on average and ask well why that's probably going the strangest rose probably a lot higher divide that by a team that's 3.7 some number okay a quarter of your life is youth three 20th century we're only living to about 30 and divide that by 18 that's 1.6 another number and that means two thirds of a life is you so by three 20th century standards you could be defined as of up to about 40 years of age in current times because two-thirds your life is supposed to be on according to the previous times yeah we by this age and you've got to get a house and you've got to get all this you know or what a certain age but we haven't noticed that we actually live in a bit longer and it may be biologically things are changing as well people mind their nose eyes people maturing younger some people mature in order and also stinks so maybe we're evolving as a species both with technology and within ourselves and with our current environment so maybe it isn't 2521 18 or 29 or 30 or whatever maybe it's 40 you don't know anything significant in monetary value don't pay taxes and rates and don't vote so what this means is the bigwigs that have the money and the power and the decision-making to do might not always take that seriously because sometimes there's a thing called politics involved and if you haven't got a void to put in and it's hard for you to have a voice so don't we very young people even though they don't actually paid your vote for you do we still actually care what they actually think about and what they want and what they actually need especially when the core significantly as developed as the people that can do those things so they're probably can have more needs and the people that are older in the first place so that's a question you gotta ask is do we value young people there's generational difference what one person likes another haze and one example for this is when I was up in Perth once one old country manager or rockingham wherever I was living at a time and up in the big smoke I'm always on the catbus and I was going past that new you know that new stadium they listen life n square I am built in the see that thing it's like a boxy sort of thing anyway I have been built yet that it was a science on the concept picture and here I am looking out the windows phone wow it looks awesome and because I haven't like a creative background and I sort perth really does it for me and that probably works attracts me would further attract me to stay in this state stay in this town whatever meanwhile the older couple next to me go oh my god that's disgusting yeah if I was a little bit younger and thinking the same thoughts I probably have much say of whether that discussing think it's the corona but older people mine so it's a really hard balance of trying to make sure that everyone actually gets to have their own likes around them because a lot of things can things based on past history and historical things and was often looking to the marks Roman actually thinking about a brighter future rather than just dwelling always on the past than that another thing is of course negative stereotypes are today I'm modeling some camo pants and if I put on this hood and I'm just walking around like this he saw me walking in the street maybe you think I'm going to stab you or something what your white though is on a massive nerve and'm scared of knives and Fire what other things are lots of focus so and why do I wear this well I grew up with a whole lot of musical instrument iress and other things and that just influences my fashion and I'm looking to the future I'm not necessarily going to wear a suit because I don't like suits but I'm going to wear this because I like it and not necessarily because some other generation is going to have stereotype about it and sometimes young people don't realize that I've had some young people that have been involved in 4th ed and don't realize that actually dress all exactly the same they going on man with a dress like that yes you do and now I wonder why the police always pick them up straight away to see I am they go straight to him and check his bag or whatever it's because they all dress exactly the same and sometimes young people can't actually bring realize that actually projecting the image outset of our rest of the community and we often think about multiculturalism as in nationality but what we don't often think about is you sub cultures within that and how they are unique we often just put a glow nothing like you you'd like to have discos or what you'd like to do this well actually use like lots of different things and it could be like 20 youth like this and fifty like that and all sorts of things so it's actually quite a hard demographic to not deal with but um trying to engage with some subcultures defined by wikipedia oh I know you're going to read all them but you can have just a quick look and just say anyone know what freaks cease what about rockabilly military brat has anyone been to a juggling festival before all of these different types might be seeing a stereotyped that they're actually known as scenes and subcultures and I had certain fashion sense and soon things that are interested in each one of these groups is not going to necessarily like the same things even though in general as I was speaking to someone earlier about but they aren't going to have particularly interests like someone who's into popular culture is I'm going to be interested in collecting them all nothing's going to stop and I think this is our special with a marketing to people if I'm putting on a hip hop event I'm not going to dress it up to make it look like it's something for a ballerina or something I'm going to market it so it looks like it's without demography and it might be a small demographic it might be 30 people in your community that those people deserve to have their interests just as well as anyone else and not just a blanket serving of whatever is deemed appropriate for you
Ladies and gentlemen could someone please point out the right direction to me because I'm confused what is step in the right direction be to my right or your right because my right is your left and your right of my left so which is right who is right what is right well according to the dictionary the word right as many different definitions and needs the most common ones being that which is just proper fitting legal and good you're right Eleanor Roosevelt said is not something somebody gives you it's something nobody can take away so really the world ride is an abstract is no definite meaning and the word right meaning concise proper an exact is in fact unclear unformed an indefinite it's a deception if then the right direction is the matter of Thornton opinion who's thought in whose opinion has shaped the right direction as we see today philosophers Kings politicians scientists but right it was right in the past isn't always right in the future or the present is it I mean it was once the Divine Right because they wouldn't bear him an email is it was right to torture and persecute someone if they didn't shave beliefs war was righteous and glorious injured I'd ones one country the right thing to do poverty in submission to the superior gender and the superior race was right even in the face of gross injustice and wrong doings ironic but today ladies and gentlemen we live in an age of recognition the recognition of neurons now that today I speak of didn't start at zero hours this morning it rose slowly and sluggishly in the revolutions of Napoleon and the feelings of Commerce the right of the King became the right of the people and not long after the world realized that war was not the right way to go nor the right place to be war wasn't right because it was immoral and deadly destruction at the hands war unjustified you may say that it was peace and not war that they thoughtful and cure for but ladies and gentlemen does the end justify the means Madonna once said I believe in peace it be then that I will never really have true peace and that's right mapa Gandhi fought for the rights of n oppressed people as did Nelson Mandela Martin Luther King Eddie Mabo and leonard woolf fees are men that brought the 444 against racism a different war a war of words and intellect leonard woolf stands out because he didn't fight for the rights of his own people or his own rights he fought for the rights of a foreign country and a foreign people perhaps that is the right direction then fighting for another's rise but that brings another question you to mine can I have no you the right direction of another without really knowing my own can I tell you what is right when I cannot explain it to myself ladies and gentlemen leonard woolf was a good man he was a just man but his justice wasn't always right for the people he served now when he first arrived in Sri Lanka or as it was then known under British colonial rule salon wolf wielded his powers an imperious telling the was being a valid in service to the people he thought he was doing the right thing but then later he started to question this very so-called rights of them pianist and abetting decided to fight for the rights of the people he had once hauled over steps in two completely different directions and it both apparently in the right direction Leonard woof however falls in the shadow of a great battle waged by his quite famous wife Virginia Woolf which is quite Iraq ironic because Virginia Woolf fought against the shadow that women were being forced to live in by men and here we are ladies and gentlemen actually yet another important step the world has taken in the right direction women's rights and perhaps I should be grateful that I can stand here on my own in public and voice my opinion this is surely a little more than a century ago that was not right in fact ladies and gentlemen if today is a step in the right direction does that mean that gifts today the world was all wrong is the right path as the and bent with realization if it is was it ever right in the first place it seems ladies and gentlemen that we only realize that what we thought of as a step in the right direction is in fact wrong once we have taken our next step in the right direction the abstract of rioters ever changing and it's a Greek philosopher once said nothing endures but change if you cannot always be right then it isn't what is it isn't because what is right changes on its own it's because you change and what is right changes with you this is my right but with every angle I move it at every different direction I face my right direction changes if I asked you to point me out in the right direction now what would you say my right is still the opposite of your art but neither of us is wrong right the Lord would the one said doubt everything find your own light ladies and gentlemen we each walk in our own parts and we each step in own right directions what matters is right because that means you are innocent of stepping in the wrong direction any step just as long as you know it isn't wrong that is a step in the right direction thank
Even the use of judgment and history test my name is building quanta and stephen adly mr. Haskell in your time and I've been living in Australia for all these levels until eight works heavy encourage from body yuneisia I believe that multiculturalism is one key issue that city is to

Good evening ladies and gentlemen distinguished guests many of the tongue thor and 16 years old is young a topic that I will be speaking on today is the future of education in the city ok ideally I

links between oversee schools or universities education for most young people is module to their success and moving forward into the world of work this success has a ripple effect on and benefits the city of canyon by providing state-of-the-art educational facilities and opportunities this will attract people especially young ambitious people to live in this area and become a product the city but the statistics indicate that education is one of the major factors in determining whether you choose to live by working in partnership with educational facilities and state government the city of cali will be the city of choice currently at the voting in high school we have a career counselor that talks us through get there prior to your eleventh will be given weekly presentations on future pathways available and costs available at school I found these talks very helpful and in helping me to decide what I would like to do in future if the city of candy were to develop career expositions similar to what we have at Leyland many more days have a clear view of the future a place for myself I spies travel overseas and to study to study overseas and one day hopefully become a fashion journalist for most youths from our big drinks in the future I would like to see the city I'm coming help students like myself by developing sister links with oversee schools and universities as well as offer scholarships to help the mechana means study overseas this will inspire the news from the city accounting to achieve their dreams in return the city ok could take great pride in knowing that they have helped a number of the city achieve their dreams and could celebrate this achievement by bringing this to the public I would like to see the city of tiny provide facilities and services that will enhance educational outcomes of young people such things as leadership courses career counseling programs for indigenous and Margaret news increasing the number of youth workers and sponsorships which are a long way in achieving this the current coalition is an example of partnerships involving the city of Melbourne Council schools government departments and businesses in the east southeast

tom I see ye are to them prefect from windows in a high school as a link of this generation I'm here to dress the statement what makes a great city for under 25 as a young person living in the city of Canyon I'm interested in creating the city we live in global warming greenhouse gases climate change which are all interrelated concern me young people today regardless of what your view is we need to plan for a company proceed my teachers being affected by the brain materialism that surrounds Western culture and we need to stop now in order to secure our future currently the city of planning is active in this area methods we have recycling in place pretty much relations we have streetscaping with native France also we have a recycling greatest recycling of old materials and heart wrong however we need to do more since 2002 these are metropolitan regional council has participated in climate wise and the regional community greenhouse gas abatement project as part of the commitment to the city local residents to become more energy efficient in order to reduce energy usage across the region and work towards building a sustainable community the SMR see is Statuary federal government authority established by local councils in the southern part of metropolitan park it is responsible for developing environmentally sustainable waste management solutions and climate change abatement measures for the communities of coburg east fremantle fremantle one arm melbourne and rocking on the regional resource center is central to the snr s reach the waste management strategy part of its strategy incorporates the regional resource recovery center located in planning room which does a wonderful job in recycling and managing waste and food waste processing in the short time in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions the city of canning plant organized events bring a travel day where residents use any buses and trains on a designated day opening event such as an thar's and can title a panning out more frequently and encourage or residents to participate use green technology that is available such as instigating policies that require all you go in science tonight renewable sources of energy the Constitution developer green policy where all the residential and commercial buildings would be required to follow through invest in infrastructure which would support a green feature such as good evil psychopath ways than fine encouraging people to cycle to work and school and also incorporating more puzzling which would allow for faster service street lighting should be solar powered with electrical backup if needed streetscaping should also be addressed more native plants could be planted not burning with this enhance the aesthetics of environment but it would also contribute to a company through city the city would monitor community greenhouse gas emissions and publish their findings they could also consult with the company on ways to reduce greenhouse emissions and support community relationships or climate change I would also like to see the County Council join in the South metropolitan region canceled body in Japan the equivalent of the city council's make revisions for the recycling of batteries times and variety of other psychol objects which are then passed on to businesses that specialize in recycling these objects into useful products by doing this they supported the development generated income for the communities providing the avenues of employment and has produced landfill not only has this been a win situation for the Japanese councils but also win situation and bridges in greenhouse emissions the city is counting could adopt similar practices on a large scale rather than just designated collections of the eco education center in filiation to business enterprises the city of candy could implement green policies that all business went out to adhere to by implementing such policies the city would not just reduce carbon dioxide emissions that it would also encourage the aesthetics of the environment making it a more sorrowful place to live in for you to use of this generation want to feature where they

like to introduce the lady
Good evening wear these denim just interests my name is David force I'm student of insinuation I likes that senior caddy provide the opportunity for your thoughts of you what makes the great team behind 25 it's my pleasure to introduce you to my kids Dylan George hangin tough for long strangled up lady winter and a bit cold I like to begin by stating for the majority of young been the existence of the sea can do is unload is an unknown identity now everyday lives we have no direct interaction this year you can in fact the only time we are consciously made aware about local council is in year nine I'm study government and when our parents complain about their rates giving this on closer analysis the city of cabinet is pivotal to our existence in this community as young people we access recreation centers beauty workers recreation and sporting facilities school holiday programs bark man's child health care centers and a multitude of other services all of these services are provided by the senior captain and here lies the problem as young the channels and closer access these services communication between the city and young people is not very effective this forum is the first time that city has publicly accessed and thoughts and passions of the unbeatable as such what I would like to propose is greater communication and an establishment partnership between City and not being the form of communication undertaking is important today young people are technologically savvy is rare for a young person not to have a phone number mp3 player or bc it is therefore important that the city embraces this forms of communication to convey information into young beating Facebook and Twitter I'm communication highways accessed by young people to communicate now and the city needs to get on board with a small communication webpage and telephone number it's not sufficient idea that we young people to be truly engaged seeing my student technologies I've outlined to reach out to young people see also needs to have a youth department that is proactive in the community I'm standing at city has a youth department and the community officer as well as if been limited possibly due to lack of insufficient resources this department must establish partnerships with institutions that young people can access such as schools new sensors and sporting facilities to get to get young people on board with the city this department must also actively promote their services through technologies outline so that youth are in partnership with the city of Canada recently I understood that the city has we going to adopt Twitter's a means of communication I'm for this new and encouragement similarly engaged in a new technology communication is the key to actively engaging healthy where is he oh thank you for the opportunity to express my thoughts are now about to introduce you to the second Luca good evening ladies and gentlemen December yes my name is Dylan Jones eggwin a year 11 student at Mercy Hospital as a young person living in the city of candy my major concern which shared by many other five years is the future employment opportunities and training statistics show that WA has a noticeable skill shortage and imports of our skilled labor from overseas as a result into courses and traits I would like to see the city of can you provide a service which would connect on people with jobs and training opportunities this service will provide an alert students an opening of it openings available errors of skilled employment as well as providing opportunities for use the drought skills I'm aware that the significant already has youth workers with presently working in schools but this service is submitted and not accessible by use one suggestion would be to set up a pre office specializing in youth employment and issues directly related to youth itself from prison providers such as similar the service will have our young people to access youth workers and career counselors as well as getting information in my freezer and training needed in addition I would like to see the service work in partnership with employers in the city of canning that will be willing to provide on the director training or into friendships or just work experience it's the fact that our proportion of young people do not maximize the opportunities at school but it's when they go of FS they can't get a good job they're very waxes training and as they get older training opportunities this feel it is important that young people supported to access appointment when they are still at school to this end the the Kogan sound council of canada has were comparable to take to provide a specially built center where you can go and try to trace by participating in these programs youth people were able to work out very quickly what their career aspirations are then they assistant to work placements this has been beneficial to the community in a number of ways it hasn't invited disengages within Avenue to get qualifications or experience which is positively interact impacted upon reducing unemployment in the area it is reduced the amount of graffiti and is also benefit the economy in the community this central works in partnership with the high school high schools and provides opportunities for those young people who do who do not want to preserve Anna Friel I would like the city planning to provide civil service where young people can go a tray of made available to youth in the sub metropolitan region opportunities to do with jobs Egypt and education these services are provided by the chemical coalition organization at first I thought that was a partnership with the County Council as you discover in fact that was the Belmont Council and therefore my school was excluded from which is baby our mother can counsel us up as to establish a partnership with businesses and schools so that similar services about the employment of traffic could be provided for schools in their division when Western Australians can't get jobs because they don't have the qualification sir employers demand then everyone loses and this is reflected in the community it is therefore important for the cane city of caring to provide services that will get youth an assistant into school of women which will turn their fat the sea all right the city of cannon to take up this challenge of ye Li partnership with youth and placing on services that will assist our youth and have a brighter future being engagement skillet employment thank you for listening to my speech and
And thanks very much I'll just simply say thank you and welcome these are dignitaries and to the wider community and ladies and gentlemen it's a pleasure to get arrested tonight as coordinator of Youth and Family Services at the city of kenning I guess tonight why are we here well mark our CEOs touched on that and I think primarily there's been some questions asked of me I don't know of some other staff members why why we're here and um some people thought it was perhaps an opportunity for a forum for people to be able to give their views and opinions about perhaps the direction in which Youth Services is heading in the city of Kandor delivery of youth programs and activities and national acts like is about exactly what is entitled which is a youth speaker series so we're tonight to listen to some young people and some lots of young people talk about what their views are their opinions and their round loves and hates and all sorts of things about the city of canning and what it means and a global scale so you have sort of clear that up so there will be some question time at the end as Mark said but essentially it out us coming on here tonight to listen to what our young people have sound so yeah just going to break out this I'm just going to inform people about the existing programs activities and opportunities that exist for young people in the city of Canaan primarily what the city of cutting provides for young people as we touched on earlier there will be some students from danwon senior high school they'll be talking about all manner of issues and then we'll have shonali Pereira I'm from suburbs college and shonali will be delivering a speech entitled a step in the right direction I just love it when I shall it was actually the rostrum voice of youth state lines so it's a pleasure to have their own here to mark thanks for coming tonight and thanks to the label high school students as well alright so for those of you the photo see you came into within the city essentially we have to make extremes of youth service provision and they are our first one is youth activity service now these activities service we counsel delivers programs activities for three different buildings in the city we are new centers located in lynnwood wilson embed me some little almost all corners of the city and these sorts of activities that are provided at those centers include recreational activities I've been so things like all involve music equipment the base of the Opera space for young people to hang out chill out roughly eight socially a safe space and also access fully qualified youth workers in order to be a you know for those workers together while support to them on a whole range of issues that could be sexual health issues with the relationship issues it would be employment education and training issues those sorts of things those centers are staff full time by full-time employees we've got a number of casual staffers when I looked um assist in the delivery of programs then we also deliver our what we call turn programs at those for young people to engage in all sorts of activities some you can see there things like DJ music workshops are programs cooking programs healthy hi Jen programs life skills workshops are sorts of things so across the year is a range of opportunities for young people to be engaging in all sorts of extracurricular activities I guess throughout the years eve cannon delivers a number of school programs to young people between the ages of 11 and 17 I'm sure they were probably familiar with the concept of school holiday programs but we undertake activities as you can see there such as horse riding tenpin bowling your movies ice skating those sorts of things editor's provides an opportunity that perhaps are engaged in any other activities during school holidays to be able to run to take part in some meaningful activities and again throughout that process they're able to access staff for a room for support of a whole range of issues so excuse me over come again with the cold second time in three weeks oh sorry about that some other activities that the city interested families include things like harmony day and friendship that events you can see some each is there I guess most recently we've been involved in delivering or helping to deliver Harvey doughnuts in the Bentley area and I guess that's been part of the brownie towers regeneration project and this is the stuff that happens on the ground a youth center in space just wilco located next to the rally towels building and there's at the start of the young people access every youth center and we've been able to engage things like how many events and Friendship Day events at the local schools quite successfully so it's not good other activities and events that we offer young people in the city include things like national newspaper events that's really opportunity for us to celebrate the contribution of young people back to the community and we go about doing that by putting on the event most recipes by the derivative legend Lex where the young people come down and enjoy a liquid pool party disco swimming activities those sorts of things so we facility either torturing times a year depending on budget constraints but um yeah we have quite successful events down there which can attract anywhere from probably a hundred up to about 250 people across the course of the day something I'm looking at getting involved in over the coming months is the entire project essentially that's a mentoring program for young people that have recently arrived from African nations and some of those people young people perhaps lack the capacity to be able to engage with their local community the same way and so extend that perhaps moment freaking young people do so we've terribly broke a funding grant pending and when to give the outcome of that but hopefully that's something at one you doing what we'd be doing it way down into the N and we also have the Photovoice project which for those that are familiar with the concept of photo voice essentially it's about giving young people a bunch of cameras running off taking a bunch of photos which relate to a certain topic or a certain topic the most photos that cat out of that the stories that were told through those photos we're exhibited here in the foyer of the city of canning through the library's at the river's edge effects and so on and some of the photos that kind of that were these slides that follow this is quite simply a fire hydrant that took somebody's fancy chance I was fancy he had that was important to her and that represented my place as far as she was concerned because that was the first thing that she neither switching over to so oaks senior college here's one from Dan and this is all English bloke called reporting a demo so that was a photo of us taking it off obviously they're putting demo and that was what was at my place to them that photo be much speaks for itself that's exam revision and that's a solid line over part of exam boats follow them squatting up not before I'm putting not look this one this is this is Paul smashing his fascination as propounded local mcdonald an ice cream cone day anyway that's what it was ok so we also I say where the city of canning also delivers supported use accommodation program so young people in the city primarily it's a transitional housing program for young people so we have full-time support staff that will provide still support to young people living in two part of housing companies in the sea as I said instead if after 12 months and council staff will assist those you have people back in their education into training support them to you know work on the relationships with their parents but there are the family member so sorts of things our staff and help them work on independent living skills if I'd be something as basic as cooking cleaning budgeting those sorts of things and that programs have been running quite successful with a number of years now there's some stats which March mark touched on before storm of thunder and just finally some stats there between july december last year ok over four to five thousand young people come through our youth centres which 12 young people time period so there's some of the things we're doing pretty well the challenges I guess for us and what was done minion very I guess the biggest fun really is probably how council Russell council I'm talking about elected members and officers go about try to engage young people in the future and try to make them or allow them to participate the things that I have the within the city so I guess for the upcoming community engagement strategy the walton council will be involved in shortly some of those thinking the answer but yeah that's always a challenge how we continue to reinvent ourselves and make ourselves fresh and let yourselves appealing to young people and try to get down to engage with us so we can provide the best level of service back to then that's about it for me so thanks for listening and
My name's Mike open I'm the chief executive of the city of 10 okay I like to welcome you all here tonight it was fantastic to now for this our fourth speaker event in this series over the last three months we've heard from large gym dyers and talking about citizen engagement and community planning in April we do from Marianne fuller the CEO of the committal club appearance on planning for third over the next 50 years talking about planning for a tooth that's God and around three and a half million people who are we planning for with their speech in mainly veteran professor richard well up the director of urban design center in wa his subject boom boom boobs boobs boobs what does boomtown mean for the suburbs so thin that charm those three speakers or a number of things of those three speakers have in common they were all professionals there are all experts in their field and they were all my generation in other words baby boomers so tonight we're actually going to hand the microphone to a new generation to the city of cannon then 2006 are the latest official statistics that we've got I'm 12 to 24 year olds that is under 17 under 25 story for seventeen thousand five hundred and eighty-five of people in that age group and the city of Canada there's twenty three percent of the total population for the city of canning the largest change in age structure in the age structure between 2000 and 2006 was the 18 to 20 four year old age group with an increase of nearly 1,500 people so I compared to Perth the city of canning is a larger proportion of young people in the 12 to 24 year olds in the first region totaled so twenty three percent in kenan compared with 19pc into across the fifth region so the work that William city of canning are doing with the community the city of the future that we're building is actually being built with and for the younger generation that's coming into the ranks and making its presence felt at the present time so tonight there's a seat before the one side and we're going to give the microphone to the young folk now I'd like to before we do give the microphone to the young folk hand over now to mere joe de la donna and who will be introducing the speakers and I know who will have a few remarks off as I'm late mr. man if you are marked in good evening everyone first of all I like to I manage my health counselors and I'll start with the DVD because the bridge mason is over there counselor michelle wigton counsel in g elliott and go to a great Barry and also got an apologies from pencil because the wooden steam boiler and also an apology from counselor awesome and also like the knowledge the f- so we have mr. one activity here you know Armstrong dinner back and senior way hosting some of the staff as well and of course there are cos my pecker would share the other by knowledge the traditional owners of the land past and present on which we meet the moujik people izmir the city of Kenny to be here tonight to introduce the fourth speak event in our speaker series together than the limit tonight we've all of our discussed youth within the city of getting and specifically what makes a great city for under the 20 hires the views issues and passion of our youth first up we will hear from even the hillman the city's coordinate of Youth and Family Service and current initiative that are opening Kenny then we are lucky enough to have some perspective from our youth from liquids in high school and the sun lewbert's college finally use consultation at leo canali or Kennedy sorry will give us the glens fantastic project as he has working on around the state it is now my great pleasure to welcome our first speaker Evan and thank him a quarter sharing his insight into you to within the city of Kenny with us
First of all I like to I think this opportunity and thinking again professor richard bought the well to make up he's a valuable time for coming and you know sort of stimulate our brains and also looked into his dreams and also imparting of some of his knowledge that he has as far as the significant is concerned the three items that we already sort of looking at some of those things but as far as I'm concerned I think that I've seen the cake as a whole and maturing from my agricultural area for years ago to workers to that another thing is now available to come we do care is it I agree with Professor here that we need to address those things in one of the the thing that the council has done is to provide this type of facilities here tonight so that we get feedback from some of the residents in the area and also I think that we have just at the back here which it said is that we have the Kings Park of the year and see at the other thing is that we don't have what if you more all the stuff of public speakers here to skew lights everybody council is in the process of addressing some of those issue here we have to sort of dent afire as to where some of these hodad's at this prospect place but it hasn't risen that trip that I had in elysian state I'm not as it in some states like Melbourne and Sydney was like that they use their railway stations for example to go around on top of them there are beneath that and I'll say you have a commercial and residential over the top so that creates an environment away if people don't have any cars you know and they can with very clearly now the state government here wish to australia's got all that s sex if you like it just sits there you know it's not really used you know in western australia I believe that there is about one percent of population they use the public transports why because you know we have in freeway you know you've got the trailer in the middle day and there are also do your buses competing with it I've been highway to say you know you got to give up to roll away from Armadale given the sea by some of it I've been hard way to be to go to the same place with everybody else but instead of bus should be coming from the suburbs indirect and the public to the nearest railway station every 10 minutes and every five minutes of work from its residents are never to Kitchener bus but everything also has to be that the the buses and train has to be safe for us oldies now I'm notice that in the audience that we got some young people here and then what rituals are moving to I think this is probably the only ones in bio says yeah like he said it might be my 70 years ago there it is feels right you know so whatever would you please join me in taking our professor at your bar for coming out tonight
You can focus on what you would do with your dictator of Darwin for a short period we transferred you down those powers of Celia panic and you grab the three kings decision this city for the future what will those freaking be chiefly sir I would charge you that kind of intelligence but that's a great question what would we do with cannon 10 three things to position it from the future yep look I would rather go I've got to buy at a time in my mind to think about this to give you some semblance of an answer you're the kind of at the top of that growth that's going to push South was that development front so I would have thought economically you and your 10 minutes from the airport you've got the river just there which is high amenity I could I don't know how long I can ride a bike to the CBD I don't know that I probably not that far away from the stairs okay but its picturesque you know it's something so you the knowledge arc so it'll be light rail coming through here potentially and you're at the front the top end of a big catchment of population growth heading self so let's say you're well positioned so you're under no one knows that kid because it's not it's not it doesn't feature on the tourist map of Perth you know so the greatest opportunity you also have is that it's if you do go out into this landscape just here it's a bit of a tabula rasa which is good for development there's not a lot of study no there's not a lot of stuff there if we start digging we're not going to find sort of the ruins of Jerusalem then so we could we can we could certainly use our imagination to create anything I don't know why but a second CBD for Perth kind of springs to mind although and you capitalize on it's on it's good connectivity like there are incredible flows through this place the question is water how do you know there's tremendous amounts of money that flows through the the West field and along the arterial of the alberni highway the question is how do you wrap up some of that energy and consolidated in a in a real place that is desirable to living and it's going to have to be by design in other words the urbanism is terribly important because you see if I was if I'm doing buildings in cottesloe well let's say Sydney harbours a good example no builds it's not you have to do great stuff because you've got the immunity of the harbor here you don't have that amenity in a picturesque manner so what your build is terribly important so you know I I would be I would be open armed about growth in this particular woods I think if you get a critical mass of people here that will change the real charm I'm still are giving you any of your three great ideas I know that but ideas aren't cheap and they don't you know I could say it here I don't know you know it's always good to start with students the challenge will be how you build how you build here for a significant population make it affordable product and don't build yourself into a future kind of slum yes instead of the sort by saying you're an optimist said basically the lady said before ha drops the group of bases in South Australia energy beer for 18 years and the fact that you mention about the applicants a electric and hybrid vehicles taking over that that slag I ask you how far we got with the government that real estate people when this design you've got proposing that people can be sufficient by having quite rail and market gardens and things like that close to the living area and you mentioned our memories in a lot of those jobs with every lost or fatigue sweep parliament for their whole so you have that sort of scenario a job to set up is going to be back to suppose down yeah well that's here but dope immigration yeah we think thought much what I can do about that by urban design whether a factoring stays in a particular place or as I said it's going to be a combination of politics immigration patterns and incentives to encourage industry to decamp to some of these places whether they stay there for how many years they stay there for Ivan who knows that's always that's always a very specific issue I think a couple of things you might have misunderstood I'm not saying that the Australians should live in small communities and be market gardeners I'm talking about significant about the country dealing with significant population growth and whether the Swan coastal plain in Western Australia wants to open itself up to that growth whether it can do that and begin to alleviate the pressures on capital cities we start more regional development that's all I was really suggesting with that the hot rocks sure the energy I agree at the point about cars I probably didn't like that point them but I'm I I don't agree this is my personal opinion I should catch buses and trains and live close to where buses and trains are because that's the driving that is one of the driving international planning policies at the moment put people bubble put people in high-density environments around public transport because of the fear of peak oil now saito I've said that by about 2018 it will cost something like a hundred bucks and a round trip to drive to the CBD from the engine so petrol is going to get very expensive and it'll become scarce but I think what you were saying I agree a few cars will be reinvented I think you'll have individual mobility I believe that firmly I don't think we're all going to be you know queuing to get onto buses but we will need some and enhance public transport system that I think we will also have individual mobility we're going to need individual my ability to service the cities we've got otherwise those suburbs don't work it was very notable that was even should start at alive I'm here what's that that drawing justjust Edward Adelaide's experiencing the same so not quite a lot the rapid growth at the other cities are but circle drive there appears to be City Council's to avoid that this actually stay padding is going to have to take a much more direct they are doing what they can I mean there are a number there are real numbers hovering over suburbs as targets it's not associated with with punishment in any form but certainly young the minister can intervene when we get recalcitrant the world depends on your view of the world but if you get recalcitrant suburbs that councils that just don't want any growth in their area and can't_''_518.57 can't_''_519.57 see how it would be off barefoot to them then there might be you know things will get a bit more heavy-handed surely my exit again it doesn't work because that's what I try and cities all over the UK and in parts of Australia and now they're putting it down and letting everybody it depends where you're looking I mean to lot of very bad building in the 20th century we've learnt we have learnt some things I can tell you you don't put poor people and large families in areas of low amenity in high-density badly designed buildings just don't do it no one's talking about that no one's talking about going out the back of Armadale on building 40 storytellers giotto me we turn away to do this how about this have been structured society as your body singapore's and that we don't have to drive we don't have that wear something no we don't want it that's not quite right hey sorry into and honest answers yeah just just to be well firstly that one I don't think anyone saying we should live at that density Singapore's a tiny place with five and a half million people so they've got they've got to build that density we're talking I think when people refer to density they mean that gym that there is there is a kind of density that is still still offers towers you can go to three stories for storage you can walk up the top you don't need letters you've got great cities in the world think of Barcelona Vancouver Copenhagen I mean these are really great cities and many would argue they're great because they've got a certain level of density you know I tend to agree though that it's it's not going to be once no not even will like it and not even one will like higher density living for their entire life cycle there'll be certain times in their lives when they do want that sort of lifestyle and the trick will be providing amenity in association with the density you don't just go in there and build stuff and say now you happen you've also got to invest in the public realm that'll be the payoff you'll get much better public space so the density has got to be coupled with investment in the public realm to compensate you in a sense for the loss of your backyard now the other thing I argue that by amenity I mean someone living in an apartment can walk to the river insofar as possible Australia way you'll think oh that's not possible the river near the river in Perth is where only rich people live if you actually look at it still in highway and the canning highway always within walking distance of the river and you could build a lot of product in those area to make it affordable and connect it to transport and I'd be I would be heavy-handed with the color I have to say I think there should be many more people living on the coast and enjoying that beautiful Richard just mentioned soon for one of the reasons Singapore works is the quality of their architecture you want to put a building up in Singapore it gets better don't rubbish won't go up so if you want to build something there will be a team of top architects will be checking that building and deciding whether it's up to scratch them up and if it's not it keeps not back and just thinking announcer shine exclusive it's quite atrocious that's going out it's not pretty creating a minute of the people can live in it so there are some signals we should go in a Singapore one is a plan G is great and they also affect the quality of the architecture going out and this is high-density living there that's delightful the women to observe and you've got the manatee rounded but one of the points you've been here which I want to touch upon is human beings need to build touch with nature from time to time been hitting anything at it I think you need to put it maybe in your planning each put more emphasis on that we've got a darling range environment up there's great unfortunately we're losing at the moment because when I managing it right we're losing all over it is it going but we'll learn about that later um but I think the quality of the environment around this is important so equally is working out real good people it should be emphasis also we can escape to from time to time so we can say me I agree I couldn't agree more it's crucial you have to lock that in night I put the development and environment aren't necessarily antithetical you know we'vewe we haven't yet seen a lot of development that that steps up to the challenge and makes a serious contribution to the public realm into the natural realm that you're talking about but we will we will but bogra quite done your own environment we're not managing it well its government all of us as a community is not learning and understanding environment which we live and making it right here are the climate's changed you can't manage what the way we manage twenty thirty four years ago we have a different climate different rainfall regime you've got a manager for us differently and things like that so everywhere don't leave the future we will learn from the past but we've got to put in the context for kind of environment when we're doing them ya know that's a really serious issue particularly as you head south towards peel and Harvey all of that extra mile environments the next area to go with significant development and it's really a shame if it's not that work anyway thank you very much
You can see that the band's there are agricultural land so these these are these are communities of say for argument's sake 50,000 people so you get a free terminal retail center agricultural land you preserve the habitat which is this data green and then there's a transport system network to that you can zoom in a bit and I guess this image is trying to say well why can't we now build innovative clusters of development I mean we need to we need to increase the performance of our development so that's what this is indicating and that's something the minister's copper mantra which is super ter notion of super towns this is our Minister for regional development Brendon Grylls I haven't had time to photoshop he's heading to that image but we will do that I've listed more towns there than are actually classified as super towns but I think it was a stroke of genius personally to start saying that word except for the problem that it implies they'll be winners and losers so there's so on but I think the I just these things are interesting just just to just the idea and the word suddenly it suddenly got a bit of a buzz in the air and of course money is serious money is now flowing in these directions and what we're doing is we're looking at the current status of these towns we're looking at their environmental limits we're looking at their predicted population growth we're looking at their economic basis and we're putting all those things together to try and get a an objective view of what you know what kind of potential does a place like Northern really have or karratha or Katainen or jurien bay what sort of people would really want to go and settle there and and build families and and you know and I think that's a very interesting thing that is going on in Western Australia at the moment it's some as I say it's not just mad development it's a very creative socio-political experiment really it's not new this I put this image this is near Birmingham in England and it's it's the old it was it was built by George Cadbury Cadbury chocolate in 1893 and it was the built-in thought the factory and then of course built the community for all these workers would live in a nice garden see and be able to more or less walk to work and it still has a still strong community with six and a half thousand jobs still tied to the Cadbury's bournville Chocolate Factory and I guess that's what we're looking at in Western Australia in terms of you know company towns almost that's not unusual in the Pilbara but down in the southwest it's a bit somewhat unusual so how we encourage immigration industry and so on to distribute itself and find opportunities in these areas is very interesting now I'm going to take to uncle it's a weeknight the question then for the australian cities I would get down on her for a little bit is to sprawl or not to spoil that's the kind of what because the each growth each city is having the same struggle should we continue expand with what we call greenfield development new suburbs or should we try and get people to live in higher density apartments and so on within the existing footprint of the city now what has happened is everyone's agreed every every Australian city and all the player has agreed we should we can't spoil too much further so therefore all the policy in the nation encourages infield development in Brisbane it's eighty eight percent they're saying they're going to have eighty eight percent of all their development will be in Phil apartments and high-density living Sydney is ninety percent CassinI's got nowhere to go calc over the blue mountains it's got a national park north and south now I'm going to bulldoze those so Sydney's you know sydney's in trouble it's got a little bit of land left which is the remnant food bowl and they're about to put some herbs on that which is a silly thing to do pouring you know you're pouring bloody the same as Melbourne these are Melbourne is copying us or we're copying Melbourne and we're saying fifty-three percent all growth in Perth will be suburban greenfield development so half of it the other half is going to be infill development this is where things get interesting politically and and architectural and so on and will interest you because of your area is targeted for significant in fuel growth infill development come to that come back to that momentarily now the problem has been for us that we can never achieve these targets a lot of up ten and had a target of sixty percent in few lives have dropped it a bit too 52-47 I don't think you'll get 4700 I'll just jump that I don't think you'll get 47 because Perth typically sprawls I'll show you why I mean if this is perth historical you can see what it's done something spread outwards it will continue to do so largely in my view oh this is interesting you can see perth the scale to other cities around the world for them for the least number of people with a bigger city on earth Perth is huge I mean there's London 40 million more than perfect all dimensions my personal favorite type hope these neverlin's 7 million food you know we've really spread out we've just gone okay look at all these spokes let's go fantastic you know it's fantastic if you've got cars running on cheap fuel and you can chase those suburbs with jobs to degree otherwise it just doesn't work now here are the numbers we're dealing with in Perth 4.2 million by mid-century that's an extra 2.7 million homes I saw an extra 2.7 million people so over me and freestanding homes and suburbs or close to 1.5 million apartments you can break that down to the ratio of with government policy is forty-seven percent will be freestanding homes and and 53 precise fifty-three percent will be freestanding homes in 47 world being in field this is why I don't think we're going to reach that target in Perth the ready is the current the bloomers stuff that we're currently building and it's all you can see it's all on the edge of the city it's pejorative referred to as sprawl it's the black stuff you've gotta worry about if you don't like spoiled because that's the land we have in our land bank it's classified as rural age it's degraded rule and largely and you can bet your bottom dollar that's what the developed that developers are buying up as we speak now just look graphically at it see the red is what we are the black is what we've got you could cut you could double the red into the black so we haven't been looking at that and I'll show you we've we've then looked at more carefully and said don't knock over a single tree just you know be very careful and you end up with still I hundred may 10,000 hectares of land and the city is currently a hundred thousand hectares so you can double it into that land it might's the catch though the catch is zoned rural lands this is p.o Harvey going right down we can also unpick that that's just the bestest day that's not a real Beth often quote north china it's just a roar mountain range it's just a planning line we can unpick that we can continue to you go to a further and you're the catcher is that the black line coincides with this beige stuff which is multiple use wetlands which means if you get a shovel and put it into the ground you'll hear order about a meter down okay and that land gets people think Perth is dry it's actually very very wet full of wetlands and dental o-line land we've built all the pretty stuff up there and now we push you down to this low line wet country and rolling out suburbs so you're rolling out suburbs into lower landscape with a high water table you're not sure he can chase those suburbs with jobs and it's all going to be based on a form of running out so we're building if you do that you're building a seeded you know it doesn't sound like the right approach now that's said I would have talked much more had a more time about how much I love for suburbs and come from the suburbs but if we gotta build more sub everything out to be much smarter than what is this is how we build on that flattened on that low-lying land at the moment we import we have to because you've got to get the land up higher pour a concrete slab and build your house oui oui my yellow sand from one site that's what you can see these trucks doing here and then we dump it on the job there Jack the land up then you can get done because you're legally up above that high water total this is what you want to see Perth the real Perth you don't go to mount eliza get a helicopter and go around the edge of the city that's what that's where it's at that looks low and and and it is interesting that you know you could you could you could start a suburb for 40,000 people tomorrow and no one will blink and as I mentioned before I talk about a four story building in college loan you know or hell will break what's this is the the problem because we're just chewing into that landscape which to to the untrained islets say doesn't look like a very appealing landscape you know it's it's scratchy and Fire prayin for snakes and suburbs want green pulls and shade and deciduous trees they're two totally antithetical worlds my own view is if you're going to build suburbs you need to try and build them at higher density that's what this drawing is saying these hydrants instead of smearing suburbs over the entire landscape build a higher density you might get some better urban carry that save all the vital the habitat and then start working that landscape first food production and water retention and look after the wetlands and you know try to live with this particular've used a transport system I've got a 800 transport system on an 800-meter grid so everyone no one's further than a 5-minute walk from hopping on public transport build higher density around that and in the public open space in the middle is proportionally enough to more or less feed these people we've tried to balance it out in terms of water harvesting food production and public transport and density now this is I'm about to end this is where we're at now with the current policy we've got forty seven percent of the growth hovering over Perth forty seven percent of our 2.7 million people you know it's an awful lot of apartments when you take an accepted fifty percent is going to be Greenfield suburban sprawl into that black plant I showed you the question then is and this is incidentally this is this is then this is those future people if they living like persons in five storey buildings it's about that big scale for to the business forum river south perth and the CBD we're going the government is asking you to do is accept distribution of those numbers they deal with smaller numbers but it's the same principle exact distribution of that hovering mass through various parts of the existing fabric of the city and that amounts to our current policy known as directions 31 every dot you see on this drawing of Perth represents hotspots places where we are trying to achieve increased density and that is a very interesting project it's diagrammatically to be to beep like that where we're trying to shut not shut down to make the city a more resilient network of trade and communication isn't just Justin just people sprawling outlets to a degree we can consolidate what we've got and build on our existing infrastructure now typically communities that are facing that kind of growth suspicious they're suspicious of the stereotype of the you know the greedy developer the arrogant architect the the the the expedient cynical politician personally I don't think those people exist in such large numbers as many think they do I think most people are trying to as a community in this city is how do we now build a city that preserves the suburbs we enjoy and we've grown up in but we also have areas of higher density and that's what we try to know that that's what the project will be outside your front door over the next few decades can we do that well so people love the place create a sense of a stronger sense of community reduce the domination of cars you know make developments that are stick and people can enjoy living in and then realize some other virtues of living in high-density not anyone's going to like it but the point is that in our life over the life cycle of an Australian you want different things at different ages you know at the moment we don't have much choice Perth is pretty much a monoculture whereas I you know when I'm 20 I'm on a certain kind of lifestyle in a certain environment 30 50 70 it's all different we should be able to provide that diversity now throughout the this question because this is not your neck of the woods but it's similar if you know we go at the front there it's a pretty tough environment and it's very much the sort of environment that cars made for themselves while we weren't looking and the question now is how do we retrofit for those places which we use as service house now we designed these places for cars for getting in and getting out and we to our nice suburban environment the challenge for us all now is to get into these tough bits of country and rebuild them so that they become the heart the hearts of new communities so that's I'll leave you on that because that's the challenge you're facing it all I'll leave it right there thank you very much
This was triggered by Tony Abbott in the last election he said I'm going to plant 20 million trees and I thought that he's going to play training in trees well it ends up being just that little dark green square there that's Tony's garden then the next biggest one that slightly lighter colored green that's interesting that was Bob Hawke's garden baubles ray was a mad tree planter over billion troffer 400 or whatever is anywhere look trees and the last green square you can see there in the lightest color of green is in fact the the scale of a forest sorry vegetation that you would need to plant in order to offset the carbon emissions of a country of 4.2 are 42 million now that people tell that's something you're not going to do that book will in fact you might in a carbon economy you might be viable there might be economics that can underpin projects of that nature we talked about highways broadband ports we talked about all the hard stuff the gray stuff we never talked me that as this century unfolds we will be talking about those sorts of infrastructures and you know why you know this is a this is about a group of us that have been living in a very strange landscape just over time learning how to live with it and maybe now you know we're being forced to turn the corner we can no longer just exploited and expect to get away with it we have to put something back this is what we've been doing with regard to just a more simple operation this is digging holes they're all the mine sites this is all in Australia not all active but where we've been digging and testing and and all the operative minds as well you can see we have a pretty good god you know if Australia was a child you'd marvel that its propensity for digging bloody holes in the vows now this is interesting too that's the broadband there's another piece of infrastructure and I like this is important here of course because if we have that sort of to think about the spawn coastal plain as a you know perhaps the Swan coastal pine can support many more people I'm just going to put that one out there for the time being and I'm going to get to it shortly I think with regards to something we've been leaning it what how many people could use to stay on the Swan coastal plain if you don't ever I'm living in Perth or Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane then you know maybe you can distribute people through larger areas of landscape and and they're grafted onto broadband technologies which enables new economies and so on this image the size of the dots here getting getting down to Tim tax now in terms of the predicted growth we don't have time to look at the stats the numbers but the size of the bubble represents the size of the proportion of growth so Darwin's going gangbusters and sure darns only a hundred thousands of northern territories only hundred thousand people very proud people but the problem you know I think we seriously need to look at darwin on the one hand and singapore on the other and you know kind of asked them what happened why isn't darwin supporting many more numbers of people and a much more powerful economy in that close to that asian market you know if I was if I was power I'd build a great University and down for a start you know to sort of kick started and buy into that age and educational market perth has a similar capacity we're in a good time zone you can see our growth rate is massive because the size of the bubble represents that we are predicted we're about 1.6 something now 1.6 million people the high ABS figure for perth by 2050 six is 4.2 million there's no plan for that our planning is still dealing with relatively small numbers they've just started to Ratchet it up a bit because there will have realized they're behind the eight ball they're not moving fast enough so when you calculate it out with the population of 42 million Australians by mid-century forecasts for the cities and regions you've still got about six million people unaccounted for so this something is going to have to happen I mean and that's assuming that is assuming that the electrics in Melbourne are going to tolerate more growth I don't know every time I go to Melbourne that people are asking up about population Sydney's a basket case both people are starting to get a bit angry about traffic jams and all the rest of it we're only surviving because of desal plants in terms of water now mycological footprints through the roof you know so something's assuming despite all that assuming our politicians can still prosecute growth and get it and convince the electric to absorb that growth you've still got a look at where are you going to house our large numbers of people now my answer to that is pretty simple you need to look at areas of the country where you build built you seize and that's a project that well that's a fact that should interest wa because wa would be still means we need to research where it might be sensible to do that in this in this part of the world and so then maybe this one can talk show you some some sort of snapshots or doors near sketches really we haven't had we are armed I'm till I'm not standing here trying to be off thora tative about this I'm just starting to think about these I need some more money to do proper research as to where people should should be encouraged to go anyway what we'll be doing in my business is we use a lot of maps we layer all the maps of all the different aspects you can get in terms of the data each map you see in that layer cake stacked there is a geology vegetation infrastructure weather patterns and so on you put below you can compress all those maps and it helps you make informed decisions about where might be the best place to go that's the result of map that's about all the information we can get Australia all-in-one voyance makes where the opportunities really lie in terms of settlement and sustainability we've just made some fairly obvious yeah choices Australia is emptying out from the inside toward the coast and that's just a historical process I suppose I you know the north of Tasmania is what each of these bubbles are all shapes represent these areas that need to be studied in terms of trying to find an appropriate form of urban development to those particular circumstances so the more north of Tasmania I've listed breathe pros and cons of all of these places in the drawing but we don't have time for that so I'll just whip around quickly norfolk tasmania will be of interest think because of its water and so on and food bowl the built from melbourne through camera and on to sydney and up into brisbane it's possible and people talk quite a lot about that becoming loan kind of conurbation one mega city linked by fast rail which you know use almost economically doable at the moment and you know you ask yourself or could you distribute population possible that you could I suppose these these decision to make those decisions is of course very complicated but in the north of tests are Queensland between Makai and cans is also an area of rapid growth where there is there are some compelling reasons for encouraging growth up there I've mentioned Darwin already a little bit badara Darwin down to calendar it seems to me to be an area where we're currently releasing more land income and RF or imprison the food bowl I would have thought we should look pretty seriously a major new Urban development's in that part of the world the military is certainly interested in that part of the world which is a good kind of catalyst for Urban Development and I've mentioned Darwin's growth kununurra could you build a city around cañon ara I don't know it's worth studying seriously the Pilbara is a bit different the Pilbara is high-risk I think and the government is plowing money into the Pilbara now as you most of you would know the minister happened upon the figure of 50,000 a lot of research in that now you know those of you that have been to corral there it's some karuppa wasn't chosen for all of the sorts of reasons that make people happy it was chosen by the miners for pragmatic reasons so whether it's right to now go and graft on to pour money into corral Thor or not I don't know it's one of the most interesting social experiments going on in the world today you know to just to try and make a city or of large town where there currently is virtually nothing my personal opinion is that I would have if I had to pick where in Western Australia I'd be pouring min num the money I'd probably pick geraldton you know it's about 30,000 people now predicted to go out to a high figure of 128 by meat Okojie is coming online it's got good amenity water food and it in headlines a belt of development possibly from geraldton down to earth and double down south from here as well which you see circles Australia in the next few decades are going to become increasingly competitive there are going to be parts of the country that elect for slow growth and that could be a prudent strategy you know let's not buy into this it's too much the ecological consequences are unknown steady as she goes other places will be very ambitious and encourage population growth boost their economies and attempt to grow these parts of the country and appeal to the immigrant the immigrants that are coming to Australia to sustain our labor markets as to where they should settle now in the government can direct immigration as you know to a degree we can't kill people in place forever in a free country so there will be a thorough of national competition let alone a global competition to retain people skilled labor and so on so how we develop these places is really important notes now it's now a matter of intelligent planning not on that not a matter of excellent so let's come down to our neck of the woods we just this is pretty crude the little orange me here there's what nest I battlekey you mean these are three different scenarios for the growth of the spawn coastal plain just to start a conversation we proposed bulldozing everything and building suburbs that's what we're good at you we can do that very qualified in that area so you get 90 million people 90 million is people living the Australian Dream with a free-standing home invite whatever they use to get from their home to work it might be called a car but it will have to be something individual mobility you cannot run suburbs on public transport doesn't work public transport only works when you get a density up much higher anyway this is the Australian Dream scope let's imagine we've lost all our biodiversity we would have leveled the topography because we're pretty good that and you get 90 million people living the dream now you know what are they going to do I don't know but it's just it's a kind of a what I call extreme logic to illustrate a point middle one we've backed off all of the biodiversity and said don't knock down a single tree that's over those days ago this is really valuable stuff lock it in preserve it all and reconnect it as I was talking about earlier with the fragmentation of biodiversity then you get it out being in living in suburbs it's the lot of people I mean you know if that's 50 million future Australians living on the Swan coastal plain now that that kind of what you'd be talking about here is in all cases in fact in all forms of urbanism into the future you'll have to harvest water well every building every pavement every everything has to harvest water and purify water and so on but you know we will also be rigged up to desalination plants for which will need our nuclear power plants in order to run now the final option on the far right is probably you know I think that's that's a more interesting option what we've done there is we've said don't knock growth to food production so you start to get a more sensible balance of people and place you know this miracle of supermarkets just having everything at all times of the year for all over the world world is that kind of petrochemical illusion so anyway it seemed then you then the figure drops radically that drops down to about 10 million so you could have 10 million people on the Swan coastal plain from geraldton down to st. Margaret River distributed through that landscape living in Loudon's philly low density environments enjoying the the amenity surrounded by agricultural landscapes not far from the coast they would look that the form of that urbanism this is not a new idea these idea here there's only so many ways you could distribute human beings but this is really a cluster of villages linked to broadband linked by Transport Systems trucking cars light rail high-speed rail perhaps from Geraldton down to Perth you know would open up that landscape we preserve all the vegetation there's a compilation of it I've got solar wind nuclear I've got villages essentially villages of 30 or 40 50 thousand people networked Geraldton down to here it's a kind of conversational vision of a fear of the future growth of the swamp
Now come down to the situation in Australia from that global background for you and and when you consult the ABS the Australian Bureau of Statistics always deals in three figures series a B and C but essentially a conservative figure for the for their future of forecasts a middle figure and a high figure 30 mil this is our 2056 at the moment to meet the mid mid century projection for Australia its third and low figure is 30 million the one that rug kept talking about now that Gillard doesn't wanna talk about it was 35 so Rudwick for the you know he kind of veggies bets and 42 is the one that I've worked with because my view is in planning at least which and so on planting seeds it seems prudent to me to deal with the biggest number I mean if you don't reach at least you've got things covered and in any case we are going to my view anyway we're going to become 42 million mid-century of it thereafter maybe even earlier now these figures are kind of mind that they are absolutely normal figures for Australia in terms of Australian history there's nothing unusual with anything there a little bit light on it's just that they're getting bigger because the the point of departure from the future is bigger the other problem is of course through the 19th and 20th century in this country at least growth and numbers and the development of space and the expansion of cities and industry was and it was absolutely it was implicitly perceived as progress and good now let me talk about growth it's cast in terms of crisis so it and and and certainly most Australians are noticing in their daily life styles in large metropolitan seas at least that life is getting a bit more frustrating you know there's a kind of electoral backlash and in my view if the politicians will back off pushing population growth in urban environments in the established cities because it's Polly tenable infrastructure is overload dis congestion and so on and so forth anyway so I reckon we're looking at 42 in my mid century about 62 million by the end of the century which the ABS has also prepared to go out to because in terms of research you go out that far things get a bit wobbly you can most most efforts around the world at the moment to deal with the future and in a sensible manner go out to about mid century now the point I would like to make about that is whilst we have a lot of research around the world going out to meet century not me in terms of all sorts of all aspects of our future in Australia we have not a single plan that goes beyond 2031 there is no plan for the numbers on China now the federal government is to its credit scrambling to kind of get together a national understanding of the urban consequences of this kind of growth they're trying to get a grip on and coordinate policy through coleg and so on and through infrastructure Australia and the major cities unit which is which is a good thing because we do need a sort of holistic national appraisal of indicate what it means really is another 20 million Australians now we've got about 22 at the moment so it's essentially a doubling and try to you know try to try to get that in your in your head in terms of this is not talking about a little bit of expansion in terms of our suburbs we're talking about the Australia we currently know literally doubling in dimension now that's in terms of infrastructure and and and so on this is this is an enormous project it took us you know a couple hundred years to do what to create the nation we can't and now we're saying we're going to double it in four decades wouldn't be a problem in China I know that but down here it's a big problem and politicians are they're not getting it I mean I you know I talk to a lot of people about this issue and they're not getting it so I try to make pictures to help them get it and this is this is what they do know you look around in camera and I can say to them you've got to build 59 more of these you know you'd better get cracking or 12 Perth's for this audience 12 Perth's now what does that mean 12 and four decades you know that's like one every four or five years in it and see yeah and we're worried out where the building should be three stories on incomes 0 to 10 Brisbane five cities or five more burns now you know extra 20 million people means 8.7 million freestanding homes in planning's the paths we work on foot to the demand of changes but it develop you're working on two point three people per freestanding home if you say we're not going to build any more freestanding homes no more suburbs going to build apartments we calculate it out on one point nine people per apartment which gives you about 10 million apartments Harriet trigger waffle be pleased with that number now I'll try to look at this spatially and help visualize it because you know pictures when I represent this issue like this because that red dot in the middle now represents some of 20 million people accurate everything I'm showing you try it's accurate if it is knowledge and over that's 20 million people living in a typical Aussie fairly low density suburb and it's not it's probably not in a very good place but you know there is no you never know they might be aquifers and it going and all the other cds were developed really because boats bumped into two reasonably nice spots with some military protection and got going with australia hasn't been planned as such the only planned place was Canberra and that wasn't really planned that was politically planned as a compromise rather than a an answer to where is the best place in this country to build a city so there's my summer of 20 million people now the question becomes when you look at that I suppose in terms of the landmass of Australia and you think Jesus be deal really it's pretty small it's tons of is add the ecological footprint which I did for the family of four West Australians and that's what you've done that's the land you need for your 42 million Australia's now if you can see you've blown it a bit up in the Gulf of Carpentaria and if you've gone beyond the Great Australian Bight but there's still plenty of land kind of fits Asaro probably right in that regard but the problem is this only ten percent of Australia is arable land right so we've got a squeeze food out of ten percent 450 million and not and then deal with the economic consequences of a radically altered export market with regard to our agriculture and as I said at the outset that agriculture you know the agricultural landscapes are in trouble the murray-darling and palliative care the week belts for salt and we have to drop 200 million tons every year of phosphate off the country to keep boosting it so if something you know something's going to have to give me water will be another problem these little harbours and we need to find about 76 of those in order to give 42 million australians enough water assuming their current habits don't change 10 minutes shells and I like collecting sort of big silly ideas about how we might deal with this perplexing country of ours and this is a collection on this map of the dashed lines are ideas that didn't get built and the solid lines there's only two of them to see why I can't of pipeline and the snowy mountains river scheme on the right hand you're right outside all the others have just big ideas for how we might move order from where we have it to populations where we don't have it and you know the last one from Colin Barnett was to the cane toad highway down from the orb into Perth and they're talking about it again and I've got a couple like I've collected so here we go there's a couple more this one was from the former director of the Liberal Party Elliot the other night said no of these natwest and we'll flush out the murray-darling well it's just an engineering problem you see Australia is just a simple problem of engineering and enough gutsy blokes to really get into it and do it you know Australia actually doesn't work like that and we should have learned that by now it's a very subtle landscape that's complicated and it usually mocks big you know eight of the engineering interventions I mean fact if you want to know about how the Australian landscape works you probably need to consult the people would have been living there for 60,000 years I mean I'm going into a house and people have been here for 60 thousand years I'd ask them you know where the lights and the tax for all the rest of it we've neglected to do that and this is the other one I read in my local paper the other day a bloke was saying what he's got a better idea is going to run water in a plastic pipe from the Kimberley's and it'll go Perth and this is my personal favorite this is laying Hancock lang hancock said no worries what you got to do is block the Great Australian Bight and then the ocean will push deeper into the middle of the country you'll get more evaporation and then lo and behold you have rain over the center of the country and will have you know farms and no Derrick golf courses so now speaking about these big sorts of things if you really like getting people in the studio to just look at things kind of accurately and and it tends to cut through via the vagaries of political debate but this is a diagram again accurate of the size of a wind farm that you would need if you wanted to power in Australia or flew to input I'll bring it down to proof there is that's 300 kilometers by 300 kilometers of winged major wind installation you can see Perth on the right is the little gross blood and you can see what this volunteer so that's a compelling kind of project I mean it's solutions to our future you won't_''_661.839 it's not going to be one size fits all but for a state that prides itself on unfairly big you know things and engineering I think some of these big renewable projects would be pretty interesting that could be coupled with wave power of course now if you look at solar it gets the installation itself gets much smaller solar is only 50 cows by 50 cows there it is there compared to Perth or it doesn't have to be one installation you could distribute that over all of the roofs of the future homes that we're going to need to build for a population of 42 million problem there is getting a government that could manage to distribute effectively now this is what now wants to talk about but we need to talk about because this has a zero carbon footprint effectively and that is nuclear power if you want to power on Australia or 42 million people you need 100 nuclear reactors no problem there is well there's two problems what's wrong with that picture is do you do at the waist now assuming that can be mitigated into the future then nuclear power is appealing because of its its some performance with regard to to low carbon footprint and its its base load power the other thing about the national situation is the cost of the erosion this goes back to food production and so on but this is an image of biodiversity and habitat the Greens essentially what's left of movement you can see we've been chewing into it for so that we builders pretty much about that what was there is being raised and replaced with the Maya culture for obvious reasons now that the preservation and the maintenance of that fairly fragile and now fragmented habitat across the land mass of the country is very important because it holds all things are held together through the interconnections of the ecosystem and that image tends to represent the important structural kind of remnants of that system and I've currently got a PhD students Kyle working on how you might reconnect some of these systems you see that in landscape turns and a bunch of green stuff over here people might think oh that's cool or green stuff and green stuff but the problem is there's no connection the ecosystem needs to be connected and that's particularly relevant with regard to climate change because the gene pool the animals and the plants will need to adapt and in order to adapt the gene pool needs to flow so you need to try and connect the system if you just have an island like kings park it just did goes backwards it loses its diversity
I'm currently doing research into Australia's settlement patterns I'm predicting on forecasting it out to about mid century so I'm working with abs figures regarding Australia's growth and trying to note to sort of dispassionately and sensibly understand how we might deal with population growth on a fairly massive scale and where might be the best parts of the entire land mass of Australia in which to encourage people to settle how should we develop our cities into the future you know but before I get to that I'm going to talk about that I am going to come down from that scale of the nation to earth because we're all interested with perfect cool so I appreciate that I what I'm intentionally not doing is coming down to the scale of your particular area I'm not talking about canada I mean there's currently a lot of work going on in that area and next week there'll be workshops and we've been doing some analysis and so on but I thought I would just use them the opportunity's think of it as the larger context to the way in which we make local decisions I want to try and provide you with a much larger context in which you can make those decisions and therefore I'm starting with the global situation before I get down to even the australian situation because there's a couple of very interesting things going on ever since human beings stopped moving as nomadic peoples and started building cities villages then seems that was about 10,000 years ago ever since then settlement has incubated human beings we had a surplus of supply of food from agriculture and the consequences were quite dangerous because we always denuded the landscapes around our cities it was always a problem sees have always been a problem it was never easy sailing never never sure if you can get enough food but what we did have surplus food over that long historical period what has happened is cities have incubated people we've grown population for 10,000 years now the most interesting thing that's going on this century I reckon is that for the first predicted to stabilize with the cities will no longer grow people incubate people and this is a phenomenon whereby most demographers agree on this that the creation of cities and the migration of people from rural areas into urban environments that is occurring all over the world as we speak South America China India so on puts a damper on population growth so you know you can look at China and think I art out of controls building seas you know and in actual fact in some ways it's a good thing because the human race light for the first time in the history of settlement stabilized and that the reason I say that's interesting is because then then it becomes it's no longer a big story about continual progress and growth in terms of numbers it's a then going to become a story I say story I mean you know social political philosophical technical challenge how do you sustain 10 billion human beings we can t have 6.5 okay now you all know that the planet is hemorrhaging at the moment with 6.5 and there are those in the first world that have lifestyle such as us and there were billions of people in fact there are a billion people that currently a malnourished it's predicted by mid-century there will be about two billion that won't have access to potable water I mean stuff we just take for granted so there's huge global inequities and that's going to be the problem because how do you and they'll be geopolitical conflict based on resources on simple things like food and water because we're now in the midst of a food crisis and a water crisis with 6.5 billion and you've got to go 10 million so it's not just 10 billion people surviving on a little bit of dirty water in a bowl of grain it's 10 billion people who will expect to live the way we do all right now unless you're gonna stand up in five a lot of those beer beings of people and tell them they don't have the right to live the way we take the granted with wealth and've got to work out how on earth literally we're going to distribute wealth and information and technology and so that 10 billion people can lead just a decent lifestyle so that's the kind of you know and the environmentalist will generally give you a pessimistic view of that is not going to work planets going to break down I'm not a pessimist I'm an optimist I believe that human beings are extremely intelligent creative things and even if they're not in their rat cunning they will work it out you know so but it's going to get it'll be messy because the pressure is immense you can't stop this population growth unless you're in the business of genocide which probably none of you will be look I ask my students regularly to making me just for me off the future the way they feel about it will see it when I tend to get images like this we each kind of these lights off Kenya oh I think it's much better it's dark and strong religious you know the dark it's going to be better because images you know it's just that one we have to knock that one out really we just so I asked them to make images and I tend to get images like this which what you can notice he's the top of the image of could be Perth it's kind of ok you know it's sunny and there's an Indian Ocean the bottom half of the image is clearly apocalyptic yeah that's good see down here we don't type of draw but this is if divided through the middle if you like this is the sort of appalling future that we might be moving into and that's iconic rosie image of progress it could almost be the image from mount eliza looking at perth it's not but you know and I'm going to reinforce the kind of by the dual nature of this image with two quotes which I which represent the hysterical nature of the population debate in this country and I want to get around that pretty quickly and getting do I do maybe sort of background hum two things here in the two quotes up the top is Harry treatable Harry treated wat with a developer in the eastern states now Harry says no worries Australia should be a hundred million people ok he also says we should reengineer the rivers it's got a problem and we have musical accompaniment tonight that's good am now down the bottom you've got another quote from a very famous population biologist from the United States called Paul village and wrote a famous book in the 70s called the population bomb he was in Australia recently and he made the comment this was when Rudd was talking about Australia being 35 million people and Paul Ehrlich made the comment that we don't talk to me about 35 million new people are going to have to evacuate you know you're in the most arid part of the world there are clear environmental limitation just can't continue to live this way with climate change and your carbon footprint and all the rest of it now I reckon both of're being told by an expert we should evacuate and on the other we're being told we can just grow to 100 million people so you get this kind of boyish booster ish you know attitude on the one hand in a dire environmental pessimism on the other I'll give you the middle ground which I think is is where things are at and this is this is at least the most reliable sort of datum on which I can base my work at the moment in 2002 syro conclude that there's enough water enough food enough land enough energy to provide what it referred to as a moderate lifestyle for fifty million Australians so sorrow kind of put their cards on the table and said this country with its distinct environmental limitations can sustain 50 million people now it's true that Australia concurrently feed we do feed 50 million people we just export a lot of that food so that will challenge as population grows we only feed 50 million people though because we dumped 200 million tons of phosphates onto the land every year you know agriculture is going to have to reinvent itself from the future global in order to get enough yield to feed not just a few Australians but the 10 billion people that I introduce the tour group so whether you like it or not it's going to be a genetic future no because the land as it is just can't_''_570.2 pump out that much nourishment now the thing about the quote that I've got there from cyro is I reckon they should have put a footnote against the word moderate you know what I mean they should have disqualified what they meant by moderate because I and these people are not not many of us are moderate and I don't know many politicians that are going to stand up and you know tell us to be more moderate there are some things you can do with regard to sustainability through behavioral change but not a lot if we're going to work this out and be smarter about resources mindful of global equity within environmental limitations I think we've got to design our way cuz I come from with linebacker I think we can creatively and intelligently innovate our systems so that we can become more sustainable I don't being sustainable in a kind of miserable environmental medieval since you know I don't think sustainability is going to work if it's punitive you know the first thing if someone tells me I can't do something I'll have a go of doing it stuff so anyway what what most Australians and and certainly West Australians perceive as a moderate lifestyle is something like this this is not a bit of big flash home that's not a McMansion there's no real pretensions here now that of course now in Western Australia will cost you close to half a million dollars it depends on the location but you know you get my point that affordability of different story but it's all related I suppose now the reason I've cropped that image so tightly is to make it to make a point that's the way we see our homes my home my family my money my future I is an investment I mean this is one of the factors that you've got to be mindful of with communities these days and particularly with the way the dynamics of the outer suburbs people don't buy into communities the way my parents did where they lived in that community for nearly 30 years people are buying in trying to get out I mean it's all part of a a cycle so anyway I'll now show you from an ecological point of view or an environmental point of view the true image of that property and by that I mean I want to show you the actual amount of space that is required to sustain your moderate family of four West Australians living in a moderate house and here it is the house is now the little red box in the middle the green space you see is 58 hectares of land so that's 58 58 subiaco ovals especially bit more than that but you know there are there abouts that's the ecology what we call the ecological footprint and you can measure this full for family of four which means each one of us in this room tonight if you do the math on its four and a half subiaco ovals which I need to sustain one of you to get your food deal with your waste all the energy requirements all of the material the Australian average is considerably less 8.1 if this for the average Ozzy and the world average is 2.2 now you know you'd have to be a genius to sort of look at numbers like that and think something's a bit wrong here if I'm if it costs for it in front of global perspective it costs 14.5 to run me and yet it may cost 2.2 around the average world citizen I'm obviously excessive and is it there's an imbalance there now I plank the point clear I've written here a global aristocracy because you see that the family living in that red box there there little modder at home is a kind of aristocracy they don't think they are they like the Old English aristocracy in the sense that they their lifestyle and add up to the house it looks like that image they look like the old land in English aristocracy it's just that that green land all that land there is distributed globally you don't see now the other factor to bear in mind you can run this the other I am think well if everyone on the planet and this is the 6.5 billion little over 10 billion that where that demographers agree is what we're headed for by mid-century if we if everyone lived the way we do now we would need fireplace which I can show you there is now that's not going to fly literally but what it means really is that this gets back to my point about desired and humans being creative and intelligent we need to kind of get five times the stuff out of that one planet we do have and some from a global equity perspective and from the population figures that we are now working with which are agreeable
Tonight is the third of our speaker series events as you may know the city of Canon D is holding these as a precursor to engaging the community and this will occur in the second half of the year and essentially would be engaging with you and trying to find out what you like about the area or if you say and what would like to be seeing in the future the outcome outcomes of the engagement sessions that really holding the second half of you will be incorporated into a community planet and this will be the key in guarding the council's planning and service delivery so tonight I'd like to introduce Richard well his professor of landscape architecture at WA and he is the director of the urban design center air the urban design in her of wh Richard will raise the issue tonight or purse predicted population growth and what this means and suburbs like the city of K so if you can raise your hands
I think a change in zoning to walk back in our five in 70 terror and there's a pretty shopping for apple picking day sub-regions really cool young survival Odyssey and that's what I found oppressive I enjoy my holly then I'll I love my god happens to be 90 yeah it's my family I love the point for mental health we write me to see the park we love using every that those horrible new subdivisions these cars park or Avengers and the veggies babies and kids are at sea bass ceviche and Iraq equal now I'm all starting pitcher and I'm also an investor in the air I live in there but I throw it around your books DVD routine plays for the CVT we're on the river and you'd never know it interest rates no and it should we be a shiny that should we be showing that we shall not to be super um and I Jonathan by the Council of the bottom of the heavy absolutely terrible about driven through Wilson lots of toxins on even challenge three places those poor people I don't have any other accommodations are putting your life every time I actually hungry and she'd never been approved and that's that's what is net I don't know the site very well have not haven't work here very long but I quite understand a little bit about that the challenge of particularly that the growth of the student housing type product that's being built in wilson and independently and I guess we've started it's the counselors of certainly no concern about that for some time we started the process of having a look at what sort of different planning controls can be put in place to guide better development we can't do a lot about investment that's already happened but we can also always look for the for the future to try but they're the sorts of issues that as we go through the Community Plan process we want to learn more about and find the way of the solutions to overcome because you know Wilson there's a few other places you described them as perfect that they're there a hidden asset that no one really knows about and it's how you actually protect them and look after him and get the most out of that for the the communities into the future it is the challenge away we all come from recently they have quite a large user organization to do Youth Council which is an australia-wide kind of basis now does the city of canning have a youth council representative are they looking at developing that this idea of looking at what the youth need you've spoken about the 20 to 30 year old have what's our councils doing if we've got a young population that's growing what have we gone to these guys that are in high school at the moment and said well what do you want what do you need what what can we do here and making happy to be here have any of those sorts of questions being it's a fantastic question we've started to have some area some of the staff would be seeking out conversation and in fact a speaker event for observing date in the latter part of two he's going to be youth focused and have the youth involved in that we hope to keep those people involved in in the process of the community plan as we move forward beyond just an event that starts to stimulate that conversation so we're at the very beginning of that journey but it's but it's certainly in your minds I think it's come to a bit of a natural end in a moment I'll ask the man to come and think Marion before we but this is two things on your tables one is a little speaker evaluation if you remind just ticking that and then there's the little promo for the next event which is when Richard Weller joins us on the twenty-sixth of may so please miss me yeah boy I think Marion just like the one we have a question is in Christ what is that what it Wilson we got a beautiful does they have done obviously probably some of you people know subdivided some blocks they are less than 350 square meters and although the council I say not support that obviously in the commissioners today with then we're on to the end up how's india just subdivide loss deborah lactation to build device because if you refuse it mr. tribunal the matter will be made out of the council things the everyone we're going to use down india won t for example we having that some of youthful beauty schools to come to tell us for example north the river cane river because somebody will say north through the same up for the swamp isn't we ever want the offense function centre we we have invited you to come and give their aspect and look at that people building if their import to see what they'd like to see because that really do for M&S perhaps YogI's and also them for future generations I was done the other thing that I proposed where was it at the moment lease to be trying to incite summer youth within the senior schools we can see to form the article in school and report back to them some of their idea of come back to the council to address their concerns are the other thing now obviously a commander councilman with a lot of things and I think that some people said that the rivers they expect activity not only a test last week over that idea seminar dammit echo 7 horizon to the fertilizers some people attended and obviously lot more people needs to know something to definitely publicize because what happens is it as the city grows we employ more cars and weapons so there's no as the truck sort of vehicle deep water oil should save money petrol for all this nasty teens and whether than her and I was never about you know so some of the people are normally the am thinking yes to really what happens and we are trying to make people aware of things but unfortunately some people still doesn't take no care for treating you have some volunteers that they put a lot of time into making they're everywhere beautiful we've created a at sea the council hunters from ops 1 and there's a lot of other things so one of the main thing what I like to do there are a lot of people that do you but I wasn't open now is that I like to do opportunity to think Marion before stimulating our over the thoughts and obviously if you can see poster having so many people here tonight with us Tony and variety of issues and I think that if the government of the politician up tonight at domino's without any of them here which might be able to there were president would be able to take some of the ideas to you attending back to the cabinet or today Defoe by parliamentarian to say this is really what happens out there I less thing I out there in the ocean like hats ago me know what happens in the suburbs now the CDM wants to move move along because and my view he's there people will choose to leave in areas where we have all the facilities if there's no facility and it's taller are all the things that it would look for you know give him the services it will not come live here so anyways toilet met you know he does impaired people to marry me and you can get a block of free memory but how many people going there next to get it I mean because for the services you know and therefore we try to you to get some sort of bug advance but at the same time we gotta move it eschews they have paradigms you know we all use especially when I went up in this country yes you know how can relate what we already had to save tonight and things if you go through the point that we know I'm going to Pebble you know all those things and all about and I remember when know we had sort of forget the fictional water fish between ever shared this is what heat the water so I can tell you outrun them take you to my anyway so I like to really take you to marry to come along provides new release to our thoughts of stimulating delight is good for the year for the city of heading and coming from the metropolitan area and one of the thing is that doesn't even scared by virgin olive oil into the directives that the train transporting it is because they're going to have done to you ordering the the carriages is my idea that's the bus isn't here with the trains because I want to put of the bus supposed to get people to subject attempt to the nearest rawr station and dentate the first because at the moment here from our level all the way for first the buses along on the highway different some spot and the freeway they did the same thing there's the freeway you would aligned reserves for the buses before you got to try and then you know why don't you drop them at the nearest ocean because the buses if the buses go round is over and the verse let's walk five minutes and we are getting old you're not a botanist and you have the buses give me 10 minutes do now believe it because they can't think about you know there how do they do it because for business or whatever and don't do it for the facility and the efficiency for people you know and then where other things we need to do much with the with the tribes they can put more transmit but if you have a premier example from Shelley fandom PowerPoint and there's those buses go to their our stations and go back you will find a more people will use that you know then after way and I our dear on how to ask away from the next bus yeah well they put some oil think I'm living run every 15 minutes what's all the hoopla to get the buses then you on but that's next they're really trying to do the minister for transport was there and other things they probably gonna change many more because he might wanna be we can see any improvement my favorite so I really got here about cleaning around where wait make it only one line you go eat you in the first place would it be much better yeah that's all I give this Easter it already yes I will take any one time of abundance I put it on a book share what are you talking often do you play and smoke
Once again genders are taking up talking about transport incentive systems circular station has seven and a half million people cry 3 space stars tricycle and as a central line across the center of touch and Wilson gets going out angriff negative 25 million people not just music I mean the challenge around that particular topic in marin I've been having other conversations about the whole issue of how you get the funding mechanisms in place and the government really has a plan that some of us have seen little bits of them and council Mason pointed out that the survey for the so-called knowledge arc which links the sensitive Curtin University around through the city and out to UWA there's actually survey work going on through having a look at what where it might fit so some of the work is being done even before the plans released if you like which is a little off but but the question does come back down to the funding I worked with ministry 10 and the Department of Planning and infrastructure for about five years and it was a that project was about 1.6 billion dollars if you add a little more when that was just finished if you like I said to the minister where we going to spend our next two billion dollars which was the 1.6 plus a bit of inflation if you like and then I thought now that's really the wrong thing to say minister to the minister is where he spent the next 10 or 20 billion dollars so you've got a bigger picture and where you might do it and then it becomes where do you get the money and how do you get that locked in so that it doesn't become a political football over over time with with treasure reason and weighing the waiters of ways of policy choices because it needs to be something that's locked into a city building program but other questions please in that County to the plan at all oh we've done some work at the committee for Perth which is what you requested the role of the Arts in a growing population particularly with an aging population the work it has series of recommendations for local government and then we see the arts has been incredibly important to the future in our not only in terms of mental health and community cohesion but also in terms of sense of creating local vibrancy and local distinction and friend mentor is probably a very good example of a place that you go into it you feel it's quite different to a lot of other places in Perth and it's probably because of its architecture but also it's sort of its culture and the way it presents itself so certainly have got some challenges out there to local government and to state government but typically the arts are highly demanded and it's just not seen as politically go state-level politically important but it's sexual it's an essential ingredient to a healthy community maybe a couple more custom pls kappa very interested in the comment you made there sometimes I think this is probably good for I've seen boiling mr. driving and I think it right at 30 something arises that partners have gone the next between number population and number coffee shops are opening up but those high rise buildings in Eurasia on the 8th 9th 10th floor where you're a puppet of the suit marketer to actually track people in there to get you think we need to do so it might receive it more fire and one of the other things about raising this council is the opportunity to have care as a combinational faculty property rather than suffer provide it for you know another unit but it's a communication that you only thought about lack of direction was like that our people as historical missionary had a voice to get back there and not be treated like little donkeys if you like and in pain who deserves that actually get something happening in the communication side when you come across this sort of thing you do these tools and how much of this information that's exactly the big really I think direction is 20 31 which is the state government document which talks so each local government about how it fits into the metropolitan area to the Metropolitan system have a real opportunity to think about how you can respond and I was on the armidale Redevelopment Authority for a short period of time and it was very interesting because there was a prevailing view by the Minister for planning at the time that Armadale should become subiaco by Scott and it's a service whimsical view of how people in armadale actually lived and what we found was in the standard three by one technical Armadale house there was often three generations living there so it might be an aged parent living with a couple who have got teenage children or it might be the couple living with their daughter who's had a child so this sense of that it was going to become his funky groove a little place where that I was only going to be housing for one car was ridiculous because there's not a lot of public transport out to the suburbs of Armadale and everyone needed to get around all the weather was to school or to work a lot of people working trades and Anna does go into non-traditional sort 31 you've got a real chance to respond to this housing Tigers and talk about some of the things that you need in your community because the government is not going to be able to build an ark aged care facilities it's just not possible the opportunity to offer a concession to Karis accommodation about to be broken ground and another unit for something else living keeps keeps the elderly in our population is aging and whether that becomes a family really communicated so absolutely starts so through your templates you will have the opportunity not at the moment not at the moment for something so you have some local control as well as some stuff but I know my personal view you know to respond to you about is state government thinking about Bertha 3.5 million people I don't think it is not a collimated way and I don't think through the bureaucracies I think that the planning department is the only place where this discussion is happening it's not happening in transport it's not happening in health it's not having education representing the business community who treat earth like a business you know they say well with all the inputs that you've gotten all the challenges that we face and all the incumbent your disposable hating k to actually fix these problems if these conversations happen in a coal or native life but not so I think it's working in a very strong voice from a local community perspective type as much as you can in your own like about this age so simple as that people as well as in also as a way that we are aging and up to 75 some people are coming back to getting props and they're nearly 80 how do you think we were going to be cared for people at work I think we're thinking wrong about that person and I don't thinking about how we design a facility in a more efficient manner than this open Sprott flat with in cyber sharp function that the only don't_''_526.81 I getting leads you know other countries do it really well with high-rise age facilities as well as ps4 hardly more families actually living together because the cost of living is is too much and as well as the cost of care in Virginia just outside of Washington I saw what presented itself as twin towers of a hyatt hotel and then when we sort of scrutinized it a bit more we actually realize that one town was the high hotel and the other towers are aged care facility because they have to do the same thing Lenna needs to be changed every day males need to be prepared people need to be looked after so I thought that was a fantastic per location opportunity happened more which are Larry the city is committed to doing some engagement the young people find out tienes la machinima Connecticut Earth has also done some what has carbon fork to the committee for 30 terms of the names of object we should be doing painting sense or people in the 16 to 26 year old age available for aggressive well interestingly a young group of professionals who probably fitted more into the 20 to 30 age bracket approached us when we were at that stage and they said we really like to come under your own brother and we said well we were actually think you need to be independent of us so that you can give us whatever feedback it is you want to give within less than two years they've actually saw this group of 14 people who've been meeting with much bigger and bigger within two years were gone half of them had left curve so that was very telling in itself I've subsequently got another group together and we certainly have some very robust discussions about the perfect future because what you're finding is people feel that for their CV they need to go national if not international so that's yet for my career development I've got I've got to get out of Earth I've got to have other experiences as well as this sense that I could always come back to poof I'm going to come home to roost when it's time so I'm going to leave first base between probably my early 20s and one they're very nostalgic about a fifth they want to come back to so the railing against it's a purpose for more vibrant let's have more bars less rules of her long list of things that first not doing right happy to go out to Melbourne and probably into London or Tokyo or one of those other seas whether it's very high cost of living but high levels of vibrancy and amenity but there is a view that when they're ready to raise their families they're going to come back to a lifestyle city like herb and post gotta change in that time that they're away and I don't know how they're going to respond to that so cost of living I think is a classic example you know it's going to be very expensive for them to come back if they don't keep a foothold in the property market so they're a bit schizophrenic about what they want about permanent quite it's quite interesting and you know we've looked at some of the issues in Northbridge my board is predominantly western suburbs baseness that's not our kids drinking in those knocks it's kids from a litter absolutely so you know there's some social issues as well as sort of release valve of you know we're going out to get drunk and we're taking drugs because drugs are cheaper than alcohol and you know there's all sorts of things that play in person some of that's about a growing city and getting getting bigger than a country town so they are very good to break about the things they tell us closer to one group suggested to us a no-rules day in perth wish Michael would really hard
Thank you very much for marrying for a thought-provoking conversation around some of the challenges we face as a whole sea and then bring it back to where we are at the moment you open up to questions I'm short Mary it'll take a few questions if there's something from the from the floor anyone has some questions for Mary please but do you think if we went from single story I don't understand what we're scared about in terms of height because in appropriate locations it really shouldn't be something to fear and I remember when Elena McKinnon was the Planning Minister and I headed up Peabody looked after land developers and I was looking at my office we know we're home the stretching route about density and I was looking at sounds perfect and I said minister what's the problem when we get it right we do it well and I think that there's in this locality brown line towers is the wine example I that's continually held off as being something that we did wrong but you wrong and very few examples of doing something right we have to look to other areas to say well where can we do it around transit lines around shopping centers where it makes sense oh you're not engaging on that sense of people's private property rights and to story seems to be one of those issues if you've got a single-story house next to you as a neighbor they feel that all of a sudden their privacy has been eroded so it's probably about doing it in much more appropriate location so that we can keep the relatively suburban nature of birth it seems to be what fit a lot early birds is very like but if people want to live with higher density they should also be allowed to do that too and you know I'm originally Sydney although I've lived here for a long time and you know my first thought was a four-story walk-up and we had to lug all that furniture out for stories I was no left so there's a lot more sort of entry-level product in other poo but then also coming back to the expectation first homeowners what I beg tal is going into those newer developments and not only are they moving into the brand new home they're also moving in with all the brain kit so they're staying at home long and to save more to get into bigger dude and you know most people in this room who are old like me would remember that you had newspaper up your windows and you didn't have half so that it's this change of expectation as well so there's quite a few issues apply there but we could use land better and certainly land around transport routes would be the most appropriate for density yeah don't forget reviewable again will be anything like charger most driven charger and 33 million people you will save area that purpose and I notice or so story the very units are official residences from they all seem to be after the rat race listen to me that's an interesting example we often bring international experts over to reflect on other cities and very much list of central business district in the big towers and then it sort of bleeds out quite quickly into a very sort of suburban City which surprised me because all you receive Tokyo is the high-rise we managed to do reasonably well for the question very upfront fees yet wondering whether with the influx of design any heat and with us having such a water problem now what that's more like Sarah that vine yeah our water security is basically control by kaplan through water corporation and I think that there's a sense that we can engineer our way out of it so they've just been more detail plants but that means what is going to be great expense on okay that's your I guess is one of the really simple things about perf and population and water is that about sixty percent of the water that we use as homeowners is actually on the garden so one of the very simple things is about smaller blocks and unless Gardens which is a real cultural change from you know having a backyard and having just a simplistic way to answer the question if I buy but that is part of the challenge that as we move forward I often involved in water urban planning in the interface between urban development and planning for about 20 years and I personally feel that if we continue down the path of lots of Lord desalination plants we're killing ourselves in terms of a city because we're not living within our means so part of the conversation has to be how do we how to address that issue as we move forward and it's not a simple one but the simplest one that often gets pitched is that if we live on smaller blocks of land will use less water but I think that's a bit simplistic in many ways we also these trees will stop yeah oh sorry for stealing I hope you come down to us what gets referred to as the urban heat island effect and there's increasing evidence that in certainly work in Melbourne and other places that as places have got hotter and when you get more extreme heart attacks and those sort of things so you get all of those things so if you do have to find a way to actually if you like real college eyes your city as well as managing your your your your resource flows your water flows and that's me so please other questions and tomorrow I just like to respond to that lady then we did an exercise and sip what is it that we value about birth because I've got a sense that the conversation about the future of Perth gets anxious because it's not inscribed in stone what it is that we really value about the folks we have now and the things that came up were lifestyle but particularly the natural environment so you go to other cities that have pretty lackluster water environments like northern brisbane and they've just managed to really make something out of nothing and what we've got is is fantastic resource and a beautiful natural setting and I'm not sure that we Revere it enough and I'm not sure the government funds its care enough carrion systems I think is a classic example of that so forgive me for the figures because they're not exactly right but this one river trust you know community values survive 1000 people and very strongly this water became up to a central something people highly valued this longer but it is there are fish in it and it's filthy and it needs cleaning completely one but it gets such a little funny I know because if they're completely written with the Thames which they did and cleaned it up put fish back in and did it so we can do it and part of our group from comp conversations and consultations have been about the health of Perez and ecological environment and the Aboriginal men are very strongly come out and said that they want to see the health of the river as one of the key things about birth to inform other questions please there must be others please it could be a range of things so people could I need to vidual lobster the investment value and there's no impetus on them bill something teahouse true but just even even within the city of canning and one of the big challenges the city has in moving forward in terms of the mixed-use development he says about 20 hectares or give or take of redevelop herbal land either or vacant or redevelop on land right next to the cannon and train station so that's one you know one place where in theory it should be easy to get some level of density that's appropriate right next to good public transport so there is a lot of land dotted around the place like you say what's the identity well what's the impediment is is the question that we're actually starting to ask to some of some extent it's a stigma and investment hasn't come running into that area and and other things are about exactly the various planning policies that are in place or a little out of date so we're working through that process is part of that ah no I mean the city owns a very small proportion of land but there's landing government a range of ownership there I mean I mean the point the point is that there within the broader metropolitan area there is poppets aware that it could be increased in development so other questions about the sort of the challenges we face is as the city moves board and the and the demography changes what we're doing counting too we actually make ourselves an island without taking in consideration attacking around this but you look at long nicholson road but all the boarding kennels you've got little goat farms got the egg factories the more those areas build up the more pressure is going to be put on those industries to be pushed further away rehousing so where does that end up for people in panic who need those services is there any way that cottage industry can be looked at and respected as a valid long-term supply to local people I can't answer from a canning perspective but I reflect on what happened in more rural in the market gardens and bigger reason and things the land prices actually got so valuable for those cottage for a commercial gain so what or who doesn't look anything like a deuce to look years ago so I can't reflect on what that's going to mean to your community certainly that's what happened I guess the slight contrast to what's happened in what a roux is what happened about twenty one years ago 15 years ago in this one valley there was a big pressure for this one valley to be basically turned into housing from its you know traditional role was being a video in a horticultural area and what was actually put in place was a the Swan building Planning Act which basically protected that type of land use so that over those sorts of industries could stay and you know some of the owners there were dead against that but what's happened over that period of time as it's become a big asset for that type of use either the future and the question for the sorts of areas you're talking about do you protect those areas and zone them and protect them for those sorts of peri-urban industries if you like the things that we need around us whether it's a market garden or a plant nursery or a chuck farm or whatever it is they're all things that we need and the issue of food security for cities is a topical conversation that needs to be solved will need to be thought about in the context of a growing city as well and Richard well and we'll probably talk a little bit more about that at our next session any other questions please trash regional hubs or they were happy to be here the state government is developing a 20-year transport strategy I understand it's with cabinet at the moment it's going to require incredible amounts of investment that's what I sort of said in my commentary that there's really not a sense of urgency so the fact that the trains are full even if they ordered new carriages tomorrow is not going to have any effect of delivery for two years so there's this is what I mean about this sort of pressures of growth people see any end in sight that's day in day out they're really going to start to vote with their feet put some political pressure on so even if they've got a plan that's 20 years for the future it's not going to help her here and now so I talk to a lot of lieutenant about this who obviously was the one responsible for delivering the southern suburbs grammar line and she said all of the projections for when they were going to reach no good level of uptake was five years and they reach that the first six months so there's a sense that the bureaucracy tends to under do the numbers so worries me that the 20-year transport plan is going to be quite unambitious about what do we need now to suit our needs now as well as into the future and also my trail needs to come into that mix and how yeah we've got this very radio systems things radiate out from the city into the summers but main roads and we've got the right direction in going into the city or out of the city so we've got to have this through sense of having orbital system as well and I think if you try and get around the universities particularly Curtin University in the morning much more public transports noted there and light rails probably one of those pieces that needs to go into that puzzle but it's going to be expensive and I think politically all the quite uncomfortable because we're talking about yet
There's a strategist and demographer call by Brian her axis and he's written a book called 2050 big australia all the things that he observes is whether the top 10 container ports in the world eight of them are now located in Asia something I'll just couldn't quite believe he says that by 2025 it will be relatively easy to travel by road and rail from Earth from Europe into Asia and this could result in some strategic lot international long distance corridors emerging across the Asian continent which would be incredibly advantageous to Australia a particular to Perth Perth therefore has the potential to rewrite Australia's growth story as the world's most isolated capital city becomes the resource capital of australia and the focal point of china centric growth I think there's much downside of an economic sense to first growth putting this into context life who are planning for I think we need to be realistic and acknowledge an impending shift of our immigration patterns away from our traditional primarily UK based immigration towards Asian Indian and molest and migration there the obvious impact such as strong economic geographical and transportation ties but also for the need for Australia to have young it's in order to counteract the burdens of an aging population it's likely that we'll need to look to countries such as India and the Middle East but both high and semi-skilled workers because according to ABS predictions these are the only two regions that will actually retain the relatively youthful population and most of the others will age as we are aging as well another issue that's of importance to Perth and one that's particularly important to me is the growing divergence in our population what I mean by this is that there is a growing gap between the haves and have-nots across poo and it's not just in an economic sense it's also about in a geographic sense communicant birth is an organization that seeks to speak from the informed perspective when we have a research collaboration with the University of Western Australia and what we've identified is that the poor are shifting geography of economic stress in Perth to the fringes into areas where they can access housing that they see as affordable in an upfront sense but it's certainly not on an ongoing basis as suburbs forever our communities can become isolated from employment and essential social services and increasing transportation costs to remain connected getting is fortunate that you do have pockets of housing that's still affordable and you're well located to the CBD and other centres of employment and as I said you also have a growing in space in a pub need in both areas of economic stress used to include in our middle ring suburbs such as valkira wayne and mira brooklyn today our emerging areas of economic stress are those in the outer see limits to rocks alchemist Butler and Clarkson we all know that all of those suburbs are north of the river not only is there an increasing gap between the growing growing between the wages of high and low income groups there's also an impressing physical graphs between whether two groups live I think this is particular of particular urgency not only for the social the low wage sectors are essential to the future of any city and community by other people we rely on our key workers such as teachers nurses and police who ideally should live and work in the same community along with our hospitality workers retail workers cleaners and labourers however many of these workers will be forced out to the fringes without policy intervention such as providing more diverse and affordable housing options we're also experiencing a growing divergence in communities expectations and attitudes and what I mean by this is there seems to be two two camps so there's these people who are pushing for the more of bein environments and they're typically more globally connected they focused on living in the inner city brand conscious culturally aware and their technology connectivity is incredible and they are increasingly having a say in setting the policy agenda and watching more traditional suburban groups-- seem to be focused on the way things up so there's a real dichotomy infused between those two groups I'm sure that you have this experience here and what you've got living alone in more couples living with our children and increase into households with people over 50 million in these ways the community is becoming more diversion and it's popular as possible that as our population grows we'll see increasing gaps and community expectations as well so probably until now we've had a relatively uniform view about wanting good quality open space good retail environment Brian's education systems etc but there may be some pressure points around I would imagine particularly environment and I think it even population growth itself listen to some of the talkback radio commentary after an issue of population of Athens discussed dude I've trained lomas the most recent one that I heard people just say bye-bye offensive purposeful so in an economic sense with 92 need workers and in an infrastructure sense we've got this feeling that were four so we've really got any of yous there so in putting all of these changes and challenges together the Pope of the future looks quite different in my view it's going to be bigger with 3.5 million people of 45 it's going to be a place where there's going to be more people living alone or you know together as comfortable rather than any of the traditional family unit that we have come to expect it's going to be much more to cultural and there's going to be a reduced dominance of rise in Asian and Middle Eastern migrants it's going to be a proof that should rise to the challenges of economic and cultural divergence so that we avoid ghettos and cultural explosion it's a capital city of increased corporate power that's something that our researchers has shown that you're a number of very significant will let friends are locating significant branch offices here in the UV HP tower that's going up in the city is you know one of the world's largest mining company is putting its footprint very strongly in rcvd it's also a perfect going to have plenty of work opportunities for young people and that's a good story if you're living in the western suburbs of city it would be living and housing they're probably not going to be able to achieve the same levels of homeownership that we've been able to achieve and certainly not as early as we were able to and all of those changes are going to be in your own community if you're not experiencing them than out is certainly on their way so it's clear that we need to plan for a city with more diverse needs culturally as well as spatially so I wanted to think about how the city of cannon could rise to some of these challenges and in thinking about increasing multicultural nature I think you've actually got the opportunity to be an exemplar you could promote and understand tolerance in a way that no other local government is in metropolitan Perth and one of the first steps would be by on a more frequent and more comprehensive way acknowledging celebrating and respecting Aboriginal or and their culture and then bring in other minority groups there's also a need in part of that pressing cultural diversity to understand their new migrants and their needs we've planned for on a traditional sense it might men different types of housing health services and retail opportunities however I think that in order to have a multicultural city to thrive all people regardless of shape printable color need to feel welcome understood and included so then trading or thoughts to how your suburbs and new developments can provide housing for growing and changing population I've got a couple of recommendations there I think developing with state government innovative strategies for affordable housing provision to make sure that lower-income households retain access to employment services will go some way to reaching for have and have-nots and that's a very important role that you could fly making sure that people who are essential to your community have the ability to work here is also another critical thing create nodes of activity which accommodate mixed-use in a in a real sense so you've got higher density live work and play environments and they're all clustered together in a very tight compact way so that you can keep the very predominant nature of having a nice suburban is work with the building industry to develop new and innovative housing topologies with an aging population and growth and couple of single-person households and three by ones and for by tools that dominate all the housing stock across Perth just will not meet changing needs factors such as increasing cost of housing in adequate provision of aged care and aged housing facilities as well as a desire to remain within proximity to employment and services mensa parent stock deployment majority need the future have seen more families living together heaven forbid we could go back to the 1950s and this could be so that people can afford to live and stay together rather than try to have a less sort of family living dispersed across Perth and it could also be because younger family members are going to need to take care of their elderly because there just won't be enough to aged care facilities for them to affirm them out and this will lead to more housing that might look like the traditional high but it might actually accommodate forms of houses they might have student accommodation might have a younger fledgling couple living in it from the street it might present like a normal home but actually inside there might be three different very separate units to it and I saw a lot of that America when I was in the property industry couple of years ago something we all like see which is a sort of champa tongue-in-cheek comment that we might see more asian-inspired housing design will have much more emphasis on puncturing that we will have on theater and I'm cinema rooms your activity night such as carousel should be truly mixed juice environments which I talked about live work and play all together and your particular fortunate that almost a quarter of your workforce live and work locally because you have an economic base of seven and a half thousand local businesses which employ a range of workers in semi skilled and skilled roles and something really to appreciate critically though governments must invest in appropriate infrastructure such as education technology and transportation that keeps pace with population growth and at the state and federal level I don't feel any a local community has to be very strong I think if we don't have some immediate action very short period of time we're going to have growing pains that are going to become an election issue and in thinking about the long-term interests of both as a whole there needs to be real coordination across metropolitan based local governments together with the state to create a high quality vision associated with a brand to assist us to position ourselves in a highly competitive global marketplace and citizens need to be brought on that journey a shared view of our future can coordinate investment strategies and action across government the private and not-for-profit sectors to ensure that we're all working towards the same economic social and environmental and cultural goals that's something that's definitely not happening at the moment purpose confronting some very big issues as a growing city potentially to 3.5 million people by mid-century we will face challenges of which will influence our identity having work how to do business and even the way we live this can be seen as opportunities to deceased the other they will require action because in action is the greatest threat of all I believe that purpose at its most critical time in its development it can either be a city that leads or a city that follows a city of skeptics or a city of Optimus a conservative city or adult guard and the city of canning and it's 28 sister local councils are very important part of that decision-making and planning so my final question to you is will we give ourselves the chance to live up to our potential or we'll win to tether ourselves to the past which we takin is fork in the road junction is all about the choices we make as leaders in government and community and business and it will be the future generations that will judge our successes and failures so my advice is that thrives to the challenges and seize the opportunities before us
Good evening everyone I'd like to also acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet and acknowledge the men fellow councillors executives and my color residents of the city of cannon thank you for inviting me to be the second speaker I understand that Jim was a pretty interface and as in there said really provided a sense of buoyance I think I'm going to be much more sobering this evening but your third speaker Richard whether he'll speak to you next month is a man who's been looking at how her fits into its urban setting and its native landscape and he has a series of very evocative images that he'll show you so that you can really respond to how you think the folk of the teachers physically going to look tonight I'm going to concentrate on some of the challenges that are facing further the metropolitan area and some of the type of the challenges that I see particularly in the city so I ran a think tank focused on her future and what I'm talking about by the business community some of the biggest brands that are operating in Perth but also operate in the global stage so companies like 300 bhp website etc and they pay me to advance the discussion about the Perth of the future thinking about how it fits locally within the national framework and also within the international context it's a very challenging role I have to say and I only have a million dollars a year in which to do my work so we rely very heavily on having consultations and collaborations with our organizations like local government state government and big bodies so my observation expert is that purpose are having a growth spurt of Stella proportions it's like when your toddler starts to grow and no facts that fitted one week don't fit the next that's how it feels a little bit in perfect at the moment the sort of sense of having growing pains traffic congestion trains that are for car parks that are for queuing up to buy your groceries it just really feels like we've reached that point where we we currently have and as the men mentioned both is predicted to grow to 3.5 million people by mid-century I think that's going to be incredibly challenging for us all I'm kind of an imagine a city at 3.5 million and what will happen is that this extensive growth will change our physical and cultural environments and that's where I'm going to plan some of my sort of commentary tonight I hope that I will in talking about growth and the challenges I hope to sort of inspire some of your thinking when you get set about doing your community planning and very formal sense after you've heard from the series of speakers because we'll all have very different perspectives but I think that we're all trying to add to your debate or discussion on it on the future of the city of cannon I'm going to concentrate on four issues there's so many are good concentrate on so I'm going to call some population growth itself and the changes that will bring to your cultural and demographic structure population work force and the globalization and rise of Asia in the world economy so I plan to spark the debate about the Perth of the future who we're planning for and therefore how we need to plan the first and overriding issue in all of this is about growth growth of experience in the perth metropolitan area as well as like living in the city of canada so just to think about where we're out of the most current ABS projections suggest the perpetual politan region currently sits at about 1.65 million people and cutting makes up 90,000 people of that about 5.5 percent the population is expected to grow 2.42 22.9 between 2 20 31 and into 3.5 million by 2050 if the city of canning was to absorb population all that's in a five point five percent average what that means is that by mid-century you'll have 200,000 people living in the city of cannon double your current science the second issue is to consider is who will we be planning fork and so what we really need to do is look up and to the latest census data has a median age of just 36 you know pretty young city and kanuk tracks perfectly against that what you thought though is a very noticeable difference in your community that you have a higher proportion of the 18 to 24 year olds and I think that'll hold you in particularly good stead in terms of where we come from two nine percent of residents identify with English ancestry and twenty five point five percent of us consider ourselves of Australian ancestry so we've got a real dominance of white European heritage and Perth has the highest proportion of English born residents out of any other city in australia our hope is actually quite diverse the office of multicultural interests tell me that there's some 200 different nationalities represented in Perth's population and our diversity is increasing which is something that's also very much reflected in your own local community I think this provides us with an opportunity to be more welcoming and tolerant of newcomers after all we've been adding to the population in indigenous sense for tens the last five hundred and eighty-five years and what this means is that you'll be able to tap to tap into new cultures and talents and enrich our own this is an opportunity where yet to realize that I think it's because it's something where I've been afraid of which it probably is due to a sort of traditional desire to take people who are like ourselves people have got a colonial past like us and some of us probably left over from the federal government policy of White Australia Policy and assimilation policies that were probably not yet shaken off and this is been reinforced by migration patterns which overtly or not they have meant that we had had migrants predominantly coming from the United Kingdom Ireland and Europe and as I said they've been a very good cultural fit with the Australia that they found salty first development culture and lifestyle offering has matched up world with their needs and aspirations there hasn't_''_401.31 been too much of a run but if you think about it it hasn't really been that simple Greeks and Italians came as skilled workers in the 1950s this was very big and controversial in its time although it seems to us now something that's quite benign with hindsight I think we could all say that those skilled workers added a lot to the nation building that we needed at the time we didn't have a workforce in our own right that could have built bridges and roads and damned etc as a demographer and social commentator birds sold recently observed that without lightning Mediterranean migration we would still be a nation of tea drinkers and interestingly in the 1970s we moved from tea drinkers and became coffee drinkers something wasn't something that I knew myself I suppose it's a sort of reflection of choking off some of that Britishness all of us and my observation is I could live in that Italian food and I think spaghetti bolognaise has just become one of the Australian staple mills and probably think it's our own however the next major change in who we plan for will be filled by a migration shift if current assault will result in what they are now calling the Asian ization of Australia as a community the city of canning is already dealing with some of these challenges with the neighborhood noticeable decrease in british-born and migrants with English as their first language and you're experiencing an increase in Asian and Middle Eastern countries his first languages in Cantonese Malay and almonds the changes also bought about achieved in religious prevailing so that you have had a very predominance of Christian community and now you having one that's tending to have increasing Islamic faith as a community Island you can reflect on how you feel about these changes as we respond to them however it's the role of local and state governments to think about how these changes will affect the way we plan for the future traditionally there has not been a lot of thought by planners about planning for a future population in terms of its cultural and demographic trends so this is something that's fairly new because what's typically happened is there's been a lot of straight line analysis so number of households we're going to need based on us with standard household size and format and then we've just signed your not plan to accommodate those people we're probably at a pressure point now where we just can't keep doing that and you know what this is resulted in is very low density single housing type suburbs it that that's purpose central business district and for suburban corridors this has probably served as quite well up until now but I think the one-size-fits-all approach will not serve as well into the future for example the city of kenning has a growing number of single-person households and couples without children but the majority of your housing like the rest of the earth is just single detached dwellings obviously a double if you're sitting doubling of the city's resident population over the next 30 or 40 years will mean that there will need to be more medium and high density housing in order to fit everyone it's just simply not going to be possible to prepare the sprawl out words because otherwise you and I don't think you'd want to do that so we're going to have to think about the types of housing that is going to be requiring in this sort of medium and high density living but also how the changing cultural form may also need a requirement to a duct housing as well so it's not also the housing but also the neighborhoods in which we want to live in in the communities in which we want to thrive in as well so we need to talk about the need for more compact walk for a diverse neighborhoods in order to make a place more sustainable but as Perth Bros will it be possible that all these characteristics can go into the mix so that we can still have it further that's highly livable but one of the things that comes with our sort of desire to be highly liver boys that we have one of the biggest footprints of any city in the world because we're incredibly greedy about how we consume resources and that's obviously not sustainable either so there of them is about praying creating and maintaining a viable workforce for Perth metropolitan area in your own community Perth is already emerging as the resource capital of Australia we have a high-performing economy which is very enviable most of us know that in order for a city to retain its economic performance let alone Hama data and economic growth that we might experience when in a workforce that contains highly professionals skilled individuals as well as workers for our service and health sectors yeah our population is aging and I think the teaching profession is one is messed up very recently to say that most of the teachings of over 50 years of age and many of them are going to be retiring in the next 10 years so the only way that we're going to be able to meet workforce demand is through immigration that's a policy set at the national level the chamber of commerce and industry in Western Australia claims that we need four hundred thousand extra workers most of these fees which cannot be homegrown and research undertaken by ISIL testament says that seems to me to be inevitable when you consider current vibrational trends as well as factors of globalization and the rising prominence of Asia by this I'm referring to increased integration and competition within international economies and the rising strength of asia and the asian economies which were close to both in an end and geographic sense for example in 2009 China replaced Japan as Australia's most important export market with exports valued at 38 unit as compared to 42 billion to China just two decades earlier Australian exports to Japan will only add 13 billion and more than double of that of our next important most important partner at that stage which was the United Kingdom at just six Benny and the importance of this relationship is likely to increase and at this point probably cause to some of the work that we've done around visioning the Perth for the future is that we spent too long in Western Australia particularly gazing east to make obsessed with what's happening in Sydney and Melbourne and feeling like the poor cousin and it's probably this century about our place in the Australian economy but particularly about our closeness to Asia which is enviable for those cities and I think they're just starting to wake up to that
Good evening ladies and gentlemen my name is Michael rich I'm one of the executives here at the city of cannon and my role tonight is just a very quick introduction that introduced the mayor just going to introduce how our speaker but I just want to try a little bit of context about why we're here this evening this is what about talks from our speaker series which is part of the kickoff process to our community plan the community plan is a process that we're going to embark on in full in about august of this year when we start a very comprehensive engagement process with the community so and what that Community Plan process will be about will be encouraging input into this the future of the city of caring how it develops and grows and one of the challenges and what are the opportunities in their context so the role of the speaker series is to really just start getting people to start thinking about what are the challenges that we face good in the city and what are the opportunities and how really a process to get some ideas flowing those of you who were here last one room saying Jim daya talk about the engagement process so that's really the start of our journey down this way so I don't want to take any more of the time so I'm going to hand you over to our mere hasn't a lil Adonis think you might have good evening everyone first of all I like to annoy my fellow councillors and I started my deputy millions of bridge Mason Kyoto our Granberry cancelling Michelle we turn council still boyland ox is the other can see what if stinking it's a very and also I won't die lon GI chief executive officer Mike nectar executive see a future doctor Michael Morris would share was the embassy of the opening day executive generic masseuses john sullivan executive private the service and roll I the adventure owners of the land in which shall we meet the wood jack people is the be honest here Kenny on behalf of my fellow councillors it is my pleasure to be here tonight that's the committee that we sort of get into giving us the particular forums or you the residents also this is for per chief executive Marion of Walker good evening our first speaker Jim Dorsett from Seattle's give an insight into the positive power of engaging people in the decision-making process that affected their around every device and for those they were here when Jim Halsey was really a bit of a recharge and Bettis for people to really show up at the epitome of what a great idea you know just give us some food for thoughts the evening yet was well received by those who attended and I'm sure he does the bigger discussion on how our resident can become involved in planning for the future of our city tonight speaker mary fuka is closer to home and the committee year properties are living business are funded think tank committed to making perth metropolitan region a more livable vibrant in sustainable players that can participate on the global stage tonight we will hear of the challenges we all face by birth of our c 2 of this challenges will be a parallel to the challenge we are currently facing in the city of kenning as we seek a clear direction for our future there are communities a major part of this process and this speaker series is just the beginning over the next three months we will introduce speakers on environmental event planning the indigenous aspect of place and the thoughts and aspiration of our use following the series we will give our community the opportunity to be a part of the decision-making process through a wide range of new initiatives these are exciting times in where you to take part

I just wanted to say that I really acknowledge your good idea about holistic approach I don't really need to be going and societies of them yeah also that community-based food projects what because people do have a sense of ownership of their community and I really applaud the council for getting along here tonight to talk to and I think my question is of the case or are we going to follow through and I hasten to add this did not happen overnight ncl I'm talking about 22 years of history to put this together so I think they're starting on it I mean I think it's off to a fantastic start they brought in a great team of people to help believe the community planning effort there's clearly commitment and you don't need for death million dollars for matching fund I think ours is to arjuns out there we felt the cities of Sydney Port Phillip with Don all start matching fund programs and most do it for 25,000 or 50,000 because it's really about giving people an incentive to think the biggest part is reducing that red tape oh that's a big one yeah yeah yeah obviously I wouldn't take any notice of dotted line he said the planet Jubal's the other videos you have the thing that you're going to drive it and do we had one that we got to decide how much half are we going to go know some of these people probably remember I'm not politic in there when when I been elected the second time this was going to do to present this of it moves to the public the other the reason I started off I also said it's a two-way street so it's also about community changing because most cities I didn't hear hear but most cities I got you are talking about a power in the community the 11 officials look if you like I'm crazy and why are the one in power those at business and they're thinking about the same 10 or 15 people in every city the world who have really big mouth and no constituencies they asked not we're partnering with those individuals it's only we're partnering with the community if its broad and inclusive engagement so it's it's also about the community stepping up in really making it worth the city's wild a partner and it's about the community taking some responsibility and not just not just expecting counselor oh I need with you but yeah you know we have to have this no I know I know I do it yeah yeah you a question chilly down the back I'm hearing Oh wonderful statement please others over the side again Yeah right and I didn't have time to tell the whole story tonight but in fact our our planet continue to evolve after the story I told here because neighborhood groups said this is fantastic the empowers do plans but if we're going to make these plans really effective we also need the city to be more engaged they said we're almost two independent so we went to really a more collaborative kind of planning which is I think what you're thinking about government has a lot to contribute to the plane they've got the data they know the policies they know the budget they've got a lot of expertise and the communities got a lot of expertise they know the community better than anybody else so there's real value in both parties coming together yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no I often say the reason there's so few activists is because government's warn everybody else down you know and that's true everywhere in the world and so so so democracy doesn't work if it's a few self-appointed people it only works if it's broad and inclusive in both government community need to change if we're gonna make democracy work yeah just let move down here and we might wrap it up after that yeah yep yep yep yep yep yeah that's right and more than that there's so many many groups that aren't represented here so part of its recognizing that every but just by everybody is already organized they just aren't all organized in your group so and there are neighborhood watches and youth groups and senior groups and informal groups and it's about how do you tap all those different groups and particularly look for the networks of people who are currently underrepresented in in activities and then we form what we call district councils to start bringing those groups together we have coordinators who helped bring those interests together so they can speak with more one boys get to know each other create real power develop consensus at the local bubble share resources finally get business and residents together never been in the room just biting each other get them all the same room and then it's a lot of tricks there are a lot of you know keys to community engagement which are it's not just about meetings if we're going to get more people engaged we need to have one fun we need to start where people are start with their network start with their language and culture start as close to their homes as possible start with their passions rather than always pushing our agendas listen to people and we need to take off those labels and focus on the gifts that everybody has together listen I think we might wrap it up and if there's still some hot water in the urn welcome to have another cup of tea I would thank you everyone for coming out tonight it's been a wonderful evening I'm gonna cook them here might want to say good good night well I just I just want a on your on your behalf I like to think Jim Rapporteur on human this presentation tonight and I hope it at this to everybody else has mind but from what I can get from him and I had a good chat today and the simply seem to be on the same way of the only thing and also we are doing this or we got to do this because for the future we are kids okay so I jesting about that because there's a little curry on the table yet tonight it looks like we rather where there which we are theories own place peace we will have we have we presentation in the future please come again tell your friends have bring some more if this is not big enough we were going to find that a bigger place the town hall or elsewhere okay so please drive safely to go home because we would like to see you again
Well neighborhood group so this is fantastic even power just do all these projects but if you really want to give us power and give us the power to plan because sometimes it would just do a single project has unintended consequences in free amount we made it such a great neighborhood now we've revitalized it so much that the artists could no longer afford to live there so we want to kick a longer term look at our community we want to take a more comprehensive approach and the best way to do that is through creating our own plan for the neighborhood well I think I think part of the reason the mayor appointed me was we both hated neighborhood planning he hated it because he really did trust the neighborhoods he thought they would just be a bunch of NIMBYs and would do the wrong thing and I haven't liked everyone fighting because I never seen anything happen I will plan plans where you use used owned by the planter and sat Michelle nothing happened so I had organizers instead of plans I so I what we did the only resource we have is the matching fund so we made planning an eligible use the neighborhood matching fund and what it did was resulted in a totally different kind of planet where it was initiated by the community rather than by the government that was makes a big difference in this community's ideas are going to make it work if it comes from outside you're often suspicious about what is the agenda the community can to find their own scope of work when our city of plans it was done I one of those siloed departments it was usually just a Land Use Plan and there's nothing more controversial than a land use plan particularly if it's an isolation from everything else in the neighborhood when the community plan to fight for what was important to them it might be public safety or economic development or transportation or education or parks and open space usually was all of those things because communities think much more comprehensively than the bureaucracy it's in neighborhoods that everything comes together third the community could who's not all you had good technical expertise but somebody who's really good involving people and understood the value of involvement people and who has accountable to the community and then the community had put together a match so the match was usually hundreds and hundreds of volunteers people who work together to create a common fish for their community who hired the planner who conducted surveys who put together recommendations to help achieve that vision so when the plan was done it wasn't just the planners plan it was the community's plan people broadly understood it owned that plan so first plan was done in my neighborhood and Columbus said it when that pile was done there were 250 people in the council chambers he-man and that pie to be adopted because they put all their blood sweat and tears into that plan but more importantly they helped a city accountable for implementation then accountability session with the mirror every year hundreds of people would show up and say we want to know what you did to implement our plan over the past year and next year very friendly sessions because there were so many people involved and the mayor really had the sense to the whole community was speaking it wasn't just one faction so here's what resulted from that plan this is low income multicultural community that had not had a strong voice in City Hall for the first time we've got some of its streets paid got new sidewalks security lighting expedited permitting for economic development this is the neighborhood of the city that had the most method highest percentage of young people but no community center that was one of their top priorities so because it involves so many people in the planning process they were able to lobby the city for the largest community center in the city it's in the background but the reason I'm showing this picture is because this wasn't just about creating a to-do list for the city it was also about saying here's what we're going to do as a community it was a real partnership so our neighborhood didn't have any ball fields for the wife organized the softball league but no no fields supply Emma so out of the out of the planning process my wife took the lead with volunteer volunteers and the young people in building three ball fields right there in front of the community center but the top recommendation of the plan was we want to revitalize our business district our obesity business district this is an historic district was declared historic district in the 19th 1970s to preserve the two and three-story brick facades and that's about the time I moved into the neighborhood soon after I moved into the neighborhood it started to go downhill I like to think it wasn't just me that it was you know big box retail with the mall but we started losing our businesses we lost both our clothing stores we lost our pharmacy we lost our furniture store we lost our hardware store as more and more businesses moved out and the storefronts became boarded up we got more and more crime moving into the neighborhood prostitution drug dealing and the other businesses started to move out we finally 19 by 1995 we had very few businesses left in the district there was actually more business going on outside the store fronts than inside so out of the neighborhood plan the community said this is project we're going to work on we're going to work to revitalize our business district and what they did was organize a town hall meeting and had it in the larger space that could find the Filipino restaurant on rainier avenue and they use the oldest trick in the world and said will give you free pancakes if you come to our meeting but you got to spend all morning with this and come with your idea for a project will make columbia city a better neighborhood so everybody who had an idea I've got to get up and say here's my idea when brought it up and butcher paper for out of the room and then we told people vote with your feet go or your passion is so everybody likes his first idea go to the baptist church right now start working on it you got the rest Columbia City Libraries start working on you got the rest of the morning everybody likes this I did go to thai restaurant but with your feet you know like what's going on that group go to another group do you don't like what's going on there go home should be fun so so many projects happen that we came back the next year to celebrate those projects and to kick off another round we've now been doing this for 15 years so I want to show you what resulted this is a Derek albino Gary coming into the business district is the gate waiting the business history it was covered with graffiti people said that makes a terrible statement about our community so an artist that that first time he said I'll create a mural if everybody will help me paint it so we had dozens of people on the scaffolding painting what we love about our neighborhood is multicultural heritage included Jimi Hendrix that's him front and center he's from my neighborhood and somebody said you know we're never going to make it looked at it looks terrible this guy said I went through the Port of Seattle I'll get them to donate a shipping container we paint a mural on the outside fill it up all kinds of cleaning equipment and on the weekends volunteers have come out and get the hedge trimmer get the paint the paint brushes they get the bruise the dust and all that and they cleaned up the business district every weekend there was a Christian Science church has been closed for years and boarded up and somebody said let's see that as an opportunity let's renovate that as a multi cultural arts center for our young people and they Retta made that building and opened it up and now for whom performances bring in hundreds of people on the weekends and when they come to shop in the local retail area to go to the local restaurants somebody's had a great idea said you know it's still have a few restaurants left but they're afraid to open up at night let's get people a reason to come ethnic music in each restaurant people go from restaurant to restaurant listen if you see called a beat walk had a hard time talking the business owners into this the van had a good experience at night but they finally agreed in that first beat walk the streets were just like legitimate activity people are so excited the businesses were so busy the badness if you would do this again next month we've now been doing it every month for 15 years and the number of venues just keeps growing talk about how we lost their supermarket so we said let's see that as an opportunity let's create a farmers market on that parking lot and volunteers organized the farmers market we have about 2500 people out Wednesday nights from the farmers market and when they come to shop local retail area to go to the local restaurants your kids in the local elementary schools selling to plan starts at the farmers market what bart has created kiosks showcase all the events we're going on neighborhood with panels that show the historic buildings I wish had the most derelict facade in the whole business district somebody came to coming and said look why don't it picks up the worst beside Mabel get the other business owners to fix their zone so we said that one's winning it must be the business inside somebody said how about a bike shop we don't have a bike shop in the whole Southeast yet somebody else said how about a non-profit bike store so volunteers work and they fix up the facade and then they got people to donate their East bicycles the bicycles that had worked for years we're just sitting in the basements covering dust and cobwebs and then they trained at-risk young people how to fix those bicycles and by time the kids graduate from the bicycle repair force every young person earns his or her own bicycle they've got word the bicycle club and the kids to regular bike rides around the neighborhood the older kids do the Seattle Portland bike ride they fix so many bicycles now then hundreds of kids have earned their own bicycles they donate bicycles to a year in people Africa this is in a neighborhood was seen as a place with nothing but needs well despite all this action there's so many other projects there was one block in this historic district we could not get businesses to come into we kept trying to market it nobody would touch it been boarded up for 15 years finally someone came to autonomy and said look we can't get real businesses let's pretend they say well what kind of business would you like and somebody said I want an ice cream store so we painted it to board it up doors and windows to make it look like there was an ice cream store people say well that's cool but I'd like a bookstore and I want a toy store and I want a gas to do and I want a hat shop so we painted an entire block to make it look like your business people got excited cars were stopping people want to get up shop within a year we had to take down every one of these murals because this is what it was like when year later with an Italian deli with the brew club with the co op art gallery that also came out of a town meeting you go to Columbus City today there's not one empty storefront they're building new mixed-use development to keep up with them in and everything that happened here came out of the neighborhood plan how the community's vision our the community's ideas going on the community's resources there's incredible untapped potential in our communities so here's what I see is the value of community driven planning the implementation happens the plans don't just set on this yellow resources are multiplied the government's resources leverage to the community's resources appropriate development occurs respecting the unique character of the neighborhood and the culture of the community rather than one size fits all certain cutter approaches more holistic and innovative solutions result in a stronger sense of communities built as all the different factions in the community come together to create a common vision just that in conclusion people always ask me how're being successful and I'm a little bit cynical about performance measures I'm from Iowa so I love this quote from an Iowa farm you don't make the hog fatter by weighing it and at the other end of the spectrum I have a quote from Albert Einstein not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted so I was so excited when I said port phillip several years ago and they finally figured out the most important thing to measure they said the only thing that really matters the only thing of new accounts is whether people are happy or not so they trained volunteers how to be smile police and they walk down the streets of court go and they catch your eye and see what percentage of people smile back up and then they have a formula and they and they calculate how many smiles per hour there are in each neighborhood and their post signs to say street settings seven miles miles per hour and it's the only measure I've ever seen this actually changing so the numbers just keep going up throw up to 10 and this guy is really happy because he's got 14 miles per hour so I just wanted I conclude the presentation by saying I just thrilled how many people are here clearly you care deeply about your community you're proud of where you live you want to make it an even better place I think it is so excited that you have a CEO mayor so many council members who are here who aren't been thinking about how do we do work in a different way we're really committed to doing more collaborative planning with the community I think it's fantastic so I hope to see many many many more smiles next time I come ok so thanks so much thanks for all you do to make this a great community
This is Susan on the right-hand side she's chair one of our neighborhood associations the West westwood Neighborhood Association and she wanted to create a more inclusive organization so she worked with our Department of Social and Health Services and she said could you send letters out to all your clients and the letter basically said hi I'm Susan I'm chair of the Neighborhood Association would love to get you involved if you're interested give me a call so she got a call she had enough Raymond and ginger she went over to their house they said we've been living here 20 years we don't know any of our neighbors she looked around the walls of that house and there were all these crafts on the walls and a lot of crafts had clown themes in him and she said what's with this what these crafts in the clowns she said they said well that's how we spend our time we make crafts and ginger said Raymond used to be Rachel the cloud but he hasn't clowned in 20 years Susan saturday could you come down clown force he was overjoyed he and ginger dug through their old boxes and finally found his clown outfit Citizen Kane picked him up saturday morning drove him to the festival and Rinko the clown was a hit of the festival and they started inviting up to other community events the kids birthday parties and in the process he and ginger met other people who did craft work and they started driving them to craft shows so wait for them to make some income to make other friendships and Susan said that Raymond and ginger opened doors for her in that neighborhood like nobody else had been able to in the final story here's where where he has a disability that makes him totally dependent on public transit so Larry knows all the places the bus goes Larry tells all the places the bus should go but doesn't go where he knows all the places where there should be better security lighting at the bus stops where there should be covered bus shelters so in the neighborhood did their neighborhood plan they tapped try to walking toward the business district and he pointed out all the access problems because they weren't just a problem for Larry their problem for elders with their walkers for parents with their strollers larry was so highly value that he was elected vice chair of the Capitol Hill Community Council somebody with the adult mental disabilities have been seeing somebody with nothing but needs is now a leader in his community because they lifted that label our second program we put in place is a program we called the neighborhood matching fund and the idea behind this program was a way to meet the community halfway on projects have been a priority for the community but had not been a priority for City Hall so he said so I so I asked her City Council I said could I have 150 thousand dollars to pilot this program and I said I'd like the money so that we could provoke neighborhoods halfway will provide a cash match from the city in exchange for the communities equal match a volunteer labor or donated goods and services and a have to be at an incorporated group you don't have to be have nonprofits dad it's just any group of neighbors it wants to do a project we're only going to find one time project because we want to build capacity we don't want to create dependence so we aren't going to pay for staff we aren't going to pay for operating costs and all the funding decisions will be made by the neighborhood leaders themselves what you can maybe imagine this is a pretty controversial idea when I presented it because our council member said there's not enough money for everything that is our priority why should we put money into things that are not but finally had a vote of five to four they approved that they approved the program for that first year that first year was supported 22 community self-help projects with that money they were so popular that the next year our council voted unanimously to increased the fund to one and a half million dollars the subsequent increase it to four and a half million dollars on self-help projects every year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the matching fund two years ago there have now been more than 4,000 projects completed across the city of seattle and every neighborhood great with changing the character of the place and increasing the livability of the place the city's 50 million dollar investment over the year to celebrity 70 million dollars in community resources that under the old model were people looking to government to do everything never would have been tapped but the best benefit is its new involved tens of thousands of people in community life because we finally given people way to get involved other than going to meetings and I'm sure thing people are very different here but in Seattle why people don't have time for meetings so here's some of what resulted this is in our Ballard neighborhood ballard was a neighborhood with the least number of street trees of any neighborhood in Seattle and there was there was a woman there named her Villa gallon who care passionately about street trees you want to see trees up in down Tribune the local paper she put them in the church bulletin she put them in the corner grocery store advertising other for other people and she tried to find somebody in every block in ballard and if she couldn't find somebody who shared her passion she would go to that block and knock on every door because we convince somebody that they shared her passion for street trees and that she got that person inside a fudge form saying I'll come to a training about how to plant take care of the trees I'll recruit my neighbors to do the same thing so she turned in all of her pledge forms with her matching fund application and one day trucks full into her neighborhood with 1080 trees they dropped them off at every block in ballard Davila went and knocked on the door the block captain said the trees are here vodka cannot gum David stores that thing over a thousand people came out and planted trees up and down the streets people felt incredibly empowered the game day there's no street trees the end of said this is cool we still have the fewest number of parks of any neighborhood in Seattle so they walked around the neighborhood looking for potential Park sites had a hard time finding them because the neighborhood is pretty built out but finally they found this old run-down house used to be a nursery problem property lots drug dealing going on lots of public safety problems right next to the business district and they convinced our City Council to buy that property in the city had some money open space bond money you buy that property but no money to design or build the park so the neighbors give it themselves local and landscape architect volunteered your services and worked with the other neighbors and together they designed a belt baker park this is the entryway into the park there's beautiful old trees one of them and I and they're trying to figure out how to remove it and then one of the neighbors who was Native American had a better idea and carved it in place as a totem and here's some of the detail there of returning nature to the city well this group went on biltmore park the next year in the build a community garden this is now one of 85 organic community gardens we have in Seattle all built by volunteers in the community and this is their most recent park this is the site of a former house so to commemorate the house they built all the furniture out of cement and at the dedication of this project they unveiled a timeline that shows the 20 parks they built over the past 20 years every one of them with volunteers they've restored a salmon in Jordan they built ball fields they built playgrounds they worked with the kids to build a skate park well then they said you know we made our neighborhood a much better environment but we're concerned what was happening to the planet we're concerned about climate change so they formed an all volunteer group called sustainable Ballard and the big thing they do here is the new tether 6th in a row is do a sustainable Ballard fest and they have music they've and then there's a series of boosting go to to learn what you can do to reduce your carbon footprint and the first booth you go to is the end driver's license station where you go and you check all the ways you will not drive over the next month and when you do you get a laminated on driver's license it's pretty cool just like my official Washington state driver's license and when you get your end driver's license it entitles you to drive the shuttle bus and this is kind of a Fred Flintstone typo go peddle my feet it's going down the streets of our gets everybody's attention gets people thinking what could I do to get out of my car what could I do to reduce my carbon footprint this has created a movement now all the neighborhoods around Ballard organized their own all-volunteer sustainability groups all the suburban communities around Seattle have organized their own all-volunteer sustainability groups we now have 66 of these organizations and collectively the call themselves scallops sustainable communities all over Puget Sound trees there's incredible untapped potential in our communities there's no other way we're going to address climate change we can invent all the green technology what we want but if people don't actually adopt it people don't start thinking themselves as community members we've lost it so important that we partner with community other examples of projects every one of our playgrounds both in our parks and in our schools has been rebuilt by community volunteers you used to be every one of our playgrounds look exactly the same I think our parks department got a really good deal but now they reflect the unique character of the place the needs of the people so this is the first playground to be redeveloped and when they did the design meeting some of the children showed up in wheelchairs so they built the first wheelchair accessible playground in seattle and we see this over and over again that the innovations come out of the community this is in a heartbeat park in north west seattle where neighbors had worked for 20 years to clean up 20 years of work they were finally successful salmon came back they said well this is great we've got Sam and now we want to get kids back into our Park we don't have any playground we want to build a playground so they got matching funds they had their design meeting and at the design be one of the young people raised his hand and said I want a salmon playground and the adults are scratching their heads because nobody there we see the salmon quite round before and a local artist said I've got an idea and he got the 19 foot long Sam that's so big you slide in the mouth and you come out the tail and then you climb into a cave and you climb over boulders it gives kids a sense of the struggle that salmon go through to get back to the city of seattle so here's where to go in it's pretty scary okay and here's where you come out you land in a foam rubber see this is over and over again community members Seattle under interstate 5 and underneath the interstate is good for nothing except holding up the interstate so there are all kinds of public safety problems it Wiggles dumping drug dealing all kinds of bad things going on underneath the interstate the young people went under there and said this could be the perfect place for something we've always wanted but haven't_''_710.16 been able to find the land for a BMX track so now it's just ingenious a gut a BMX track is always covered from the rain will talk about the liability issues later this is in our fitting neighborhood this is a piece of land that was planted as a street there are houses on either side but it was never developed because it's too steep cars could never make it up to the top it's just way too steep so as a result it just became overgrown became a nuisance in the community started attract rodents the only thing to try to get up were four wheel drive vehicles in the middle of the night did race their engines they you know can make it to the top driving neighbors totally crazy I thought the neighbors were crazy because they applied for matching funds and by hand they used picks and shovels went through that heavy hard pan clay soil all these Timbers up the side Paris that whole hillside and turned that problem property into a community garden where there's a picnic area is a top and a children's play area and we see this over and over again taking properties that were in the hands of a department that did the property didn't work for that department and made it work for the community this is in my favorite neighbor this is a site of a former school and the parks department purchased it it was just covered with asphalt and the community brought the community leaders together community members together and said let's plan for a park and as they play that besides that one bua park with the urban agriculture theme so they call it Brandner gardens 50,000 hours of volunteer labor have gone into this over the past 10 years and here's some of the views out over downtown Seattle but what I love about this car is that it's a garden of inclusion very diverse neighborhood forty percent of the gardener's are from Laos using their traditional gardening techniques and sharing with the other neighbors center part which is low income housing for people with disabilities just below the garden so they couldn't raised beds so that they could participate in the garden white house for the blind is next door so there's no sensory intacto gardens so that they could appreciate the gardens there's youth gardens there's gardens for absolutely everybody and for those who don't like the garden there's all kinds of gathering places and public art to bring people in there's a low place in this garden where all the water drains and it creates this wonderful little pond but by the end of the summer the water gets really stagnant and it starts to attract mosquitoes with big problem so one of the neighbors got online and found a windmill for sale and farm in Iowa they have pumps water out of the pond to the other end of the park creates a stream that flows through the park keeps the water circulating so you don't have a problem with the mosquitoes not a solution would it come out of our privacy
This is an old storage shed that was on the property and the foods that we want to convert that to become a community center so they get very green so there's press sunflower seed is the wallboard inside they put it Roger on so nice whether they can open it up and have larger gatherings they have solar panels on the roof and even in seattle where we hardly ever see the Sun we're generating enough power that the meters actually going backwards putting power back on the grid there's a sister behind it captures the water off the roof so that during the summer when it doesn't rain in Seattle we give the pine full keep the windmill operating keep the screen fall and that is that we want to do restrooms because people are gardening all day we need toilets and our parks department said you can't do toilets they'll just get vandalized it's true we have a huge problem with vandalism of our park toilets so so many of them are locked up now and the community said well to make these so nice people going to feel so respected that they're going to treat them with respect so they got people to donate the broken dishes their leftover mosaic tiles and neighbors came together and created these patterns on the toilet walls showing garden plants garden insects those have been there for 10 years now absolutely no vandalism and we see this over and over again that when the community builds projects other community members tend to treat it with more respect and the neighbors watch out for it they don't just wait for the problems and call the city up they deal with it this is the tree hundred fall and the local artist hard to show the life cycle of the salmon everything from the fingerling salmon to the Kingfisher eating the seven at the end of the cycle even the playground has an agricultural theme with the tractor half carved out of wood and there's a wonderfully gazebo where there's all kinds of community gatherings back this couple met at the garden decided get married at the garden and for wedding pile so as part of the wedding ceremony they made wedding compost all kinds of facilities been renovated through the matching fund this is a site of a former school basement of that a school that wasn't being utilized we paid for all the materials and the communities match was for the children and the parents to do all the renovation to create a youth center this is a log cabin it was rotting away in West Seattle the community rehabbed it it is now an historical museum this is some of the public art that's been created by the community this is in our international district where we have some in different cultures we have a Chinatown we have a japan town we have a manila town we have little saigon and they don't often get along with each other have a hard time even knowing what to call the neighborhood as a whole but they came together and each culture had they had their own dragon and so they came together and created a composite dragon and now they've got 17 of these dragons help define their common neighborhood and the last time you want to talk about the matching fund is in our fremont neighborhood this is another bridge underneath the bridge over top of the bridge is the freeway and underneath is good for nothing but holding it up there were lively public safety problems a lot of field bumping drug-dealing any other neighborhood I think they would put fencing up on either side to keep out the problem but Freeman has all kinds of artists so they have different ideas and then when under the bridge is that you know this is kind of cool it's almost like you can theater all it's got this high ceiling these big columns they started calling the hall Giants and they said we want to get some matching funds to put a piece of public art under the bridge to attract legitimate activity they asked for twenty four thousand six hundred dollars and I said well what's the art going to be they said well we don't know yet once we get our money then we're going to put what the people decide this was the second year of the matching fund it was still very controversial program I said man we can't_''_252.689 do that that'll be in the end of the program but all of our funding decisions are made by the neighborhood representatives and they like this idea so they agreed to fund it I thought oh my god that's the end of the matching fund so they got their money they put out a call for artists and artists submitted my with the one down to the bridge somebody submitted the Lord's throne because this is the Hall of giants somebody else submitted larger-than-life construction workers and engineers kind of a tribute to the people who built the bridge somebody else submitted a troll oh my god how would I ever explain to the mayor that we're going to use public funds to build a troll under a bridge when there is enough money to fill the potholes in the city so they put these sculptures on display at the Fremont fair 100,000 people come to the fair everybody who goes sculpture they want under the bridge so I kept going by vote for those construction workers because I figure they're the least objectionable right sure enough guess which one won yeah my worst fear and it got much worse because the art critic from the local paper wrote a scathing review a couple days later she says this shows the people should never be involved in public art decisions because the people have no taste this is kick it's a terrible waste of public funds I thought oh my god that's the end of the matching fund but her columns so incensed the community that they started rallying behind control they started having street dancers to raise money for the troll the kids wrote a troll ramp I went to the neighborhood one day and there were ten foot long foot prints up and down the streets of fremont like the troll have been walking through the neighborhood so they raised the money they best patrol here he is that troll is so big that's a real BW he has come in environmental statement let's was a man that was early on somebody broke out the window in the VW but the neighbors organized it for him to troll patrol they put wedding on the troll they walked around the neighborhood at night making sure the troll neighborhood are safe and again it's what happens when people start to take responsibility for their communities again then I just caught the city and say there's problems with control let's not be so distraught spiritual and they program it Thank You Shakespeare in the troll and Halloween they celebrate halloween and hundreds and hundreds of people come and they howl with the troll to do processions through the streets of bream on and this troll attracts people from absolutely all over the world here's proof and when people calmly shop in the local business district and there's always people to you legitimate activity underneath the bridge so you don't have the public safety problems not a solution would have come out of our Police Department you know we got a big public safety problem under the friend we've got put from the local paper since rotary traction said it's time to eat troll
Thank you very much for mayor it's wonderful to be in Canning I spent the whole day here I might give me a fantastic tour of the whole city and just saw the diversity of the people of the different housing types here I had great sessions today with a lot of top leadership from the city and really understood that their desire to make this an even better City and engage better with the community got to have lunch with the mirror and then then I'd get a crumble walk out here and walked on through the wetlands have been created and along the river now I tell you I was on the great ocean road on two weeks ago I was in rats nest yesterday rat nest and right rottnest yeah I picked it up so but I've never seen such a high concentration of different kinds of birds in one place half-hour walk I just saw incredible bird life so it's a it's wonderful be here so I'm gonna talk a little bit about Seattle how many of you been to in this morning that's good that's good so this is enemies a lot of people have yeah this is our space needle Mount Rainier we're surrounded by mountains surround by water and a lot of people know Seattle oh I'm gonna turn sardius a lot of people know seattle from from the pike place market some of you may know about the tossing of the salmon that they do Seattle is the home of the world's first Starbucks sorry about that home of Bill Gates and Microsoft it's where to build the Boeing airplanes but what most people don't see us now is what I really love which is our strong neighborhoods we have over 100 neighborhoods our heels or valleys or water helped to define distinct places each place tends to have its own business district its own neighborhood associations so there's a real strong sense of place in Seattle people identify with their neighborhood whether it's alki or columbia city or capital bill and our neighborhood since the first neighborhood I lived in the Wallingford neighborhood where they're lights the top of the girl store and a lot of really remove certified by the unique character this is our historic pioneer square neighborhood and this is the quality homes Association that the neighborhood of floating homes with in Sleepless in Seattle that's another neighborhood a lot of our neighborhoods are defined by their housing stock so this is a typical little bungalow in one of our neighborhoods in ballard this particular house was lifted by a woman who was 85 years old she looked in this house for most of her life a developer owned the property either side of her house wanted and wanted to tear down her house so he could put in a large mixing you stood off so I offered to buy her house and she said I'm not some he offered her 1 million dollars her house is worth about 150 thousand dollars just a little house and a little why she said I'm still not selling my community is worth more to me than 1 million dollars she was a hero in her neighborhood the developer responded and to happening the way people are experiencing community in so many places where decisions are being made that they have no control over the decisions being made by outside money or by outside powers and people also so many people feeling isolated in their communities even if there's a strong sense of community in dividuals who don't feel a part of community so this was part of the development pattern that was really kicking off in Seattle in the late 1980s where more and more people were coming to see out and enjoy our wonderful natural environment and the process totally screwing it up and we're changing the character of our neighborhoods that people prize so much getting increasing parking issues traffic issues increased issues around drugs and gangs and violence and people were waiting City Hall in fact I was one of the chief organizers here's the demonstration I organized where we were fighting a big box retail proposal that was threatening the Little Saigon neighborhood so we had hundreds of people marching down the streets with big boxes around the this kind of the neighborhood to City Hall in blaming City Hall for all the problems in the neighborhoods in the Fremont neighborhood they were so angry that they simply erected a rocket on the side of one of their businesses and they announced that it was aimed at City Hall they declared themselves the artists republic of fremont you start issuing their own postage stamps and this kind of activity is going on all over the place so finally our city council some members were just concerned about their future jobs and some work and some said you know there's got to be a better way to run a democracy when people start being so feeling so alienated from government that they're erecting rockets something's wrong we got to do things in a different way so in 1988 re Sydney established a first-ever department of neighborhoods first time an apartment had been organized the way the community was organized by place rather than by discrete functions and I got surprised my life because the mayor at the time trollee writer called me and said Jim I'd like to appoint you I was surprised is that I only had two contacts with Charlie prior to that time one was when we had picked it at his house and the other was when we released a live chicken in his office because he backed down to campaign commitments we called him chicken Charlie I'm not trying to give you any ideas yeah but whatever so I'm still not sure why I got that appointment he may have just been trying to get me off the streets or it may have been paid back because it was a pretty controversial office when it started but what I realized was I was not going to keep that job for very long if I just train people how to release chickens and the mayor's office right I would need to find a new way of engaging people with City Hall and earn a new way to engage City Hall with the people and so well what we worked towards is how do we create more of a real partnership and what we realized very quickly was that in order to move towards in the part of city hall but also on the part of the community that we had acting very different ways so I gave this chart showing with the changes that need to be made and I'm not going to go through and read all this you can do it yourself but just to highlight a couple of the things government needs to shift by moving beyond customer service and citizen participation to community empowerment the community first part needs to think and active citizens rather just think of themselves as ratepayers so the point is if custom government is just treating people as customers and it's important to provide good customer service and I know that's a real focus of the city and it's very important but all we do is treat people as customers the inverse relationship is to think of yourself only as a ratepayer so it's how do we get people to start thinking themselves as citizens again and start seeing government as an extension of ourselves when I met with the merits noon he really gets it he kept talking all about so other major changes that need to be made our community can't partner with government the way government's currently organized where every function is organized into its own silo where everybody's trying to reach out to the community as individual departments or individual functions it's only works if government is working as a whole is working across all those silos and takes more of a place based approach and in the same way government can't partner with the community when the community is divided into all kinds of factions when different community interests are fighting with each other and not talking to each other when business and residents and home owners and tenants and young people and seniors are all in their own silos and not communicating with one another so I'm not going to go through all those but those are a few major changes but the biggest change that needs to be made on the part of both government and community if we're going to move towards partnership is to stop focusing on this map that we tend to neighborhoods in government and in our communities tends to be focusing on all the problems in our neighborhoods this is a legitimate map the purpose for government is to address needs that we can't address the communities can't address themselves but if we stop here we're only looking at half the blast and frankly we're looking at the useless part of the glass you can't do anything with a half-empty part of the class but that's usually all we focus on communities for their part tend to focus on the half-empty part as well always look to government for all the resources all the solutions and forget we have incredible capacity in our communities to do things for ourselves it just shows the futility of looking in the read you know how ridiculous it is just to look at the half empty part of the glass so what's the basis for partnerships is to start to focus on the half-full part of the glass and this is a map of exactly that same neighborhood but instead of focusing on what's missing we the community amba gives some individuals in the community on the many many there's hundreds of voluntary associations different networks in every neighborhood the adult natural environment particularly those underutilized resources the local economy the local heritage and identity and the local agencies are all underutilized resources in our communities probably the one that gets most overlooked is the fact that every individual everybody living in our communities everybody without exception has incredible gifts to give everybody's got gifts of the head their unique knowledge everybody's got gifts of the heart their passions and everybody's got gifts of the hands their unique skills the problem in our society is we're increasingly putting labels on huge sections of our community that label them not by their strengths but by their deficiencies so I'm sure you recognize some of these labels we put on people homeless unemployed poor non-english speaking single parent added sex worker at risk you old person like get increasingly sensitive to that one and disabled and when we put those labels on it defines people solely in terms of what they're needs but everybody also has incredible gifts to give and somehow in our society we've created two classes of people we create the class of people with the labels and the needs and we've created the class of people with all the gifts and when we just focus on people's needs they become clients in a service system and we focus on people's gift they become citizens in our community so we need to lift those labels off so one of the first things we did in the Department of Neighborhood so it's trying to figure out how do we get our neighborhood associations to be more inclusive because our organizations tended to be whiter more middle-class more homeowners more middle-aged than the neighborhood as a whole so we've tried to help groups think about how they could be so much stronger if they remove those labels and focused on everybody's gifts so we started with the people who are the most the most isolated in our neighborhoods those people are living in group homes for years outside of our neighborhoods were being were part of a service system living in our neighborhoods but not part of our community life so we started a program we call involving all neighbors and the idea was to focus on the gifts of people with adult bonus abilities so when the first people game seeing it was mad madness mom came to see me maxxis I've been living in the Ravenna neighborhood for eight years I don't know anybody I'm totally alone I said Matt what he liked and he took me to Ravenna Creek since I love this Creek I knew the neighborhood association was working to clean up that Creek to make a better salmon habitat so I talked to the neighborhood leader to Thomas and I said Thomas could you involve Matt in the project he said sure we can always use more volunteers so they traded Matt how to remove the invasive plants how to reforest need of plants and soon met became the expert and that was leading work parties here is teaching other people how to remove the invasive college from along the creek but max greatest he knocks on your door and says I am mad I'm really care about the same you you'll happy won't you I'm gonna can't_''_803.23 say no to the guy so he's got armies of people clinging up the cleaning up the invasive plants wrong the Greek and it's incredibly creative so you see how it's invasive Holly at Christmas time he organizes a holiday party and all the neighbors go on to collect invasive hollowing to make Christmas decorations and they go back to mass house afterwards and have a big party and that is totally socially uninhibited he's always the first one out to dance for and he helps everybody else break out of their shells that's his gift but it was being lost under that label of developmentally disabled
 I feel amazing on three men on one day it just allows the Aboriginal and non-aboriginal people to come together and celebrate what it is to be Australian together we are changing history and the way that people relate to each other in this country for the better my heart feels happy because you know it's not on the day that signifies sadness and oppression and genocide it means a lot you know look look at all the non-indigenous community here are they're celebrating and sharing our culture with us and they feel like family because they love and celebrate us and show respect and understanding from where our heart is for me it has a big significance because this is my family's traditional grounds and for many years we hardly came down this end of the community and to be able to come back down here and see it being used today like it is with not only Aboriginal people but people of all nationalities and cultures to me that has told me that we have connected with reconciliation of the highest morning was actually a real sense of people coming together in a deep and meaningful way what Frio is doing here is it starting something and showing how how it can be one day two means an acknowledgement of Aboriginal culture and also about how we need to heal the parts to move forward with compassion I reckon one day means to me that it's acknowledging Aboriginal people and it's very special we haven't really been able to celebrate you know in the same way that other Australians have on this weekend and this is our opportunity to come down and you know and I feel good you know it's in amongst everything else all the animosity that's out there this is a place where we can come and feel good and feel happy so my heart feels good yeah on the count of three I want you to jump in the air and sing afterward yeah you're ready line

members responses to previous public questions there are some responses in the printed agenda which is also available online from the meeting of the second of march we're now entering public question time we're going to take all the presentations in agenda order then we'll discuss the items for which there is someone present and then deal with the items for which there's no one present um the first person I have is matthew ryder to speak on item one a yep okay you have three minutes uh if you go over time we'll give you a reminder we have three minutes because you're gonna test your sound before you go any further check one two check one two that's really coming through yeah three minutes go ahead all right hi hiya uh my name is matthew I'm the owner of 32 bromley road in hilton uh since originally applying to build the proposed patio I've been very conscious of the heritage significance of the area and more importantly the impact to the streetscape after listening to feedback from the last planning committee and also from the uh petition that I got signed by some of my neighbors I've amended plans and I've got support from my neighbours I've made features more visible from uh from the street um you can see the house clearly um worth noting 39 uh of my neighbours supported the the structure being built um and I just asked that you look favorably favorably favorably on the design that's all thank you are any questions to the uh evan rogers on item three the local heritage survey and heritage list involving a house in thompson road north fremantle are you there evan uh yes I am can everyone hear me in the same oh yeah yeah deborah sorry debri would you mind turning your camera off you can leave the microphone on sorry leave your microphone camera you can watch but turn your camera off thank you okay evan rogers uh okay um thank you mayor and councillors for the opportunity to address the committee this evening um at the committee meeting on 23rd of february the decision to heritage list the property in question was deferred to allow the property owner to obtain an expert opinion on and response to the report by prepared by the city of fremantle heritage officer and that response was submitted on the 25th of march I trust all of the members of the committee have taken the opportunity to review that response and other materials submitted on behalf of our client the response was prepared by phil griffiths a well-known and highly respected architect and authority on heritage architecture in of the subject property I'd first like to start by addressing the statement of significance in the report prepared by the city of fermantel the first element of the statement of significance stated if the building has uh sorry the building has aesthetic uh and rarity value as a simple well-composed example of the work of year one it went off as an idiosyncratic example of late 20th century brutal style of architecture now in the in the minutes prepared tonight there was um you know no no uh acknowledgement of the response by mr griffiths in in in his report that we've submitted but uh if I could at least allude to that in his response he rebutted that statement by pining that the city of fremantle report overstated the significance of the building there in fact thousands of buildings of a similar structure all over light industrial areas in perth in using concentric identical bays with side elevations distinguished by piers and planes the design this is a standard design for light industrial buildings including a variety of materials including brick steel tilt up concrete colour the building had not been designed by e1 illinois it is unlikely it would have received any attention at all with respect to heritage so it's disappointing to see these important facts have not been acknowledged by the heritage officer in the minutes in today's meeting in order to bring them to the attention of the committee the second factor in the statement of significance was that the building has historic and social value as an example of the light industrial and commercial development that was established in north romano between the 1890s and 1970s and illustrates a mixed use of industrial development in a residential working-class area before the rise of car ownership and the introduction of post-war zoning plans again in the report by phil griffiths he strongly rebuts that statement the building was constructed at the end of the period stated comparing the use as as it was built as a recording studio to other industries in the area such as the state engineering works soap factory flour mill that were common in the north romano area during that period indicates that this use stands the example of light industrial and commercial development that was established in the area during the period furthermore a recording studio is clearly not an example of an industry that is normally associated with the working class people that lived in the area during the time stated finally the building has side access for cars and a car park and garage at the rear as opposed to the premise in the statement that it represents buildings in the areas which were constructed before the rise of car ownership again the statement in the city of romano report is clearly wrong and misleading in several respects and this has been highlighted in mr griffith's report however once again the minutes for the today's meeting prepared by the heritage officer have failed that fact or bring it to the attention of the committee the third factor in the state correct can you draw to a close please you've had it well over three minutes thank you okay well the third factor in the statement of significance is that it contributes to the character of the heritage area as per front elevation represents as a blank wall to the street um and again that hasn't been brought to the attention the committee um look in the response phil griffith stated the city of france you've had I had well over time I'd like to draw to a conclusively just finished sentence okay in this place the fact is only recently representative even us work and although he was an important architect this place could not be sent to be a good example of work if the um we we conclude that the property shouldn't be placed on the heritage list or alternatively it should only if the clowns is inclined to place it on the list at best its heritage value sits it more at a category three place thank you are there any questions from the committee no questions from the county okay thank you if you'd like to mute your microphone um the next person we have is joseph paparo are you available uh hi yes uh it's joshua actually okay joshua just give us a second you're on uh item tavern okay go ahead yes no I'm I'm just present uh to answer any questions uh if anyone has anything specific regarding our development application so you're the applicant yes that's correct any questions from the committee so you can have an early night okay thank you um deborah friedman are you available this is uh item six the uh sterling highway additions to the top of the chemist shop uh can you just test your sound please uh can you hear me yeah that's good okay three minutes um the first thing I want to say I had an email from the neighbor who had made the submission about this thing telling me that he says all the best for getting the application endorsed we have no objection so that's the first thing quickly trying to read off a mobile the business design philosophy aims to mitigate as much as possible the significant overshadowing that will be created by the proposed adjacent development of 110 sterling highway if permission is granted the significant constraint on our site dictates the orientation of the proposed responds to the scales of the proposed three-story mixed-use development at 110 sterling highway and the three-story residence at seven leslie road and transitions from the medium rise dingo flower building north to the lower rise building south we believe the overall bulk of the the design is in keeping with everything else in the area the overshadowing um the only overshadowing that we are we see is it's all within the codes and the overshadowing just overshadowed un unhabitable space um and car parks and it will just create shade for cars parking in the area the parking we've got currently seven bays and one bay allocated to uh residential use the city don't recognize one of the bays because part of it sits in the road reserve only part of it but on our other plans it was as far as I remember highlighted as us having eight parking bays which is far more than anyone else down there in that area landscaping we've done our best to make sure that we have as much greenery as possible on the property we're planting've got a green wall going up on the southern boundary in the form of a fence with greenery growing on it um there's just a bit of a clarification here around the it says we're proposing a nil boundary set back to the ground floor south the ground floor building alignment remains as existing we're just proposing a 1.8 high boundary fence along the southern boundary for privacy and security purposes it should be clarified we are proposing an extension to the existing caretaker unit and upon completion will continue to function as a single dwelling not multiple dwellings as stated in the agenda documents and I think it pretty much I have spoken to most people I'm I'm fairly confident this design is going to enhance the whole area and will set the standard for everything else that comes after it I think he's done a great job so that's my personal opinion so yeah I'd love to have some feedback if anyone objects to anything and away we go that's me done okay any questions to the applicant lane application item eight are you there uh yes can you hear me yep yes um thank you for the opportunity uh to speak tonight and um hello to all the councillors the mayor and staff um I'm representing the landowner at number seven guertin lane uh which is the adjoining eastern property we've reviewed the plans and we've been following this application through with the city during its process and I guess at the end of the day we oppose the recommendation for approval for this application given the fact that we believe that it doesn't meet the current planning framework it represents over development of the site the over height component of the dwelling can will affect the views of significance if you're joining property and I think the plans that have been presented tonight have insufficient information for uh the city to make an informed decision in regards to the non-compliance issue with the planning framework um we've looked at the plans quite extensively and it cannot be deemed the addition to the top of the uh or above the existing existing house because there's no direct link between the existing house the dwelling part and that addition so it clearly has to be in addition to the existing ancillary dwelling on the site and the way in which it's designed it has been designed with what could arguably be a common foyer area um the r codes as you're aware um limit ancillary dwellings to 70 square meters this application seeks 102 square meters which is a 32 square meter increase and simply does not meet the design principle side of the codes when looking at that type and size of variation when looking at the design principle side of the codes it clearly says a small scale and designed to support independent living as I mentioned this is a substantial increase to what is permitted for an ancillary dwelling it's 45.7 percent increase in in most cases and and the way I look at this is that it's akin to a group dwelling as opposed to an ancillary dwelling and this has come up recently with the department of planning for developments within the swan city of stirling and so on where substantial increases to ancillary dwellings of this magnitude has been deemed as a group dwelling and hasn't been supported um in terms of looking at this as a group dwelling the site is r25_``_874.88 it's 475 square me 471 square meters and it certainly doesn't meet the requirements and the r codes for a group dwelling so to con to to look at this aspect of the of our point is that if it's deemed as a group dwelling you can't have it um and if we look at it as an ancillary dwelling it's way too big and it doesn't meet the design principles we've also looked at and I said we've looked at the layout um the foyer or the entry appears to be a common for you it clearly could be separated because one of our concerns of our client is that the ancillary dwelling the top part and the bottom part sorry can you draw to a close please not a problem so the layout we believe could be design are occupied separately which once again has two ancillary dwellings not permitted um and in regards to the current plans not having enough information there's no internal layouts for the ground level of the ancillary dwelling there's no internals for the house so there isn't enough information in regards to building height just to conclude it does affect the views and significance of our client and a simple solution is move that upper flower back if it's only one ancillary well then they can certainly lose some space in that living area to push that upper level back to make it comply with the building height requirements so just to conclude we do believe that this shouldn't be supported and that the application should be refused thank you thank you any questions of mr famiano okay the next speaker is michael perth who is the applicant are you available I'm here yeah okay three minutes starting now thank you okay good evening everyone um I just want to say that uh that I support the uh officer's recommendation on the addition and and then I'm available for any questions that the committee may have but I just want to I just want to reply to to some of the uh statements that were made by the previous speaker that the the whole intention of of our addition is is to create a one uh livable dwelling because as it is now it is two separate uh buildings and our whole the whole plan was to create something that was completely joined so that our our two daughters are living uh in in that in that in not a separate space but actually in in in one uh livable uh dwelling so that's that's the intention and we did not have enough space in the existing dwellings so what we've done here is we we've created something that is now uh a composite living space whereas before it was something that was two separate uh structures and I think the the end result will be uh a much more livable space for us and there's no intention of having any kind of uh separate uh area to a family house with we've got two uh sort of older uh children that are now uh young adults and then that's uh so we're able to live in in the situation with uh sharing all the facilities of the house that's all I have to say thank you thank you any questions of the applicant uh councillor sullivan yes thank you chair um michael I just wanted to get a little bit of clarification about the history of the site and whether in fact it was two lots originally when it was subdivided um you know I sort of have a memory of the different buildings being built at different times and completely different architects and everything and just wanted to get a bit more understanding about the history of the blocks in that area if you know it yes I mean originally this was was all part of one very large uh block which included the the old grammar school what looks like a church and a number of uh of sites which are houses on the on both sides of the laneway and some changes made when when the uh the blocks were were subdivided uh the alignments or the the size of the box were changed in about 2000 or 2001. and number three the reason why it's number three to five gertin lane is in fact the the five is is a is a half a block was added to the the old free gertin lane and that so it's essentially um one and a half blocks uh now then in terms of its compared with its original size before it was one block now it's it's three to five does that answer your question sullivan yep thank you any further questions okay thank you oh no thank you we'll move on um the next item for which there are several speakers is item nine um which is uh solomon street 45. I'm going to ask the director to read out kevin carter the real neighbor was unable to be with us tonight and he's sent in a a submission which the director is going to read and then I'll take the other here actually the manager's got that statement to read out sorry it's the manager are you available with that statement I am chair I will uh read this on behalf of mr kevin carter from 36 bellevue terrace is a submission against the proposed development of 45 solomon street uh I would like to make this submission opposing the proposed development of 45 solomon street my property has a block of flats on the north side the gutter level of these flats is almost three stories above the ground level of my property the retaining wall is up to 2.2 metres high with a 1.8 metre fence on the wall the house to the rear of these flats is higher and not far from the rear boundary and overlooking my property the proposed development which is immediately to the rear of my property will similarly be three to four levels above my house if this proposal goes ahead living in my house will be like living in a pit with three to four level high structures on the north side around to the east side and no privacy unacceptable situation but also devalue my property I am not a expert on height limits however my understanding of the purpose of these limits is to maintain a uniform height in the neighborhood and not disadvantage neighbouring residents height restrictions should apply to all neighbours not only the adjacent neighbours on each side to have height limits to protect adjacent neighbours in the same street but not adjacent properties in the front or rear is discrimination my understanding is this proposal does not comply with our height restrictions simply put it should be rejected on this fact alone I am aware of a situation in fremantle where the planning scheme had slash has a limit to single-story buildings approval was given for two-story homes while it may have given the developer and the approving committee a warm and fuzzy feeling to allow two-story homes to be built I can assure you the neighbours did not have the same feeling due to the impact on their lives and property values it raises the question of why do these regulations exist the impact of shading is another issue I estimate the sun morning unfortunately this is only an estimate as I do not have the information or tools to create an accurate profile the information I have not received from the city of fremantle shows two different shadow profiles the second is much larger than the first which raises obvious questions I have since been informed not not by the city of fremantle that these are not correct the shadow profile only applies at midday if this is the case why not apply it at the solstice or on a cloudy day when there is absolute minimum shading my final objection is regarding the rainfall runoff at present there is unacceptable and illegal runoff from this property into my property the lack of drainage shown on the proposal is a concern as the runoff is most likely to increase I have been assured verbally this matter will be addressed I await the outcome thank you there are three other speakers against the proposal I'm going to what can I ask you all to introduce yourselves by telling us where you live in relation to the application I'll go first to applicant um if you want to speak to the neighbours um I'm I'm happy to go after them um but I'm the applicant from some home group no sorry I will do that I really I thought mr soto was the applicant okay so yeah kristen hello can you hear me okay that's fine sure thank you um yeah my name is christian thornton for reference I live at 38 bellevue terrace with my my wife and two children we're situated directly behind 45 solomon street uh we'd like to thank sue jeff ben brienne and tom and maria for visiting our property to take in our point of view literally for the record we're opposing the proposed development uh with the following points to hope to provide some clarification for that reasoning uh when my wife and I purchased our home our 1907 built home on bellevue terrace more than six years ago we were drawn to fremantle because of the respect for heritage and character buildings including homes we are fortunate to live in a neighborhood where people are aware of others we are also fortunate that we would see our property increase in value as the years pass the proposed development would see that this does not occur due to the encroaching nature of this proposal to our knowledge the proposal will be above the current height restrictions also and will increase its shadow crawl profile significantly reducing the amount of natural light into neighboring properties asking one of them if this development was to be approved this would set a daunting precedent where the building guidelines specifically height are not adhered to my question to you would be what is the point of the building guidelines if a matter as simple as someone exceeding the allowable height is not able to be opposed again it's our opinion that allowing developments such as this will set a precinct for future developments and it will in turn diminish the integrity of the process now as you're aware the currently 45 solomon street is a two-story property and he's proposed to add a third story as the building currently stands 45 solomon street has rear windows that looked into in recent emails which shows this these windows on the second floor look directly into our kitchen dining and bathroom area with our toilet within view also we already feel we are lacking privacy when we're in these areas of our home and make conscious decisions to change our behaviour so we're not in view of these windows we believe that by adding an additional story with an additional three windows this will reduce our privacy even further and increase the level of anxiety that we feel as I've said above the proposal or the proposed development would increase the visibility into the rear of our property this is where our young children play we want our children to lead a normal and safe childhood in which they should feel that they have the ability to feel safe and secure in their own home and backyard we want our children to live in the sanctuary of their home and do not want them growing up in the complete view of others we worry that the proposed development would not allow us to have the ability to limit on that at all we strongly believe this feeling of potentially being watched our loss of privacy and reduced security will severely impact our family's mental health we believe that the development lacks the conscious consideration of its neighboring properties especially ours and we respectfully request that the above points be considered thank you for your time thank you very much any questions from mr hobson mr thornton any questions no thank you carl hudson are you available carl hodson on item nine is that the neighbor does anybody know we lost him um we'll just leave that then so uh mr gleason and mr sotile is that I'm sorry if that's wrong pronunciation who wants to go first mr gleason yes council have to go first yep okay three minutes thank you thank you thank you mayor councillors and staff um my name is I'm the senior council planner at the summit homes group um I'm speaking obviously in support of the application for additions and alterations at 45 dollars just first of all the application has been described in the report as a two-story home with a uh an undercropped area at the rear of the dwelling the upper floor addition proposed is small in relation to the ground floor and it's set in from the the side and and rear and front elevations of the ground floor and um that means that it's not presenting a vertical two-story wall base to the neighboring lots and that goes a long way to break up the building bulk and mass of the structure um just returning some of the comments earlier the hype proposed is actually in keeping with a development approval for a similar proposal at 63 sullivan street which was granted at the planning committee meeting on the 5th of october 2016. this application was approved for additions with a roof part of 10.9 meters and a wall height to 8.4 meters this proposal is uh proposing a route height of 10 meters and a wall height of 8.5 meters so a lower roof height and the approval granted at number 63 and the wall height is marginally higher 100 millimeters higher um so very similar in scale to 61 um so it in those terms it's consistent with other homes in the area um I'd also like to comment that um uh the variation is largely the result of the the two metre slope on the site um the application's been amended during the course of the application and it's fully compliant with privacy in relation to the the rear neighbor and the um the neighbor to the south and it's also fully compliant without a shadow with regard to privacy I appreciate the comments of of the the neighbours to the west however a lot of those properties are already overlooked by dwellings on solomon street and in addition the properties along solomon street have mutual overlooking between themselves it's just a character of the area and it's typical of sloping topography such as this in terms of overshadowing we did provide a breakdown of overshadowing at different times of the day and year so the properties to the west will be subject to some overshadowing at 9am june 21st however um at midday june 21st there's no overshadowing no overshadowing at all in the months of uh march september and december uh there is a shadow cast on the site to the south at 47 solomon street but the additional shadow falls largely over the roof of this dwelling and about half the deck area at number 47. I can provide a more of a detailed breakdown of the impact on 147 but there's a you know a dining room which virtually experiences no overshadowing and a living room experience is overshadowing in june but then nothing in march so can you draw a close please just a couple more points if you can sure um so we have amended the plans to reduce the building height by 100 millimeters we cannot reduce the height anymore because the upper level bedrooms are at their minimum ceiling like the building code we can't reduce the third full floor frame anymore because we've we're retaining the existing ceiling joists and we need a 510 mil um dimension to accommodate those joists and the new uh first floor truss and all the services um the only real were to pull the first floor uh forward um of the dueling forward of the main ridgeline um yeah so just my final point I guess is going back to some of the comments made by the neighbours then to comply standard in one compliance pathway obtaining approval under under a design principle is also a valid approval pathway and we feel as though the proposal meets the design principles and is in keeping with recent development approved to the south on on solomon street thank you tom thank you I did allow that extra time because it's fairly complicated issue but any members of the committee wish to ask questions no sorry mr sotili is that the correct pronunciation yes three minutes please okay good thank you um yeah good evening all um again my name is jim citelli I'm one of the three owners of the property at 45 solomon street in fremantle the other owners and my wife melina and sister-in-law janice I'd like to thank hamish hamish and charlie from summit homes for their work on the project so far tom gettys the to meet us on site and the committee to give me an opportunity to speak I just wanted to say a few words today about our plans for renovations and the reasons why we want to move back to fremantle melina and I have been living in cardinia for the last 21 years and they have decided that it's the right time for us to move back to fremantle where we both were brought up melina and janice did their schooling at south mantel high and I attended south cbc fremantle janice has been living in the house all her life and on her own for the last five years when mum passed away we've decided to move back to fremont for a few reasons to be closer to my 98 year old mother so that I can continue to take care of her uh to fulfill molina and janice's lifetime dream to renovate mum's house so that we can all live a comfortable retirement and to support janice with the health issues hence we have included a lift in our renovations from what hamish has've taken on board our neighbours concerns and have addressed them by changing our design to include a barrier in the terrace downstairs and lowered our overall height as you can appreciate since the house ceilings are currently 3.5 metres high adding a standard height room on top is going to raise the issue of height which sometimes can't_''_2129.68 be helped we also believe that our neighbours existing approved renovations will address some of their concerns going forward I hope you also appreciate that in areas like summoner street fremantle there are already significant ground level differences which introduce issues like overlooking and overshadowing which in some cases can't_''_2151.2 be helped I believe we have compromised as much as we can to address issues on hand I'd also like to point out that there are other houses on the street nearby that have taken out similar renovations in the last five years and have had some sort of and and that's set to some sort of precedent our enabler on belgium terrace had a fantastic crew removed a few years ago which provided great privacy they design plans have not proceeded without consulting some of our neighbours and providing them with a copy of our plans upon request we did this in good faith even though it was outside of the allowed time frame we also did this to minimise issues but more importantly maintain the harmony amongst our neighbours we regard neighborhood watch and harmony amongst neighbours as very important especially in later years of life so in light of all of this I've just which is what I've discussed today today we're hoping that our project is approved so that we can continue with our exciting next phase in their lives thank you thank you very much any questions from the committee uh we thank you very much um we seem to have discovered mr huston can you make yourself known mr carl austin he just showed up a minute ago and waving his hand where's he going I don't really know where he is we'll just give it a minute he just had his hand up a minute ago any idea no oh he's here again on your microphone and let us know where you are no idea okay so I will have to leave that then um it is at the end of the agenda so if we maybe can get you a chance to speak later if we can work out what's going on okay um all right got my microphone off so say that again uh the final item of public comment is item 12 the north mental rezoning I've got gerard mcgill to speak are you there jerry yes thank you mr chairman three minutes thank you thanks very much I previously stated in relation to the demolitions that councils should refuse them on the grounds that the application was premature in light of the future fremantle study the same applies here as the subject area cannot be considered in isolation from the whole of the future of fremantle study nor indeed the context of the whole peninsula I referred to the latent finish there as an urban archipelago of islands separated by rivers of traffic the subject site should not be adding another island this fortunately is acknowledged in the key issues being resolving or at least not worsening community severance issues in north fremantle considering a further road network option that of a dispersed urban grid network of boulevard style roads a grid network that would provide flexibility to service local needs as well as through traffic a precinct plan for the area to resolve coastal setbacks transport and access a collocation collocation of this development with the existing center and establish strong pedestrian cycle connections between the existing town center and any new retail facilities or indeed any other place on the leiden peninsula this I'm happy to say is some of the most encouraging language I've ever seen from council in relation to north 3 metal which is why the north korean metal community would support the urban deferred zoning I'd like to express my appreciation for paul garvin and the strategic planning staff for putting forward this this extremely thoughtful response to the application the bridge of the bridge issue was a lost opportunity to do something creative about the future of the latent peninsula but this is another and council should another suggestion the proposal by the government to dispose of the mccall center is highly relevant to the bigger picture that includes the amendment I believe it would be highly appropriate for council to establish a position on that too so thanks very much for listening thank you any questions from mr mcgill can I just ask are you putting in a submission I think I'll just check with the director I think at this stage there isn't public comment because this is the very preliminary input but there will be an opportunity for community and personal input at a later stage can someone verify that for me uh yes chair that's correct at this stage it's a preliminary referral to the local government and other state agencies if the commission decides to allow the amendment to proceed to the formal public advertising stage that will be the opportunity when anyone in the wider community can make a submission okay thank you are there any questions from the committee no thank you mr gill well uh and this is a an item going to council so member of the public possibly is um tim dawkins to speak on the same item turn three minutes I can hear me yes thanks uh good evening chair mayor and counselors my name is tim dawkins I'm a director at erbis and I'm speaking with respect to item 12 on tonight's agenda I'm joined online with by lex bunnett director tbb and cameron leckie director of lot rise urban urban tbb and ryzen have been working together um with a specialist consultant team to assist the landowners of the north from annual development precinct to start the pro this process of preparing the site for its non-industrial future the future is more appropriate to the context of existing surrounding uses a move away from the industrial uses that are no longer appropriate in a sensitive coastal location and a move towards land uses that better serves the needs of residents and visitors the first step in that process is to realign the metropolitan region scheme to move it from industrial zone to the urban zone this is the beginning of a long process however we cannot um which will be inclusive of a consultative consultative and um inclusive process to set a vision establish development parameters and commence urban design until this step has occurred and the site has been moved into the urban zone we look forward to working with the city of fremantle and a wide range of stakeholders including the community to redevelop this former industrial land in a way that best reflects its amazing attributes this includes a scientific and well-considered response to the matters raised in the agenda including the various um including particular response to coastal processes or front of mind it's important to note that this mrs proposal has adopted the council's position on full managed uh retreat and coastal soviet setbacks have been developed in accordance with the state planning policy on coastal processes finally in light of all this we don't believe the urban divert status is necessary and recommend the council endorse an urban zoning the the considerations set out the agenda are all matters that are normally and regularly regularly um resolve through a structure plan that prepared under the city of determined by the commission along with lex and cameron would be happy to answer any questions you might have any questions from the committee no okay um lex do you wish to speak uh no mr chair thank you very much I think I think tim has expressed our position on this very well I think there's a long way to go there is um it is a long journey as as as tim has said and we're really looking forward to getting to that first base I think just emphasizing the importance of this being able to go urban as opposed to urban deferred that is the step that will really trigger the next layer of detail planning and I and we really welcome mr mcgill's uh comments on behalf of northridge mantle uh residents because that's what we really want to get into and that that full urban classification is going to be the trigger to start that process so we're really keen to to to get the land zoned to a full urban zoning for that purpose but one way or the support for uh the future of this land being urban as opposed to industrial thank you mr chairman thank you another questions from the committee okay I'll just we've still got mr huston with his hand up but no idea one last chance mr huston if you're there okay in that case we'll move into the items if we're going to deal with the items where there were people speaking first so the first one is item one deferred item the patio in bromley road hilton I'll move the officer's recommendation seconded by councillor graham is there anyone wishing to speak uh councillor laura oh um thank you chair this is um uh an item that we've all seen before and I just want to thank everyone for their um comments earlier and and the thought that went into uh the previous deferral and I just I just want to say that I'll be voting against the officer's recommendation and that's because I believe that this is an instance where our discretion as a committee really should be exercised at the previous committee meeting and and by his account got 39 neighbors to agree to his proposal um and um and I think that's a testament to some of the challenges that are uh you know being experienced in hilton at this at this time um and if I could just briefly you know some of the the alternate proposals that was put to the applicant as ways of a solution to to garner um you know support from the staff just really are not possible um and that included uh lowering the the height of the roof um because that that's just not not gonna be a workable solution another thing that was suggested was to lower the um the level of the the decking and that also is just not possible at this area because there's actually a concrete slab underneath that and then um so you couldn't actually lower the deck without doing much much much works there and then the other thing was to make this a freestanding structure which actually putting posts closer to to the house would um uh as open as an environment and so you know personally I just really believe that the amenity of this proposal it would increase the amenity of the of the neighborhood by an increased passive surveillance of the street and that's also I guess doubly true because if you look at the the plans for this lot there's really no amenity in the back of this house there's about a meter that's there and so um you know this is really the only place that the applicant will be able to enjoy the front of their their area um and then the last thing that the council talked about or the staff was about the impact on the streetscape and I personally just don't believe that the impact is going to be that major one because the applicant did take on board um opening up and changing the pitch of the roof so that way it's you know tipped up versus tip down but also this proposal doesn't really project past the neighboring house at all and the other side has adequate screening and you know taken our comments on board and um I'll be voting against all forces recommendation and if that goes down I'll be voting in favor of the alternate recommendation so thank you I've got council sullivan wishing to speak thank you chair um I'll just support um what council lawver just said uh fundamentally um having been on out on sites uh since the deferral um and it is the house is well set back um the awning has been revised in the way that the committee suggested that it should be so it actually opens the house more up to the street um it might still be a very sort of patio you know back patio type construction and the conversations that I've had with the applicant and I apologize to him for not getting back to him subsequently but uh we're much more along the lines that it's not the the planning form uh that I'd love to see improved it's more the construction um technique um but that's not really a a planning matter in this that the way in which it is now configured sorry about sorry about that um remember not to touch your keypad um the test really uh for uh the the planning approval is whether um the form overall is right and frankly it is it's it's done what the committee asked for um and so I think we should vote the officers recommendation down just bear in mind they obviously had to or felt the need to uh repeat the recommendation that they made originally the committee set a different path the applicant has complied with that and so a reasonable outcome should be an approval I'll come to council groom but councillor lover your hand is still up um council groom all right playing with microphone buttons um thank you for that um I concur with councillors laura and sullivan I certainly had hoped that we would have a more uh elegant um design solution on that site this um you know it's the first patio of its kind in the street um and it would have been nice to set the bar high going response in that context and um as councillor laura says a you know a normal response to the subdivision of the land that occurs that's beyond our control so when that block was cut up there were no other open space options left for the residents so the only way for them to create covered outdoor space which is generally considered as a good outcome for a whole range of reasons is to put a patio at the front of their house so our job is to find solutions that facilitate that with the least impact on the streetscape and neighbours so you know the applicant has worked in good faith to achieve the best they can for that solution within their means unless someone wants to speak in favor of the opposite recommendation I'll move to a vote we'll need to vote against the recommendation if you wish to move the alternative recommendation which is on page 15 so do anybody else wish to speak before we vote on the officer's recommendation okay can we do that please need to hold your hand up long moving what's happening okay we'll do that again so we're voting if you wish your defend against this and then we'll move the alternative recommendation so all those in favor all those against bruno the officer's recommendation or what we've already moved the officer's recommendation so we need to vote on it there is an alternative recommendation in the agenda and since we've already moved the officer's recommendation we need to vote that down before we can move the alternative recommendation that clear okay yeah okay so we'll move move the officer's recommendation all those in favor all those against council graham are you voting sorry a little time lag on your camera is that unanimous I think it's unanimous yes okay so that's lost we'll now move the alternative recommendation which is on page 15 which is for approval I don't think we need any further discussion do we okay all those in favor oh sorry nicely moved and seconded uh councillor lorva you'd like to move it council sullivan you would not lord is frozen yeah so I think we've seen everybody haven't we there seems to be a bit of a time lag on some of the cameras so can we just do that again just for this record hands up in favor and keep your hand up there's quite a time lag on cancer graham and council law over okay just bear that in mind in the future okay that's unanimous thank you the next item is item three the local heritage survey of the house in thompson road that we heard the speaker on I'll move the officer's recommendation which is to add it to the heritage list taken by council graham any discussion council graham yeah thanks mr chair look uh no I'm not going to support the officer's recommendation um I find this is a bit of a difficult one uh it's certainly got no streetscape appeal in actual fact you can't actually see it from the street if you go over there you've got to get off your scooter and try and find the house a month or treat you so I would have thought if we're looking at a level two um classification would be something that people would like to see uh I do think that the assessment has overstated its significance um some architects don't get it right and just because this is I have enough it doesn't mean to say that this one's right I just cannot see the value of it being a little too listing um it's a sort of a house that would never get on a tourist map and I don't think there'd be too many people in north america but mostly even art sarah or would even miss it if it did go so um I won't be supporting the officer's recommendation I think it should just be a level three um so I've just been just gonna see what others think thank you councillor groom sorry counselor sullivan thank you chair um I'm a little bit sort of uh in between the two heritage reports on this so my sense is um it does than none or little it should be listed but I'm not absolutely convinced by reading both of the reports that um that it's actually a level two and so what I'm going to suggest is to move an amendment I'm sorry I didn't give notice of it but it's very simple it's simply to change the two to a three so it gets listed as a level three so I'll move that as a an amendment if I may and see if I get a second is there a second up I'll say can't see your secondary council larva so it's moved by councillor sullivan seconded by council larva we're on the amendment now which is to make it level three heritage listed is there any discussion of that so can I just speak speak to that obviously um I think the conversation that's been had is that it isn't uh in any way a high quality example of the architect's work it is at the lower uh end of the the scale um in um that doesn't uh in itself though mean that it has no heritage um you know the the combination of um the architect uh the uniqueness of the the function I mean the music industry in fremantle is incredibly important um and certainly important in north fremantle and so there are some social heritage aspects which I don't think have been all that well discussed um and so for those reasons I feel that it does need to be on the heritage list but I would also imagine that um the potential adaption of it would be better observed I guess at a level three I i just don't if I think of other level two buildings in fremantle I just don't really feel that this one has that um that quality um that uh uniqueness in in heritage that standout quality that a level two or a level one uh should should get so um I'll see how I go on that and leave it to committee council groom so I was going to speak too much the same so thank you councillor sullivan a listing at a category two with all of that that it implies both in terms of what the value of the building is and the implications for the owners um to my mind it just doesn't meet the criteria and I found several of the arguments put forward by the not the proponents but the respondents um to to be well justified so I'm happy to support that amendment any further discussion on the amendment ready to move to a vote so it's all those in favor of changing from level two to level three please raise your hand that unanimous council orba yes that's interesting oh you're frozen on one screen and not on the other that's interesting um okay that's unanimous thank you so now we move on to the uh item as amended so presumably no further discussion are we ready to vote okay all those in favor of the amended motion that's unanimous thank you very much the next item is 81 high street um the tavern change of use to tavern license and fit out I to second it yes so it's moved and seconded any discussion um just wanted to say that these guys setting up this operation most of you probably know them they're good operators in fremantle and I just want to say congratulations to them for taking an empty west end building upstairs and activating it it's exactly what we want to see happening in the west end using the upper story building so hats off to those guys and I look forward to seeing it opening any further discussion no hands up okay I'll move that to a vote then all those in favor of the opposite your uh yep that's unanimous thank you so now sorry item six sterling highway two-story edition I'll move the officer's recommendation is there a seconder counselor graham any discussion oh happy with it okay ready to move straight to a vote okay all those in favor council graham I can't see can you see him okay that's unanimous thank you all right it's going too quickly I can't keep up sterling highway 7 I move the officer's recommendation is there a second up counselor graham have it a second yes yes okay any discussion uh counselor groom yeah I did I wanted to kind of talk to some of the um kind of issues raised by the neighbor and I guess my thinking when considering this proposal because it's certainly different and we have had to think about what it means and is it a you know an attempt to stretch or push the planning scheme but the reading of the plans um is that it is creating a flexible house to be shared by adults and at the end of the day it is just a four bedroom house um it is it remains a good amount of open space does not over develop the site and um creates the kind of flexible and adaptable living environment that we need to see more of in our um community to you know meet a variety of needs in a variety of household configurations so I welcome the proposal I think it has been considered and I'm happy to support it'd also support that um I've followed the gertin lane redevelopment um since its inception in the 90s and there are some quite small lots obviously created in that area um and there are also some quite big um and quite tall uh houses uh built on those small lots this is now one of the bigger lots it was developed in multiple stages and it remains in terms of its height overall and its bulk and scale one of the smaller of the buildings in gerton lane and I think on that basis it would be unreasonable to be knocking this back on the grounds of uh being uh an overkill in built form in terms of the ancillary dwelling I mean sometimes the planning kind of framework that we have to test density doesn't exactly match the diversity of living styles that we have in fremantle and this council has been very encouraging of a range of different types of developments that that went well beyond what the codes were set up to do and the codes are slowly catching up where you've got additional buildings um and are kind of like essentially one house um made into into two that's quite capable of being made back into one um then I'm not absolutely convinced that we need to be slavish to um the particular sort of bog standard rule that's set in the r codes so for all of those reasons I think it's reasonable I think they've already compromised a fair bit in terms of setting the building back from the east eastern boundary and and in many ways uh they paid the same respect to the eastern neighbor as the eastern neighbor originally did when they built their building um with a fairly uh narrow setback as well so um you know they're all saying what's good for the goose um so I think it's um it's appropriate that we uh approve it tonight thank you councillor lang thank you um I've had a look at this site and it is somewhat of a difficult site and echoing what my colleagues had mentioned earlier um have to remind myself that a loss and that's it's happened to me before and there's not much that I could do about it um having spoken to the applicant about the loss of the view I understand that there has been considerably trying to maintain views from the balcony from the neighbouring property so while some view has been lost they have worked hard I understand to try and leave some of the view there in place from from that balcony um being a difficult side I will support it but um yeah it's just it's a tough one without when it comes to the views it's not really a planning planning condition anyone else wishing to speak I will speak to close the debate but if anybody else wish to speak first well I'm also old enough to remember being on the planning committee where michael patroni first did this development including the old grammar school which is not a church most people think it's a church but it's actually an old school and I think he took on the whole side and something about it that's now the ancillary dwelling was his building at one stage so I have visited the site it's very difficult site very complicated very hard to find the door um but I think the family wish to achieve and what they've tried to achieve with what they have to work with which is two totally different buildings sitting on the same lot and I'm pretty happy that that's a good result and I'm happy to vote for it so with that is everybody ready to move to a vote okay all those in favor councillor graham I'm not seeing you moving thank you there must be a lag on your camera um okay that's unanimous now to um solomon street number 45 um now there is uh a referral motion but I will take discussion on the item first and then at some point the song wishes to move a referral we'll discuss that at that point so I'll move the officer's recommendation which is for approval is there a seconder councillor graham yep after the second so moved and then if somebody wants to move uh referral or before they can do so anybody wish to speak counselor groom yeah I've really agonized over this one it is um a really potent example of how the r codes are not fit for purpose in the old urban form of fremantle once we combine the varying lot sizes the topography um kind of our built form heritage the rules and the r code just don't make a lot of sense for what we've got to consider in our decision making and certainly having visited the neighbouring properties and even just looking at the drawings we've been given and understanding the topography the the impact in this circumstance of an extra meter of height is really substantial so while there are other contexts that we might decide that that level of discretion has minimal impact in this context that has significant impact the overshadowing on the southern neighbour whilst it's described as just being a dining room that is the winter solar access for that dwelling to the outdoor living area and to some perceived overlooking um to those rear dwellings that are six or meters more meters below the existing ground floor of this new dwelling is real the impact of the extra meter in wall height means that those windows that are looking into those wings are a meter higher than they may otherwise be and and that exacerbates that overlooking impact I would love to think that there are solutions that the owners could find that would mitigate some of those impacts um locating the development more forward or more to the southern side or looking at what options there are to do some of that development kind of at ground level or sub-level because I really support the outcomes that the proponents are trying to achieve and again that notion of you know a family of adults sharing a house which can require a different built form so that's where my struggle's been because I understand the intent and I think it's you know something we would like to try to support but in this circumstance that impact on the neighbours I'm finding it really difficult please thanks um yeah following on the last item as well which is quite a tricky one um I'd say this one's even trickier um councillor groom has absolutely captured everything perfectly I won't repeat any of that um but in in support of the applicants again um I want to say I support what you're trying to achieve here with your family living and aging in place and fremantle that's something we want to support as a council um in fremantle the ability for people to live together with their families we support I support that concept um it's just though this application just needs some changes um to limit the loss of amenity on the neighbours um the ability to see straight into the back of their house does impact on their living so I i foreshadow um that I may raise a referral of this item so that we can encourage applicants to maybe have a second look at this and try and find a balance that enables them to have the aging in place while limiting the impact of the a referral thank you I'll just ask the staff if they could have that ready for us please I've got council laura next please um uh thank you um and I i agree with sue's comments and counselor lanes and council grim um comments um 100 and if there was a referral so I won't repeat what they said I i just think that it's worthwhile because I do support the intentions from the applicant 100 and if there's a chance to make it work while also um you know making sure that the neighbors and can enjoy their properties as well we should give it that chance so if there is a referral I would be wholeheartedly supporting that to to see if we can't find a resolution thank you councillor graham uh thanks mr chair you look like a uh just one point that uh hopefully jim may be listening he made a point on sunday morning saying that he hadn't taken into account the bellevue terrorist neighbours and um from the little balcony he's got there at the outlook all that much but when you actually go down to bellevue terrace and from the yard at 36 and 38 and look up and then picture what is proposed it certainly is a little bit sad to look at so I'm hoping that jim and the summer home people can come up with some sort of solution that will mitigate the problems down there in bellevue terrace I don't think the problem to the south of the neighborhood number 47 I mean because that's totally overlooked at the moment now you know but if they can sort of work out something on the overshadowing that would even be better um so I wouldn't be supporting this application in its current form um but I certainly think in good faith I should have another chance to have a look at it and hopefully perhaps uh get something more to think about next time thank you so uh anyone else wish to speak before we go back to council lang councillor sullivan thank you chair um like the others um you know it is a complex one bit of context into the problems of of living on a hill a hilltown um I've owned the property in a similar situation I've had uh someone build a you know two-story house that was uh a meter and a half from the boundary uh above me uh when there was already a a half a level retaining wall before they even started and he had a window where he was going to get garden island views and I said absolutely go for it it's so high up that I will adapt my yard to that situation because I know that that's probably what I would want to do as well living on the hilltown wanting to get that view um so there is uh a reality of the hilltown um kind of living that that essentially says within reason view corridors views uh are going to need to be accessed or want to be accessed it is a little bit difficult obviously when you're in bellevue terrace where a lot of the cottages are actually quite small on very small lots uh duplexes very big uh and a lot but the reality of this area or this the houses on solomon street is that typically they are a long way from the rear boundary and even the existing building and certainly the proposal in terms of locations of windows and the light the overlooking is um the over the window location I won't say the overlooking the window location is so compliant with the code so well within the codes um that you you could move the building you know another five six seven meters towards the rear boundary and it would still be compliant um the dilemma is uh the applicant's property has very few trees and I suspect it's unlikely that they'll put anything um significant in that area and the bellevue terrace properties had trees but the trees are no longer there um there is a responsibility and I spoke to the neighbor to the south about this that when you live on these hilltowns that you kind of have to acknowledge that people are going to want to get views acknowledge or try to come way but also to acknowledge that you have to adapt to living on a hilltown and I know I had to to do that and wanted to do that and I think it's also possible to do that in the bellevue terrace properties there are also things that the applicant can be doing on their own property that would potentially uh reduce or in fact completely remove the overlooking particularly to the properties immediately behind in bellevue terrace which are the worst affected and you know I certainly encourage the opportunity if the deferrals gets up but some of those opportunities uh be looked into because um it doesn't all have to happen back at the building the final thing I would say is that yes the building is one metre over and that should be always taken that has been a significant issue that we need to very seriously look at in fact you could apply the r codes uh and say it's 1.5 meters over and of course it's 1.5 meters over uh on the worst corner of the building uh where it basically in that context we do need to ask the applicant I think to see if there are ways of mitigating the impacts but the impacts are not from the height necessarily they're from the windows uh they're from the overshadowing and so in the context and we've done this before if we're going to ask them to change it's not really that the height is going a reduction of one meter is going to make almost any difference at all to particularly the overlooking and to some degrees the overshadowing the position of the building the way in which you detail the windows the way in which you might develop other aspects on the rest of the block the way in which you build your fences and do your landscaping all of those things are the things that are going to change whether or not um the neighbors are going to effectively get along uh with developments that um that respect each other's um need for privacy um so if there is a deferral I think that's the sort of direction that we to mean a significant change um to the floor planning of the building to the general planning of the building but it might include details it might include screens it might include um things that come out both vertically and horizontally and the like so um yeah I i guess I i wanted to speak to to not overly raise the expectation that we as a council can do very much about um the the um second story on this on this building it is consistent with so many other developments up and down solomon street including the one immediately to the north and we wouldn't have a leak to stand on if we categorically said you can't build us a second story on top of the existing single story with a with a um a basement simply because um it's got a a slope on the block we just wouldn't have a leg to stand on so we do need to you know set that bar we need to explain that to both sides as to why we might seek some minor variations thanks happy have to do that can we just wait for the officers to bring it up if you'd like to just give us a second okay council language you like to move that and I think I believe councillor sullivan was going to second is that correct correct thank you so that will take that has moved and seconded would you like to speak to it um uh no just just to reinforce the points that I do support the print the principle of the applicant um and touching on customers and said before that there is always going to be an issue with this development behind but we want to try and reduce the impact on that for the neighbours as much as we can who is there to vote then no further speeches okay all those in favor of the referral please raise your hand that's unanimous thank you uh the next item is item 12 the um mrs amendment north fremantle and I'll just remind you that there's been a couple of comments about making some minor alterations this but it is going to a bit more work on it before council if you want to um so I will move the officer's report is there a seconder councillor graham thank you any discussion council of lawrence your hand up for this one or the last one yep okay council over uh just briefly I just want to thank the staff for um putting together a pretty thorough um report on this and it is great and while I have a few things I'd like to see maybe if we can make it stronger I'll be you know working to bring that to the full council so just want to thank the staff for their work on this it was really well done any further discussion council sullivan thank you chair um I do want to comment because I and I have flagged that I think the recommendation needs to be to be strengthened and there are a couple of matters that I think perhaps need to be included in there the word that jerry mcgill used which was premature does to some degree ring very true in my in my because I think it probably is reasonable that that is zoned um urban deferred or even urban uh if the force your reserve element can be uh sorted out but the development wa land which is part of that land which is uh if you like the the blighted land that's been um railway reserves and road reserves and unresolved issue reserves um all the way through through there and it just gets wider and wider as it gets towards thailand road if we don't get a convincing final outcome out of future a fremantle study that actually describes and demonstrates how that land is going to stitch everything back together how that land is going to undo the 30 or 40 years of segregation I think was the word uh jerry uh used the creation of the archipelago he was polite enough to say separated by rivers I would probably have used the word sewers so if that land isn't sorted out then I really fear uh for the way in which the development of the private land will occur because it will effectively turn its back together so in that sense there is um a prematurity about the idea of rezoning uh this land to its final to final outcome um but of course you know none of us want to block um the development either we don't want to slow it down we want to speed it up um so there is going to need to be kind of a conversation about how we do both you know how do we make sure we get the right outcome that that stitches everything back together at the same time as not unreasonably uh slowing things down and that my friends is a very significant challenge um so on that basis I i guess the only other thing I would say very strongly and I think um as was very correctly said by by jerry mcgill that the officers have done a great job in identifying what the key issues are and particularly the force your reserve and as someone that demanded a government 20 something years ago to write the state coastal planning policy and sat on the advisory committee to make it happen the planning commission and the politicians implement the policy in the way it should be uh should be done and I'm already seeing a little bit of that um potentially creeping into this in this particular one and I reference particularly the level of erosion already at the southern end and the critical importance that having two highly functional regional beach nodes in close proximity how critical that is to uh our region um and particularly the 70 percent of the user groups who live south of the river um you're not as worried about the the user groups in in park or cottaslow because they had a plethora of alternatives but for those people who live south of the river in victon in melville and all the way east along canning highway and all the way out to hilton and beyond these are their beaches and we need to make sure that they still exist in 100 years time so um sorry I apologize that's not an easy task and it's not an easy task in an area where we're already compromised by the inability to know what's going to happen south of thailand road until such time as future of fremantle is sort of out um so um but they're the issues we need to go through them systematically and we need to get the right outcome uh that serves our community uh into the longer term well beyond our lifetime thank you for that if it's hiding you've got two hands up I don't know how you do that I don't know either um I completely endorse everything that councillor sullivan has said I mean I think it would actually be ridiculous for us to do anything other than uh move in the direction of urban deferred if we say we support the future of fremantle committee process because this is our one shot at resolving some of these really big challenging issues that you know jerry and andrew have alluded to for north fremantle the study area does include this portion of land it absolutely has to do that work and I think everyone knows that you know the the development of the portland will you know we can't on one hand say yes we want to be part of that work and then on the other hand say but we support zoning this urban right now we just can't_''_5376.48 it makes no sense so um logic sends us in that direction I don't think that the proponents should reflect that we are never going to have that conversation but until we sort out some of the connections the coastal setbacks some of those other issues about community infrastructure it's just premature so um you know I look forward to finishing the office's recommendation which was already very well done I thought thanks thank you any further discussion uh mr chair I seem to have lost my hand button on my screen so I don't know where that is but anyway can I just say a few words uh yes your video is not moving very much either so maybe you've got yeah I know I said limited bandwidth um yeah I i do sort of support all this but I think you mostly all uh know that all um urban um I don't really understand I'll be quite honest uh I don't really understand urban deferred versus urban at this stage so I know we've got two weeks to uh consider this at full council so I'll try and find out a little bit more because had a briefing the other day I never heard the terminology urban deferred from the offices or from anywhere else so it seems to have been put in part three here and uh I'm none the wiser as to what it is but I certainly don't want a lesson on it tonight troops I'm quite happy to do some research myself and um but as I said I'm a supporter of making this urban this has got a long way to go I mean it'll be mostly still going well and truly after a lot of us are left council so I think we've got to um make the most of it this is our place where we get extra uh people living in the city we get extra rates the city of primal and the greater residential area and in the whole what city-wide the um place uh so at this stage I will vote against this recommendation to our build tool until I do a little bit more research and hopefully I'll find my chat thing later on I'll leave it at that thank you any further discussion baby mindsets going to council I can't see any hands up okay your regimental vote all those in favor of sending the office report to council everyone except councillor graham um sorry council law were you were in favor yep so all in favor except for cancer graham so that's uh supported now we're back to um jocelyn street item two I think is that right yeah um item two justin street I'll move the officer's recommendation this is a a referred item with us to make changes they made some very small changes which are detailed in the report I'll move the recommendation which is for approval is there a seconder counselor graham any discussion let's give you a minute time are they all ready to vote no over you speak yeah thank you I I'm really still struggling with this one and um you know I've gone by this location multiple times in the since our this last came before this committee and the the trees that they're proposing to remove are you know umbrella trees and probably not that significant but just the um impact on the the front house from the from the back dwelling it's still um even with those minor changes I'm still thinking about the the future people that are going to be living in that front house so um I think that we could be a little bit better in this regard so I won't be supporting the officer's recommendation um at this at this point in time because I i think that they could be um just a little bit better so thank you any further discussion counselor groom um yeah I i similarly am very disappointed at the um you know very limited changes that were made I don't feel though that I the development does comply with the r codes you know is now so close um because that overshadowing has been reduced a bit even though the reduction doesn't actually achieve the outcome of getting northern solar access to those rear rooms and I guess it just harks back to my earlier comment of how not fit for purpose the r codes are any further discussion ready to move to a vote so all those in favor of the officer's recommendation so that's uh yeah so and against let's just counsel over against that correct council over against everyone purpose that's uh a decision by delegate to authority um harry street item four mixed use tourist accommodation residential there is a flagged amendment which we may get to I'll move the officer's recommendation which is for approval seconded by councillor graham any discussion now there was a amendment for shadowed anybody pursuing that councilor groom yes sorry I'm just trying to catch up and my report's frozen um so this is another proposal that I've kind of struggled with because to the streets and parks and kind of activity around it as much as I would like but I you know acknowledge that these the kind of height that we are wanting to get in the city ring we have supported similar height recently nearby on high street and um you know recognizing the proponent has gone through a fairly protracted process with our design review committee who I guess I can say that at best they gave a you know kind of level of support you can read that they still have reservations um the the thing that kind of when I was able to move beyond all of that when I read the conditions and recommendations as we've got it and kind of really looked at this um you know lack of deep planting and green space on it and the reliance on queen square for that but the way our conditions were worded kind of implied that we weren't really locking the proponent into actually doing works in that square we were saying if you want to then you'll need approval and so I our expectation is that they will invest in enhancing that space and one of the reasons for that is because there isn't that deep planning on site but that's my expectation where that investment goes and it was the basis of their initial proposal so um I did put forward an amendment and councillor sullivan post some alternative words to that could we get those up on the screen assess the staff to get that on the screen please um thank you I'm pretty sure that's all of it there's nothing off the screen would you like to speak to that counselor I'll move that first council groom and then we'll uh yeah council sullivan secondly yep okay that's moved and seconded as an amendment would you like to speak uh well I think I've spoken and introducing it um you know it's really what we want is a good integrated landscape outcome and an investment in some mature vegetation and deep planting in that process is there any further discussion not seeing any hands up no down to sullivan this is one of the ones I reckon I've seen this application four times now over the decade um and I would support what counselor groom said I don't really want to go into you know my uh my less than satisfactory desire for the building architecturally um but it is an important building and it's a very difficult it is a difficult site to develop and and uh I have previously accepted that uh and uh moved on um with with that the thing that I wanted to talk about I guess is is what the um the amendment tries to deal with um which is essentially the previous iterations it was very strongly put by um that activation of the park was really highly desirable and that we would be prepared to help in any way we could to facilitate that type of activation now frankly I would let the proponent raise the height of the building by another meter if it meant that um the rear part of the cafe could get raised by another meter but that's only one way to to effectively fairly flat part and I've got it up on google maps on my screen here um and it's got a couple of nice trees on them but it's pretty basically boring it has a swing and a sandpit in the middle that never gets used um and it could be so much better than that but to be a lot better than that it actually needs activation now I know that the applicant's proposal sort of describes it as a private cafe and I my sense is if we were to get the um if we were to get the landscape in the park right but even if it starts its life as a private cafe uh there would be an automatic uh logic to a business plan in their mind to turn that private cafe servicing the apartment needs uh the short stay needs into something that actually serviced the part and so my vision you know is very much about um how the park gets used um what sort of future playgrounds or the life that we might be able to put in you know we've got four parks there could one of them be dog exercise walking and you know those sort of things fenced in so they're the sort of things that we we need to do to queen square that actually make it work um and so I was a bit disappointed that the the idea that sort of flowed through was that the development shouldn't be allowed to do very much to the park one acknowledge that their proposal was probably somewhat privatising we need the balance we need to actually get to a point where the developer is allowed to help us develop that part but in a way that both the community the broad community get to utilize it and also the people staying in that building uh equally get to utilize it it's about a one metre crossfall across the whole park you know um it's always amazed me how architects and landscape architects in wa can't deal with topography it's like everything has to be on the flat um if we can't come up with a really changes in a subtle way that doesn't make for privatization of public space um then I'll go heave so um I support the uh amendment and and helped put some additional words in I just had one question if I may I did um uh speak to the manager today just about the need to make sure we get the wording right on this so that um the requests that we make of for contribution are seen to be precisely related to the development and that's a typical planning requirement and something that we would need to make sure we get into the recommendation or at least the reasons to ensure that it is clear that anything we ask the developer to do in a public space is genuinely related uh to the building and as councillor groom said that includes if we are asking them to do landscaping and deep root planting it's because they don't have deep root planning in their own site and that this is the way that we're dealing with that matter and allowing that to be compensated for make sure our planning approval actually makes it clear that it is their needs which have been met by doing works and asking them to pay for them uh in the public realm uh so I might just check in with the um manager as to whether she had an opportunity to to give that some thought if I could yeah can we just check with the manager please whether you're able to comment on that thank you chair yeah look I i have drafted an advice note to support that additional condition um that really does reflect what you've spoken about their counselor sullivan the key with this one is the applicant is proposing the works themselves so that's the initial first step in and I guess their thinking is that it will improve the amenity of that I guess what you call a private cafes or cafeteria for their for their hotel in effect um so they have obviously opted not to set it back from the boundary and create quite a large courtyard because of the proximity to queen's square and because they in accordance with the apartment codes um you start stacking up the the case to require the applicant pay for the works themselves and I guess the balance we need to strike and and what we have been working with the parks team on over quite a few months and the applicant is to make sure it doesn't become a privatized space so there is that balancing act as to how much they can do and and should do um but I think there can be a compromise reached they were certainly willing to do significantly more works than what they've ended up with um and we've asked them to pull it back because they were proposing walls that kind of closed off the space so I think there can be a compromise reached that that maybe increases what they're proposing there and and does look at um certain changes to help improve the immunity for both the public and for the occupants of the tourist accommodation so council sullivan if you wish to continue are you happy done I've got council languishing to speak landmark site and it's also a really good opportunity to activate queen square which we know is there's not much happening in queens square at the moment in fact in city what I get a few phone calls and emails about behaviour in queen square and I have people saying to me can you pull the park benches out of queen square to deter the anti-social behavior and that's kind of not how I really want to work in freo I don't really pulling out benches to curve any social behavior the opportunity here with this site is to connect uh the hotel and the cafe to the park and make it a space where hotel guests or locals want to have a coffee and play in the playground so if we can't achieve that with developer um it's an absolute lost opportunity for them and for us and the community and and queen square so um like council sullivan said previous designs I can recall being on council planning a few years ago there was a design put forward and that really engaged if we could get some of that back into this design through this amendment that would be great work and chloe you touched on does give me some optimism um if we can encourage them and push them out into the park I think we can actually create something that everyone can enjoy so this is a fantastic amendment and I just hope we can find um a big change with the developer on that one thanks guys I've got no other hands up is any further discussion so we're voting on the amendment can I say all those in favor of the amendment that's unanimous thank you and now do we need any any further discussion of the amended recommendation no okay all those in favor of the amended recommendation that's unanimous thank you okay the next item is 18 staples street um a very derelict heritage house which the applicants have done some excellent work on I'm very happy to move this recommendation announcer graham is second any discussion all those prepared to vote all those in favor unanimous thank you um seaview's recommendation councillor graham will second any discussion no no no discussion okay sorry I'd like to discuss sorry um sorry yep I i wonder whether we would consider a referral with advice to the applicant on what they could do to modify it because certainly we would entertain you know an alternative design that didn't dominate the front of the house so much rather than going down a refusal password pathway so I'm not sure what the appetite for that might be I'll second that if you move it would it be difficult to get the words correct tonight to get all right with that yeah well can I ask the officers just to work on that for a minute maybe do it a different item happy with that yeah because we haven't got a great deal left uh information report page 139 I just have one question on that uh just what is uh what what is the item about um 207 high street sorry if the manager there there's an item in the information report talks about 207 high street to appeal yeah thank you chair it's it was an application done under delegation for predominantly internal alterations to a heritage building the bulk of the works were supported um there was a section of fireplace original fireplace that was proposed to be removed uh and so all the works were supported across site and there's a condition um requiring that that fireplace remain and the applicants are appealing that condition so we we haven't gotten to directions hearing yet so only just been lodged thank you the office is ready so we'll need a move I'll move the officer's report the information about item 11. uh we'll do it do it at first council of graham you're happy to second so we're voting on the information report all those in favor that's unanimous now we're going back to uh item 10. let's have a look at the words on the screen um who wanted to move it was it uh move that if um I think council lying was happy to second it is that right it I guess so that we the proponents and the officers can get some sense of the you know what council might look for um very similar to the bromley consideration there you know there are no other options for um a carpool on the site but the design of the um current carport with a roof that seeks to replicate the main house roof and dominates the site and detracts from that house roof is not consistent with the outcomes we want to achieve so a well-designed virtually flat roof but well detailed would be a much better outcome for that site and proponents might have other good design people with other smart ideas for how to handle that cleven I have councillor sullivan speak thank you chair I just wanted to ask a question before we go to the referral vote of the staff as to whether or not um staff have already been through that process or this proposed process uh with the applicant um you know I guess we we all have a sense of their preparedness uh if the conversation hasn't happened we should said you know we're not interested this is how we should be doing it um then maybe I'd be less inclined to support a referral but yeah staff may know um whether that's already the case or not and I'll get a comment from the manager please thank you chair yes the conversation has occurred um there have been changes to the plan so the originally lodged proposal did show the carport and the driveway coming straight off the street rather than using the common property so it has been orientated and at that time it was raised with them the design was was overly dominant um so they have been provided with that opportunity um sometimes though it does allow the applicant if committee does refer to to take that a little bit more seriously um sometimes it doesn't so um I guess regardless if it does end up at a refusal it would end up at mediation anyway this might be an interim interim step but it really is in the hands of the applicant I don't believe anyone registered to speak story thank you any further comment on this referral okay all ready to vote all those in favor of the referral student limits thank you so now just check with the staff I think we've done everything except for the procedural motions okay item 11 motions with previous notice there are none item 12 urgent business there is none item 13 late items there are non item 14 confidential business there is none and thank you very much for your attendance and uh close the meeting at 801 come on
We got a new cat a rescue cat and she wasn't allowed to go outside and so as part of that video was Kevin also couldn't really go outside so we had to train him to be on a lead this is persistence so if we only took him outside on a lead then eventually he started to you know walk so we take him on walks every night we carry him down to the beach and he has a sniff around and walks home so yeah it's become quite a long walk and quite pleasant I guess the benefits are of course he's not eating the wildlife so I feel a bit more smug when my friends tell me they hate cats because I can say well he's not eating the wildlife Kevin's definitely safe that last cat she got run over bag hard there's a main road near us and then that was pretty sad it's more personal like we know him better because we're hanging out with him more so I really like that actually we've I've got a better relationship with him you
Good evening everyone um it's gone six o'clock so I will declare the um if paul meeting open first I'd like to acknowledge the wajak people as the traditional owners of this land and recognise their ongoing connection with fremantle or wali lap and that their cultural and heritage beliefs are still important today in terms of attendance apologies and leave of absence we have apologies from both councillor archibald and also councillor thompson any leave of absence disclosure of interest by members no response to ques previous questions there are none and so that brings us to public question time and we have one or possibly two people speaking richard and alison evan evanson everson sorry so if you just like to come to the um front is are you both talking or is it just one okay thank you and you have three minutes evening everybody I i have pre-prepared and it is three minutes um we would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk in support of the greening fremantle strategy and how it affects samson the gateway to fremantle and residents of samson we are fully supportive of the proposal and planting the verges through samson the precinct group first requested that council consider beautifying the entrance of samson in february 2019 so we'll be pretty happy to see the project get underway residents have left have felt that samson is regarded by council as the last and forgotten suburb in the junction to south street and macaum avenue has become a major cut through for traffic to winterfold rod especially since the introduction of the traffic lights and the upgrading of the road services with council now adopting the greening fremantle strategy this is the right time to make the statement for the greening for the gateway to fremantle starting at samson as part of the up and coming budget discussions we urge the council to support the greening plan and in particular the vegetation at the intersection of macomb avenue and south strait you will be aware that council data shows that samson experiences the highest temperatures of all fremantle suburbs and with expected climate change actions taken today will help address some of these increases that the works start at samson rather than being left to the end as part of the strategy planned to plant natives on both sides of the junction we would like to request that this includes a way to screen the large and imposing junction box we have seen other boxes painted to disguise them or screened with plants or fencing as samson is the gateway to fremantle we would also like the plan to include a samson neighborhood entrance sign on either side of macomb avenue we believe that the green linkage objectives in the strategy along with the beautification of the entrance will encourage people to utilize the connection corridor through to samsung park and beyond the precinct group would like to acknowledge the support of ryan abbott frank mofflin in liaising with us on this project and aligning synergies thank you excellent thank you um so that sorry that moves us on to petitions anybody have a petition no uh deputations special presentations or presentations there are none confirmation of minutes um so I move that the finance policy operation legislation committee confirmed the minutes uh dated need a seconder sorry uh councilmafilin thank you and all those in favor those yeah that's unanimous excellent uh elected member communication councilmofflin thank you and just before richard and alison leave I just wanted to say thank you to richard and allison on behalf of the um as the representatives of the samson precinct and just as some additional context to um richard's statement earlier and the group were hoping to be able to come to a full council meeting but timing didn't allow them to do so uh so thank you for taking the time to come to the f pole meeting and and I will urge other council um councillors elected members to now have a look at the live stream to understand what richard was referring to but in essence um the the group have been pursuing uh with with ryan and his team a plan to look at the the improvement of macomb macomb avenue and south street and if you do spend any time coming down south street there it is essentially a you know a piece of dirt um at fremantle and the entrance to samson and particularly the the precinct group have done a great job to understand the strategies that the city has and particularly the greening strategy and understood uh the work to develop the green corridors particularly um through sampson and making sure that this work here is linking up with that strategy so I just want to say thanks for that and um yeah really urge uh as we go through the budget process for us to consider how we um manage that potential project and the opportunities that come with it thank you and then thank you and just secondly as well um thinking as well from a local government perspective on the east coast of australia at the moment there are a lot of local governments who are bearing the brunt of uh the the floods uh the floods which are occurring um at the moment and or have occurred so really I don't I don't think there's um too much we can do as such but to express that sentiment that our thoughts are with those local governments and at the moment and the work that they're doing too that they will be doing to recover from such significant events well thank you councilman um any other elected member communication no okay then I'll move to the items committee items firstly do elected members want to call on the ones that they want to speak on so we can move the others on block so obviously the draft parking plan item seven does anybody want to speak on one two three four five or six council visit three uh yeah we're not to add that one yet but noted so five and six oh well four five and six all right okay so I'll move item one and two on block can I have a seconder all those in favor that's unanimous uh so I'll move item three which is the draft annual financial statements is there a seconder council mossman and council views that you wanted to speak on that one do that okay um I just want to outline why it's very difficult for me to be able to support um a copy to leave after I've read it out I look at the gender item 14 to 20 and I think it's it's pretty difficult to understand it and then contextualize it in in following through a lot of the the um information presented so what I'd like to just point out this evening is meeting documents I'm referring to the meeting documents now that support the agenda I'm using the page number to the right of the of the document we have a look at page 2 of 77 which refers to an independent auditor's report or the draft independent auditor's report and you know it tells you which page it should be on when you go to that page there is no report there's a blank page but there are two financial ratios on six page 67 69 now I can't find the draft independent auditors report I assume the blank page is whether the draft report should have been located the draft report is important because it provides context for the interpretation of the information contained because these these documents connect and link in with each other without the draft report I'm left to draw conclusions which may be incorrect or misleading and this is not helpful for me one can be mischievous and draw conclusions that the information perhaps is being held back for some sort of reason so I've dealt with that that little block as I have stated then I go through one I'm really like to ask a question on and then that is on page 4577 elected member remuneration the ratepayers have paid out 570 960 seven dollars for elected members remuneration for up till june 30th uh 2021. and yet when you have a look at that document it just says mere and counselors 1-16 they're not identified can I ask why why we chose to do that I'll throw to the director through the chair with regards to the auditor's report these are the draft financial statements we're still awaiting the final auditor's report which will be provided when we put it up for adoption um so that's why that question um we are just noting this information at the moment for your information we're not actually adopting it so I'll take that question on notice and come back to you with some more information on that okay thank you um we I really don't I know that they're draft annuals financial statements but if I'm going to go through these financial statements and make sense out of them I do expect to find a document that's listed in the index inside I go through and I've made another two or three other comments which I'd like some explanations and questions so I'd like to hand that up thank you okay so understanding that you're providing them on notice to be um answered in email rather than yeah okay thank you um that's very helpful just because um giving prior warning of complicated questions is useful if you want a meaningful answer on the spot so thank you uh so anything else on that item councilman offline uh yeah just briefly I supposed to um yeah I was going we're only noting that these are draft financial statements and that the order is still um to be finalized and you know that's the officer's recommendation this evening and I look forward to seeing the the auditor's report and outcome from there but to put it on the record and expressing disappointment that we are sitting in you know 9th of march um and we haven't got a completed audit report I understand you know a number of reasons behind that both on the auditor's side and you know some internal uh backwards and forwards as well and uh would like to think that you know come next uh next round for the audit that we're well prepared and we can see a finalized report if you like within the sort of six month period as much as possible before the end of the end of the year but I just want to also say thank you to staff for putting up the draft financial statements prior to the audit being completed I think it's good to provide that clarity and detail be endorsed so it gives people the opportunity to have a look at that so thanks thank you council of usage can you please turn your microphone off and also just note that we are required to wear masks when not talking so and yeah properly thank you um so if there's nothing further on that item I will move the officer's recommendation do I have a secondary so I have okay awesome thank you for debate of course uh all those in favor first opposed count the research posed uh item four self-source supply for the aboriginal arts foundation okay so yes just to explain that will go through to council because we don't have delegated authority if we don't all vote in favor tonight because a couple of people are missing so just to explain uh so item four um I'll move the officer's recommendation do I have a secondary thank you council me if uh council he said you wanted to speak to this um I just want a question is um is the sole source of supply is there any to tender refer to the man the director sorry um through the share with this is going through sole source of supply simply because there's no other supplier of this product um darwin has is the only supplier that's designed such a product that you can deliver a market online for artists does that answer your question yes it does thank you was there anything uh council of usage can you turn your microphone off was there anything further on this item uh mere fits hiding um I just wanted to acknowledge the work that the team have put into this like you know I mean there are obviously we do like to have a competitive process but I think to actually go through and identify such a specific and unique um product to meet this need in the short time frame you know so we can use the funding that we receive from the department um in a way that is appropriate in a covered environment I think you did a really great job of explaining that in the report why I would go this direction so vote all those in favor that's unanimous and I'll move um to item five which is the other sole source supplier uh I'll move that do I have a seconder council often and council of usage you wanted to speak to this more of a question being a sole source of supply particularly in the next item I would have liked more information as to why we need to only have the one source supply what is it that they provide that no one else in the 22nd in the 21st century supplies I'm always a little bit dubious when I commit ratepayers money and I have you know this is the only option we have is it because we didn't go out to see other options or um you know there is um you know we've already got relationships I just get nervous I just like so much reassurance as to why we only have the one supply sole source of supply I'll hand over to the director thank you uh through the chair so um when we implement a software solution expend significant resources to implement it the way it usually works is you enter into a contract to to deliver the software as a service over time I guess the option is when you come to the end of that contract you have to go back out to market and look at reintegrating an entire new system but once you are signed into a platform it does become the sole source of supply because it's simply just a contract renewal for that particular supplier yeah and the ceo will add something um just through the chair we're going to continue to use both of those products so we're going to continue to use ezra as our gis application software and we're going to continue to use tech 1 as our proprietary software as with all software companies there's usually only one company that will support a product at a time in this particular case both of those products are proprietary software monitored by only one organization so to continue to get support in maintaining that product we need to pretty much use the company that sole source thank you any further um anyone want to speak no I'll um put that to the vote all those in favor that's unanimous item six I'll move the officer's recommendation can I have a secondary counsellor commander and council of usa do you want to speak to this answer my question from the previous item thank you thank you so I'll put that to the boat all those in favor that's unanimous so now we go to item seven the draft parking plan principles I'll move the officer's recommendation as stated but note that there is an amendment can I have a seconder council thank you and who wants to start the conversation yep councilman all right I'll start noting that I don't know if this will be the the best foot to kick off on um if I'm going to add too much but um yeah appreciate the work that's gone into putting the the plan uh principles together I suppose I uh struggled a little bit to actually visualize what the plan principles would on the ground that might just be my own inability to to make that connection but yeah it would have been and I i suppose looking forward to the actual plan itself uh to understand that detail I you know the principles are there but for me I just couldn't make that connection to um say okay well this is what parking is going to look like in fremantle under under this plan and this is what people can experience as a difference or otherwise or not um as part of that not to say um you know I'll support this as it goes forward and look to look to see the um the plan when it when it comes comes through thank you um the director might respond thank you through you chair um council malta makes a very fair point um by way of explanation um as the report sets out this has been approached as a two-step process the officers thinking in that bringing a very comprehensive plan to council all in one go when some of the principles that guide a lot of probably not be the best way of doing it and that's why we adopted this two-stage approach but I do acknowledge it means that the principles in isolation might seem a little bit nebulous in some ways um I think the intent is that to achieve what council mostly is looking for the second stage of the process where for each of the precincts has been identified the the principles then get used to kind of shape what what the parking looks like in a particular precinct and it will be different from one precinct to another is hopefully where council muffling will get to see what he's wishing to see quite uh quite understandably and certainly we'll take that point on board and try and make sure that when the plan is fully developed for each of the precincts it does give that local contextual feel to what those principles mean on the ground in a particular area thank you and the ceo will respond also um thank you through the chair I think the the two main things coming out of these principles that probably 1.7 which talk about the 85 percent rule which is obviously how the principal approach will take to our off street parking now and also item 1.8 which talks about in a predominantly residential zone where residential parking permits are provided will try and provide the restriction on parking that allows for an ability to keep parking within a 200 meter over residence here so that at the moment we probably don't really account for that so much we sort of historically rate how we um restrict parking but this is saying that we'll try and maintain a 200 meter walking distance for residents parking so I'd have to walk too far and I think it also makes comment to the fact that an idea would be to get down to 100 metres if we could and that maybe we'll review that as part of the process as well thank you um I have a follow-up question and it does relate to the uh amendment that I have um put forward um but whether or not it's even required because just noting that the precinct aim for those objectives within these different precincts I presume that paid parking is going to be one of the um levers that will be considered in all of this so does that mean paid parking is potentially going to be looked at for these precincts as part of these principles that you've already drafted through through you say yes yes paid parking could well be one of the policy levers that would be used in particular precincts when that detailed work's done to see what's the appropriate most appropriate mechanism to use in a particular locality to to manage that kind of competing demand between different users of part of what parking facilities that are available or you know to just overall regulation of supply and demand yeah okay um I think it's it's um it's a good plan and uh but I think we we also need to note that one size fits all um we need to be careful about that particularly in south fremantle I've had a lot of feedback from residents particularly with the um increasingly more approvals for the residents and I think the the residential parking in commercial street I can well see why harbour street would want to have the same it's the same street the same congestion and I do think that we need to be also very mindful that in sacramento we're at tipping point with the small businesses coming in but also there are small businesses like the hairdressers I know last year we had an issue over parking for them to have two parking bays outside their businesses which are not timed and where you don't pay is going to affect that business so I think we need to be very mindful of the nuances as we go into the various parts of our city thank you thank you anybody else want to speak to that item uh councillor sullivan um thank you um I had a number of um matters that I thought would be relevant to raise um and I'm assuming that you know this is a city-wide parking policy it's not to the exclusion of the city center so I guess that's to set principles that apply to the city centre as well as all the other centres and other areas and on that basis I'm intrigued by the fact that the principles don't sort of talk to issues relating to the benefit of on-street parking or the benefit of off-street parking where it's located peripheral those sort of things and even talking to the sense of prioritizing other activities that might have higher priorities over the actual provision of parking so we know for example increasingly we want to give over road space more and more to pedestrians first cyclists second uh etc etc and the car increasingly is a little bit further down the list so those sort of principles that might come into play it also doesn't seem to cover well what the different levers are and why you use levers in the first place so the notion that we and it's the hardest thing to explain to any member of the public you know why do we have paid parking why do we have time parking why do we have 15 minutes and sense those things which officers kind of take for granted but are really hard to explain to members of the public kind of feel like they need to be sort of up there in principles so that when we try and sell a parking policy or modify what it's like in any particular area that we can simply refer to a set of principles that say this is why you use levers and this is why you use a different type of lever you know why do we have a half hour or 15 minute parking spot in high street and to our paid parking in the side streets for example yeah and there's reasons for it but um it's not they're not articulated um well for public digestion and even cancel the digestion um I also felt the notion um that you know 100 meters or 200 meters or 400 metres might be a reasonable distance to park your car because you can't get a park in front of your own house is is not the only measure of whether that is satisfactory to say streets between marine terrace and south terrace which might only be I think you know like 120 meters long or whatever um if you have to park around the corner in south terrace or marine terrace you go oh you know I don't I don't trust my car being left overnight in those streets so whether it's uh you know 400 meters or 100 meters sometimes it just doesn't feel right um so there are sort of measures there are there are thresholds I think that can't just be used as a single lineal measurement to say whether or not a resident feels like that's reasonable or not so I just wonder whether that couldn't be um somehow expanded because I you know if I was a south ward resident I lived in any of the side streets coming off I have a south orderism but if you live in any of the streets coming off um south terrace and you rely on on-street parking which I know I do then I would look at that and say that's just unreasonable principal um I guess I i still feel when I read it I again it just feels like this it's not answering the questions that I know that my community are constantly raising as to you know do those set of principles or guidelines give me the answers to the increasing community questions that are coming I'm not sure they actually do the other one is which is council of music rightly raised in a sense is planning has a role to play and we have previously as a council talked about uh whether or not um cash and lou should be an issue in the suburbs not necessarily the city centre or um and as planned the planners continually tell us we can't even apply it unless we have a parking strategy for a particular area and the like so those are all bodies of work that kind of feel like they they still need doing I know it's not easy but it's also a really critical area um and that's an area that community um have a lot to say rightfully uh in there in the mix and um yeah I think me if it's hurting um it just strikes me we do have committee delegation on this item but it's one that's likely to have broad appeal across the elected member body I would have thought so I'm just wondering whether we would look to vote send us through to council and if there'd be any impact if we were to do that just do think you know any feedback from the officers on that cleanse shaking okay yeah cool if you want to do that afterwards yeah yeah okay okay uh I'll speak to that if there's nobody else um wanting to speak so um I do agree that this is a really complicated one and picking up on some of what council sullivan was saying there as well I mean I think one of the really significant elements of this is a cultural shift that kind of needs to happen and you know the the story of kind of parking a car around the corner and feeling uncomfortable with that I think and you know if you were in london or um major cities in the u.s or something that's you know something that's not abnormal but it's not come something comfortable here we need that cultural shift um I've got I've I also started to think a little bit about what's lacking in these um principles mate there's no reference here to urban design and you know the kind of public amenity of the environments and how parking does and doesn't you know impact on that um and I'm just sort of thinking everything from kind of this concept of putting parking on the fringe of the cbd and then a walkable core and not encouraging cars to come in and try and find parking in certain areas and that sort of thing so um I just I had a thought about um a alternative amendment that kind of picks up on the one that I flagged but it's much more simple and it's actually about just adding some hopeful clarity to these principles as printed so my proposed amendment is to add simply add a few words at the end of that after parking precinct so that it reads parking present which may include paid parking and urban design and just making sure it's clear that those two elements are two elements that will be considered in these precinct approaches does it can I have a seconder for that thank you oh kill some often sorry no no you're right I was just going to ask a question does the inclusion of only those two aspects mean that others are excluded so I just want to make sure that we end up that we only put in two and that then means that four or five other important elements are excluded and or yeah is there the need to to put in that two two okay yeah that's a good idea um well the ceo's just suggested we could say which may include but is not limited to paid parking in urban realm yep yep or urban design because you're right I mean things like trees and canopy cover and all that kind of speak on the amendment oh council sullivan um I'll certainly flag uh that the notion of spreading paid parking even further out is is something that not only is going to create a lot of pushback I think from community um so I'm not sure that there's a well argued case um for even putting it out into community I mean if you've got a well argued case then community's going to want to see it certainly got a demand to see it but there is also a notion I've read a number of reports that actually say you actually talk about the fact that paid parking is part of the problem is actually part of a cycle that we actually have to wean ourselves off if we actually want to achieve all of the other sustainability aspects as well so and that's cool that that's a little bit counter-intuitive perhaps but um it certainly was when I first read it uh but reading through it it does sort of uh make you know some sense so it's part of that to provide huge amounts of parking or should we just actually stop doing that and provide less and not worry about it you know actually just not charge for it not worry about it maybe just have time limits but not necessarily paid parking I mean obviously that's a huge change and it would be something that could only happen over time but there are experts who are suggesting that's exactly the direction we should be going any further comment on the amendment okay I'll just um close and say I i have real agreement with the direction that council sullivan just said but I do think that that's a totally different set of principles than what we're looking at here in lots of ways um and yeah for me it's just around not necessarily um a definite introduction of paid parking in other areas but just looking at the labors and part of the labors are about like um equalizing with the cbt but also managing the demand and so on so um that is my thinking um so I'll put the item as a whole methods hiding oh um so no further comment on the the amended item council usage could we vote uh on on one and two separately uh yes absolutely thank you so um number two being the harbour roden orient street okay no problem um so I'll put uh part one all those in favor uh part two all those in favor those opposed yeah excellent all right can I move to send that to full council yeah and I'm happy to second that so we'll have another crack at it uh so I'll move on to item eight which is the bus review I will move the officer's recommendation do I have a seconder council commander and I'll open debate so I flagged in an email that I'd be looking to move an amendment to delete the reintroduction of the red cat I've put my arguments in that email so I won't labor them but my view is that it's a service that primarily serves east fremantle along a route that is quite well served by I guess feedback that we've had in not reintroducing that route suggests that it is probably not being missed as much as you know the blue cat for example um would be so my view is if you've reduced a service or removed a service and there's not a huge amount of community feedback um telling you that you desperately need to bring it back and you're in a tight budget environment and you haven't really examined and in my view we haven't really examined the broader strategy around um cap buses and what they're really sort of looking to do and the adjoining local government's got zero interest in helping fund it despite the fact that it appears to serve them equally as well if not better than that serves us there's absolutely no reason to to fund that service so I wouldn't rule out in the future a situation where we looked at maybe key destinations within fremantle I guess remembering that the cat bus was initially introduced many many many years ago as a tourism destination bus um and I wouldn't rule out in the future that we might look at that kind of service but in terms of reintroducing the red cat at this stage I don't support that so um I don't have to move that immediately if people want to talk more broadly about it but I just wanted to flag that that's the direction that I would want to go okay I i would like to respond directly to that if I may use the privilege of chair um I don't know where you're getting the impression that the redcap primarily sends uh services east fremantle residents I'd be I've not heard that at all um and I guess if you came to the freya arts center precinct meetings you would hear some of the upset at the loss of that cat bus and so on and certainly um councillor lang and I have heard numerous times and each time we go they are asking when it's coming back I'll also say that the maritime museum gets a lot of people who are and lament the loss of the cat bus I spoke to franco from the port last night when he was here as part of the chamber and I asked what the ports view was with their um strategy to activate victoria key and he said absolutely they really want that cat bus back I said you know enough to pay for it and he said that he would be very happy to work and the chamber as well would be happy to back us in approaching other parts of the state government so tourism for example or whether or not it's department of transport more generally or the ports in order to chip in towards the cost of it because I do think it actually is a really important tourism service and it does actually go to all the major destinations and certainly when I was um being a visitors center volunteer ambassador a lot of people were using we were directing a lot of people to get on the redcap bus so that they could go to places like the fremantle art center or the leisure center and think you know it's interesting this research and feedback that's come back is really useful but of course we need to remember that that's in the context of this is only research and feedback into the blue cat because there was no red cats who actually asked people and of course it was in a time of covered with borders closed and much less tourism and so on so while this information is really useful it's not comprehensive or has it doesn't have any insight into the full service that once once was so any further discussion or debate council sullivan um thank you um main reason why I came tonight um obviously we're in a position of a fair degree of challenge because you know cat buses have their place but over the last two years the principal purposes for cats that applied to fremantle have been particularly challenged obviously university students tourism um and just the general movement of people uh has certainly made you question that if you were if we if the last two years was going to be the bus probably not if you were doing it from scratch the flip side of the dilemma is we have a cat system it has been well received and well well utilized certainly the blue maybe not so the red but the difficulty of sort of scrapping it would be yes it has its place and maybe it feels like it's um belatedly premature if I can use that terminology it's premature right now to have one almost um it was appropriate before it will be again so if you scrap it do we ever get it back it's so hard to get in uh governments it seems to put in place something that's so logical um I worry about scrapping it and then not never getting it back when we really need it I had a number of questions um that sort of went to I guess not so much what was in the report but what wasn't in the report and the first one is um the special area rate conversation and I kind of like one and I i don't know whether remember but why have we looked only at a special area rate as opposed to a special area charge and by that I mean a rate is something that you rate against the grv and so it's going to vary for every household as opposed to a charge which is like the rubbish charges that some councils um impose and a lot of them just have a fixed rate per household I know certainly over rest that's almost standard so I wondered why the conversation was it just felt like it was so overly complicated instead of saying ah you just do a special area charge for all those places that are roughly within 400 meters and it's you know based on the current calculation it's it's uh 65 percent of 56 um of the total cost 243 000 a year is what you need to raise um from that so it's 35 per household why can't it be as simple as that and so the question that follows from that is is that actually something that we are allowed to do as something we can do under the act as well as a special area right my sense is it should be but if it's not then that answers that question um I'll do all of the conversation and then ask for some response um I also and it's picking up what you um said um council pemberton that you know we keep going to the pta and going and the pta keep coming back and saying well no one else gets more than um uh you know a third or forty percent or whatever uh why are you special well that's just using a different lens everybody else gets um no one else is paying more than one-third of the cost of the cap bus no other local government is paying more than one-third of the cost of a cap bus as far as I understand so I would like the the starting point of negotiation to be first of all focused on the whole of government not just pta and second of all setting a threshold of saying we're not prepared to pay more than standard and it does seem pretty reasonable so I don't have words to change the recommendation but I certainly flagged that that's where we should be heading and I wanted to sort of see see whether there was officer feedback and whether in fact that's something that they could draft for full council the other thing I wanted to say is that and I said it in my email is that we we probably do need to recognize that the sort of I guess the the transport thinking hiatus that we're in right now shouldn't stop us from imagining and actually advocating for the fact that cat buses into the future are going to be really really important and even if we get um rapid transit um in the corridors that we've been asking for such as to the south and to the east all that's really going to do is pretty much mean the blue cat doesn't need to be there but what it's not going to do is connect us to a bunch of other really important nodes and bridge gets redeveloped and we get a hopefully an amazing east street for sure that's connected to cantonment hill how do we connect into the heart of beaconsfield and the knutsford street area none of those areas are well served or well connected or well interconnected by public transport so if you want to go from one to the next um you'd be you'd be struggling um and yet all of those things um victoria key the maritime museum um the hospital the prison you know they all are areas that probably ought to be interconnected by a cat bus system so we we should be going to government saying we want to keep the principle of the cats working but we also envisage a future version of cats which will be probably even more important to the future of fremantle than the cats have been in the past and I just wonder whether that's a conversation that we should be you know knowing how hard it is to get traction on any of these issues we should be including that in our transport um strategies I know we're not getting very far we're going backwards still on that but we should also include the fact that the cat bus in the right locations will be an integral part of our transport planning going forward so with all those comments I'll give it back to you thank you and in terms of answering some of the questions that council of fatherhood had uh yeah I'll head to the director uh I'll make a start chair or we need to look to the acting ceo or acting director of city business to answer the one about the difference between a special area rate and special area of charge um so council sullivan's first part of that question was why do we explore a special area of rate um just a reminder that this report is responding to um further further work that the council asked to be done when this was presented almost exactly 12 months ago so the frame for the content of this report is very much set by by that previous direction previous resolution of council that that of especially error rate maybe except maybe as officers we interpreted that too literally um but that for better or worse that's the reason we focused on especially rating reporting back on this report um I'll perhaps let my colleagues sort of answer the question about charge if uh action cos looks like he knows the answer to that one through the chair I'm looking furiously through the act to try and find where it says it exactly but a service charge is what you're referring to there are only four or five things that we can charge a service charge for and it's things like television re-transmission bushfire a couple of those sorts of underground power yeah so we can't actually charge a service charge generally or make something up it's actually prescribed all right useful uh council usage um look I i concur with councillor sullivan he's put up a good case um I could not support a reduction of a vital community service I'm very optimistic that tourism is going to come back uh we've got a fremantle area um I think we're going to see things are going to get busier I'm an optimist I think anything short of that full service I couldn't support because there are community people who are giving feedback that the 20 minute wait is not is not conducive to the school children so I'm always being a fan of the full service I think we do have a challenge of finding how we're going to pay for it I'm not inconsiderate on that issue but I think that's a separate issue if we can't raise money through the local government act then we need to be creative in some other ways um and concentrate on on finding ways of retaining our basic services I think even last night counselor sullivan I'm sorry I'm sort of referring to you tonight I didn't mean to but he does say when we are doing problem solving that we often get stuck onto one particular problem and we we miss out plan b and plan c and plan d which ought to be don't have a lag period where we are looking at other other ways of solving a problem so I think this this problem fits into that I would much rather that our energy goes into seeing how we can raise that money rather than reducing this vital service thank you councillor thank you councillor pemberton um yeah I just wanted to briefly express that I also support the officer's recommendation I believe that it is something that's very useful to the community and obviously in the longer term when we do get our tourists back and everything's up and running again it'd be really sad if we've this structure that we've got in place that if we threw it away now basically throwing the baby away the bath water I suppose and it is something that we can build on into the future that southern corridor is really important and I believe that eventually it will be replaced by by something that um reaches even further south and will be so crucial to to the growth of fremantle and and vibrance um I read my own notes uh yeah yeah and basically my final point was yeah I agree that we we should be looking to get a better deal uh along that one third principle and if we if there's something that this guy if this goes to full council and you know it gives us time to to work out um you know a strategy that will get us towards that point thank you councillor mofflin thank you um yeah I suppose just to start wanted to thank staff for the work that they've done in what is yeah an ongoing difficult discussion and conversation and looking back at the resolution uh from 2021 or you know pretty much 12 months ago on council um that we maybe didn't give staff the best opportunity to do the um to provide that outcome that we were seeking through this review and in particular when we look at those strategic objectives which are listed um they looked more like a bunch a shopping list of things that we would like to see the cat achieve rather than being really clear and it kind of strikes me as well that you know maybe going back to that conversation around the the parking aspect is that the cats most probably have different services in different areas and different objectives to to what they're they're seeking to to service and um you know even thinking about the the south fremantle or the south terrace run that that equally is serviced by reasonable uh public transport existing public transport services um so I'd be kind of reluctant to say that we would get rid of the the east frio run and maintain the southern one and be carrying a reasonable burden of cost associated with that when there are public transport services there and I think we had the discussion previously that if we did pull the cap from there would transperth look at changing their routes and service times to pick up some of the slack so to go back to yeah I suppose the point before is if maybe we're a bit sharper on the objectives then it may have helped the conversations that staff were um were and I like the notion that councillor sullivan has put forward in regards to saying yeah 33 is the part is the the line that we want to start with and align ourselves with others and it may not be the public transport authority that is stumping up the rest of the the funding but who else in uh government or other funding bodies would be uh keen to come on board um as part of as part of that um yeah I suppose yeah maybe if we're just to to go to that point as well around the longer term strategic element what I'll I know in here that we talk to this being for the agreement that we're looking to have is no no less than five years and what I would really like to be able to see is that what we're pushing for is those other strategic transport elements whether it's the trackless trams or others and be having those conversations to um to talk about transport holistically and and do that in parallel with um maintaining the cat service which to make sure that we're really clear with those people that were speaking about um how we how we could look at additional funding but yeah acknowledge that the challenges that that existed with the objectives that we set so may fitzhunting are you moving your amendment no I'm not because I think what I've noticed is I'm in informing what I'm thinking about with this referring heavily to the cat review that was done in 2021 january 2021 and I've noticed it's probably not in the additional documents or anywhere in this item for elected members and given that a number of our elected members weren't on council in january 2021 I suspect in order for us to have this debate properly it's going to be really useful for that to be one of the documents that's there for reference because it does give forwarding numbers it gives existing pta routes and and all the mapping 400 meters from each you know street basically who served and who's not and I think it's really hard probably to suggestion is that that for full council has that review and even the opportunity for people to come and have a briefing or a discussion on it prior to full council if they were to want it because I mean a lot of there is a lot of data what's in this report is some data that's very specific to a very non-representative time and it means that we're not really considering the full full set of information okay so no I'm not going to move in take that on board without an amendment all right um so I have flagged an amendment and I'm kind of into minds about it um I do I do note that I've mentioned the special area rate but I would agree that you know I'm not wedded to that as a concept unless that's the only mechanism possible and I do think that maybe it might change between now and council but maybe to give council some kind of direction of where the committee is going with this I will move my amendment do I going rehashing what's in there um I guess it is just about recognizing that both of the cats the red and blue do service the local community a lot um and that it does make sense for that community to contribute a little extra to the um to the running cost and I note that the amount referenced in the report was just nine dollars per household and I thought that's a bargain um and I don't think it's a amount an amount that people would complain too much about um also the paid parking on marine terrace and ord street we've talked about that for some time in relation to a number of different aspects but I do think it makes sense to potentially link it to the cat bus service because you know the cat bus is a beneficiary to the people who choose to park in those locations so therefore they are actually contributing to it and I guess particularly those people who are coming from outside of the fremantle city area i.e they don't pay any rates um at least of the cat bus that they are using um while the advertising on board is you know a little bit uncertain at this stage I do also think based on my conversation last night with franco at the port um there's a fourth element there that is um about approaching other sectors of state government to contribute towards the cost whether or not we get to the third third third I don't know but to start a conversation and to work collaboratively with some of the local businesses the chamber of commerce and so on to be putting the case as to why we should get some tourism funding to be able to run the cat particularly the redcap perhaps but yeah that should also be an element which I might find a way to work in for full council um any comments on the amendment councilmofflin sorry yeah just question in regards to the nine dollars um was that just for one cat like I thought the other was yeah 20 yeah that's what I thought yeah yeah okay is it just that question that question as well about the additional element to this in regards to other funding streams from state government and yeah we we went and or sorry staff went and had those conversations with other local governments and the like about funding and um yeah we didn't didn't pick that up earlier um that it should be more so some of those state government elements and be getting third party advocacy as well to support us in this regard so I'd be supportive of having an additional element around um yeah other state government entities or similar yeah yeah absolutely do we want to add on the fly because this is um it's part d which is um I don't know I don't know how it would be worded I don't know whether it's worth doing on the run at the moment but adding a d that says um lobby state government departments such as tourism and or should we just come back to it with a cleaner one at council yeah okay um methods hiding I guess one of the things that I things is that you know the usage from the data that was collected in the covered downtime um shows it's about 50 percent local people using that service for the blue service particularly when we did the review in january 2021 we looked at the fair paying paying option and because there is a high proportion of people who are using the service to get to public transport I'm just wondering whether we want to put that on the list again too so it is you know it's a two section or whatever fare but if you're catching the train to perth which we know a lot of people do they're paying that anyway as soon as they get on the train um so and from the report in 2021 that said well that would basically cover the cost of the service so pta at the time weren't super keen on that but I mean that sounds like more of a leverage point than going off to tourism who you know have no interest in funding buses that you know it sounds high broad service because they already have two cat services the one in at uwa and the one I think in joondalup that are fair paying cat services um so and I think the other thing I'd note with that is the evolution of how you pay for public transport where you know you used to need cash or a smart rider I think they're very quickly moving to a system where they sure as heck don't want your cash um and that tourists will be more able to pay by an f type arrangement so it doesn't become such a prohibitive issue when tourism comes back so I'd be more interested in a d that said you know um fair paying yeah uh anybody further want to speak because otherwise I'll be closing sorry can I just have a question because yeah just in regards to that fee paying element um can you clarify can the director clarify in regards to that and if my memory was correct pta's reluctance was around the cost of it putting in the infrastructure was it or yeah giles who's done a lot of the the grunt work on this review to help me out in a minute um I think in short yes that's my recollection it was um because obviously once you introduce a fair the payment methods you need the payment infrastructure installed on all the buses to deal with that my recollection is that was a major part of concern but perhaps I'll just ask mr giles to confirm that this is my first time using the microphone apologies um yeah without discussions with the pta they the officers um opinion was because the city centre of fremantle was well um well served by existing bus services that a fee paying introduction on two cat services would be an additional fee um fee service to the city centre um and they would see the funds from that would they would rather spend in an area which did not have any bus services um the joondalup cat is actually still a subsidised cap but that's still the third third third with um pta city of juneau and ecu paying that apologies rockingham's feet the uwa cat slivy station to uwa all right um I i think that that's probably um another element with um including in an amendment for council because noting that the way I've worded this and quite deliberately is as part of the budget process we look at implementing the following so it's not saying we are doing it it's about let's investigate this further let's like we do want to pursue these things because the report as it was written was indicating that these things were off the table and I'm suggesting that maybe the council has an appetite to have these things on the table so uh I've moved and we've got a seconder so I'll put the uh amendment all those in favor slowly slowly you know unanimous we got there thank you very much um as the item as amended any further comment no I'll put that all those in favor those opposed count the usage posed all right so um yeah this is going to cancel so we will have a little bit more between now and then and and also get that additional report thank you uh so the other if items that that are council decisions do people want to speak on each of those or can we move things on block any items people want to speak to the venue support dedicated setbacks or the tender on port beach perry street yep 10. all right so I'll move 9 and 11 on block can I have a seconder if it's hiding all those in favor are unanimous all right and I'll move item 10. do I have a second seconder councilman offline thank you and council sullivan um thank you I just was really I looked through the report and I i couldn't understand why we weren't talking about the rest of the footpath in front of the old energy museum it doesn't really get covered in the report and yet if I look at that footpath which is to almost everybody's understanding is a public place but even the bike on-road bike lane is partly in private land in that saga it really worries me um as to why that's not even being discussed in the report if there's a logical reason if it's because well it would cost us you know three hundred thousand dollars to get that piece of land or whatever then fair enough but I'd still expect it to be in the report or a confidential report because it's just kind of like the elephant in the room is huge you know so I guess I'm asking why isn't the rest of that footpath um identified and and I had a number of questions as to you know that the bit of land has been sold by the state government and we didn't get an opportunity to get the footpath as a public reserve it's been redeveloped and we didn't get an opportunity to get the footpath it's been subdivided it's now two blocks when it used to be one and we didn't get an opportunity to get the footpath so there seems to have been a whole number of threshold changes and left regretting something further down the track if a particular owner grabs that site and says that's my land do officers want to respond at all I'll hand to the acting mayor I'm sorry ceo um through the chair the at the moment these are the only properties we have control over which is why we're taking action on them the property that you referred to is privately owned at the moment and we are just taking some advice on how we might approach that do we do we actually own that little truncation is that so the bit of land that's the tiny little bit that's right up that sort of um far end um it's either owned or publicly dedicated and we're making it into a road reserve okay is there any further comment no and maybe we can get a little a bit of additional information for when that comes to council perhaps if necessary okay I'll put the officer's recommendation all those in favor that's unanimous they are all the items therefore there's no no urgent business there's no late items and there's no confidential business so I will declare the meeting closed whoo
I live in South Durham Angela and the beach down there when I first moved in was was quite frankly you I don't think I swam in it for the first 10 years it was just terrible and then you go down there now and you think you are in a resort last summer I was down there it was one of those lovely evenings when the Seabreeze had died out early it was hot there was a market down there the place was filled there were people walking tight ropes it was music everywhere and I suddenly said to myself man this is just like the Summer of Love and the seventies no it was such a vibe and then bathers Beach you know what city has got a little jewel of a beach right buried in the middle of it you know it's sensational and that was quite frankly until only seven or eight years ago was a largely abandoned space and now you go down there at any time and there's backpackers you know enjoying it and thinking my god I learned shangri-la here you
That we wanted to not detract from the house and we wanted to integrate with the garden and that's what I think the architects plants have achieved I've brought along a couple of photos today which will be circulated later to show you the street view of our house from the corner where we're proposing to build the studio as you'll see there is no street view of the house from that corner at the moment there's a 30 meter street frontage along amherst street and the street view of the house is on the northern half of that boundary the proposed studio won't be seen from that part of the boundary the studio will also be set below the road level so our garden is about one to one and a half metres below the road level which allows us to retain into that little bank that we have and build a studio that will be about the same height as the fence so there'll be very minimal impact from the outside it's also set on high street so we're noise barrier as well the other option that the planning officer previous planning officer put to us was to put the studio in front of our house on the northern boundary we're not keen to do that because we've got a hundred year old fig tree that sits in that location and we would rather not remove the fig tree um yes so so in short I think brennan council says ben came out and looked at the site and I really appreciate that and hope that they can also add to the discussion when the time comes about you know the impacts on the site in the garden so we really sought to minimise the impact while getting extra space for the family thank you now you can either watch on the live stream at home or you can contact the officers tomorrow to to find the result right thank you uh is anyone else like to do the same before we move on if you'd like to make your presentation now and then leave rather than wait for your item to come up on the circumstances all right so um petitions there are non reputations there are non-special deputations going on presentations uh elected members non uh confirmation of the minutes I'll move except the minutes of the planning committee meeting the second of february 2022. I'll move that way as a seconder council groom all those in favor that's carried thank you elected member communication uh I'd just like to point out that it's philly to roddick's last meeting tonight and uh thank her for her service to the city uh phillip is moving to a a new job at university of western australia and on behalf of the planning committee for all the work you've done I thank you for that and wish you well in the future any other elected member communication reports and recommendations so we move into the agenda item one is a deferred item demolition rack street um I will move the office well the um I'm sorry so do you wish to speak in any particular order I've got john meredith I'm sorry where's it going there thought you were right right so it's uh so it's um sorry I thought there were people here for that so uh so we're on to item three henderson street there are three people to speak do you wish to speak in any particular order I've got john meredith first you have three minutes you'll need to be fairly close to the microphone thank you uh good evening thanks for the opportunity to speak tonight on this application I'll stick to my three minutes I speak in favour of the office's recommendation however I'm seeking a variation to condition four relating to the time frame to construct the art war I'm the ceo of five eight the owner of the spicers site since 2018 to be clear from the outset our unwavering vision for the spicer site is to deliver a landmark boutique hotel project along with vibrant new food and beverage offerings to support the ongoing transformation of this important part of fremantle public art and working with local artists will be a key part of that project vision covert but it has driven us to reassess and challenge our design scheme to reflect post pandemic traveller needs we're confident our design scheme will deliver upon the vision and we intend to progress that d.a for your consideration in the coming months tonight's application seeks demolition of the existing warehouse and careful deconstruction of the heritage wall that adjoins this warehouse this is the first important step towards this development given our existing car park is often at capacity we saw a temporary conversion of the warehouse land to public parking as a positive and logical outcome for the precinct the demolition raises two logical questions which I'll address uh the first is the well-regarded public art mural of the numbat by belgian street artist roma this art was engaged by the city in 2011 when they owned the car park however it's important to note that even at that time it was envisaged the site would likely be redeveloped in the future and that that war would be demolished at some point in the future 5 8 has been engaging with rower in recent months ephemeral that is something that doesn't last forever as a result we are committed to instead exploring ways to reinterpret the number within our future redevelopment of the site the second question relates to the heritage wall structural and heritage advice indicates the heritage wall does not have the integrity to stand by itself if the warehouse is demolished under our redevelopment our proposed approach is to carefully deconstruct that heritage wall and utilize the limestone and other artifacts we discover to re-incorporate into an artistic gabian wall and that's to frame a new land laneway between henderson street and paddy troy mall for those not familiar with the term gabion walls involve placing rocks and artifacts within a steel cage that presents both a structural and an artistic wall outcome the officer's recommendation is for construction of this art war within six months of demolition however this is not practical our hotel development scheme includes excavation of a basement and therefore if constructed prior the art wall would likely be damaged or severely compromised when we start excavation of that basement in the future we fully that condition 4 be amended to 18 to 24 months to align with future construction of the hotel and basement thank the planning committee and elected members for their time there are two other people from the applicant present who are not speaking but they're available to answer questions any questions from members of the committee council thanks and thanks for coming in this evening just had one one question um has any consideration being given to leasing the building out rather than demolishing it for other uses between now and construction yeah and the other question that I had was you may have mentioned it when do you plan to recommend to lodge the da for the hotel okay thank you any further questions of the applicant council over um yeah I believe it was one of my first meetings where we voted to extend the da application for this site and excited about the development thanks for coming down I just wonder is there um any issue if we extended the application why is there a rush to dismantle this building and the wall right now da and how it's going to be used uh sort of leading on from those uh comments from the other councillors best case scenario with the da for the development of the hotel when would you see work starting on site um to start construction any further questions from the committee I will now go into committee I'll move the officer's recommendation is there a seconder council lang any debate thank you um the first point I'd like to make is home support in support of the minor amendment suggested by the applicant to extend the uh period from six months to 18 months 18 months I'm in support of that and um for background I've been quite involved in this site and this project um with the original architect space agency from I think some of their work may have carried over to the other architects that were involved and a number of workshops with some of the team from mindaroo when it was and patty troy other owners in paddy's royal mall and through those workshops this laneway connection through patty so I understand that may be coming through in some of the future developments um I guess I in foreshadowing a possible deferral on this um I am broadly in support of what's being proposed but I personally would like to see more detail in context of the design of the laneway and it's around the demolition of the wall I want to make sure before I say yes to demolition I know exactly what the design of the the new old wall looks like so I can be comfortable authorizing demolition and if that if we have to hold up I will defer it to the next planning meeting which is um a month away that may allow time for the da to be lodged and for us to to cite the plans and understand is because to go through the design advice committee and it probably ends up going to jada but um personally if we could defer this to the next meeting I'll be far more comfortable in giving the green light to demolition if I can see the context of this this reconstructed design so just foreshadowing that possible deferral um and if I can move the minor amendment or someone else like to move the minor amendment perhaps would you like to move the minority first we can deal with that that's simply to change the six months requirement at 18 months is there a second for that I saw some advice from officers about the best way to do this because I think there is the 18 months factor but I mean I know we can't link a demolition approval to the approval of the da but I did seek advice from officers as to how we might be able to link this to works occurring on site so um we can certainly make this minor amendment to 18 months but there are some additional words that the officers prepared that perhaps we can uh look at adding into that and maybe if we can put them up here you as a mover might consider those words so really what we were trying to say was um well perhaps I might go to um director to to talk through without linking the show knowing that that's not a valid planning thank you through your chair um yes as mayor said uh the intent of this wording which I think is essentially is also doing what the applicants have requested in that it's primarily extending the time frame for um construction of the the artwork reconstructed wall to 18 months um the bit the mayor has touched on is that um whilst it's not not appropriate to to kind of intrinsically link to completely separate and stand-alone development applications the the intent behind this was to try to ensure that if a if the upcoming development application for the hotel proceeds successfully and is approved and there's an opportunity for the development the developers to act on that approve all slightly more quickly that wording of the alternative of upon completion of below ground level works and the reasoning for that is we understand that the hotel proposal does include a basement and and the applicants have quite recently pointed out that it would be difficult to construct the basement if the art wall was already there is an opportunity to complete those below ground level works as a sort of the first stage of the overall hotel development once works have gone up to ground level and proceeding above if that happened in a period sooner than 18 months this would provide an opportunity for the the art installation to proceed a little more quickly I'll just check that the mover and secondary happy with that amendment okay so that is moved and seconded any discussion on the amendment okay I'll move the amendment all this in favor that's unanimous and so that becomes the amendment part of the motion uh so the recommendation now is for approval with that amendment and there's any further discussion sorry councillor sullivan um yeah look this has similarities to the backstreet issue for me um mainly because I think it's quite clear that the limestone wall has cultural significance and we're approving demolition and I'm not that confident we technically should be doing that what we're really saying is yes it has significance and no we're not approving demolition in another form which I support um because I think it would be very difficult and almost it's its significance would be lost anyway if it was just somehow incorporated inside a building with no reference to its past so in in this way the interpretation approach probably provides a much greater opportunity to not only interpret the wall but to interpret all of the spices site and everything that it that it was so to me it's a it's a it's a conservation strategy for the site but it's worded there's a demolition approval so I um I wouldn't mind asking the question is is this not actually you know in a sense um the wrong way to deal with it legally um is you know given that we know our scheme does not allow us to approve demolition um if uh if something has uh cultural significance at least some cultural significance and this has more than just some so that I guess I asked that question first and uh might reserve my right to speaking that's the manager to did grapple with and and the I guess initial position was to retain the wall and ideally that would be the best case scenario the applicant has put forward this option of dismantling the wall and retaining all the materials and essentially rebuilding it look it is isn't as clear-cut as it's just full full demolition and there are a lengthy set of conditions that talk about the way this wall is to be treated and re-prepared and I guess that's why the time frame is quite important for us in making sure that it is tied to the site and retained the level of significance of this wall is in this in the scheme of things not high um it is on the lower end of the scale and if it was of a high level of significance then the recommendation would be for refusal thank you any further comments counselor sullivan yeah look and that's that's sort of my dilemma is because the report um talks about you know what the threshold tests are but then doesn't really say whether it meets demolition it's kind of like left open that it has little or no significance and in doing that it one I think diminishes the value of the wall it basically says it's not of sufficient heritage to warrant retention at all and then potentially weakens the argument somewhere down the track uh if we end up having a an argument uh about the reinstatement um and so I just sort of it only really occurred to me today that that that sort of connection between what the scheme says and how we need to deal with it in a legalistic sense might be connected I might be completely wrong it might be that that um we're not approving in a sense even though we're not stating it but we're not approving demolition we're approving a type of conservation um but I'm just not absolutely clear that that's what our says um and yeah I'm a bit nervous about that because I don't know what then our legal strength is in making sure that it is actually delivered as a conservation it could just be considered an art project and not you know something that's sort of almost voluntary rather than um yeah I'll ask the director to reply through chair um I mean I think our viewers officers as the manager has said is whilst the report doesn't explicitly use the terms non-limited some or high in our view it's in the limited range and in that context there's not in obvious offices there isn't an absolute right legal impediment in terms of the way the scheme clause is worded that would um preclude this being assessed as a demolition proposal I mean obviously that level of significance as committee members know well is a matter of judgment and you know the judgment can can differ um as indeed it has on another item on this agenda which as to you know whether others agree with without assessment of the level of significance but but our view is the there isn't a clear legal barrier that would prevent the application being being approved because of the wording of the scheme clause council groom more sense to us if the approval wording was demolition of existing building conservation of heritage wall brackets dismantled etc and go on with the change of view so it is to councillor sullivan's point that we're not a pre proving demolition in the sense of that word but we are approving conservation management that involves demolition and reuse I'll just ask if the title is part of the recommendation and if it can be amended yes that's a simple change that we can add in the is that amendment the committee needs to make or can the officers do that do we need to move that way are you happy with it so the actual resolution on page 49 is what will be the recommendation to council do you think it's necessary to change the title of the item or happy with that sorry it's the accountant it's a committee decision correct yeah would you happier did we just change the title uh I don't know which title you're referring to I was suggesting um that after reprove it says heritage management of heritage or conservation management of heritage wall so adding three words yeah after the comma and before heritage wall just check the officers have that and you move that as an amendment I will is it a seconder the mayor is there any further discussion on that council sullivan yeah so just to check I mean that some applications come in as pure demolition applications some applications come in as demolition and planning applications I'm not sure if there is a clear distinction in a sense but as long as it's clear that it was a demolition application for the bulk of the building and a planning application to do something with the heritage component of the building then I think that is satisfactory and that actually does make it different to a pure demolition application so I guess I'm just a little bit surprised that previous proposals for this site absolutely identified this wall as being required to be conserved so presumably previous I guess assessments inside the city had been that the the wall needed to be retained so um it was articulation of what level of cultural significance staff considered the wall to have and that leaves it ambiguous so any further discussion so the amendment is moved and seconded can I see all those in favor carried unanimously so back to the motion with two amendments any further discussion council lang I did um flag earlier on that I had a deferral drafted for it um personally I would really like to see more detail on this new reconstructed wall and that I assume would probably come in with the da and if that is to be lodged shortly as we understand if this was deferred to the next appropriate planning meeting so we could see what what we're going to get in exchange for the reconstruction I think I see this would sit a lot more comfortably with me so that's so there is a referral motion on the screen are you formally moving that yeah let's move by council language is there a seconder council law any discussion on the referral yeah it's harding can I just get a comment from officers in terms potential impact on timelines and time frames for this project moving ahead that's possibly a question for the applicants ultimately the way we sit at the moment is the jade up is technically lodged but on the request of the applicant was put on hold immediately I think it was to do with the conditions of deed and having to get their application in so at this point in time it is still on hold but the applicants are have advised that new plans are imminent so it could be any any day now um ultimately it would it would just hold up the approval um so if it was referred um then obviously that just takes extra time so yeah okay any further comment up so if you're having a question um I mean I i guess I'm slightly concerned I really wouldn't want to see this slow down because I think it is a bit of a um you know it's a very prominent sight and I think the sooner we get something on it the better um I'm personally quite happy application on the agenda tonight that we get an application for demolition that speaks very clearly to how the heritage elements are going to be dealt with um and you know has detailed planning around that that we can actually understand whereas you know and I completely understand with the construction time frames why um and and the desire to do something significant on that site why the wall a can't_''_1778.72 be retained and b um will need to be stored effectively before it can become a gabian wall so you know I i know we're taking it on trust and saying you know we think that this genuinely is moving ahead right now but I won't be supporting a referral for that reason I just I don't think it's necessary council groom yeah I'd like to clarify because I understood that the first of the two amendments that were moved would have the same effect as this referral because it requires that we see the detailed design before a demolition permit is issued is that the amendment that was made my understanding of intention of this wouldn't delay any hotel construction it would merely only delay the operation of a car park that was that was the main point and the question is the point that council groom just made that before the issue of a da would would that come back again to planning committee would we have an opportunity to cite the details of the wall again and vote vote on this so the details of the wall should come in with the jdap plans so that will obviously come through committee and be subject to quite extensive consultation um it won't_''_1871.519 I don't think the intention for the applicants is to provide it as part of this da it will of course need to come in as part of condition clearance before they start work on site so the way the potential approval operates now is that those details coming in with the new da plans can kind of happen after the approval but if it's if it is deferred then they may well be able to provide it with that sort of a yeah timing jade up moving forward council lover um yeah I'm supportive of the amendments that passed and also the referral and we we've been asked to delay this once on behalf of the applicant and I don't really see whether there's a public car park there this month or next month as being a big deal but once that wall is gone it's gone forever and so having a little more detail before us before we make a final decision I think is very important um so I'll be voting to support the referral because I believe it's the right thing to do any further discussion uh council sullivan yeah on the referral I won't support it um my sense of it is if you're confident that a a gabian wall reinterpretation of the heritage is is acceptable from a heritage point of view the detail of that I'm more than happy to leave to our experienced officers to handle because um you know it's the detail that they would be dealing with every day and that's pretty normal you're getting a sense of what somebody is trying to do but the the final detail is always that which gets signed off by the officers um to make sure it's consistent so I'm sure if the officers felt that it wasn't actually achieving a level of interpretation that was indicated and warranted um then they would probably uh bring it to our attention and the process would um would require a change so I don't I don't really see um the difference I have to say and yeah it's like um having that trust when you say uh the final details of a of a big building uh subject to signing off at the dac uh in terms of its materiality I mean I i don't need to see every last detail and it wouldn't be really appropriate because I don't think we as a committee would have that level of expertise anyway any further discussion yeah just closing that item um so if you're going to close I want to speak so okay I think there is would be shown plans that haven't_''_2060.159 been approved yet or assessed yet so it'd be shown the wall in the context of a plan which may subsequently change after we've approved the demolition of the wall so I think if the referral allowed us to see a timeline where we saw the wall in the full context of an approved plan that would make some sense but I think uh it doesn't actually achieve very much because we are still acting on good faith that the plans are submitted with the wall shown will be the plans that are built and not changed so I i don't support the referral close thanks doesn't seem very popular um clearly um yeah for me for my peace of mind um I just I did want to see more detail I'm not against the demolition on the wall and I'm in full support of what has been proposed on the site I just wanted to see some more detail on how it's going to be interpreted so that's me on the referral which on the referral all those in favor that's uh counselors lang and what lover on those against so we'll now move to the recommendation as amended is there any further discussion move to a vote all this in favor of the recommendation as amended thank you that's unanimous next item is item 16 joslin street mr morris is it yeah um you have three minutes starting now and uh that's you'd like to go to the microphone sorry are there any questions to the applicant no sorry thank you so this is uh 16 jason street um uh renovation of the existing dwelling and the addition of a second group dwelling um I'll move the officer's recommendation which is for approval is there a second before you do that sorry I wouldn't mind asking a question okay so sorry would you like to come back to the microphone um yeah thanks um there's a question being raised about where the second story component of the rear dwelling is and I'm as to whether it could be moved in terms of to I mean I had a quick look at it and I was assuming that the upper story was designed based on you know requirements for setbacks from side boundaries and rear boundaries so that you could actually have decent windows in it could you explain the philosophy of the the um the upper story and why it's sort of in the middle of the site and why it's quite close to the existing dwelling um yeah so there's a question that's going to be raised about um overshadowing of the existing dwelling um it I just wondered if um there was any other way of building the second story so it wasn't overshadowing the existing dwelling but also what the consequences of moving that bulk of the second story to another part of the site might be any further questions replicant thank you so I'll move the officer's recommendation which is for approval is there a seconder sullivan would you like to speak um yes so I do support this and I know that um it's been flagged that you know it but I and I had a very close look at that and wondered myself whether it could actually be repositioned the second story could be repositioned on site to improve the solar access to the old house while also being trying to deal with all of the issues that you have with your side neighbors and your rear neighbors and then issues of your liveability in your in your own house in terms of having decent sized windows rather than just highlights in every room and I very quickly came to the conclusion that um essentially the upper floor was designed um based on you know six meter setbacks to the rear and to the side so you can have decent windows and particularly on the north side that's really important I also looked at the way that what would be achieved by rearranging the upper floor so that it didn't cause an overshadowing and what I kind of concluded well actually the single story parapet probably causes as much um loss of direct sunlight uh to uh windows set about a meter away from the from further away so that even if the upper floor was sort of moved around the site it wouldn't it wouldn't necessarily result in improved solar access to the existing existing cottage so I kind of felt that you know with reasonable consideration that it was such a good proposal compared to where we were um that um that it was something I would be prepared to support without changing it so thank you council groom uh yeah so agreed that um part of the problem is that the fence and the parapet wall is right on you know a meter or something away from the existing residents however you know the r codes does require us not simply to look at the percent of the lot that is overshadowed but to look at the daylight access and the amenity of a dwelling and whilst our officers have assessed this scheme as though the front dwelling is part of the one property its future uses for someone else and this development completely denies the solar access and daylight access to the entire northern wall of the existing property whilst a complaint I come up with a lot when we're looking at these schemes it seems incredibly unjust to me so I did look at what could be done to reduce that impact and also looked at the fact that we are being asked to consider extra height in my view that extra height does make the rebuilding more visible from the street and the fact that it is further forward on the rear sight again makes it more visible and you know the front building has an incredibly low roof line so this will stick up behind it and when I look at the overshadowing diagram that upper story does make a big difference to the amount of bolt that is kind of blocking um daylight access to the rear of the building and we'll change the amount of time of the day that various parts of it are shadowed because it is just so prominent and particularly in winter will have a quite dramatic effect on that back part of the building so I don't want to say no because on the whole I think nice house but there's lots of options for that second floor because it doesn't take up the whole space there are options given the size of the site that would still allow good northern windows and actually give a good solar passive a better solar passive outcome for the new house because it wouldn't have a second floor that was getting hammered by morning and afternoon sun in summer which having a second floor that gets some late afternoon and summer the less wall the better so I would like to propose that we refer this back to the administration and encourage the proponent to take another look to see the impact on that front dwelling which is quite a lovely dwelling which a good extension so it's going to turn it into a good quality house apart from the fact that it gets no sun for several months of the year um encourage the proponent to re-look at this game with that in mind so do you want to move that now is there a seconder for that council law do you wish to speak by councillor groom and the way that this is you know positioned so close to the front house that when this block is split it'll probably put some pressures on there that don't currently exist or were envisioned in the officers report but I also just wanted to point something out and this is just more um just as a general I guess comment maybe if that's allowed um because the hilton specific planning scheme or the hilton you know whatever 3.7 um it specifically says hilton has aesthetic value for its parks streetscapes mature trees areas of indigenous vegetation and bird life its stock of relatively intact modest housing including both timber and brick cottages set on large lots many with mature trees and gardens contribute to the ambiance of the area and create a distinct cohesive streetscape character now this is something that in the application before us it's explicitly said that this site has multiple trees in front an existing dwelling to the rear on site the majority of these trees will be removed with the completion of this this new addition and officers may have missed and that the trees actually contribute to the streetscape of the entire garden precinct and so um in deferring this it might give the applicant an opportunity to see if that might be something they would consider retaining more of the trees on site while also envisioning someone living in that front house down the track on how their building might impact that so we're just waiting to get that on the screen now if you'd like to have a look at it make sure we're clear on the wording anybody like to speak on this referral the subdivision of these lots is always controversial because of the way the planning commission kind of like doesn't allow the flexibility to increase the setbacks of the existing dwellings because then the rear lot gets too small apparently um or or they're trying to maximize the area of the rear lot but in terms of what council agreement is saying I tend to agree with her but my question is um you know has is the subdivision already lodged on this and gone these boundary lines are because in a sense what I don't like seeing is wastage of land as well and that's why you know I totally understand why they would build to the boundary with their garage but I sure as hell wish it was two and a half meters away from the existing house so rather than a meter or whatever it is um so even you know and and it has that scope to be able to do that so I guess I'm just asking questions around um the status of subdivision um and the um whether that's sort of pretty well locks in where that where that wall is likely to be I'll ask the manager to respond to that through your chair at this point I don't believe there is a subdivision application lodged at all um this is simply a group dwelling development at this stage so just a further question though um would the area of the land if if there was a greater setback to the existing cottage um would the area of the rear lot then are they sort of happy to see the light and average things out the lot the overall lot sizes looks like it's big enough to be able to reduce the re rear lot particularly if you propose common property for that access driveway so the lot size at the rear could potentially be reduced so is any further comment before we move to a vote okay we're voting on the referral all those in favor that's five in favor sorry six in favor account against councillor sullivan against thank you so that's carried uh you can talk to the officers tomorrow about what that means the next item is item six holland street okay additions to a single house recommended for approval and speaker is hugh wetters you have three minutes thank you get very close to the microphone any questions of the applicant thank you so we'll move into committee I'll move the office's recommendation which is for approval is there a seconder council lang any discussion no discussion all those in favor council over all this way that I sorry conceal you item 8 56 watkins street I've got travis mcqueen to speak thank you any questions of the applicant no thank you uh the other people in the gallery don't want to speak no okay thank you so I'll move the office's recommendation which is for approval is there a seconder council groom any discussion okay so all those in favor that's unanimous thank you and talk to the officers tomorrow about what happens next thank you deals with all the items where there are members of the public present um the next item going back to the beginning of the agenda is uh the third item brack street number 90. um I will move the officer's recommended well let me just check because we've got a recommendation from council only as opposed to officer's recommendation let's get this right so we're looking on page 26. may I take the opportunity to make a request of offices so these this agenda has come out without a table of contents on like on the sidebar that we can navigate which is check in the future that they always come out with that um navigation that'd be great I'll second that so it's the uh just to make it clear this recommendation on page 20 is what was referred back to the committee by council what's the recommendation that was andrews I'm just saying sorry about this I think the recommendation page 26 is the one that was tabled at council but not discussed is that correct so just for your information so page 20 is the recommendation was referred back by council page 26 is the modified recommendation which was discussed at council but not moved is that clear so I will move the recommendation on page 20 if someone wants to substitute the one page 26 they can do that by amendment so I'll move the motion the recommendation page 20 is the second down so it's moved by I'll move it in a second about council sullivan um do you want to immediately move the amended version in council sullivan so I've been I'll just speak on it briefly trying to work out how best to do this and I had some additional words as well I don't know if it's been very late in the day so I'm not sure whether chloe's managed to get those through to the minute secretary or the likes so um she has um my sense is how we're going to deal with tonight we're probably going to try and get as best a recommendation as we can and then have it referred to council or we can actually make the decision tonight so I'm not too sure which way we're going but what I'll do is I'll move my amendments which are up on the screen which are horribly confusing but I'll speak to the to what the whole motion is trying to say um and then we can debate that can I just clarify that this is a new amendment it's not either of the ones in the agenda that's right it's very much a modified version of what I tried what I presented at council but that people have seen the correspondence that came from the applicants this afternoon which offered a compromise although not a very good one um so I think I think maybe move them move and speak to the amendment and then we'll decide whether to refer to council or not so you've moved the amendment you've got a second second council law that would like to speak to it thanks um this is really you know I don't like making things more complicated than they need to be um and of course unfortunately not everyone's going to be able to see everything that's up on that screen at one time and they haven't got it electronically yet because it was only really drafted sort of this afternoon late this afternoon um in essence the motion that I moved at council was basically to say that those three elements the two lots of sheds and the wall that unifies them together are the elements that we want to see conserved what I've kind of like realized in a sense is in fact really what all of them and the wall are the bits that are that have cultural significance sufficient cultural significance to warrant retention but that like the other proposal that we're prepared to see that that heritage dealt with in different ways um in an interim sense and in the long term uh that not all of the buildings even though they have cultural significance not all of it has to be kept and it doesn't have to be kept in the short term in the sense that it can be dismantled and be readied for reconstruction so the following our meeting with the applicant on monday I took the view that it was a fairly reasonable approach to allow the dismantling of the roofs that are there because the reality is they're going to have to remove those concrete slabs they're going to have to remove the steel structural beams which aren't sorry the steel structural posts which aren't heritage so they're going to need to do a whole bunch of things on on that site to get to the point where those buildings doing that from a building point of view would be to dismantle the roof forms put them aside and then allow the demolition of the non-heritage fabric which includes the steel columns uh the steel truss uh longitudinal trusses which support the um the uh the the heritage timber trusses um and also ultimately um pull out the um concrete slabs and deal with any minor contamination which might exist underneath them and there may well be so in that sense what I concluded was I'm not sure what's going on with this mic but anyway what I concluded uh was that allowing the deconstruction of the trusses and the trusses only uh was a reasonable step to take in the long-term conservation of the of those buildings but the proposal that we would see the deconstruction uh of all of the brickwork uh was really quite quite a challenge for me uh because I didn't see the necessity for it first of all but I also didn't feel that it was the right thing to do from a conservation point of view so just quickly to still require or sorry to still exclude the three components from demolition approval but then to speak to what you could do with them in the interim so if you take part a I'm assuming that the um the words above there are just sort of fixing it fixing it up a bit but if you take part a which is the central three bridge to building in the site what it's basically doing other than just tidying up some wording is saying that the original fabric of that portion of the building that's to be conserved may be temporarily dismantled and stored in accordance with a conservation management plan now the wording conservation management plan is something that chloe and I discussed this afternoon and it probably needs to be changed to something like a preservation strategy or something like that so but let's not worry about that right at this moment let's deal with the principle um so and then what it then goes on to say so that's what a bit of the building that um or the portion of goes on to say that the rest of the trusses i.e the ones that aren't part of the building to be reinstated uh should also be conserved in case they can be used for an interpretation somewhere else on the site or unneeded because not all the trusses are in good enough condition or whatever if we move to part b if we can just scroll to that so part b deals with the building closest to brack street and I after consideration I decided I wouldn't change that um that building's still got the tin roof on it on both bays um I don't see any immediate need to touch it or to demolish it uh because of asbestos um so I've just left that part of the recommendation as it is and in part c what I've done is to emphasize uh with the last bit that the wall is to remain uh to be retained in situ because I just don't I don't think it's logical to demolish a wall that doesn't need to be demolished and it will never have the same feel and I've got to say when I listened to the applicant on monday when he said oh well you know we'd have to punch openings in that wall to make it usable for a future use and everything and I'm thinking hang on it's got these amazing doorways and these amazing windows quite large windows in a very nice rhythm for most of its distance so I'm was left a little bit wondering whether they actually knew what they actually had because I can see there's a fantastic elevation in that street there is some more um is it in there chloe so just scroll up the okay so what I'm suggesting um in I think I think actually I'm not sure this bit didn't go to council did it chloe so what chloe had suggested was uh the stuff in black and I think what I've done is my suggestions in greens just to make that clear um so if we can just get back to three yep um so this is plan to guide how they do all of that it might be called a preservation plan or strategy so let's not worry about the wording just yet so this is about just talking to that and it was suggested that we actually provide a bit of a list as to what that would entail so that's what the a b c and d and e I think are so if we can scroll up you can read all of those um and then I have also suggested a further condition sorry chloe's this is chloe's additional condition so this is her bringing in um so the chloe's additional condition was really just to put some legality around uh what you do when you demolish something and set it aside so um that's that aspect and then I thought it was appropriate to basically put in an advice note or a footnote that really kind of explained what the hell we were doing so that's if you want to have a read of that that's what that advice note is um trying to things that were said on monday so that they became part of the recommendation so I might just give everyone a chance to have a read can I just add something to ponder while we're reading for council sullivan one of the things in the uh email that came through quite late from the components today was that either they would store the materials or we would at our cost at our depot I think with the so I'd be keen to see if there was somewhere in here that we could make it clear that the cost of storage would be on the proponent not on the council council thanks just have a question on this so the facade that we keep in place does that automatically get added to a heritage register or some kind of list somewhere that's my question for a comment from the offices through your chair no um it's a quite separate process that gets places added to the heritage list um so this whole precinct is already in the north mental heritage area which is what's triggered the the places to be added to the heritage list as an individual place um it's a quite standalone process separate from a development application where the the places it goes through a proper heritage assessment um the results of that assessment get brought to plain community and council with a recommendation um for it to be added if council supports that initial recommendation and then has to be public consultation with the landowner I give the landowner an opportunity to comment and the matter then comes back to planning committee and council for a final decision on whether to add somewhere to the list or not and you may remember actually last month's random meetings was the report on the um last year's annual review of and recommended changes to the heritage list which included the additions of some places and the reason why I flagged this is just the recent demolition of the kohl's wall store building I don't know if anyone was watching that within that building there were significantly large timber trusses like like we're describing at the moment that I try and protect in the reinterpretation of that new wool store building second demolition round that just got bowled over with no consideration so I'm just thinking council sullivan's going to do a lot of effort here and then new apartments built and then a new apartment's bowled over what happens to all the work that's happening right now that's what I'm wondering is this correct the large timber frames in the woolsters were the poor heritage result but they were retained as part of the vision of all stores and there were the original trusts of all stores and they were very large so I'm not sure what's happened to them um I'm not sure if the wall press is being kept either but uh any further discussion of this item council law um yeah and I support what counselor sullivan has put forward I was I was just thinking in my head um I was trying to find it and I couldn't_''_4168.4 but maybe putting the actual words from the north free mental heritage precinct area about retention poor there's two key phrases maybe putting that in there would be um oh yep so so achieving the objectives of of retaining the the focus of the in on the industries relating to the port of fremantle the railways and associated industries established in the area and they're also trying to achieve objective b with its former industrial character resulting from the former leighton martial in yards in industries such as a dingo flower mill located in the area if putting those specific words in what we're trying to achieve would help clarify our intent and that that's what we're trying to preserve is those objectives in the precinct area itself I'll if the mover and second are happy to accept that as an amendment um well I look I actually thought about that when I was drafting it I just didn't get time to do it um but I kind of feel like if it ends up getting sent up to council then there's a sort of another iteration of this sadly that needs to happen anyway so but I to include in um in this sort of statement um but I also um to um there was another matter no I've lost it I'm trying to think if it's what council lang was raising but um yeah my my sense is we are um you know what we're going to end up with is a building and if they were demolishing it into the future they'd be seeking a demolition application for a building the problem with the wall stores was that it was so pathetic in the first place that it you know was inevitable almost that those beams would get demolished and there wouldn't necessarily be uh someone going well what are you going to do with them now because they still need to be reincorporated I i thought about raising it myself at the time I did note that they did demolish them uh and put them aside not not necessarily very carefully but they certainly put them aside and they have disappeared uh separately so I'm pretty sure they didn't just go straight to the tip but somewhere so yeah um or they might form some part of jared's one of jared's houses I don't know so and I'll just ask if you want to work on this tonight to get those words in off refer to counsel and give people chances it's up to the committee if there's if people are going to refer it up to full council anyway then there's no urgency I think the general thrust is what we need to get right tonight and I'm pretty confident with the general thrust so it's the thrust of allowing or keeping those buildings and allowing some practical uh way of letting them use the site and also manage the site between now and when they go to do a major development method hiding I mean I'd be pretty keen to deal with this tonight if we could I'm not sure sort of given how long this is dragged on for that we're going to get any closer to something that we feel comfortable with than where we are now so I mean be pretty happy to support council sullivan's amendments because I think that's really where we have got to and I think taking it full council isn't going to get it much much into a different place anyway so that's my view I'll just ask the officers to look at including that preamble which council over asks for I think any further discussion whilst we're waiting for that wording I just have a question if that's we're considering the amendment to the motion we're not debating the substantive substantive issue yet we are currently debating whether this amended recommendation should replace the one in the agenda so there was probably one other element and I don't know whether I should raise it now but basically changing the wording from a conservation management plan to what it was what was the last word I had I think it was just a preservation strategy and I'll when chloe's free from dealing with the other matter I'll get her to suggest if that's if we can just do that that you know start having to sort of listen to it but in in terms of um the borough charter and the different types of conservation that exist preservation is one of the conservation approaches and so preservation is basically the maintaining of something um without necessarily uh using it or so it's really just I guess mothballing is probably the right word so the preservation of something is where you're really just making sure you're hanging on to it rather than some of the other types of conservation that exists so using that word in caps preservation strategy or plan uh I i think I tend to agree with the mayor that I'd rather deal with this tonight I i think we know what the applicant's response is going to be so um have we got the words that we need yep okay so just check that again on the screen then we'll hopefully move to a vote um I'd like to make sorry from castle groom I'll comment if I may so we're moving to a vote on the words um doesn't quite align with what the sub points are now saying so before we vote I'd like to just quickly go back and check that so we get this one tidied away but so conserved on-site made structurally sound are where necessary and be maintained because then we go on to say that they can go off-site so just any further discussion just just to be clear on that my sense is that the material should not leave sign okay and so that is why originally I thought uh the shed closest to brack street should be retained so that it could be used as a storage shed for all of these trusses and materials um and that that would be its use for the next 10 years yeah so it kind of like just isolated that building it gave it the use and yeah the risk when you let materials leave site is huge um so uh council groom your microphone are you ready to move to a vote do we want to change the conservation management plans to preservation we're looking for some recommended jayna this afternoon um on this and she's given me a bit of a brief spiel which I might just read actually summarized it quite well so a conservation management plan is used to conserve and manage a heritage place and it would be suitable if the building were being largely retained or a portion of the building was being retained something like an interpretation plan can be used to tell the history and social values of a place that can't necessarily be understood by looking at the fabric so the term interpretation plan might be the best one in this instance um there's a paragraph up there before from which council of louisville described the future development should follow prescribe certain details can I see that again please oh thanks it's only a device note okay sorry I missed that point so it's wrapped up in that advice note is it the are you referring to the conservation management plan I'm referring to that there was a paragraph I saw on the screen a moment ago which said the future development should reflect and dingo flower so I think that was a request from councillor groom to just add an additional advice note it's in the advice note is it yeah yeah okay that's where the confirmer was thanks any further discussion are you happy with uh well I I'm not sure I'm happy with the interpretation plan but I'm so I think preservation plans probably the best or closest I know it's not necessarily defined but we go on to define it anyway so I don't think it matters too much but because conservation management plan has an exact meaning um I think that advice from gina would be uh dangerous to ignore uh because it could actually be a reason for them not to want to go ahead so certainly not wanting that level of detail the interpretation plan and or conservation plan management plan would literally come at the time that you would be looking to reinstate everything um and that could just be a you don't even need a conservation management plan if you've got a good application so um future but we don't need it right now so um rather than just say to you search conservation management plan and replace it with preservation plan there may just be a couple of spots in there where it actually means conservation management plan down the track so I don't know I think most of them just you can probably just change the preservation plan yeah do we take that as an amendment or drafting well I'm moving it so the secondary is happy with that I'll accept that as a minor change to the amendment any further discussion okay we'll move to a vote all those in favor of the amendment that's unanimous thank you and that's a decision made tonight um so that was that vote was to replace the officer's recommendation with the amendment now we're going to vote on the amendment so all those in favor sorry you want to speak yeah I just had a question so the financial implications for this is still listed as nil I know it's not necessarily a planning but it in the future if there was actually if this was all knocked down if that would implicate uh or have an impact on our financial situation like if there were no buildings would it impact the ratable you know the rates that we collect from that property would it increase would it decrease so I just was wondering if there was a way to potentially investigate that kind of issue a little bit more during these applications unless there's another one coming up that I have a similar question on through your chair just a bit of explanation council lawler the the financial implications commenting in any report is is basically addressing the the direct subject matter of that report not necessarily you know financial implications that may flow from a decision into the future so in that context the the nil is referring to the financial implications impact of this development application in itself on the city there might well be implications from a rating point of view but that's a separate issue you know that is obviously a consequence of different legislation and regulations that deal that's why officers in expressing it is nil have done it that way because it's you know it's true the da in itself doesn't have that financial implication okay so council sullivan um I just wanted to comment about the issue of whether or not uh we should also have in this and I can't remember whether it's in here or not the condition that basically a further condition that actually deals with the fact that it's not currently individually listed and that we should be making a statement that it is um considered a report is it in there okay it's already in there yeah I thought I'd included it and I'd yeah so I'm going ready to vote can we just make sure that last chance to speak for anybody all those in favor and motion just to andrew's question so on page 30 of our papers the amended item part b reads the offices provide a further report and recommendation to council regarding the heritage significance of the massey harry buildings etc so that is on yes it is okay so all those in favor of the amended recommendation thank you that's unanimous and made on a delegation so we'll go back to item two because this other one is leaving the room so this is alterations additions to a single house plus an ancillary dwelling I'll move the officer's recommendation which is for approval is there a seconder council groom anybody wish to speak okay all those in favor that's unanimous made by delegation colic street child care center item four is a jdap application uh child care center in colleague street uh recommended for approval I'll move the office's recommendation mr seconder councillor groom any discussion just a minor point that came up in the briefing was around the treatment of the verge area around there and driving past it daily I think it is you know I'm not sure we need to do it um as a you know a specific condition well I'd take your advice about how we do it but we definitely need to prevent parking on the verge there of soft landscaping or something just given visibility with the bus stop and other things there I think could be quite essential um so yeah if you think we need to deal with that um it would be something that's quite important I think safety that's the officer to respond to that so I did have a quick chat to our traffic engineers about this and they agreed people in four wheel drives parking up on the verge is probably relatively likely and they advised that the the best solution was probably just some low landscaping on the verge rather than solid bollards and things which tend to get hit anyway but the lower landscaping makes it quite clear it's a garden and makes it hard to park on um and also ends up with quite a good outcome so committee could choose to put a condition on about landscaping that that verge area and I do have something drafted if you would like to see that so would you like to do that I'd be happy to move that way uh waiting for something to chair um on this one here um I won't ask my question about race because you answered that on the other one um because it's going from a church to a to a daycare but it says in accordance with clause 7 of the policy where development is associated with a non-residential use class that the development shall be compatible with the heritage significance of the hilton garden suburb precinct heritage area um as well as local planning scene four and then earlier on in there I talked about how this um the facade of this building actually wasn't necessarily in line with it but that day cares are gonna be bright and colorful anyways um so I was just wondering how having that bright and colorful facade was is in you know lined with the hilton garden suburb precinct heritage area policy comment I guess the the key for this site is that they are retaining the church in its current format and yes they are painting the external finish of the building but that doesn't necessarily require planning approval so someone could come along colors the applicant is also keeping the large tree that is on site today and while they are reducing car parking they're turning it into a play area so it could potentially be a better outcome for the streetscape with this design yeah I appreciate them retaining the tree but the other thing is it's also like a big sign in some of the drawings it looks like they're putting up as well and there's really nothing like that on colic street at the moment yeah look this is an unusual one a child care center in a residential area always is going to look a little bit different and the signage policy doesn't necessarily bring into play all the significance of heritage areas and things that does allow a pile on sign now committee could take the view that perhaps there is too much signage for this site uh it is a little bit tenuous and obviously being a business the need to have some signage to make it clear where they are located and where entries and things are is is logical from the streetscape itself given the site is quite clearly not an original hilton home and it is sort of right on that intersection uh the landscaping amendment is on the screen for a lot to move the memphis hudding a second a council lang any discussion on the amendment uh council sullivan suggests that it says after so provide a verge landscaping plan that restricts verge parking because I think it needs to be made very clear that it's a combination of beautification and purpose well accept that as a minor change to the wording any further discussion on the amendment okay all those in favor that's unanimous thank you so back to the as amended as any further discussion to remove the approval for the signage just because I think if there's going to be this colorful building it's going to stand out anyways and the collection really doesn't have a lot of commercial or really any signage on it and I think adding that element into the residential neighborhoods of hilton might actually really detract from the garden suburb garden precinct suburb however the concept I just where this is really going to stick out and it's going to make a huge change to a neighborhood that this council has put a lot of time and effort into maintaining as it is and um without that sign I think it would be more acceptable so do you want to remove a particular sign or just ask for the signage to be limited just the one pile on sign yeah I was interested in the additional information um it referenced the it's it's not dissimilar to the proposed parliament sign of the early learning but there is no pile on site so I mean unless they're asking for one two which I assume they then would should we approve one you know four doors down um yeah so I mean I'm supportive so would you like to remove that as an amendment removal of the pylon sign have some words and I apologize for not flagging this earlier I just thought it would be a minor thing boarding on the screen you happy to move that way council over amendment okay we'll vote on that amendment all those in favor that's unanimous thank you and are we ready to vote on the application as a whole or any further discussion okay on the application as a whole all those in favor that's you carried unanimously thank you next item is number six montgomery street uh additions and alterations to a single house I'll move the officer's recommendation to a seconder sorry okay sorry item seven amherst that's the lady who spoke earlier um the studio in the front garden I will move the obviously recommendation though I don't support it I won't be voting for it but I'll move it for this circle argument um is there a seconder methods harding any I'll just um seven item seven okay I'll just uh speak against the officer recommendation if I can um the having visited the site it's uh entirely surrounded by large vegetation um the single reason for refusal was uh the setback from the street but the building's actually is not visible from the street the three townhouses that used to be the garden of this house so this house has a large setback it's then been subdivided on a strata and then the townhouse is built as part of the strata and much closer to the street and that's why it fails the streetscape test so it seems to me that I would support the officer's alternative recommendation now I've moved the refusal so we can vote on that first if there's any further discussion on the refusal in favor of refusal okay against so that's lost there is okay can you just clarify you're voting for you're voting for the refusal or against the refugees no I support the not the initial officer's recommendation the alternate so I'd like to I'll just do that again to be sure then so those in favor of the refusal none goes against the refusal that's unanimous I'll then move the alternative recommendation which is for approval is there a seconder council lang all those in favor that's passed unanimously thank you so 112. uh alterations additions to six montgomery street I'll move the officer's recommendation for approval is there a secondary council commander any discussion okay all those in favor that's carried unanimously item 11 is review of heritage areas draft local policy planning I'm sorry yeah I'll do the information report sorry item 10 which is on page 118. are there any questions before I move that on the information report okay I'll move the information report we received seconder council groom all those in favor that's unanimous thank you item 11 review of heritage areas draft local policy um recommendation is on page 128. I'll move the officer's recommendation to a seconder council groom any discussion this is going to counsel anyway any discussion okay all those in favor that's unanimous and item 12 review of south sumatra local planning policies I'll move the officer's recommendation as a secondary any discussion sullivan um I just flagged that it was raised at the precinct meeting as well last night so the comments that were made tonight but also some to review those questions in relation to the policies that we're deleting so I'm just flagging I know it's going to council but I uh given that I've had a raging headache for the last five days I wasn't really keen to read all of the strategic planning stuff um over the weekend so um I couldn't couldn't do it justice as well as everything else sorry I love that just go anyway but I've yeah flag that I might uh have a closer look at these ones do you wish to speak on them thank you and we will be providing response to the questions that were raised in in question time and obviously anything we received through from any elected members but um it is important in reviewing these policy reviews that we're doing as part of the staged up update to recognize the role of a local planning policy which is essentially to guide decisions made under the scheme not to guide possible future decisions on rezoning which should be guided by the local planning strategy so although very important in deciding where council wants to go with its future policy framework no in some regards there's no harm in having policies left on on the books that provide general statements of intent or views but they can sometimes complicate appealed situations hence one of the reasons why we do prefer to update the policy framework to make sure that it's tight it's robust and it works within the legislative system so I'm just providing that as some general content and context because uh these policy reviews that we're doing at the moment I'm very well aware can be seen from two perspectives and the queries that were raised tonight are I think a reflective of that perspective counselor groom let's ask a question um given that I guess there is kind of live information that people may want answers to are we able to defer a decision on this or should we given that it's going to counsel anyway or should we it makes no difference we our recommendations counseling council can alter it so that's right or you can alter it tonight but the council's sorted so that's what I mean yeah yeah yeah sorry yeah okay well that would be exactly the same as sending it to council I mean you could vote for it and then you could put in an amendment council no I understand that I don't know that I feel informed enough to make a decision either way that's what I'm trying to given the question so just wanted to refer to council okay you want to move that way okay secondary council sullivan all those in favor so that's probably that's a reason normally a referral motion has a reason it would be to give consideration to the additional comments that have come from the community from the community just just so that it has a purpose yeah because a referral should have a purpose but it also shows that we're listening so I think that's good so just fine just for clarification if that reveal motions pass the effect of that will be the the same report will go to council committee recommendation the committee resolution will simply be the matters being referred to council for the reason with the reason that council sullivan's rightly suggested yeah okay everybody happy to vote on the referral okay all those in favor that's unanimous um item 11 motions with previous notice there are none item 12 urgent business non item 13 late items item 14 confidential business there are none and close the meeting at 7 53 just somewhat earlier than expected okay thank you for your attendance and thank you affiliate for your service to the council you
What happens when I mentioned this to people for the first time well they get a twinkle in their eye they go you're not it surprised me I didn't realize it as possible and that's part of what's so exciting to do it's been amazing so you've got the city of Melville town of each man ONC four together who's a bad idea but it's around providing access to arts for the whole community I can see thousands and thousands of thousands of families coming out of people of all ages and backgrounds people who have a deep interest in dc and though they just want to see a spectacle along the highway to help come join us first of March 2024 the best imposing event highway to hell this bonds got sang in that song all my friends are going to be there too
This is the site where all of the aboriginal men that were brought down from up north and even from down south were housed in the Roundhouse before being shipped off to Rottnest so this is the notorious round house and it was the oldest public building in WI built in 1830 it is interesting that given this one River Colony was a free settler state the first building you'd build is a jail and of course my understanding is because they are well aware that they were going to come into conflict with Aboriginal people because it was their land and the settlers were taking their land and there was no there was no recognition of that three thousand seven hundred men were taken across to Rottnest about ten percent of those are buried on the island in an unmarked grave and it's a dark chapter of the state's history but it needs to be told for reconciliation and for telling the truth so if you do the tool you can come along and learn about the history the true history of Aboriginal history of Western around here of weigh it up in Fremantle this is man jury and it's on a limestone hill or a cart and that went all the way across this one River see it's one river over there double year again this is the double Nara and over there is warm up rottnest island this is man jury a man jury is a trading place within Wally llama whale up is Fremantle North the river south the river and it's the place of the warrior little Whaley little kangaroo right there locally extinct now and over there his mean deep war Garden Island and the new now have an ancient story where yon dock crocodile Carter khumba come down and he wants to go up the river and take over noon our country from the north but great Woggle who lose out Wagle mire and easter amaryl fought with the crocodile and bit the crocodiles tail off and he placed the tail of the crocodile over this one River just in case the crocodile decided to come back up this one river so that's what we're some this crocodiles howl extended across the Swan River to stop and coming in but CY O'Connor in the 1900s blew up part of this limestone construction that blows across this one rivet and created the harbor Fremantle harbour yes so this is the first sign along the meandering trail and it refers to the six known are seasons so we're actually in the seasons of Burak starting December January February March Bonnaroo which is a slight the second summer April May is Gerren mackerel June July that's first winter July August September October November cambering the thing about the seasons it's not exactly clinical so the first of December isn't the start of burek yes it's usually the start of the flowering of a particular tree okay or the migration of particular animals so you know things like the yellow eyed mullet and the flowering the Christmas tree are signals of Burak you know winter time people were inland winter rainfall patterns filled up a lot of little water holes inland so people could camp on those and get water and survive but around about springtime they had to move to more permanent suppliers and they followed them down the river to the coast so pretty much we mimicked the availability of water and with that came the availability of plants and animals so people's migration and they moved you know from from coastal areas in the summer to inland in the winter and then back around the four seasons that I know it's just sort of names but this sounds like a like a lesson like a guide yes yeah yeah it's intuitive okay why do you think it's important to know that history well I mean there's a lot of there's a lot of judgments about Aboriginal people there's a lot of people making comments about African people and without that full understanding of that history you can't really even begin to make those judgments and make those you know those claims and you know Aboriginal people many Aboriginal people are still still suffering from that past we are the most incarcerated people and our people do suffer from high rates of poor it hasn't been a good relationship we need to be able to tell the truth about that in any relationship you need to be honest and you need to share those things that that are contributing to that problem of that bad relationship so I think this is one of the first signs of its kind that we put up the recognize that history in the aboriginal and state relationship
Information session for march 2022 I'm siana for the community grants and I'm ali hi everyone kaya I'm the senior arts officer for the city of fremantle we're just going to do an acknowledgement which is the city of fremantle acknowledges the wajak people as the traditional owners of the greater fremantle wailaperia and we recognize that their cultural and heritage beliefs are still important today so just to give some background on why we fund grants so it's a way to bring the community together and support projects that facilitates this goal we adapt the grant guidelines to what is needed in the most at in the most at the community at the time so for example last year we were a bit more focused on the social recovery for covert 19 and this year we still emphasize that but we want to also facilitate all people's being included in our activities we'll also just mention that neither of us are wearing face masks it's because we are recording this from from home um just and yeah just so everyone knows with everything that's considered if my cat may join this conversation as well okay so some really key information for you to take away from this um very short powerpoint is um first and it's most importantly um it's really important to contact siana or myself to talk through your project ideas um you know it's for us to double check eligibility answer any questions you may have prior to somebody submitting a grant application it's also just a really good opportunity for us to connect with you um to hear your thoughts hear your concerns hear your really beautiful ideas and we can absolutely provide feedback and and save you time through this process as well we really do enjoy the conversations and if it's just a really newly formed idea that's okay as well we can maybe um send you in the dire right direction or connect you perhaps to other people in the community that may um have like-minded ideas so to get in contact please just email the um grant funding at freeman or wa.gov.eu_``_138.56 email address and we then if there is a need to meet face-to-face um or meet further online we can absolutely absolutely do that and kind of work out the best way that we can support you another really important information is the application process um is now on a system called sonar grants that's an online system it was used for the very first time last year and it went really well it's a really user friendly system and so um yeah you'll have to get used to that system if you are concerned about using digital technology do let us know and we could probably also connect you once again um to someone that can help you through the process but yet please be aware that it's all an online system and it's the only way we can accept the application um funding amounts are a little bit different for the categories and we'll go through that on some separate slides uh but art grants is up to ten thousand dollars per application and community grants for up to five thousand dollars per application but remember um it is very much about asking um the amount that will help you achieve your um project successfully and those important outcomes project time frames will actually go through in more detail later in this presentation as well um so when you apply we need a six-week assessment period to turn it around which is pretty creepy pretty quick in grant world um and then you must complete the project within 12 now with within 12 months and then we also have a really key piece of information that we really encourage you to get to know well is the guidelines on our website so I'm actually just going to show you where they are so what you're looking at here is the city of fremantle web page and the fact that you're listening to us means you probably have found this page but we have just circled the arts grants and community grants section and then we've just highlighted in this very sophisticated yellow texture um that there are some blue um hyperlinks so within there you've got um if you click on does talk about um the the criteria how we assess things and give you some really important information and also a link through to the smiley grants portal so they're the two areas for you to look at the other one which I think is really useful is the hyperlinks of previous recipients so you can see there the rounds from september and march of the previous years go and have a look at the projects that we've funded um you know it'll be inspiring to see what's done we're so lucky to have such um ambitious and talented people in the fremantle community so it'll give you some good ideas and also give you an idea of I guess the quality of the projects that we fund so I just included this page because I just wanted to show you that's basically a similar sort of formatting um so you see the smiley grunts portal there's community grant guidelines and then obviously the email which you can contact us and ask any questions and the relevant downloads just has something a give some different information on there if you wanted to read further yeah great cool so some of the key dates or the important dates so it opens on the 1st of march such as 9 a.m and then the applications close on the 31st of march and please don't be late because we can't actually accept late applications even if we wanted to and the assessment period is approximately six weeks and we'll send out an outcome notification prior to the 12th of may and plea we do work against this timeline very closely and then the notifications you'll receive by email okay um so uh so who can be funded is also a little bit different for the two categories of arts grants and community grants so at grants we will um accept applications from individuals if you have an abn um and that we do this is because a lot of the uh artists who apply to this program are sole traders themselves and they don't have to be in incorporated organizations but we also do absolutely expect um we'll accept grants so it is an organization or group that is legally constituted as an incorporated association or has an offspring a secured offspring a not-for-profit company or applicant that has obtained the appropriate level of public liability insurance for proposed project and or event so I'll just quickly also run through the auspice information so the ospicer receives the grant funding and enters into relevant agreements for the auspice unincorporated group auspice organization will need to be based in fremantle and be a not-for-profit entity a community organization would best fit for community grants and must agree to act as an offspring this means that they must have permission and commitment from offspring prior to submitting the application the city does not manage the relationship between the ospicer and auspice only the requirements of the grant and funding conditions that sounded kind of scary but it's really but it's really important information yeah I thought I'd run through it a bit like that because we don't want to miss anything that's important yeah absolutely so it's it is really good for first-time applicants help with the administration side of a project so um the that agreement is really good because that the person that's um especially in the organization really takes on the side of managing the money and making sure it's acquitted so so yeah it is it's a really good option for people that might need that extra definitely um oh so I've got you know I've got a bad slide as well to talk about the scary slide so what won't be funded I'm not going to go through this entire list but please make sure you do look at this um because um you know it's really important to know if you're eligible or not so um key points to kind of refer to is we can't fund anything that's already happened um so no retrospective funding we can't um uh fund anything like equipment purchases or capital works which I know is kind of what a lot of people really need we also can't fund um what else kind of organizational expenditure like salaries or year and there they actually have the same intention and outcomes happening again so um if you've got questions about this this or concerns about this top just talk to us about it this is me again so our grant objectives so um yeah a really good way to work out which category you should go to either our grants or community grants a nice way to and simple way to look at it is arts grants you need to have an artist involved in the the project and that the project really is benefiting um those artists and those artists are kind of really working at a a really good professional level so yeah obviously free mantle is a really proud creative city we really value artists and creatives and we absolutely acknowledge the role that you play in helping us be such an amazing city um there's some really beautiful visions for the city it's a city that's clever creative inspiring inclusive one that welcomes and celebrates all peoples and cultures a place that encourages innovation and prosperity and is compassion so I know what I've just said is really important um and that's in the guidelines um to really when you're thinking about your project is your project thinking in that way that it is inclusive and that it is for everyone um and that it can just really make a difference to people there are some very clear objectives as well the three that are here on the slide it is about developing and strengthening the arts and cultural sector so once again that is making sure there are assembled it is about activating place and engaging people so when we mean by activation that means um that the project itself is happening in the fremantle area and that um there is audience or people participating um or benefiting from what you're doing um and yet then the third objective is supporting artists and arts organizations to extend practice and kind of build capacity so what that one really means is um sometimes it's good to have a number of artists involved in the project and maybe there's a lead artist mentoring an emerging artist um artistic concept in building and growing their ideas so there's two examples of what was funded just in the last round actually um which I think really speak to I guess the ambition of the of the arts grants programs so the first project is photo freo um which was a really successful amazing event that ran between 2002 and 2012 so an internationally recognized event that really invigorated the photographic community in wa I think anyone that used to go to absolutely remembers photo creo so we're so lucky that um some people have banded together led by claire martin and um is redesigning and bringing it back to life again and that will be happening in may and june of this year it's going to be um you know involving multiple artists in multiple venues across fremantle hosting artist talks panel discussions and projection evenings and workshops so make sure you check that one out soon and another really nice example in a different art form is the last round supported under current theater who is a kind of emerging theater company working on a residence at the fremantle art center in november last year um a cast of really interesting theater makers who really are exploring what it means to them living and working on um abuja so they'll be showing um you know when you do a creative development that's when artists get together and really it's about creating a new work so they'll be doing a showing of what they've come up with in march of this year so you can see there the project timelines and the guide information just to give you an idea but um yeah lots of amazing ideas out there so keep chatting to us about it all right tiana I'll just go through the community grant objectives so we kind of go we have three main points um and then I'll go into some key points later but the first one is to deliver inclusive responses to meet the needs of isolated groups including but not limited to services to vulnerable people who are direct directly affected by mental health homelessness and family domestic violence so those seem quite bring everyone together and then support I guess the undercurrent but not focusing on that and the second one is to enable and encourage active participation in the community so that's kind of what I just talked about bringing everyone together and then supporting a need three is to seek to align with key strategic priority areas as outlined in the city's focus action plan so this is first access and inclusion which I think both of us are kind of focusing on this year as well is to give active participation of everyone not just an isolated group second is why a lot reconciliation plan and three is age friendly and then some other key points is to ensure that the budget is detailed because we can fund in part of the amount that you want it might not be the full amount but we can support some projects and so at least then things can go ahead um and then budget reminders also to capture in-kind support and resources and other funding contributions so it's not just solely relying on us you can actually go if their needs align it's yours and then you can kind of fund a project that way as well um yeah great and just to give some examples as well so the first one I put down was the fremantle was by the fremantle wesley mission and they created a program called the wesley link so it was basically the wesley link is a dropping center with a commercial kitchen and what we did is that we funded their provision of food supplies and some of their running costs so then we bet we help them maintain um their little gathering that they have already existing and so this was from the october 2021 to september 2022 so that was how long it ran for and then we gave them two thousand dollars which is the up to five thousand we gave them two thousand and then the miralinga youth children's service um they so it was basically a yarning circle which has been used by aboriginal people for thousands of years and so it allowed people to come together in a safe place and discuss I guess a um aboriginal crease worker which helped to take care of the kids as well which is awesome so this is from april to december in 2021 and the grant amount was three thousand dollars great I um and just going back to that point around you know someone working out if it's an arts or a community grant sometimes you might even after listening to that you might like well I i still don't know because some arts projects absolutely kind of you know work in a community development space so the best thing is just just to reach out to sienna and I we're already kind of um sending clients to each other and yeah exactly kind of really aware of of all these beautiful ideas that are starting to form um this is johan siana the application process so first is to contact the city's grant officer which is one of us to discuss a potential pro project and application um I think and we're pretty hands on with that I would say because we want everyone to um you know carry but obviously has to meet our eligibility and criteria so we're happy to kind of collaborate with you on that point and the second is to complete the grant application form online by the city smart grants portal which is what we just showed you before um and please ensure all questions are answered with as much detail as possible because um this also allows us to kind of break down what you've put down and we can possibly fund certain things instead of not going with the project at all so please be put in detail you can save this and always come back to it three is to submit your application so you'll receive an email or receipt all notifications will be via email and any technical issues you can just contact smiley grants because that portal doesn't really have anything to do with us yeah excellent this is our second last slide everyone so thanks for sticking with us um this is just a snapshot of what the smarty grants portal actually looks like so people can start to become familiar with it this slide is actually showing you when you type in somebody grants or you click on the link on our website it brings you through to here you can see that there's current rounds at the moment so on the 1st of march up will pop the arts and community grants link so you can click into there when you do click into it it then takes you to a page which you're looking at on the right here um which gives you really important information but you can um you know what you can do is preview the form or download the application form so you can really start to see what the questions are and how it all looks and as sienna said before when you start a submission you can save it and come back to it when you need so you can start to build it slowly we do recommend you do it as soon as you can don't leave it till the very last day because that never works well for anybody um and it's also really useful because then um saves your previous applications then if you are successful that's where you do your acquittal which is the report at the end great all right a nice fun slide at the end so um yeah we just wanted to say thank you for watching and and good luck and yeah please get in contact with us yeah thank you so much guys
Them until they had time to present their own case they received the information in november it went over christmas and new year and we felt that was a reasonable request so the report goes through as is with the single amendment to remove 63 thompson road for further consideration and that can be dealt with in one or two months time but the building itself is quite interesting um before we go much further councillor sullivan continued really you're just embarking on quite a I was introducing the item okay I was just getting some looks from the officers that a second might be a handy thing at some point right councillors sullivan did you want to speak at all on that right so I think that's fairly clear is there any other further discussion on that one okay all those in favor against we're all good great so pc item 13 is in your agenda um the recommendation is paint is printed on page 71 13 yep so I'm just saying it's printed on item on on page 71. so councillor jones did response to the uh covent look at short state tourism in western australia so I'll I'll move that the report secondary councillor lang any discussion counseling just a quick comment I touched on it last week um I thought the staff did a really good job in highlighting the key issues with this proposal from the state government um with airbnb now being such an important gap between a rental and a hotel it's a real national market that affords emergency accommodation and also it's really important for tourism and the proposals being put forward at the 60-day maximum which would wipe out the industry I think so the staff have picked up on that and made those notes and recommendations I think they've done a great job so thanks to the team for that one remember there's any further comment I'll put one to a vote all those in favor and that's unanimous that brings us to the end of planning and into f poll um councillor archibald do you want to move any of the athol items or throw to is the north fremantle bowling club expressions of interest criteria um second uh for that one councilor mofflum uh any discussion councillor pemberton thanks um yes I just wanted to thank the officers for the time that's been taken and the thought that's gone into this as well I think um it's a good basis on which we can build for um other facilities as well um obviously there has been a lot of concern around the utilization or lack thereof of the north fremantle wolves club which of course is actually separate to the cricket club nothing to do with the cricket club not even on the same site but you know this is this is a space that a lot of community members have been wanting to use and have currently been unable to do so under the current structure so I think this is a really positive step a way forward where we're creating really clear kind of guidelines around the expectations of whoever has control of this um facility and that it is actually um utilized more widely by the members of councillor groom uh yeah I again I appreciate the work and I know the in the intent and we look forward to a great outcome um I have been concerned since seeing this item on the f polar gender about the 60 um and I know we've had questions at an iem about kind of what that means um I think the kind of question of at least clarifying that that means time not area would probably be useful amendment um and I'm also concerned that um you know we couldn't expect that from the beginning of someone taking over facility of like this and I wonder whether it warrants a minor amendment you know requiring that they have a plan to work towards achieving utilization for 60 over the time within the first year or some such kind of goal like that because any community or you know other group that tries to build up the kind of usage we are envisaging in these criteria it won't happen overnight and and we need to be committing to be on that journey might be useful if we did talk about this quite a lot at f pol as well I think it is a good measure but how we measure it and win ah thank you um so yes it would it would make sense to just clarify that utilization is about time that the facility is used rather than portions of the facility being used it definitely makes sense to build in some wording around how we can work up to a 60 utilization for sure and obviously from day one you're not going to achieve 60 but as long as there's a plan in place and an intent and then we can come back and check that say after 12 months and we're able to audit it in a measurable way then yeah that's that's fine right did you wanna yes thank you um thank you madame I was just wondering if we might just move a very minor amendment to part a which just says equal or greater to greater than sixty percent of the time in any normal week that would take account of christmas bang and something like that so um perhaps I can ask the officer to draft up some minor amendments to point a that maybe first talk to developing a plan to work towards achieving an ongoing utilization of the facility that is equal to or greater than um sixty percent of the time of any normal week something along those lines so we'll just work that up council pemberton did you have a suggestion I guess I wondered whether the reference to a normal wake was necessary but um either way I just thought um if it was clear about like within six months of taking control or within 12 months of operation something like that window of opportunity pointed to yeah yeah okay well we'll just get something drafted up there I mean I think taking out councillor I'm sorry speaking from the chair so I can maybe slip into committee a little bit um that any normal week also probably gives us a bit of wiggle room round covered potential lockdowns and other things like that so I think if we were measuring them after a period of you know 10 it would be fair to take that into consideration all right we'll just wait for that to come on the screen did anyone want to comment on this item more broadly while we're working on that amendment councilor wafflin yeah I suppose just the question in regards to the working up to the 60 because we all we're saying here is that we're seeking proposals that we'll be able to provide that I just don't know if that's actually creating additional complication in there rather than just saying yeah we we're potential future users that can demonstrate that they are going to have 60 usage rather than saying put a plan together we may find ourselves 12 months down the track and they haven't got 60 and they're never going to achieve it so I'd actually prefer to to be putting that harder line there at the beginning and of course it's always an aspiration for them to be able to achieve it um and yeah I would almost think that some the the to the broader community we know that's not going to be accessible to the broader community necessarily on day one either that's going to be an ongoing process so for me I would be more than happy to just keep it as is rather than putting an additional plan together because I would have thought and maybe it's a question to staff is whether there is some discretion in the work that staff do in terms of assessing the eoi and looking at how how that 60 would be achieved so can I just get yeah a response from the staff on that yep so get a comment on that and I'll just note the words the current wording is up on the screen of the proposed amendment sorry what happened uh through the mayor um so given its criteria and it's going through an assessment process we would assess against the criteria more so than necessarily the criteria needing to be achieved at that given point so if you had a number of submissions that came close to some or all of the criteria to that criteria and then we could continue to have a conversation with what we would identify as our preferred proponent moving forward council following oh sorry I jumped in sorry um just a question regarding that I mean obviously this is an eoi that might end up in either a lease or a licence and so these matters you know if they with our policy the question would be if they can very clearly demonstrate 60 percent of the hours of usage would be used by this organization um or the organization um then they would probably qualify for release if they can't_''_666.88 demonstrate that our policy would probably suggest they qualify for a licence or we might even consider some other arrangement is that where the process is heading and so do we need to be outrageously worried about what's you know in the wording um depending on I guess the quality of the submission we achieved and the level to which they meet the criteria we can consider a different mechanism for making it available whether it's a management agreement or a licence or would make it available to them and also the the terms that they have proposed as part of their submission to I guess the intent of this criteria is to put forward the best possible use of the facility that the working group has determined and it may be that if if we are unable to find a proponent who can achieve this criteria the option you could you could have an option to go back to the drawing board and re-look at how the facility is used councillor pemberton did you want to speak further to the amendment yeah that's what we're doing we need to probably move and second it so are you moving the amendment as drafted at point a on the screen you wanted to second or speak to that have you second it and speak to it great perfect okay um having said that I would second it I actually don't support it with the first section in there so I think it overly complicates it I think what the clarification that is useful and valuable at this point in time is is of the time and within a period of time however um and it's kind of been alluded to in what a couple of councils and the officers have said which is that the development of the plan is what you would want to see at the point of sign you know negotiating a lease I don't think we want to see it in the eoi and I think saying I think what's more important in the eoi stage is that we want them to be able to demonstrate that they will be able to utilize the space rather than they can demonstrate that they can write a plan can I ask the mover whether they would be comfortable to remove the words the development of a plan towards yes I think that came into the debate yep oh good so I'm happy to say the ability to demonstrate ongoing utilization of the facility that's fine with me okay so the amendment now reads um 60 of the time within no hang on 60 of the time within 12 months of operation you that you're all good I'm going to move him we've moved seconded the amendment I'm going to put the amendment to the vote all those in favor and any against so that's councillor commander against council of yousek against the amendment can I speak to us do you want to speak to the amendment not after your photos but maybe if you were speaking to the amended recommendation you could allude to that okay so that's carried so we're now um back to debating the officer's recommendation as amended counselor commander did you want to speak oh it's just more the reason I didn't put my hand up it's just more a clarification of the 60 I know we're talking time but 60 is that like 14 and a half hours a day I mean how do we define exactly I know it's yeah we're sort of clutching at straws here in this common sense approach but I've still am confused about that and exactly what we mean I might just go back to the acting director was quite a discussion at f paul through the mayor um so the way we would consider 60 is a half day so yeah that's what the half day refers to it's a measurement of time so we wouldn't expect someone to utilize the building the entire day every single day of the year but a half day is a more reasonable consideration did anyone want to speak further on the amended officer's recommendation I'll put that one to a vote all those in favor and again all those in favor yep everyone unanimous cool timing of hands got a bit out of work there thank you good so that's not through our bowling club um I'm just going to see if there so we've got an amendment for f-fil22028 um perhaps I can just see if there's a few that we could do on block here so if you just want to follow along um f poll seven anyone wish to speak on fpulse7 oh armc one anyone rmc2 it's an amended officer sorry two two great um and block the amended officer's recommendation probably not no okay um arnc four armc5 no um rmc6 rmc7 no um rmc8 yes um and then we'll just quickly go to the c items c two c three so we can do c three c four okay we can do c4 all right so the items that I've got to move on block are seven um fl7 armc armc1 arm c5 arm c7 c1 c3 and c4 so I'll move those items seconded by counselor muffler sorry yeah you're right I didn't intend to see one to be included and we will that's an amended officer's recommendation anyway so has somebody captured the ones yep so we're gonna I'm gonna move those and get a seconder councillor jones all those in favor of items thank you um this is going to bring us now to um f poll item eight um so I'll move the offices a recommendation and get it seconded by someone council jones maybe looks like he wants to um and there's a proposed amendment by councillor to that if people I'll move my amendment seconded by council of pemberton excellent yeah I just simply wanted to make sure there was a recognition of the importance of the heritage of the building that's part of this I mean obviously we're closing a street that street is services almost nothing except a heritage cottage which is the only cottage left from the port expansion so all of that area that had been subdivided as as residential including all of the breck street area and much of where the port on the north side is now was zoned for residential and cottages and there were many and this is the last one and so it's rarity value alone in that specific location is important so this amendment is very much trying to just make sure that we as a council recognise that and continue to recognize that because we have in the past and that we also hopefully let the port authority have a little bit more of a message that it's not the sort of place that you just go oh well um our hands because that's not how you treat uh heritage properties so um I'll ask that we do that and essentially it also acknowledges uh the passing of mrs mullally a household name in norfolk mantle and was very much a household name in this council for a very long time because there were quite a few efforts to squeeze her out and quite a lot of community support to keep her safe so I do acknowledge uh the battler that she was um and how amazing to live in that cottage so close to such a beautiful beach uh even though you had an entire port industry running around you so good on her for living a life that she wanted to live and just acknowledge her passing thanks councillor sullivan um before we go to councillor jones uh we've got two different versions of mrs mullally's name in the uh amendment so I believe it's carmel not carmen yeah that's okay um so we might just before we go much further and then the second reference to say carmel thank you council that uh the and former and jerry mcgill put out a press release this afternoon which I think is relevant um and just a little more detail that bailey street alone had 30 homes in it with 52 people living there including many children and everyone except hers was resumed and demolished uh in total over 300 homes in north carolina were demolished to allow for port expansion and they are in addition very supportive that the building should be retained in place and not offered to be taken away so I just passed that on thanks councillor jones and I think you know um on behalf of the council we would extend you know a recognition to mrs mullally and everything that she became iconically known for um as a memory in northern mantle um I'm assuming there's nothing further on this amendment so I'll put the amendment to the vote all that's in favor and back the item as amended any further discussion I'll put that to the vote all those in favor looks like unanimous on both fronts excellent so that's councillor groom did you want to move these or whatever you like okay so I will move um the officer's recommendation for armc 2022-22 whatever it is two um seconded by councillor groom um I think someone would wish to speak on this item council green was that you yeah and then councillor archwald uh yeah I just I like to bring to people's attention that um the offices circulated an updated action report for this item and a couple of the other ordered items so um at committee last week we certainly received some reports that things will pass their date and I'm really aware that that's come at the back of a really busy time for council so I thank the officers for bringing that information up to date for us um and for the work that they're doing to kind of implement these recommendations and make sense of them to us thanks councillor groom councillor archford did you wish to speak any further speakers on that item council of your friends just got a question um disclosure of interest on page 91 annual return was not received and it was referred to the crime and corruption what was that about ask for an officer comment on that through the chair that was a um a staff member and they were mitigating personal circumstances and the return was just put in like that okay thank you anything further on that item all right um you think you might want to turn your mic off if you're finished speaking thank you um councillor archibald sorry could I just add a comment that was my understanding on that particular issue that um once something is late for whatever reason it is automatically referred to those institutions that are listed so it's not as though there was anything untoward it's just a process thanks that's good clarification all right so I'll put that to the boat all those in favor that's unanimous the next item is armc 3 and we have an amended officer's recommendation so I'll move the amended officer's recommendation second the bank counselor groom did anyone wish to speak on that item no okay in favor that's unanimous um we come to armc four wally lap civic center so I'll move the officer's recommendation seconded by councillor groom and I believe someone wish to speak on this one I do um on page just some of the inconsistencies um in relation to to the costs of the civic center and I'm having difficulty with three different areas and marrying them together let's say that there is 46.8 budget 46.4 let's use those figures if you go to the monthly statement financial statement for the 31st of january 22 the work in progress is 35.3 million when we have a look at the meeting um attachments on 157 of 213 there is an item there for capital works in progress which basically um uh consider this as an internal risk of moderate and also that the the city is looking to improve how they report on capital works in progress there's too much of a discrepancy for me to support this I might just get an officer comment on how those figures relate to each other if that um so I'm assuming just to make sure we're getting the right thing council music is referring to the figures on page 101 as compared to the risk reporting document correct yeah so we know what we're being asked I'm ex I'm guessing it's a time difference issue but if there's a comment now otherwise we can take it on notice thank you through the chat what I would emphasize is the the financial swimmer that's included on page 101 it relates to the overall construction budget that's multi-year um I suspect some of the figures that you're looking forward that you're looking at are carry forward figures and they relate to a financial year so that's probably where the discrepancy is but we can take that away and just provide some more clarity thank you appreciate that anything further on that one I'll put it to a vote all those in favor against council music against that's carried I lost my run sheet items armc six um overdue debtors I'll move the officer's on this one councillor or was it council music or someone else entirely overdue debtors I still struggle with 90 days plus um I i really do struggle with 90 days plus and being able to have that manage of money outstanding um I've I've just been a bug bear of mine for the last two years and I just would like to to see what else can be done to be able to claw back that money and also for your reporting 90 days plus 120 180 would like to see what depth there is and um I've got a question about dome with overdue debtors um my memory serves me correctly and this is just an example of where you have a debt that's been outstanding for a long time dome would have over two hundred thousand dollars it was one I think about three four months ago I hadn't had time to go back to go and check it but dime owes us a lot of money don't they no no I don't think so certainly isn't in the dying but I would also like like I said the 100 the 90 days plus needs to be a little bit unpacked so that we see um you know where are our debtors in terms of time because that overdue 90 days a long time very hard to call that back yeah thank you I just wanted to um point out to the council of e6 that at the audit and risk committee meeting um there was an amendment that was moved by uh councillor groom to request a report to come back from staff about how we are working to or how the city is working to recover those those funds and in particular those greater than 90 days so it's a valid concern and it's something that the committee considered as well and has moved that amendment to get that information back to us so that we can address it I've got one more question and that is summary of overdue debts uh it's got a confidential attachment um we don't normally do that do we I might just go to councillor pemberton come back to any questions that are remnant afterwards um thank you mine's a very minor point and it is looking at the confidential meeting attachments and um I just wanted to give some feedback that the version I'm looking at at bit big tin can hub is very pixelated and actually impossible to read the detail so if we can get that kind of fixed up for next time that'd be great yeah and we might be able to get a hard copy for tonight if you want to discuss anything in the confidential part of the meeting if you need that um sorry so the 90 days is part of the recommendation the report on the 90 days is part of the recommendation that we're going to vote on shortly the question about confidential I think it was why is this confidential is that the question that you wanted to why is it confidential this time okay uh through the mayor we we typically make this report confidential because it provides information uh commercial commercial commercial information about a business which is allowable under put the officers oh sorry counselor press your button and then you come up my screen well I couldn't press my button because it kept on taking over from other people so I kept turning it on and off I just wanted to kind of bring a bit of a discussion that was had at committee into this debate and draw council of uzik's attention to the pie chart on page 110 which I think gave us quite a lot of comfort what we can see there is that 30 percent of that over 90 day debt is actually 270 days and greater so it is harking back to the covered debt that was kind of accumulated by some of our um tenants and we can see that officers have actually done a quite remarkable job bringing down the rest of that debt and particularly if we look at our 30 and 60 days which is the normal period as we accumulate it that we're really looking at staff to target and manage we can see those numbers are starting to fall into what we would expect we acknowledged that work that's happening and also if you are able to read the confidential attachments at some point in time um we can also see that a lot of those debts are beginning to come down and and people are honoring the repayment claims arrangements and we're even getting some lump sum debt so what we've specifically asked in the amended motion is that officers come back to us with reports and recommendation for those debtors whose debt is not coming down and the very small number whose debt is actually continuing to increase because we're concerned that we're not setting businesses up to get deeper and deeper into debt um and at some point in time hey we need to protect our own interests but also you know not locking people into a negative situation so I think you'll feel if we can get a report that's legible that on the whole that debt is coming in the right direction and it is still a big number there are unusual times um but we have certainly asked for that advice direction can I just get a comment from officers as to which committee we expect that report to go to because if it is an item of interest I would recommend councillors come along to the committee discussion where we can get more deeply into the into the debate through the mail I don't think the specific meeting was um identified in in the recommendation but we would hoped at least that that's brought back to the next order and risk committee um but it can be sooner if required perhaps we could target an f poll thanks okay so I will put the item to a vote all those in favor that's unanimous um that brings us to armc eight the information report for february so I'll move the officer's recommendation get a second off of that councillor groom any discussion on the information report yeah press the button thanks just got a couple of questions um I'll look at the the chart on page 122 um it says actions that have been completed in this report impurities fines and we've got at those figures and they're pretty um yeah I would just like to know why aren't we moving a lot faster in resolving um our actions and also and that relates to and this could be something you've already resolved but um if we have a look at the internal controls on page 155 out of 230 in the um I think it's the meeting attachments and it's got um super must the supply master files that was a very significant and it is a high risk and it's still ongoing is this an accurate summary all right so I think there's a general and specific question in that if we can anyone's in a position to comment or we can take it on notice about our number of actions outstanding and then specifically the master files audit action I'd like to take that on notice because we will need to look at the specific tasks that are being referred to in the table so we need some more information well actually if you read that item it's very clear months later and that's a really big red flag I couldn't find that on page 155 in the additional information where are you referring to uh well that was the other issue that's quite poorly numbered but if the meeting documents 155 out of 213. so controls that bring that's it's fremantle technical college demolition on a page 155 so we use the references to the page numbers that are at the bottom of the document I've got a number seven here as well yeah so I can I can I can you can take that on notice but like I said it's pretty clear on it um okay so matt are you clear on what we're talking about um thank you can I just say one more thing on on page 123 with the recommendation there it includes a risk rating not ranking if you don't rank a race due so is that a I'm not sure if that's a correction yeah okay cool um so do we need to amend any words or are we comfortable with the recommendation yeah okay yep okay so we'll move minor amendment to put to change the word ranking to the word rating I'll move it seconded by councillor maflin all those in favor yep so that's carriage and so we'll go back as amended to the officer's recommendation any further debate okay all those in favor and against and council if you're sick against that's it your mic is still on um okay that brings us to c1 fremantle technical college demolition um we have an amended officer's recommendation here and I might just get some officer comment on uh the origins of this small amendment if that's okay so I'll move it and I'll get a second or quickly which looks like councilman and go to the director of planning thank you through you mayor um the applicants in their submitted documents included an arborist report which identified a large number of existing trees on site as being retained through the demolition works we as officers we'd already recommended a condition which is on the screen requiring of how the proponents would manage the impacts of the demolition works on the surrounding area in the community which obviously covers a wide range of issues which are listed in the items a to n um but as we realized late in the day would probably be appropriate just for completeness to also including that list that the management plan should require details of how they're going to protect the trees on site that they've already indicated will be retained so it's just getting confirmation in the form of the management plan of how those trees will be protected notwithstanding that the proponents have already identified which trees would would be retained thank you all right on this item any comment councillor mofflin thank you um yeah I suppose just to speak very quickly to this and and to thank staff for bringing what was I supposed burning away for a very long time and became an urgent item to um come to this meeting as opposed to planning committee meeting to enable the state to get on and do what needs to be done on make but that we are providing comments so thanks to the staff for doing that and also um yeah it's disappointing that what was a functioning building um was left uh standing there for some period of time and has got to the position that it was in and that decisions weren't made either in the past to either utilise that building or demolish it there and then I understand you know always there's always reasons why these things don't happen but there are a number of um members of the community who struck a good balance between reputational issues in and around that area such that they wanted to raise raise the concerns with the building being demolished but also not to denigrate the the area in which they were living so they were quite concerned that um in raising the the risk of anti-social behavior in in in and around that building that that would then create issues more so with reputation of that area and particularly as well you know we know the heart of beaconsfield project and other bits and pieces so with the state with the minister and the like and appreciate the work that they've done uh in regards to that and I really look forward to seeing this building flattened and gone and that we're able to make a a a step in the right direction in beaconsfield now and that's most probably the second time in the last month that I've said I'm happy to see a building gone and the other one was the wool stores in three I went past and I was stoked that was gone and equally my same sentiment on this one here thank you councillor sullivan um thank you just a quick question uh because it was sort of raised uh at the same time as the question about trees I thank the officers for bringing the the amended uh wording um the car park on the the western boundary is um a fairly substantial car park and it does provide or has typically provided parking for market day at the um at the college uh and the like but also um given that there's a building process that might occur there so I'm just wondering whether we can reach out to the government to ensure that that car park isn't unnecessarily demolished I don't imagine there's any good reason to knock it down straight away it would also provide a bit of a buffer zone between what might just be a sandpit for quite a long time or be it you know a dust protected sandpit but by at least having a little bit of a zone uh that's still bituminized does help protect the neighbouring properties from that that's also actually a walkthrough as it currently stands a lot of people actually walk through that area presumably to get to the college but I know I've walked through there to get door knocking but also just to permeate through the suburb and if it turns into a just a building site um a fenced off dust bowl then people won't be able to necessarily do that so I'm not sure if you could tolerate a minor amendment I did sort of ask in a sense list I'm not sure where it would belong but it hasn't been put in the in the office's amended motion so I might seek some guidance I think we could get some offers to comment I mean I think looking at the aerial photographs of that car park if you're retaining the on-site trees you're going to have a job actually trying to not retain that car park given the number of the trees that are in that car park so I do wonder if we might have protected it by protecting the trees but perhaps the director can give us some guidance on how or if we need to do that through you mad first in my apologies I i wasn't aware that cancer sullivan had to raise that issue so it's it's why it wasn't in the wording we put forward tonight um I guess thinking quickly there's two options I mean we we could either do this administratively and simply raise it with the proponents we also have quite a um good working relationship with development wa the application we could raise it administratively if council would prefer it to be in the resolution that becomes the the formal advice to the planning commission um so it's either something that gets included as a condition as something the demolition plan should show um or a standalone point I i mean I think it could be added as an additional point that um could just say something like um arrangements to retain the car park along the western boundary for public use during the demolition period the ceo has actually captained ceo has come up with a suggestion to amend b in the list there which could reflect the oh I don't want to speak for you but to your microphone I guess my only comment to that mayor would be that that's meant to be talking specifically to infrastructure within the road reserve whereas technically this that car park is part of the property not it's not within the road reserve it's within the site boundary so right that might be you know confusing if to the applicants if it's mixed I just think maybe as a separate point is perhaps clearer so certainly I i from an office point we've got no objection if a minor amendment added a what is it a p point p that says um which to the effect of what I just said I can't remember that council sullivan you want to move that way uh absolutely I mean it might just be sort of opportunity to uh maintain the western car park yep well you're asking a lot now all right we'll just get some words out there interim retention of the western country um look just on this one while we're getting the words up there our understanding is that the state government are hoping to move quickly enough to get this demolished during school holidays whether they're able to do that or not is another question but we were fairly keen not to be the stumbling block for that project because obviously with asbestos removal and other things they're pretty keen to do that while school is not in turn how's that look details so it's the interim retention of the car park along the western side site boundary okay second to council of mosslin any debate all those in favor back to the item as amended any further discussion all those in favor great unanimous where does that bring us to um see item two so I'll move the officer's recommendation for the monthly financial report seconded by someone I hope councillor archibald someone wished to speak on this one council of yousek thank you um page 134 I'm not sure what this table the head of that table really means net current assets at the start of the financial year 11.337 million is this supposed to read operating surplus because if I go back to page 132 operating surplus you've got 11.34 million here and the variance it's a big difference can we get some officer comment on that one might be the carry forward uh through the mayor so that figure you're referring to is the carry forward funds from the previous financial year um yeah is that does that answer your question well net current assets at the start of the financial year I'm assuming that that is relating to opening surplus because it follows through on on the figures for the acting ceo saying that's correct okay um on the um in the meeting attachment statement of financial uh position um if we had a look at at 31st of december 2021 you have 8.9 million at the end of reporting net sorry net result year to date 30th of june 2021 when I have a look at the statement that's reported here 31st of february it's got a net net result of 10 million 543 195 what's the reason for the 1.5 odd variants can you clarify where exactly in the report you're referring to in the attachments meeting attachments the the statement of financial position what page are we uh through the chair so we're just clarifying that the net result from last month to this month has changed by 1.5 million is that the query so my understanding is we have had a completed audit change as a result of the audit was adjustment to our balance sheet of one point approximately 1.5 million and that will be brought forward next month when we bring forward the annual financial statements okay sounds like good news councillor archibald thank you I just wanted to suggest that when we have detailed questions that relate to attachments to be really helpful if it could be sent in because flicking from the agenda to the attachment particularly if the attachments are online it's really difficult to do that so so that we can all understand what the questions are it'll be better if we could get it in writing first or just a text or an email private meeting so we can see them and it also means the staff can look it up before the meeting and have an answer for usual thanks councillor archibald I'll put that one to a vote um it says no further discussion all those in favor and against council of you sick against um that's going to bring us the end of the non-confidential agenda because we have no emotions at which previous note has which I am aware this means that we will go behind closed doors to consider the confidential items and the recording and live streaming of the meeting will cease given this is the first time that we've done this I'm going to suggest we take a five-minute adjoinment adjournment and get that word out um to do that so that we reconvene at 8 20 so see you ah no we're going to have an adjournment and then move it I think I don't know you have to move an adjournment or do I need to move it to end the live streaming is that what you're saying that's what kayla's saying with her face come back a minute um all right I'm going to move that we go behind closed doors seconded by someone councillor groom all those in favor okay and now we'll call a five minute adjournment thanks

councillor jones all those in favor and that's unanimous anyone else good probably not all at the same time that's great do we have any disclosures of interest by members on tonight's agenda councillor sullivan uh yes given it's the same item that was presented last month the declaration is I'll declare an impartiality interest in item number c22018 as the matter relates to myself personally and in doing so I'll state that in accordance with the directions in the council chamber during consideration of this matter and to vote on the item notwithstanding uh the real or perceived potential that bias might creep into the decision-making process I'm confident that I will remain impartial during consideration of this item and obviously as required will remain in the meeting and vote thank you any others all good responses to previous question public habit questions taken on notice so they're contained in the agenda any questions that were taken on notice at the meeting council on the 19th of january 2022 and be aware that any statements that were made at that meeting are considered as such and are not recorded in the minutes nor responded to that brings us to public question time I'll group them a court together according to items so I've got a number on planning committee item one so we'll go through those um you are welcome to remove your mask when you are speaking into the microphone so for the recording and for the clarity and then we clean the microphone between users so just take your mask back on straight afterwards so the first person I'll call is bonnie dorian um I would I would just like to make some comments in opposition to the proposed application if possible um good evening council members thank you for the opportunity to address my concerns with you today in relation to the proposed development directly adjacent to my home at unit 2 alfred road north I'm incredibly disappointed that the planning officer has recommended this application for conditional approval again today this is a bad development shoehorned into an already congested area which will have a significant negative impact on the amenity of the adjoining properties including mine I apologize to the councils who've already heard my key concerns a couple of times now but I think it's important to ensure that the full council has a good understanding of the context and inevitable impact of this proposed development I think it's easy to say that a proposed development will not impact the amenity of adjoining properties when you don't live in one of those properties the external wall of the proposed development be built right on our boundary for context our backyards are small courtyards of approximately 5x5 meters we do not have an expansive garden and this development will dwarf us the bulk of the development on our boundary will block what little daylight our garden currently receives and will significantly impact the use of our living areas thank you bonnie my next speaker on this item is lee holder thanks councillors and thank you for your time today I'm the co-owner of to alford road north america with my partner bonnie our home is a small modest two by one house with a rear garden that butts the commercial building in question a rear garden a bunch of boundary wall on the northern side this proposal has now been through two planning committee meetings where various concerns have been raised by councillors on the planning committee in addition to nearby residents throughout the course of this application numerous design issues have been raised regarding the compact nature of this development and where the view there has been significant lack of consultation and procedural fairness in considering the impact that part of north carolina the development is proposed to be constructed right up to the northern boundary of our property with no setback the proposed wall which is immediately a rear of our courtyard is proposed to be eight meters from the natural ground level while we understand the previous development applications were approved for the property which allowed construction on the boundary we were advised that this approval was given on the basis that the proposed available design commercial and the proposed wall was on the northern boundary had no major openings the current application converts the use of the property to residential and proposes the addition of six outdoor entertainment areas in the form of open balconies to be constructed right up against outback fence the proposed eight meter wall and normal boundary is unusually tall for the surrounding area will restrict natural light and ventilation to the adjoining properties and based on the explanatory guidelines in the residential design codes outdoor living areas have an impact at least equal to or usually greater than those indoor living areas and ought to be treated similarly in terms of and increase noise bonnie's already mentioned the parking issue and we also believe that it will have a disruptive impact on alfred road where the rubbish now has to be collected on elf of road with 12 additional unit holders in a small arterial road that goes in an hour north from mantle it's while the bedrooms have been moved around has been suggested the plants will be growing to respect the product respect the privacy neighboring properties the fundamental premise of the development hasn't changed there remains no setback it's been suggested that the 1.6 meter screen will prevent people from looking into the yard this mix represents the impact of all the balconies across the entire development the apartments will come straight up to the back fence these measures are not adequate it's being suggested the balconies on the upper floor joining the property will be screened by planter boxes how will these planter boxes be maintained and how and can they be removed this is an ad hoc measure importantly the plants miss open represent the height of our property as mentioned as the liquor land which we believe is misleading and further exacerbates the impact of the world war this is not a long-term solution simply a piecemeal attempt to quell the concerns of the residents in the short term to get the plans approved the fact that the same application moved from commercial and popped up as residential of the southerners a testament to this in 2020 we wrote to the owner regarding works carried out at blue peter again in the construction of a pergola we received no response from the owner at all at that time the owner has recently had altercations with nearby residents and from his past behaviour we have grave concerns over the owners sticking to the application as drafted and abiding by the conditions including during construction with respect I have no concerns regarding an owner's right to develop their property however the fundamental issue with this development is is an ill-fitting shoe originally the proposal was for the developer to be commercial in nature this planning application has now morphed into twelve residential proponents which is more geared to packing as many top of the shops I have to ask you to wrap up because you're at the end of your three minutes so yes this is a situation where commercial landowner is looking for profit over functionality departments are small they have very little ventilation particularly in the second bedroom and the six north-facing apartments effectively have balconies that could be blocked out in the future if the owner wishes to develop property it should be done in the consultation with existing landowners in the area where a more tasteful development can be undertaken that considers the amenity and public use of this important part of north korea okay our next favorite speaker on this item is david smith good evening I'm speaking in support of the officer recommendation for approval um thank you mayor and councillors for your time we've made multiple presentations on this project so I'll try not to repeat myself and I'll just simply summarise a project in some some key points if I can this project is an absolute reflection of the objectives of the local planning scheme with a diversification is actually relatively modest compared with what is allowable on the site the current mixed use proposal is we think is preferable to the currently approved 100 commercial redevelopment which has some slight greater scale and probably less landscaping and planting than the current proposal it's a highly sustainable development that will make use of innovative construction system that will minimise construction time and impact on neighbours it balances the commercial and public uses with high quality private spaces which we think again is in keeping with the planning scheme all parking requirements are contained within the site the design has been through several reviews with the city's design advisory committee and received positive comments all the proposed apartments have a high level of amenity both internal and external and really to use the committee member's own own words from the last meeting there is almost no reasonable basis on which not to approve this application thank you okay our next speaker on this item and I've been told we need to get quite close to microphone join us um I need you all to get planning item as well it's brack hoffman it's b-r-e-c-k rick hoffman I live at number four uh alfred road three years my main objection to the development is is parking um there's proposed 12 apartments with roughly two bedrooms there's potential for perhaps four cars that's rented out it could be four cars and there's one car buy and there's 20 cars um thank you all right we've got um still on planning items we've got steve gorman on planning item 12 it looks like which I believe is the heritage inventory heritage survey and heritage list thank you councillors um yes I want to comment on item pc2202 12. I support the objection from the landowner of 63 thompson road based on the listed reasons I don't think it's been given consideration I had no intention of speaking here tonight but I feel I must express my disappointment in the mayor with her attempt to stifle public comment by trying to limit questions or comments at this meeting I would ask if this is the same mayor who asked about the timely significance of democratic voice in fremantle post pride miss fitz harding said love is love for me humanity is exceptionally beautiful because of its diversity we stop growing when we only accept people who are just like steve can you bring this back to the heritage listing please in the spirit of pride in fremantle I would ask that we remember the idea of common humanity in being human we are all inherently different we must slow down sit down and genuinely genuinely understand each other that was a quote from you mrs mayor I'm sure you won't refute it these commendable words could well have been spoken by mahatma gandhi martin luther king or even jesus christ however the actions of mayor fitzharding in attempting to shut down a democratic right of resident rape players to say in this are more likely to be looked on with favor by would-be dictators like putin macron trudeau or mcgowan keep your comments it is do you want to be remembered by your words or by your actions thank you our next speaker is dominic mim two zero two three which I believe is one of the audit reports good evening um I'd like to ask you how long was the process of coming half an hour early and putting your name down on a list to speak in place for in the city of fremantle how long was that process we do have covered restrictions in place so that is why we have some some procedures at the moment could you just answer the question please how long was that process in place you've always had to register before coming to a council meeting I'm not going to get into a debate with you about this dominic if you want to speak on the item you have your three minutes it starts it's already started you've got about two why has public question time been removed from the agenda without sufficient notice to the ratepayers do you want to submit your questions in writing to be included in the response to the next agenda or by doing this how is your decision all inclusive as per your vision statement do'll respond to them in the next minutes if there's genuine questions I would like to speak continue you are denying people who pay your wages a voice I'll ask all you counsellors have you ever drawn 6 000 people to a council meeting before have any of you done that we have the people have drawn 6 000 people here they want to be heard they want to be heard they need to be heard my next statement is address to the mayor you continue to say that the subject of dropping mandates in the city of fremantle is absolutely not in your jurisdiction I've seek legal advice and they have told me it certainly is within your jurisdiction and this comes under the emergency management act of 2005 under sections 36-39 so disappointingly mayor you have misdirected the ratepayers this act empowers you to talk on our behalf and we the people demand that you do that if you do not do this then your ratepayers will be accusing you of discriminating against them bullying and locking us out this does not sit well with maybe the wording will need to be changed I would like to see a retraction of that statement stating you are powerless on the subject of mandates thank you that's your three minutes that you're reluctantly wanting to hold we've been asking you two advocates on our behalf thank you this is happening in other cities for example bus bustleton it can be done thank you it will be done thank you and our next speaker is mark woodcock and mark woodcock is speaking on airpole item nine which is the north fremantle bowling club thanks mark good evening and happy new year um I've got some questions on notice which I'll which I'll bring forward in a second I was speaking about f poll number nine the north ramallah bowling club and on the last page 77 I just had a couple of questions um point a was the ability to demonstrate an ongoing utilization of the facility that is equal or greater than 60 I was just wondering how that would affect something like a crooked ground because you couldn't remove a quicker ground so was that the intent of the actual amendment or have I misread something into into that is it the whole ground I could take away the cooker ground leave the club buildings and then take away a large chunk of the sporting field because that would still be 60 of the actual utilization because it's a car park in a building so I just wanted to get some clarification on point a I'll ask the acting director of city business to answer that one itself is used so um the facilities in total we would hope that um it's used 60 of the time over the year so rather than sitting there being used once a day we would hope that it's utilized more often than that it's not about taking any particular piece of the um facility away it's more about how generally it's utilized over time okay thank you for that but I think that's a little bit vague it doesn't actually say that I mean you could infer that but it doesn't say how you will actually lease out rate payers and you know local government property so I think things like that need to be clarified because that's not how you would read it I mean from a layman's point of view and who would be going into it you'd be saying okay I can use 60 of the ground for playing cricket I'll make the ground smaller and put something else on it or use it for another purpose which defeats the purpose of the actual ground itself point b the facility is made accessible to the broader community which is a good a good point and the extent to which diversity of use will be achieved can be demonstrated so if you had something like a sporting ground again you had a cricket pitch there are activities you can't do in it because it destroys the actual ground itself and the way it functions so while I applaud broader use for any public areas I think it needs to be clarified too that certain protections are put in place so the actual fundamental feature of know I refer probably to sporting grounds because building is a little bit different but they be protected somewhere in the criteria and also in the leasing requirements as well um so I also had a few points which will be in my questions which I'll put on notice and that was what sort of investigation has been done in the past concerns and problems that have been held with various places that have been leased out so we've seen in the press quite a few pages about northrop mantle for the bowling club and the local residents wanting it back we've seen issues with the old putt-putt was on the corner of montreal and high street which was a complaint an issue for neighbours and residents in the area so I just wanted to know what sort of investigation had been done into that and how that was being ensured between the criteria for new potential users and also how the lease was drawn up so the legal issues that were reported to have happened didn't occur again this time so the rest of it I just want to ask those questions before you vote on this particular issue tonight thank you and that certainly is a useful consideration in our discussion um in terms of the 60 which I think we all we're seeking more clarity on in committee as well so it's a good question thank you if you could just hand the to the governance manager there all right thanks so that brings us to the end of public question time um do we have any petitions do we have any we haven't had notice of any deputation special reputations or presentations so um you'll note in your notes that there are some amendments to their minutes for january so I'll just give you a minute to read those so we'll move a confirmation of the minutes with those amendments I'll move that and I'll get a seconder sullivan and I'll put that to a vote all those in favor great elected member communication council music thank you um how the world has changed since our last ocm in january when this chamber freedom this council has set many precedents to give voice to community issues and I applaud them this tradition has cast a wide net to be called grassroots democracy we need to preserve this tradition because picking and choosing which community issues the council will champion is not an option now we have set the bar high and it must be extended even to issues that we do not support to give voice to our community is a privilege to pass the feedback on to state government is a duty omicron will continue to be here for a long time just like influenza and the measles and we will deal with it because to be human is to be a risk-taker I want to share with you two stories that came from a compassionate doctor and are examples of the cost of living in fear and isolation the doctor attended an elderly woman in her home where she lived alone with her pets she has not ventured out into the community for months the doctor after a short examination knew she was dying she was hospitalized and died three days to see a woman and her child because they could not enter the surgery due to symptoms the child simply had tonsillitis fear is a terrible way to live fear as a strategy becomes like a club looking for a nail it is my view that had we had our builder or silent generation in power there would be no mandates no emergency powers no isolation no fines no one losing their jobs and no threats this generation regardless of the left right or middle politics agreed on basic freedoms this was a generation that fought bled and died for democracy and human rights in the second world war and the korean war and sadly not many of them are with us now in memory of my parents who were the survivors of the yugoslav communist gulags of the 1950s I will speak for freedom for all australians this was a society that othered a section of their community with disastrous results I cannot stand by and let my country follow the steps and mistakes of my ancestors for us to be truly the land of the free we need freedom and compromises the doctor-patient relationship the government needs my permission to enter my body my bedroom and into my beliefs thanks councilman offline uh thank you I just wanted to give an update on an event that happened now some time ago in december uh last year and uh I suppose the opportunity to communicate that hasn't hasn't arisen yet but I'll take that chance tonight to talk about the state of the blue economy which the city was a sponsor of and at the state of the blue economy event it's a forum that's been held for a number of years now which brings together representatives from the blue economy right through from the likes of people who run free diving courses large-scale fisheries and research institutions the asp the aspiration of the forum uh is to make wa the leading blue economy of the indian ocean prior to 2030. it's really strongly aligned to the aspirations of the city of fremantle and I think one of the things that I took away I was a participant in one of the panel particularly was the the joining of creativity and scientific endeavor and it really struck me that fremantle is the place where that would be um the the right place in western australia for that to occur and there is certainly a lot of energy around that um some of the work that the economic development team has been doing and in particular in regards to the innovation hub and looking to develop new industries was pretty exciting as well so the draft report has been completed on the forum I'll share that with elected members and would also I suppose encourage you to stand some of the the industries that are involved in the blue economy and the opportunities that that are that are available thank you councilmoflin and I attended that too and it was a really fantastic event councillors any other elected member communication I'll just touch briefly on the arrangements for tonight and going forward there is a balance we need to strike between effective operations of council and providing a forum for other discussions um given the significant space and time public question times is we gave significant time to this in december in january for this meeting and because I was getting concerned from people who have items of business on this agenda we have restricted public question time to items on this agenda so where people haven't written down what their agenda item is I'm sorry so which if you could tell me the item number in the agenda sorry that's not an item on our agenda um as I was saying this month it's really important that we get through some of the legitimate business of council and if I've got people who don't want to attend because I think the council meeting will be used up on I guess issues outside our jurisdiction then that's a problem for us conducting our business moving forward we're looking at our meeting procedures for a number of reasons one of them being that we probably do need a method of submission for people who are not able to attend meetings in person because we are likely as we have had tonight to have elected members others can't_''_2353.359 be here so we are having a look at how our meeting procedures work in a covert environment live streaming which we welcome is a really good start to that I would also like to note that we've received valid form 1 for special electors meeting on the issue of vaccine mandates this will be held next month and any motions will come through to the march council meeting the date and venue for that are likely to be announced later on this week meanwhile we can dedicate our efforts and resources to the many opportunities we have to build the long-term success of our fabulous city so we'll get into the business of the evening thank you so I'm going to move the office's recommendation for pc1 which is the sterling highway item do I have a second of the officer's recommendation counselor joins councillors over to you anyone we wish to speak on this item councillor groom then councillor jones uh yes the neighbours have pointed out this is the third time that um we have considered this those of unable to support this development in part because of the impact on the neighbouring residential properties and the wall height plays into that but the wall height is similar to that previously approved for another development proposal but it's more the configuration of six outdoor living areas right along that boundary line um the noise that comes from people just even having quiet enjoyment of their outdoor living area is intrusive on neighbours we've all had the circumstance when we've heard our neighbors out on their patio or their deck just having a family dinner party when you multiply that by six and your house is only five meters from that boundary it's a pretty extreme impact so that is one of my concerns about this proposal the apartment design policy would normally require setback for building such of this from the back from the boundary to start to deal with that impact the apartment design policy also requires a range of other amenity controls for apartments and was recently introduced by the state government to improve the quality of apartments for people living in them daylight and more importantly access to external views this design we're pushing the external wall of six of the apartments right to the boundary with no windows for those apartments except one high level window which only gets sunlight in winter none in summer and would have very limited view output outlook denies those apartments of that daylight and external view look those six apartments on the south side of the development their outdoor living area is a screened terrace that directly abuts an internal unroofed but internal private circulation circulation space that is utilized by all 12 units to access their apartments so using that outdoor living space affords those people no genuine privacy as their um any conversation they would be having would be completely overheard by anyone else using that terrace and this screening is does not give them full visual privacy in addition the bedrooms of the six apartments across the walkway from those apartments have their windows onto that space so anyone using those outdoor living areas would be directly conflicting with the apartments this design that gives poor amenity to occupants and sets is not a good outcome and I know the proponent is arguing that they are meeting affordability requirements and that is certainly one of the challenges we've got at the city but I don't believe that this level of compromise is what's a fair outcome for any resident and I don't believe that this type of apartment design is what we are really looking for as a city and it's certainly not the type of outcome that is supported by the apartment design policy so I have found myself unable to support this proposal the number of times we've considered it uh councillor langeon listed next to speak thank you we touched on it in the last meeting and we absolutely want people living in these locations close to train stations that's where we want to increase our density around fremantle and also acknowledge in the last minute this is a really really tough site it undulating is a main road there's small houses next door which makes it tough for any architect to design and this particular site is made tougher have brought in an existing building in that location the result we're getting what's in front of us at the moment and I voted against this last week because of the loss of amenity on the immediate neighbours and interestingly I voted in favor of the previous commercial development there because it didn't have the same impacts on the neighbours so I would like to see a smart development in this site that can stand the test of time and support the amenity of the neighbours in the street but also the many of the neighbors that are living in the building and sustainability was touched on and looking at this design thinking to myself how long could this this building stand in north romania if it was the site was reimagined and a new design was brought forward could suddenly be built that is there for 50 or 100 years if it's done right and something that brings better amenity to the occupants and the neighbours so they're the reasons why I didn't support it last week and I can't support it little confused I did have councillor jones on it and he disappeared and then so I i was going to give you the call councillor jones but up to you yeah I just want to provide a little bit of feedback from the meeting the um the design was referred to the design advisory committee and they came to the view that the amenity was acceptable um except the the apartments are fairly compact and 12 together could have issues but the detailed look by the design advisory committee came to the conclusion that it was acceptable the current da that's approved for 12 officers is actually likely to have greater parking and traffic impacts than this one I think that needs to be taken into consideration and the roof form is somewhat higher um although the walls that you know obviously there are not people on balconies above people's gardens and finally I think just to correct something that was mentioned that the parking for this apartment is fully compliant it's entirely contained within the building the issues of parking are more to do with the area of north fremantle the back of these this building is used by people going on the train presumably when the apartments if the apartments or the offices are built then the owners will put restrictions in place on that parking to make sure it's used properly by the occupants at the moment um there are literally cars all over thompson road purely people accessing the train station to go to perth so I don't think the parking and traffic issues are necessarily an issue for this development they're an issue for the whole area thank you councillor pemberton um thank you I i feel really challenged by this one because I really like the idea um when I was doing some research into this sort of stuff we're referring to it as shop top apartments and it is actually the kind of development that I think would be really really suitable particularly in an area like this however I was concerned with some of the comments and and the recommendations made by the dac that don't seem to have been fully um addressed by and I guess I tend to um therefore er on um in agreement with councillor groom in terms of just concerns around the amenity for the neighbors but also the people the occupants of the building once they're actually in and I feel like um if there was it's a bit of an overdevelopment of the site essentially and if there were a couple more single bedroom apartments that then you could pull it back from the boundary and you could relocate balconies and so on then you would actually be able to do this and I would really really like to approve this um but yeah on balance and with with particularly the dac's views in mind and that issue around amenity I mean even things like having a caveat on the lot that actually says if this get if next door neighbors decides to build an extra story then you're not going to get any daylight anymore that to me is deeply concerning you can't kind of build that into a I think that flies in the face of good planning basically so thank you um I won't speak a great deal about this because I concur with my colleagues who have spoken against this application to date for me the most fundamental thing is the amenity of the people who live adjacent to have five or six balconies immediately overlooking um your back garden or your whole entire property is pretty intrusive and I do think to get residential there would be fantastic and I'm quite sure that they'd be able to redesign it and come up with something um I concur with the against um argument I think there is there is room for a building here I think there is uh it just needs to go back and look at the amenities and also speak with the the neighbors and I'm sure that there is a building there but uh not this one so I won't be voting for it thank you councillor sullivan um thank you um I guess the the starting point for me is the zoning for this area so it is a mixed use zone it is a zone that actually very difficult site which is what has been expressed by others and the notion that the the volume 2 codes are going to deliver us sort of a standard apartment building in this location where they're trying to make it affordable and by by renovating an existing building you know the reason it's affordable is because they're keeping a huge amount of embedded energy and if they were essentially required to start again it sure as hell wouldn't be affordable and then you'd ask the question um would someone buy a luxury apartment on on the sterling highway in that location and I suspect the answer would be probably no if they uh weren't building on an existing structure perhaps they wouldn't be going right to the edge but that's where the structure goes to things like the balconies and the like I mean I can think of many warehouse developments in fremantle where you start with basically a building a big shed and you build within it and I've I haven't lived in one of those personally but I have an outlook to anything great um you know I've looked over a marshalling yard I wouldn't describe that as a great outlook um and it's not for everyone you know some people um absolutely would kill to be how to live in these sorts of apartments in the amenity location that this is and they would normally be afforded out of this environment because most of the apartments that are going to be built in these areas are like the ones at layton beach this and the volume 2 codes actually do talk about this I mean they do still allow walk-up apartments which have obviously have a lot less amenity than the sort of apartments that people normally normally live in so I you know I i know the codes are great they're a really excellent step forward but they're a little bit like they are you know the residential um lower density codes as well they do tend to favor this notion that the one size fits all the almost uh planning is all about what you do in a brand new of accommodation into pre-existing environments so for me the the issues of the amenity are for the residents internally um I you know I imagine there are people lining up to live exactly like this and the notion that you know I might live in apartment buildings which are very close to each other old-fashioned ones the notion that you know every second residents going to be partying every night is very quickly sorted out within a building it's very quickly dealt with and it's not normally you know residential partying and noise and loud music and the light that disrupts these types of buildings it typically is more you know potentially mental health or drug and alcohol issues so it's not everyday living it's actually society issues and those can happen in any building and they can happen in any situation people have said well you know there's six balconies overlooking um you know I i would prefer a system that actually um didn't just rely on solid fixed screens to 1.6 meters but that is the system and this is absolutely compliant going to get is if someone stands up on a chair or stands up on the table or does it anything like that and um again frankly you can get that from a residential neighbor in a single residential area it doesn't you know it doesn't we shouldn't presuppose that people living in apartments are all going to be wanting to stand up on the table and look over the you know 1.6 metre solid screen and see what the neighbors are doing um so I look I have sympathy for the neighbours obviously it's a mixture zone when you've got a single residence single-story single residence in that zone you certainly do feel put out by apartment building built next door there are a few examples of exactly that in south fremantle where you've got a three-story building fairly close so issues of over overshadowing are normally the issues but I think in this instance because this building is on the southern boundary of those properties it's it's not as bad and it's certainly in my view permissible basically's not this development I don't think there would be a development we've already approved a development of a similar scale albeit not residential so I'm yeah I have to I have to support it because it's it's a good development for the area and it's been through a process with the dac think it's a reasonable building and a reasonable outcome so I'm going to support it any further counselors wishing to speak um so I went out a lot other than to say that I will be supporting um this one on a very similar basis to councillor sullivan I think also in the knowledge that the alternative which is and you know an office development which is approved um you know it doesn't address some of our strategic objectives which include getting more affordable housing into the area but it will have a similar bulk impact parking all of those issues so that's the approved development in my view we're moving away from the approved development to something that at least has some strategic benefit in I will be supporting it so if no one else wishes to speak I will put this to a vote so those in favor of the officer's recommendation and against so that's carried okay this brings us to item two which is the third item on racks street um councillor jones I rather you so preciped your role before you may wish to move the officer's recommendation and I'm just curious if I could ask you madame there was no request from the um applicants to defer this or refer it there is a proposed amendment by councillor sullivan but I do think there's also been some an email yeah so if we open we'll need to open debate on it regardless okay well I'll move the officer's recommendation but just a bit of background the original officer's recommendation at the committee was to approve all of the demolition the committee amended that to retain certain parts of two structures as remnants of the industrial heritage since that's the resolutions in the main agenda there is also an amendment which refine the uh remnant they would like to keep so I will move the officers the committee recommendation and presumably then council sullivan will move an amendment so second after the committee recommendation has moved councillor archfold I think had her hand up first councillor archibald yes thank you um I i was sort of happy to support the um committee's recommendation on this but I just wanted to raise um the issue on demolition because in the same agenda tonight we've got the demolition of the tafe site which has had 50 years as I understand it from the agenda 50 years of youth and occupation as an education institution and it did actually have some quite interesting looking buildings but we are we are able to argue that none of that is worth keeping um and yet here I mean I know the buildings might be a little bit older but some of them are very um you know there's not we're going to have to undo most of those buildings to even be able to keep any any of the structure um and um sorry they were ever intended to be um necessarily buildings that would last a long long time so I i just kind of felt I just wanted to raise the question because I kind of wonder whether it might be better to have just a clean slate and get some really good quality buildings happening on that site without it being constrained the development being constrained by little bits sort of which I worry that sometimes they can be a bit token um little bits of the past that don't then fit in with whatever people are going to be building in the present so um I just wanted to throw those ideas in at the end of the day if the developer is willing to take on board what the committee recommendation is that's you know I'm happy to work with that but I do think that some of some of the the line is very thin and arbitrary on just how we make decisions about some of this I feel and so that's basically what I want to say thank you can I an email from the applicants was that only sent to certain people and councilman often hasn't either the reasonable question we'll look into that um should we continue debate in the meantime council sullivan um thank you uh I opened an email very late in the day and I have subsequently forwarded it on I did correspond with the applicants to provide them with a copy of the exact same document that I provided to elected members on monday evening I think it was and I'll just so for those who haven't got it uh it's from eric denham who's from the uh the planning consultants um he was the chap who spoke to us at the council meeting last month um and it just says we would welcome the opportunity to discuss with council and are supportive of the referring of the application back to the planning committee next week and that is in response to my emailed to them basically saying that I was aware that mr garbett had been speaking to them and the possibility of referring it back and giving more detailed face-to-face conversation about what their concerns uh constraints or ambitions are in this matter so that's just to give you that detail so sorry council I didn't open it until about 5 30 something today and I immediately emailed it on to you oh I think I think I did sorry yeah okay it was hiding yes um look I i suppose I have to speak now because I've got the floor um counsellors I mean I've I've obviously put a lot in in my email to you all um and I did that because it for me helps me process the situation and that's a difficult situation and I um it was interesting I think this almost would have sailed through um with certainly me being asleep at the well I i would admit um and it was only when the community came to the planning committee I think it was um and really said what you know what's going on I mean you know our northern mantle heritage area talks specifically about the importance of the heritage uh of kind of like process of thinking well okay this is just one application we've had a couple of other applications that have actually uh seen the demolition of some fairly minor buildings here and there but then when I went back and had a look at the entire pressing you know for me I look at it and go well these are the only buildings that would be worthy of conservation in that sector in that entire area coming off brack street and so if it's not these ones which ones which ones were we referring to when we wrote a heritage area put a heritage listing area over north fremantle and specifically talked about the late marshalling yards and industrial heritage so if not these buildings which ones in terms of heritage I mean we are now confronted obviously and it's a daunting situation of having both our own internal assessment and um three external assessments saying that they're that they don't consider there is some or more uh cultural significance uh they do admit that there is um you know there is cultural little below some kind of mark well that's a mark that's I have to say is pretty subjective in the scheme of things um you know that it it will vary from community to community and it will vary from council to council and our job is to actually determine whether we're happy where that line has been established and and whether or not these buildings fall on one side of the line or the other side of the line and the more I've read and the more that is put in front of me the more and having seen the buildings having seen the amount of jarrah that's in that building and still in that building as it was when it was first put up there more than 100 years ago or almost 100 years ago is for me very impressive you know these aren't 1960s sheds these are actually quite old buildings um and if I if they were part of the biscuit factory in south fremantle we would have already kept them if they were part of a number of the kept it and it's just because it's in this massive industrial estate that's kind of our you know that none of us have actually really been a part of for a very long time we've only really seen it from the outside that that we weren't aware we weren't conscious of the importance of these buildings I had the very same reaction when I went into sea lanes sheds in the 1990s because they were looking at redeveloping that whole site and it was a big proposal for five and six story apartment buildings and I remember going in there going oh these buildings are way different on the inside than they are on the outside they've been re-clad on the outside they don't look like old buildings on the outside and I was suddenly surprised by that and actually felt I've kind of like let the community down I haven't really recognize that I should be standing for these buildings and I was so happy when um the brewery went into those buildings because now they've been saved I gotta say those buildings in south fremantle where the breweries are probably much less important than the ones that are over in brack street so on the basis of that I really feel like these do fall across what has traditionally been our line in the sand and they do have some significance and more important that significance is actually elevated by the rarity value that exists because they are the only one now the issue is not for me whether they have heritage or not I hope others are convinced that they do the issue I think really is how do you incorporate that meaningfully into what will most likely be a new development and that's kind of a conversation for another day but I think you'll see that in the amendments that I've been trying to put forward certainly conscious of that the developer does have a challenge always to try and incorporate them and the amendment that I am putting forward today is an effort to try and bring all of the elements that need to be conserved in a meaningful way conglomerated together in a way that actually allows the optimization of the development of the rest of the land but still delivers you know what I think would probably be the best conservation outcome which is the conservation of what were the fronts of the buildings we don't know them as the fronts of the buildings anymore but what were the fronts of the buildings and a reasonable amount of the sheds behind so that you can get a feel for what they were like so that's what the the amendment actually does um I think it's probably useful I mean there I will actually flag that I'll move a referral back to committee but I wouldn't mind putting the amendment first and seeing if that gets approved and then put through the procedural motion afterwards obviously because we can't really debate that so I'll move the my amendment so I've got an amendment on the screen moved by council sullivan seconded by councillor jones speaking on the amendment so um perhaps I can just say a few words to amendment if did thanks yeah um I was very comfortable what we passed last week these changes now I didn't have the foresight or the benefit of actually going on the site tour I understand more of the planning committee did go on site tour so this is these are quite substantial changes and I don't have the context of what what I mean there's words in the page but don't know what that means in terms of the real building so I don't know if my colleagues have got any thoughts on these changes whether it's drastic or what they've seen um if there is a is a referral back to committee I would absolutely support that because that would give me the opportunity to go and look at what these changes are um I was very happy with how things were last week just seeking more context and these changes counselor groom I think it's a fair question from councillor lang my sense is that the amendment is a more accurate representation of councillor sullivan's original intention in his amendment and was represented but I think the ability to refine that because for the proponent this amendment is involves even retaining a bit more than what was considered by council at the last meeting I think it does give us a better heritage outcome it's a more complete retention of the elements that are important and if I could just take the opportunity to add to councillor um sullivan's commentary one apart from retaining some of the important built form that is part of the industrial heritage of the area this proposal really allows us to heart back and show the original street grid in the area because the main wall that is proposed for attention was designed to front a street that no longer exists but this area did have a fine grain of cross streets that is completely lost so the wall's kind of really important on that level as well in terms of an urban form and to speak to councillor archibald's concerns we've got to remember that overall this is a tiny part of a really large development site so we're site it is one part of a much greater development area with a development form and land uses that haven't yet been determined so by kind of putting a bit of a footprint on the bits of heritage that want to be kept early on it allows the proponent to work around that and plan an overall urban response that works with that rather than envisaging that somehow you know a building might be have to squeezed around this I think we do have to think about this in the whole site um and that again to go to councillor sullivan's argument that without this that whole history is obliterated um and and we we lose all that reference to the industrial past and the nature of development in this area as it historically was but I would support that we try to negotiate this better with the proponent um and referring it back to the committee is the right approach but I'm certainly comfortable at the moment in principle to support this amendment councilman thank you um yeah I suppose in the first instance I got this evening councillor graham for keeping this up to council a bit of a bug bearer of mine committee had done its work and made a decision and for for mine that was the decision in having said that I suppose what counselor graham has done has meant that um that the proponent has now reached out and is looking to come up with a better solution so so for myself uh absolutely support the idea of maintaining the industrial character and the the significant heritage of some of these aspects I would prefer though that rather than passing amendments this evening is that it does go back to committee and committee sorts that out as part of doing doing the work of committee rather than trying to to put it through tonight and leave it stand on the um the the mat as it as it came to council and we just refer it back but um yeah out of respect to councillor sullivan for the work that he's done um I'll let him make that call one way or another thank you yes just on this really good thing to be able to leave some hints of the past and the history of uh fremantle I think that the when you look at places like the biscuit factory and even richmond raceway sorry um it's nice to be able to go visit those places and feel that link to the past so where it can be done in such a way that development is still able to prosper then I think that it's a good way to go and whether whether it's referred back to the committee or we support the amendments I'm quite comfortable thank you councillor jones um thank you just a couple of points that haven't been covered um the application of demolition is not because the applicants want to build anything it's unlikely they've able to build anything for five to ten years because they're waiting for a metropolitan regional scheme amendment which has now been rolled into the future fremantle discussions so the reason they want need to demolish and have to demolish is because the level of asbestos contamination now has reached _''_4579.44 to be removed that's irrespective of whether keep any building or not and I suppose my argument would be let's get rid of the asbestos and the rest of the buildings that are not worthy clean up the brickwork and the wooden trusses that we're looking to keep leaving there for five or ten years and then see if they fit into what's been proposed in the future I mean they have no plans they don't even know where the coast the coastal reserve will be they don't even know how much of their land will be developable so it's not a matter of entering development or preventing development it's really trying to retain a couple of remnants of these buildings in the hope that they can be incorporated in the future I mean they could have a temporary use um for anybody that's visited the site there is a building they are retaining which uh they provide to a charity which uh I think does work with uh veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder uh and they I don't think move them out of this building once they got the asbestos report and moved them into another building on site which will be kept for a while that's the white little single story white building which is quite an attractive little building so it's not a matter of clearing the site in order to do anything they can't build roads

 foreign the idea one day came about through discussions between the council and elders in our community that led to some conversations in the council realizing maybe if we could start to do australia differently and do it better when we went out to our community and to the elders they're like actually we don't want you to try and make january 26 better because that can never be good what we want you to do is do something on another day the reason why I think we did was powerful was rather than just kind of talk about it we actually did something we actually said no we are just going to change the date on which we celebrate he wasn't telling anybody else to change it but we're kind of opening that invitation in some ways what we didn't realize is that would kick off this kind of national kind of conversation around this the west australian newspaper ran a series of cartoons of me standing in this park with a with a single firecracker and and like a couple of how miserable is this this idea that we were just being a negative damn squid on this whole thing and it was so wonderful and so powerful that instead of that we had 15 000 people come out to this extraordinary celebration of coming together I recall the first time the one day celebration began it was on this very reserve and as I looked around that day at all the different people that were present people from all cultures all colours all gathered together on this ground I thought to myself I'm looking at a statement of reconciliation people from all races coming together to be together I someone acknowledged the first nations people that knew now the watchup people who have built this place in their hands for thousands of generations today the city of fremantle you magnificent people you are providing a leading light today by example you are throwing your hearts out and you're inviting everybody it's including everyone to be part of something that is truly remarkable and look at you look around you what a beautiful like it's been amazing from that first year which was extremely special everyone remembers that all the artists came together to do a rendition of pork kelly's from little things big things grow and that in many ways is kind of been come a bit of the theme song for this in some ways because this was a little thing it was a small step it was a step with our elders with the aboriginal community with the broader freo community who actually largely supported this from that we've seen something far bigger grow that conversation growth the one day event to me it means a lot and means respect well the one day celebration too to me is everything it's a movement and the movement just keeps continuing one day is an event that creates a conversation it's a conversation that aboriginal people become a part of the main aim is to create this dialogue so that everyone can see all different angles to a celebration and it's inviting aboriginal and non-aboriginal people to stand together in that conversation and then saying how't we find is this multicultural nation that reflects all the diversity that we have in australia a date that's palatable to all rather than to one cultural group so the conversation should not be about whether should be the 26th of january the conversation should be what is the date that's acceptable to everyone I actually love the idea of celebrating this amazing special place that we live in with this extraordinary history going back you know 65 000 plus years so that idea that we do that all together on a day that everybody can celebrate and I had a glimpse of what that looked like it still makes me emotional where there really was people celebrating together change makes a lot of people uneasy but when we look across australia we are now seeing other councils changing the day for me today is all about fremantle and its community coming together and standing as one my heart feels happy because not on the day that signifies sadness and oppression and genocide yeah it means a lot you know look at all the non-indigenous community here they feel like family because they love and celebrate us and show respect and understanding from where our heart is the way forward is keeping going on this journey a journey that is about respect that is about acknowledging we've got to walk together acknowledging the painful past but acknowledging that a better future is one where we acknowledge this nation's history and we go together in a spirit of reconciliation of healing of doing that together and I i think that's at the heart of one day what's happening now is the way to move forward when you look around and you see all the people standing out there clapping hands dancing coming down walking through the smoke we're just cleansing shaking in that's what we've been looking for for a long time the date will change it may take several more years we've gone about this exactly the right way which is that we're walking with our community in a steady way in a way that is about reconciliation and and walking together you
So Hilton is recognized by the city for its heritage value as a planned Garden Suburb and this is characterized by wide verges open streetscapes generous landscaping and curvilinear streets a significant part of this is ensuring that surveillance and connectivity between street and houses is achieved so originally fencing in the suburb of Hilton was quite low in height and very simple in design and materials however many homes actually had no fencing at all and this character is a vital component of the heritage fabric of the suburb and it's one of the city is really keen to retain in recent times has been some community concern about the maximum street fencing height allowed within our Hilton Heritage Area policy so we're considering some changes to the policy we want to achieve a balance between allowing an increase in height and maintaining the character and heritage value of Hilton there are four things to consider with fences it's the height the amount you can see through the material and the character of surrounding horns variations to the policy that can be considered on a case-by-case are permitted up to 1.2 meters in height however they must be at least 50% see-through and can have a low solid wall we're proposing some additional flexibility to allow for different fencing styles either higher than 1.2 meters or slightly less see-through to find out more information and to see details about our community information session as it might say for you
 after careful consideration consultation with our elders and with heavy hearts we've made the difficult decision to postpone this weekend's one-day smoking ceremony due to the uncertainty around the coca-19 pandemic we know this decision is going to be disappointing for a number of you who look forward to this event every year and celebrating an inclusive event down on baylor's beach but we're taking this decision for the health and the safety of our community particularly the most vulnerable in it they're growing clusters in nearby cool bluff and village are concerning for fremantle so we'll continue working with our elders and the aboriginal community in general who currently have significantly lower vaccination rates than the rest of the population on ways to ensure that they're safe during spending the great thing about one day is that it's held on a day that's an alternative to the 26th of january which leaves us with pretty much every other day of the year so we hope one day soon to bring this inclusive event back to you in fremantle
It's really important to keep pools like this which are all too quickly disappearing and this one was built by the community the funds were raised by the pier so it's it's even more important because of that walls like this which have been part of the community for such a long time part of the fabric of the community and Mike GaN Valley being such a small suburb has a relatively small and very very engaged community and this hall it's just been at the hub you know we've had PNC events and school events here classes get held here all kinds of events the square dancers of such a familiar sight now if they're big skirts and you know when the square dancers are in the valley so it's hard to imagine the valley without it the association was so grateful for the effort and the know-how that put into it that they named the hall so in recognition of even inside now not much has changed we're a very small group and we grew to huge numbers we would who night at a dance and I have been square dancing this hall for nearly 60 years this hall has the best memories for me it's a living treasure yeah just walking in here it's like walking into the hall as it was you know 1960s it is not a lot of difference between what it was like then to what it is today other than it's it's nicely painted on the out these new toilets out there I think celebrating the 60th birthday is a wonderful thing to do and I think it's good to give it the recognition that it deserves you know that it has been an important component the valleys residents live you
 one of the exciting things about wally lap court is that playground it is fantastic so there's something for all ages there there's right from the little kids through to the bigger kids it's a really fun environment and it should be because it was designed with kids so we went out there and talked to kids and said what is it that you'd like to be playing on and they gave us some feedback and it's been incorporated into the design my favorite thing is probably the trampoline because it's really fun but I also like how they use the shape of the city like the crane and the old buildings as the inspiration we've taken inspiration from everything that's local in fremantle it's a reflection of the architecture it's reflection of industry and the wharf the trains the boats things that make fremantle so iconic in terms of its identity and look and feel I like it because it's open and there's so much to do like you can climb the materials used idea to try and balance the industrial side of what fremantle is through a lot of painted steel but still vibrant and colourful and then offset that with sort of more natural elements like timber and mulches and gravels and so forth to sort of soften the space again I like the swing because it goes fast and it's really cool it's been absolutely amazing sort of seeing how people are starting to interact with this space I just love looking out there seeing the kids hearing the laughter it's a lot of fun

It is 15 degrees in perth right now you're watching 9 news at 5 as we return to a greyish winter's day premier mark mcgowan's promising not to bend strict covert rules to accommodate a possible footy grand final in the west while optus stadium's emerging as the top contender to host the big game the afl remains wary of our history of snap lockdowns let's welcome our pulse guests this afternoon special guests tv legend rove mcmanus and fremantle's deputy mayor andrew sullivan to talk this over hello hello I'm on roy you've been to a grand final uh I have been to a grand final 2013 when is it worth it is it worth it just to have a grand final here in wa absolutely and I think that they'll do it surely like the idea of we'll be like the kids who have a pool in summer like if we're the only place that you can have a grand final suddenly we'll be everyone's best mate so the prospect excites you it does excite I'm very excited andrew what would you do to make it clover proof would you go as far as compulsory jabs for punters perhaps um look I like the idea of the um no jab no seat um so that would be pretty good but look in all honesty it'll be a fantastic event send the teams over send the staffers over maybe leave the uh the afl codery back in melbourne behind the closed border and just let the people the footy fans of perth go to the footy we don't care who's playing we'll be there yeah we'll be there before this time of year season comes down to something being mathematically possible that's exactly what I was going to say to you roy what do you think of the chances are freo playing in perth well look it's look it's possible I'll be honest I don't know if I'm meant to be here today I just came in hoping to get matthew pavlich's autograph and took a wrong turn so I hope he's it's all dependent on other teams losing and isn't that a great place to be exactly all right next up the after paid day sale is back on from today through to sunday offering a massive list of discounts from big brands but can we afford the bargain the system has been criticized for encouraging struggling consumers to take on debt that they can't handle andrew is it wrong to tempt vulnerable people into more financial debt or do we just have to take responsibility for our own impulse control yeah look I don't think it's the after pay that's the problem and we've had um you know um uh delayed payment type systems for as long as I can remember um but you know what we've got is this sort of rampant consumerism and that's the problem and I think online shopping has only made that even worse so uh really it's about trying to deal with the consumerism that we have as a society what's the weirdest thing you've ever bought on ebay uh you can you can't most of us do love a bargain like a bit too much for our own good perhaps yeah but I think it's a risk worth taking like I love chocolate mousse mon you know that about me and if you said here's a bowl of chocolate mousse I'd go great if you said here's a bucket of chocolate mousse I would just keep going and just until the point where quite clearly it was a bad decision if we're really honest with ourselves I think most of us would do the same okay let's finish today with the fresh petition for the future design of the fremantle traffic bridge it is doubling down on the vision to convert it into a linear park green space allowing for a range of outdoor activities rov you are a former southern suburbs boy do you care to throw any ideas into the mix well I just love that the bridge is still there um uh has it been checked for trolls uh yes there are some there you go maybe just keep the trolls the fact that if you take a wrong turn there you just suddenly end up on leech highway and you don't know what went wrong so I like keeping that thrill and uh I will miss the bridge if it goes but I don't know what the pans are andrew it does seem like everybody's had a say by now how many more suggestions can you take uh look I would just love one good suggestion I mean I think the idea of the highline is a great idea what really troubles me is the design of the new bridges and we're kind of like in perth you know we want perth to be a great city a great place to live and everything but we're leaving the design of our city to those people that build freeways and we're getting really bad outcomes um so yeah let's um let's just run some shade let's keep it something that is really characteristic of freo ah absolutely true puts freo on the map again and put freya on the mat on the you this is my actual hike thanks
Frias one of those places that just gets under your skin the art scene is great there are world renowned painters musicians even writers working alongside people just start in our in their craft we maybe that's why free Oh punch is so much above its weight as a city I don't know I think it's the water and let's face it the beaches are pristine and the sunsets are epic and then you add the culture which is rampant as a special sense of them the weird and the wonderful such a special sense of communities diverse it's inclusive it's been welcoming visitors since the start of its history I know I'm one of them
With cars going slower it means it's safer to walk it's safer to ride and the more people that walk and ride it encourages others to do the same I think fremantle is a very connected community lots of people enjoy walking around going to local cafes so many experiences to be had and connecting with each other fremantle's such a great place to live with a family it makes sense to reduce the speed limit it's not safe doing 50 kilometers an hour on most of the roads it's just better for all road users and then the people the residents of fremantle riding my bike is one of my favorite things it's just the speed that you go out you've got time to look at things and smell the roses as they say look at the sky I feel really comfortable on any road even if it's busy if the traffic is really slow I think that when we slow down the speed of our cars we're actually making it safer for people and we're actually allowing everyone to enjoy the community more as well

big thank you to dr. song and I handed over to you thank you very much Thank You Daniel and thank you very much for the introduction and obviously Fremantle is one of my favorite place in Perth now I just want to extend my thanks to City of Fremantle for inviting me for this webinar and and to actually give me a chance to actually speak to you guys about digital marketing so today the webinar is really about basic in the digital marketing space really looking at how we actually could leverage on the right content with the right digital platform now a lot of businesses have actually asked me so what are actually market on the digital platform there's actually no right answer or no one right answer and so today we'll go through a little bit of the fundamentals of digital marketing what I think is crucial and also looking at some of the digital platforms and how you can actually leverage them with the right content now there's a little bit about myself as then you'll have said I'm a senior lecturer in school marketing and if you have any questions after the seminar or Webner please still feel free to send me an email my email address is on the screen now this is another reminder that our session is being recorded and so if you do not want your face to be in the recording please don't switch on your video all right so what we will go through is very quickly basically this is a Content page basically we'll go through what it's micro moment and then we'll talk a little bit about search engine marketing and then a little bit about social media advertising and social media obviously because on this webinar is only 40 minutes so we could only go through so much but I will try and answer some of the question at the end of this webinar I would I might also be looking to my left because I actually have my laptop to make sure that I'm also looking into the chat so if you do have questions during the webinar please do feel free to either raise your hand which is at the bottom of your screen or to actually put on your questions in the chat box now a very fundamental question that I always get from either the clients that I consult accoding university or businesses that have come to me and ask me a question is how do I better design content now one of my answer to this is about micro moments now micro moments is basically a term that wasn't coined by myself it was coined by Google and the smart people from Google basically what micro moments are micro moments occurred when people reflects we effectively turn to a device increasing a smartphone to discover something wash something or buy something now looking at this definition you would go well actually you do that day to day for myself I do that day to day so I would probably go to my smartphone and try and and say a question that I have at that packed the glim moment and that is why it is called micro moment they are actually intend rich moments when decision are made and preference are shaped to give you a very good example this morning at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. my cat I only cared for my partner and he the cat actually vomited now the first thing I do is I basically go onto the smartphone and check what's wrong right so those are the micro moment now if you are a Fed if you capture that micro moment and if you have a blog pose or if you have content that actually answered my question I would have went into your website and possibly I would have noticed your brain and so that is why Michael moments is so crucial for businesses especially when go through very quickly later on is that relevance is really the big thing about digital marketing you have to be relevant to your customers and exactly at that moment what are the decision that they're making one of the questions that they have one of the things that they want to do is so on and so forth now Michael moment is a big thing and these are some of the statistics that are from Google by cuffs off so on and so forth so 91% of consumers actually turned to their phone or individual turn to the phone for ideas in the middle of the task so this might be watching a TV ad watching doing something or so on and so forth and there is a micro moments where you need to actually satisfy 82% of smartphone users say they consult their phone on purchase they are about to make in a store I think a lot of us are for victims to this and I genuinely do that so even if I'm in JB hi-fi oh good guys I looked at a appliance I the price and why is that the case is because at that particular micro moment I'm trying to purchase however I actually want to get the right price and so at the best price so basically I go onto Google and basically such as same model same specification and I cheat see and compare price online or even comparing physical retailers and so these are the micro moments that we need to really look into and one entry smartphone user has purchased from a company or brand other than the one that they intend to be information provided in that moment is that it's the ones that they need and so you can kind of see that micro moments are crucial when you are actually looking into how we can actually engage in digital marketing or engage in digital marketing more effectively now to give you some examples of micro moments you would have some of these moments yourself day to day life that I want to know moment whereby curiosity can trigger by anything satisfying time or someone is basically exploring or researching but not yet in health insurance what do you do well you're going to do Google or your search engine of your preference mostly Google and actually search for you know health insurance in Western Australia or if you're looking at car insurance it'll be conference in Western Australia so your search term really reflects what you exactly want to know at that particular moment and therefore we call it that I want to know moment and obviously you have that I wanted go moment implemental is a very very applicable destination or place of the I want to go moment in fact if you think about this a lot of the destination of places implementors would attract metropolitan visitors as we have done with city of Ur mental a tracking project that we have done we have seen a lot of metropolitan visitors and to attract them into your physical store or physical location or even noticing a brand infra mental you actually need to tap into that I want to go moment whereby people are looking for local business or considering buying a product at local store now one the Niemi searches have grown doubled in the past year and what this means is that people are actually searching for for example supermarket near me cafe near me so on and so forth and Google and other search platform are small enough to actually notice that if it's a smartphone they can track the location of it through 4G so on and so forth or form through Internet and actually return results that are near the customer so if you say cafe near me well currently I'm in my house I'm around South for the river they probably would give me something in Victoria Park or near my house so on and so forth now we also have that I want to do moment and these are mostly from YouTube so basically these are when they when customers come before uh they come before after the purchase and either way these are the how-to moment when people want help with getting things done or trying something new so on and so forth so for instance in YouTube there's 70 percent rise Yan year for how-to these are the micro moments that you can actually tap in and these actually drive your content so if you're thinking about the type of content that you need to create or what are the themes content that you to create my one suggestion or biggest suggestion is to actually mount the micro moments of your customers and actually provide them with basically the right the right content at a particular right moment now obviously at the end you also have that I want to buy moment so these are basically someone that is ready to make a purchase and they need help deciding what or how to buy and so if your product or your brand or your service involves a quite complicated form or complicated process in purchase such as a health insurance or insurance company then you also need to make sure that those and that I want to buy moments to have websites ability and a very positive or enjoyable user experience within your website or within where customers will go to buy that product and obviously today we won't talk too much about moments of that I want to know I want to go and I won't do moments to give you a little bit more examples is that if you think about this every single small decision of us nowadays are probably being searched on Google now if you looked into basically some of the stats from Google these days even the small decision are being researched so about over a hundred forty one hundred and forty percent growth in the search for best or over a hundred and ten percent growth in searches for best travel accessory best to brush so on and so even if you look to the right and we have seen 1.5 times more mobile searches ending to avoid cooking oil brands to avoid refrigerator to avoid so on and so forth and this is my note of vacation seems to be popping up I'll just close them and you can see that how consumers are curious about things so not only that actually look for best things or nimi searches but they also would be looking for things like things to avoid and so what you want to do is to avoid those to avoid searches and making sure that those micro moments you don't pop up all your brand and pop up but for those micro moments that I want to buy I want to go so on and so forth moment your brand actually pops up and in fact you can even look into ideas so in the past two years mobile searches for whatever ideas have grown over fifty five percent for example bathroom remodeling ideas graduation party ideas so on and so forth so those are the knowledge rich micro moments that energy tap in whereby you can actually satisfy them using a landing page on your website or blogs on and so forth but all in all what I'm trying to say here is to really map out basically the multiple moments that your customer actually would would experience and actually deliver content in the digital platform and the right digital platform to actually map up will match up with the micro moments that they're experiencing so what are the questions what are the information that a plumbing services example so a plumbing service this is pretty much based I think in Bentley um if they offer a number of different services so hot water the block Jane leak detection leaking showers and your plumbing so on and so forth now if you think about this the micro moment is being targeted in those in these services are very different hot water system is probably when you are building a new house we need hot water system or maybe your hope for the system died and you need a new hot water system this micro-moments is very different to let's say a leak leaking micro-moments so if you have a leaking tap in a leaking shower then it's very different and how you search is very different so if you have a leaking shower you probably go D for leaking shower or how do I turn off the water in the house whereas in poor water system example you probably will be looking for cheapest hot water system or cheapest hot water system near me so on and so forth now this actually have doing your content marketing and digital model in the digital platform your search engine marketing your search engine advertising and even in social media marketing why is it the case to give you an example on the left of the screen you can see the emergency plumbing service so if you looked down of those results you will see emergency plumbing same-day service emergency plumbing per for fallible service Jim's plumbing available 7 top and so forth now because you have actually told Google that you need emergency plumbing service Google's algorithm is here to provide you with the most relevant information because their objective is for people to use their search search bar as a search that they have and so you have to think about that Google is always optimizing the results or whatever that they are presenting to basically the inquiry of the consumer and the pools are going on it's very smart if you're actually is mergency plumbing service it will actually prioritize things like emergency 7 near Pamela now saunas top of those wording will actually be paradise and because if search engine advertising or landing edges on your page that actually this emergency plumbing your search page your landing page or your ads we actually get prioritize now in comparison to let's say the search in the Middle where you say Betty plumber cheap so obviously Grammatik mistake however Google so you are actually looking for a plumber in Bentley that is cheap and so you can see the research result there is basically price tags it's only in this prioritized bent-kneed plumber whereas on the right you can actually see Bentley water system so if you're looking at hot water system you can actually see that they actually go that you search for Bentley hot water system they actually prioritize plumbers that in Bentley who also specialize in Hoxton and so this is a clear examples of how you should be actually leveraging on these micro-moments what do your customer actually search for when they are searching for your service or your product category and in fact what what are the specific search term that they're looking for what are the unique selling proposition that advertised and maybe it could even be prioritized in your content uncreation so what you can actually see here it is digital marketing there is always the saying that cash is king but in digital marketing relevance is king or at least from my perspective and I also have a condition plea especially text plus some cash for paid media why is that the case is because if you think about this every single digital media platform or digital marketing platform is tech space it's still you can still put images in there however if you look at Google's algorithm Google's algorithm it's not advanced enough to actually look at an image without any text and actually determine what it is Facebook the same so on and so forth in fact what you will find is that then we are still looking at a lot of the optimization being done in text so personally the key words or key phrases in your blogs keywords and key phrases in your headings keywords and key phrases on your landing pages keywords and key phrases even on the title and so text it's very very important elements that you need to optimize in order for you to actually pop up at the right micro-moments because everything about this you can search with image in Google but how how many times have you ever used an image search in the sense that you actually use an image to search for things so text is a very important point and obviously cache for paid media is also quite important if you're engaging in Google Adwords or Facebook advertising you need some cash but I will talk about that later on and why that is the case now here is not examples of how that translates micro-moments translate in the digital marketing ecosystem now you can see that I actually say ecosystem because it shouldn't be that you are only just focusing on your paid app so for instance if you had that plumber and this disclaimer that I was basing it on rich tech no relationship at all no Commission no no advertising cost for rich but rich Tech has done a very good job actually toggling micro if you search for plumbing Perth not only the Google ads actually say perfectly certain a perf plumber plumber Co fee for example but also if you click on the ad it takes you to this landing page on the left so it will say we are your translation of attrition and plumbers in Perth the free quote in a 0 coil 3 on the right is when you actually search for if you search for Bentley plumbing emergency or cheap been coming in Bentley so on and so what happens is that not only the ad will actually say oh it's cheap it's also silk oil-free a price tag that is very competitive but when you click on the ad you can see that it leads you to a website when landing page on the website that she says your local Bentley plumber 0 coffee so on and so forth so you can see micro-moments is so crucial not only at the start of when someone see your ads but also the whole journey or experience that they go through onto your website so they click on a particular or answer the particular enquiry that the person is actually looking for if someone is searching for a local Bentley you probably want to have a landing page that is actually specifically for you don't have to show it on your main website you can hide it behind your server and basically point them point point the post people that is searching for local Bentley plumbing to actually this landing page and actually are be more relevant to them now here is another example there is more sort of a hotel example and this more estranging optimization acceptable so this is nope not pay media but these are let's say blog post or or web sites that you are you have optimized to be top of the search results now if you think about this if someone is searching for let's say best hotel in perfil family so this is actually are telling you that the people that is searching for this at least this hotel is probably someone that is looking for a family-friendly hotel now if you can see buttons over here for calm for some reason but what it is is because if you open this page and myelination is a little bit out of place but if you open this page over here you click link this is the page that you actually see so basically the most kid-friendly hotels in Perth and basically what happens is will tell you what is perfect and then it will list out so one gum leaf cottage palm stay to Holiday Inns perth city centre so on and so forth now you can see that the word prioritize this page in search engine optimization is because our SEO is because it actually provide a list of hotel that actually address this question the best hotel in Perth of which the user have keyed in and so for Google this is the easiest because Google is smart enough an algorithm is smart enough to actually read each of your web pages on landing pages and go oh one gum leaf cottage farm stay that's a heading to holiday in perth city centre that's a heading and so all the XS about that particular a summarized version of it in what we call a knowledge panel nowadays and actually prioritize your websites so for instance if you are this blogger who actually are advertising for particular hotels obviously um he or she is getting a lot of or this website is getting a lot of traffic if someone is searching for best hotel in Perth advertising budget o galvanizing fee up so on and so forth but not only that if you think about this if there are links within your webpage and their link is within this bloggers website so for instance this is a link this is link this over here is a link this over here is a link if you click on this link so for instance if I click on family getaway in under holiday in Pearl City weapons is that would take you to Holiday Inns website which actually mention about family getaway packages how kid-friendly they are so on and so forth and that actually again boosts up your SEO so again as I said trickling is much more like in a ecosystem so not only your to the search term while micro-moments but also the link that you're actually linked in to also should have X so holiday in if you're featuring holiday in on your website holiday engine should also have those keywords in key phrases and so that is why SEO takes a lot of time and also how micro moments actually transcend from basic search results to the landing pages of your pages to even don't link within your website or that landing pages on so forth and so it is a really a big ecosystem of micro moments in a digital platform now you might ask wow that's a that's a lot to consider it's their particular way to actually really envision basically all these micro moments and say that there's no one right model or one best model but I always look at what we call the hierarchy of effect so this actually shows you basically four different stages of how consumer actually decide on a particular brand a product or services and obviously it's not the most comprehensive model however it is thinking to actually sit down with your team or sit down with your marketing manager so on and so forth to actually think about what are the micro moments that I want to target for example do you really want to target if you're a florist do you actually want to target Valentine's Day obviously but what are the keywords that they actually look for one of the things that I need to do in order in February to actually capture those customer so on and so forth but this model actually basically shows that buyer actually goes through an exploration stage so basically this is when they're exploring different alternative then they go through a decision-making page this our space which is when they have probably four or five different options that they are weighting against they would have a stage that they now decided to purchase but where to purchase and obviously after the purchase they will advocate for you and hopefully now why do I think this is a good breakdown of or model that actually gosh your micro-moments thinking is because when you're trying to competitive an option and especially this is very very different or these Tuesdays are very different to when you have decided to purchase and now you want to actually think about where to purchase for instance when I'm exploring less a new laptop if I want a new laptop I might go okay I want to lap the new laptop that is virtual reality compatible so I can actually play VR games on it you might be searching for VR compatible laptop in exploration stage so this is an exploration micro moment however once you have gone through a few websites you kind of go yep I have about three or four options that I really want to do might go into the decision-making face and your key words or key phrases that you used to search or the things that you want to look at it's not we are compatible laptop anymore obviously it is still fear compatible laptop but now we're looking at specific model let's say HP HP is that book or Lenovo M 160 so on and so forth your exploration stage you have identified these options and now you want to go compare them in the decision-making face your search term is very different and especially purchasing so where you're gonna purchase JB hi-fi good guys so on and so forth every single physical store in a laptop context or a laptop decision making context um sell you the same thing if you are if you be careful with all the specification that are different with JB hi-fi and good guy sometimes the RAM is a little bit different CPU is a little bit different but most of them say the same thing so then price is the driving factor in the purchasing decision at least for the laptop application now a good thing about this the micro-moments will differ not only from exploration this is you're making purchasing and efficacy but also that this actually informs how you should be actually reaching out to your customers at that particular page so for instance when they are actually doing exploration you probably are looking for search engines and social networks when they are making a decision laptop perspective you probably will find a lot of review website for laptops of VR compatible apps websites your websites or the brand's website blogs community interactive tools and when you're purchasing it's probably on a ecommerce process or e-commerce platform either your own websites or or the brands websites or aggregators so there are catch price price bergen.com they use on and so forth these are all aggregators that actually I'm a great auto offering from different stages in fact Google now has an aggregator by itself if you type in a particular product let's say if you type in this Lenovo laptop the first thing that it pops up is all the para offering that is listed on Google and therefore you can actually scroll through to see what is the lowest price so on and so forth and obviously in the efficacy stage it's probably more social media and so on and so forth and this will also inform your key measure but I think for time being we won't go through that but to give you another example here decision or these micro moments how social media marketing works so these are free or free brands that in Australia they have been doing quite well in digital marketing or social media marketing and you can actually see that they have a lot of organic likes so these are likes or engagement that they haven't paid for it's as organic it's free but you can actually see a common theme within them so they're not selling the product hpf is not selling their insurance they are selling the insurance their branding themselves their branding themselves to make sure that people actually say that our HP F is very helpful HP f is very useful or provide me with useful information when about insurance claims on and so forth Swiss for instance are not to selling the immune solution they're talking about how do you actually keep a good immune system and obviously if you watch this video it will go through some tips on how to you know to eat prebiotic fibers how to be more to enhance your immune system but at the end because it has prebiotic fiber so on and so forth but if you think about this what they're doing here is they're actually not trying to sell the product they're not trying to do a promotional post and obviously why is that the case is because these are probably targeted to expiration and efficacy because if you're searching for immune system booster or how to enhance my immune system you probably might be interested in this post but you probably won't be very interested if a Swiss is blatantly selling you the immune health solutions on and so forth and obviously our a as well you can see that engagement mostly to useful information that are not really regarding products or brand directly now let's move on to search engine marketing so we now know about micro-moments so let's go through for the next 10 to 15 minutes let's go through search engine marketing and social media marketing in a deep dive now we talked a lot about search engine marketing in this webinar in fact if you think about this I what did you search for on Google in the past seven days or the search engine that you prefer say Yahoo is on and so forth um for me I'll share mine basically as I said last night at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. I hurt my cat vomiting so I was since basically searching for cattlemen right I was looking for let's say in a week ago I was looking for digital marketing examples good digital marketing example for this webinar and so on and so forth so those are micro moments right them are my moments and if you if you are a let's say a in fat you probably would have tapped into that micro moments where if your cat is vomiting here are some examples and in fact if it's really severe come come and see us right that's how you actually tap into micro moments and if you think about all these searches that you have done if you actually go through your searches again or type in your searches now think about what are the things that they are see how good digital marketers or digital marketing strategies are actually targeting that okay if you click on all the searches results you will actually see that they have really been designed to actually optimize that user journey but with search engine our search engine marketing there is two types so basically there is SEM so search engine marketing these are the paid ads obviously Google doesn't have this anymore but this basically SEM cuz of top of the page an SEO are basically the organic searches that comes down comes at the bottom after probably three to four four Google X now so SEO is all about organic listing and this is all about your keywords and key phrases within your web sites whereas SEM is key words and key phrases within your website but also your keywords and key phrases within the earth that you have written so these are pay listing and these goes through Google Ads or what we call pay-per-click act now why am I talking about this well to give you an example for instance you can actually looked into where you want said search engine marketing is really targeted to intention rich moments so for instance this is probably a search term or searched keywords that I do pretty much every single weekend because my partner really loved going to brunch places but I'm should probably have a lot of ideas and therefore these are trying to find new brunch places in Perth now I'm pretty sure I don't have to statistic but I'm pretty sure a lot of couples or a lot of people will be searching the same thing every single day now when you can actually see or not every single day but every single weekend but you can see that there's only SEO s these are organic results so where to find the best preference in Perth openness open this open this bought sheets comme des au these are all bloggers who are posting where to find brunch places but if you're a cafe wouldn't you be actually targeting that intention rich moment if you are if someone is actually looking for new brunch paces in Perth chances are they are place that they had not familiar with and so what you can actually do is leverage on this and go to be the first one to do Google Ads so invest maybe 20 dollars per day 30 dollars per weekend or forty dollars per weekend on all Friday Saturday and Sunday to actually have if you're a cafe to actually tap onto these keywords in Google Ads you can say if someone searched for new brunch places and particularly if the location is impervia imperf or the idea dresses in perv I want my s to be showing and your ads will be showing way above over here and that captures the micro moments that will capture my micro moments if you even optimize your ad to say you know finding a new brand patience try this or something like that or have you tried so-and-so brand improve best brand pages best brunch places in pervs on and so forth and so what we also need to consider is in search engine marketing not only the micro moments but what are the activities and benefits that people are actually wasn't by me it was come up by Chafee which is a quite a old veteran in digital marketing for a very long time but he came up with basically these are not the major benefits that people derive from it platform so to connect with each other more so in social media social networking sites to create something is it to create let's say co-create a particular product or service to learn about something access information to enjoy something so in the entertaining yourself so on and so forth to try and transact so to conduct shopping and to give in a giving time or given financial donation so those are the benefits that we need to actually to think about when we are actually thinking about micro moments so within each stages at least in search and marketing within those stages exploration decision-making we only need to consider what are the micro moments we think those stages that we need to capture but also what benefit that you're actually trying to tap into are you trying to connect with them when they are exploring a therefore you need to connect with your potential customer a little bit more before they actually commit so for instance if you're a real estate agent or so on and so forth January sneaking and it will go through emails so on and so forth but how do you make sure that people email you how do you make sure that people actually should go onto your special media and look at what you're sharing as a brand so on and so forth now another example is here is basically if you type in piece of huts and mostly it days look at what results or the first top results and that is also why in a few slide I can actually said that when you're looking at search engine marketing a little bit of cash is very important why is that the case is because your competitor can actually bid against brand or against your product category so what we see here is P if you search focus mostly on weekdays dominoe axe comes up 30% of hot Domino's Pizza why because nominal understand that particular weekdays your decision-making process yes you have probably go I want peace of heart but if I entice you with a financial incentive then off hot Domino pizza pickup or home delivery now you probably click on my ad in fact it actually checks my IP address and go well it's in color it's in the nearest place is in Colorado which is very close to where I live so basically what you can actually see is Domino actually spent probably one ball a click or maybe ninety cents a click to actually outfit peace a hut in fact if you look into that peace of heart then started this is about six months ago peace I started making sure that they for their own keywords but because Domino was first there and a lot of people already been clicking from this ad Google obviously prioritize people get money every time someone click on your edge charges Domino certain amount of money and so it prioritize Domino and now if you every time in the weekdays you type peace of heart in the ads or Google search that a percent off you actually also find Pisa Hut giving discounts in fact if you're interested do it in for the whole week day so Monday to Friday what you will see is that Domino sometimes 30% that Pisa how it would change its add to 31 percent of Domino might say these are might say twenty nine percent Pisa company will go twenty nine point five or thirty percent off so you can actually see how dynamic that is in fact if you look into on the right this is when someone is for postgraduate in digital marketing improv and so what I'm glad is this is unit that I teach in Curtin University is a digital interactive marketing so you can see that Curtin have done quite a bit of work to actually make sure that best postgraduate digital marketing and Perth those keywords is actually embedded into your land in the landing page because that will actually ensure that we are the top shows that are coming up in the in the search results and obviously Curtin has been bidding a few other competitors are really optimized to really the micro-moments that they that be their beach for now I won't click on for too much longer I want to go through a little bit about social media marketing but if you are interested in looking at keywords demand and performance analysis here are some free tools for you I will also share the splash zone you can have the links as well or Google Keyword planner you just need a free Google Ad it will record your credit card details but it'll when you have any Google accounts when you sign up and link it to Google ads and this is how it looks like now moving on to social media marketing and I want to touch base I guess very quickly just 5 to 10 minutes on social media marketing because we have talked about about social engine mark now social media marketing is a little bit different and search engine however it is also quite similar why is that the case is first true media marketing is also very much based on text but one thing that you actually people actually using or when are they using social media well yellow page just a still exists conducted a research in 2018 and it seems like in Australia most people use it in the first thing in the morning in the evening last thing before they go to bed and bricks this shows you that in that context being relevant to these people you cannot be promotional and that is also why in example Avenue a lot of the organic cause organic engagement really stands out from basically providing useful information in that particular moment because people are not wanting to actually look at promotional poster explicit promotional first thing in the morning break in the evening these are their break time and so that is why we need to talk to one of the reasons for people to use social media well to catch up with friends to share photography for new and current events watch videos and so forth and so social media is still useful with social aspect of our daily life and so instrumental marketing we have to incorporate a social context and as the digital through too much but how does your contact actually benefits or satisfy these benefits that's your social media propose actually connect with people does it allow people to create something to participate in a competition to learn about something learn about your immune system learn about where to go for your next road therefore you might buy you might go into a seas cabinet or the new units that that are running Kevin my friend parks on and so forth I show medium marketing or the post that you're posting engaging entertaining so on and so forth but to give you some examples of why people unfollow brands this is actually done by sprout social in 2019 poor customers an irrelevant content too many ads so on and so forth in fact if we look at why they follow brands is the same thing they want to learn about new products or services to be entertaining to stay up-to-date so on and so forth but also they also said that if there is too many promotional posts so that's the last light they will unfollow the brand learn about the new product and services but I want to know how you actually benefit me I don't want to know about your product and service by itself but I want to know how does that actually fit into my daily life how is it compatible how how do you make it entertaining how do you make it to satisfy my micro moments my the questions that I'm trying to solve over here and so one of the other thing about social media not only their micro moments but when you're looking at your media marketing you also need to look at your buyer personas these are basically where are they situated what the personality what the behavior is on and so forth why is that the case it's because everything about this your customers will not have one micro-moments that are that applies to everyone some other customers or specific customers would have the micro moments for your product or services and their personal buyer persona actually Tate how they search on what they are going to search for and in fact this is space because if you look at Facebook and Instagram or Facebook ad nowadays you can specifically target particular by persona from location to language so what language they speak what is the educational level what the financial aspects are estimation on whether you are an interested in tainment and what type of entertainment relationship are you in are you in a mother or your mother a father are you married are you a couple are you interested in Fitness are you interested in food are you interested in cooking all you're interested in beverage so on and so forth there the amount of data that should media platform has on you it's basically in fact you don't even know that they're probably tracking you so once you're using your mobile device you can even say I want to target people who have been to free mental in the past one week and actually provide them with an ad that is relevant to them if they have been there in a week or maybe I don't want to target these people because I don't come back and they're then residential is our supplemental let's say and they have been there for one week I don't want to target them you can also do that and so you can see that what is the added advantage of social media marketing is that there is all these data yeah and you're at your fingertip and you can really target anything you want and Facebook and Instagram will probably optimize the algorithm to make sure that your ad may be shown to the most relevant person at the most relevant time I'm a little bit mindful of time so I'm gonna go through the last few slides and they'll be quicker but you can even do location targeting on Google or in thing on social media Google is a little bit harder because Google search or a browser on your smartphone won't be able to actually access location data most of the time sometimes it does but when you open up a Facebook avoid Instagram or Twitter app the location functions start and if you have to turn on your location and that is also how Google map actually knows where your Park where have you been so on and so forth so you can actually target in this location people who live in this location recently in this location and travel to this location then you can actually attract working customers drive purchases so if you are a physical store you might want to go okay I just want to target people who are in the ten club districtís and if they haven't been here for the past week so those are walk-in customers I want to kick them if they are searching for let's say a cafe near me or a a so fahnny anemia so and so forth one of the things that I really want to touch on and the last probably two to three minutes it's really to find your suitable platform so you can see that search engine marketing is about intention rich platform whereas social media is about buyer personas being relevant to those personas and also taking into account social aspect but also with different social media marketing serve different function so we'll go through them very quickly the good old social networks ones these are my twitter and linkedin so these are basically social network to help people and organizations neck online but you can actually see that this social network or older types of social network basically knowledge sharing network and so they're useful for information rich ad to humanize your brand to engage your followers and research why is that the case if if you think about is Facebook a Facebook user are very tolerant towards promotional ads in fact they're more likely to get with you on Facebook than in Twitter oh sorry Facebook then in Instagram because in Instagram they probably just like your posts or like your image right and so those these types of social media platform social networks like Facebook and Twitter these are where you should be humanizing a brand engaging with your followers and actually providing information for each at or information-rich posts whereas if you're compared to let's say media sharing sites so these are Instagram snapchat and YouTube they are basically media and to spark conversation and speak for themselves and so what you are seeing here is unique contents that not only that cannot be informational rich they are image image based content video based content and they should in some sense actually tap into the entertainment benefits so they actually make your engagement is really driven by whether the content is relevant to them and whether they think that and that the that is entertaining and whether those media asset actually have unfollow specific themes that actually are relevant to that to those micro moments I won't go for the trend I'll let you read through it when I make the slides available but you could also think about social media platform as review and discussion forum so for instance reddit's Cora so on and so forth review websites or discussion forums are also showed media platform now these are more so basically sure to prove for your claim so for true profile there for example or restaurants review websites on and so forth they are here you actually need to make sure that you have provide positive word-of-mouth and you are actually resolving issues of unhappy customers when you're going through TripAdvisor good hotel is what they do is that they will have a social media marking team that actually monitors TripAdvisor and actually try and resolve issue or at least try to address the issue and explicitly on the website on the TripAdvisor web to make sure that other users or other customers who look through those review websites actually see that oh yeah you are actually quite empathetic you actually resolve my issue and so the content within the review and discussion forum are probably not driven by yourself or your bread but you have to monitor them as well last but not least also have blogs so these are basically things that not only to help you with SEO but probably to provide information and these probably are not promotional information these are direct information that actually extracts traffic to your websites to actually gain visibility and genuine more engaging content for your social channels so on and so forth now I won't go through too much but basically you on Facebook which are the social networks the ordinary social networks you need to have promotional information or knowledge or informational rich post from Instagram where is media sharing websites you are actually sharing media entertaining and interesting and engaging content in the review websites review social media networks you're looking to actually be more engaging engage our customer resolve their issues or thank them if they leave a good mess a good review so on and so forth and on blogs and publishing networks like medium or your own website you are actually making sure that your content generated visibility so obviously direct promotion of blog post won't actually generate visibility things like tips for your weekend for family getaway incremental would things like that all right so I would end it here I know I'm a little bit out of time so I'm gonna invite back Daniel to facilitate I guess the Q&A thanks really that was fantastic really do appreciate that presentation I like to invite our attendees to ask any questions you can raise your hand down the bottom or you can just jump in by turn your microphone on first if there are any questions while we're waiting I might just kick things off Billy so lots of information there and quite a lot to take in as we said before we'll provide the slides and recorded to attendees um what do you think would be a quick one two three item takeaway list that people could go and do a or this week what are some of the ones that someone can get off this webinar and just go and do I think one I guess a few things that I will suggest the take-home message or the tick away from this seminar that can be actionable is really start to have a brainstorming session of micro-moments so sit down with a team or even sit down yourself and actually think about what are the micro moments that you want to try to capture and and those micro moments if you are the customers while the search term that you are going to search for that will actually provide you with a host of different actionable recommendations not the keywords and key phrases what are the key words and key phrases that you want to target in your Facebook ad but also you will start to actually develop a sense of what kind of content you need to create so for instance if I'm sitting down and if I am let's say cafe it might be you know best cafe best coffee brunch places on and so forth you start to actually understand that oh these are the content or some of the content on social media and on my blog I need to post this or my website have to talk about this so on and so forth so that's one and the second take-home or actionable recommendation is really think about how you're actually using particular platform if you have paid ads on both social media platforms and Google Ads are they really targeting particular functions or are they really leveraging on the particular function so Google you should be looking at the keywords and key phrases in those rich intention intention rich moments whereas in social media look into your what are actually fit today actually aligned with the functions or the usage of those social media platforms so Facebook should be things about information can be a promotional West Instagram official base there is probably very little promotional and you can even go through your Facebook and Instagram history going through some of the post and identify kind of key theme and you will actually see that in Instagram how people or the engagement ways of Instagram it's really determined by whether your official is aesthetic whether your video is entertaining where Facebook is whether your posts are useful and what you will notice is if you ever featured a product on Instagram is that engagement brain of that post or that image or that video will probably be lower than all the other images that you have actually shared and so you have to devise a strategies or a particular plan to go so what are what are the particular functions that I want particular platform to actually serve here so social media should it be more so to engage people whereas my website should be more promotional question you did

I'm sharon egan I'm a long white jack artist and I'm married simon gilbert um yeah I'm a non-indigenous artist that was contacted more than a year ago to work on this project this artwork is about instating a sense of place that is different to what is generally a colonial expression of free men so the idea is that the the center of king square there's a point where the church land and the land that is the council land intersects at a particular point that we saw a long time ago and that's parallel that's perpendicular to the sloping lawn of the building whether that's by design or some kind of mystical forces I don't know but it seemed an incredibly opportune um positioning for the epicenter of the artwork and of course the epicenter of fremantle it's the center of it the town hall the council and the church so in that one spot is a place where we're going to have a didactic ring and a submerged under glass fire vessel that sharon and I in ceremony but essentially that's the center and around that in a sort of rough ellipse that doesn't conform to the grid of the um of the king's square is an assembly of standing stones that come from the 14 different regions that are the home places of the 14 clans 14 so in a in a process of of very significant and appropriate consultation we will invite the different clans to contribute a stone from those regions which means that we will have stones that are made of granite limestone sandstone coffee rock all of the different uh expressions of the geography and the home places of those clans come in to position themselves around that central case so this artwork is being created on one jack country and inviting all the other clans to be a part of it so that plans come together in this work we're going to translate the milky way with the significant stars down into the paving within the ring of stones that will be up lights and as well as that picked out in the surface of the the of the dark emu the emu like it tells certain times of year it'll tell you when the emu's are laying their eggs because you can actually see eggs because it changes and you can read the seasons and when the males are looking after the eggs and everything in the sky is like a reflection but we just don't know much about it whereas the ancients did in the installation we have a augmented reality element which is used on your phone and you can scan it over the plaque and we want the elders from each area their voices to be heard and they're still telling their own stories the new building links high street with the prison at one end and the roundhouse at the other and I can't help but think that that passage for indigenous people how many people have been incarcerated wrongly on their own land how many people have died in custody to make one space that asserts their recognition and sovereignty in a whole city um that speaks of of the colonial project of the timely and I like to think that we are now a people of such maturity to recognize that this is the correct thing to do led by the council and by inviting artists to to make this happen so it's been a really wonderful situation of a small project um that as I went along I realized that I certainly wasn't qualified to tell the story of in terms of being a non-indigenous artist in fact um the first person I contacted about it to ask if she had been contacted was sharon yeah but I was over the other side of australians yeah busy with other stuff early on I had barry mcguire working alongside us and then um in the development through negotiations with russell kingdom who's been fantastic we built a project that couldn't possibly really adequately address the issues of commemorating and recognizing the wajak people to something that's much larger and along the process with covert intervening and those adjustments of what was appropriate to the project it kind of went into a hiatus at which point all of the to happen again but only on the condition that I could engage sharon who pulled the whole project together do you remember that first sitting down sharon and looking at designs and things yeah and it was all a lot clearer to me then because was on a different headspace when it first came around yeah but then after it's come around again it was all not clear thank you and barry yeah it was just beautiful we had these I developed designs from my own perspective but I couldn't have any sense of real authority other than having collaborated with people in the past and sitting with sharon and saying look this is just some ideas but we can start from scratch it was sharon that just looked over the works in my opinion and just picked some beautiful things together I wouldn't have gone forward if it wasn't anything other than an equal collaboration or sharon in the lead but it's worked out to be the way that we're moving forward today which has been fantastic

 so name is nancy haddadin and I currently work for the city of fremantle as the senior coastal projects officer uh really what triggered my interest in environmental engineering is my love for the natural environments and so because I grew up in a desert region I knew how important water is and so I wanted to be involved within that space I never hesitated to try different sectors like I i pretty much like I worked in the private sector in the ngo sector in academia and now local governments it just gives you a more strategic understanding and more comprehensive view of how our world works one of the like most satisfying roles I had is when I worked in environmental politics I was working on the jordan river and so that offered me the opportunity to to use my environmental and let's say an engineering knowledge in a different in a different aspect where I worked on peace building uh bringing government officials and ministers from the three different countries to get to collaborate it was really satisfying when trying to sort of fight for also uh pushing for um you know peace building and trying to get communities that reject each other because of a historical conflict but trying to find a common ground for them trying to get them to understand that preserving or rehabilitating this environment rehabilitating this river is for the benefit of all as an engineer you're always looked upon as that problem solver and in order to to to be able to go through that process is you'd have to first of course identify the problem identify your stakeholders identifying its impact and so that process where you're analyzing the situation requires all of those stem skills that you would gain during your years at university I probably don't use math as much but I think the skills that studying mathematics the skills that I've gained through studying mathematics is what I'm using right now it's that ability to break things down and and analyze and and also drawing comparison sometimes comparing balancing assessing I would say there are a lot of other careers that support the engineering industry for example machine and and with a handheld and you would walk across the beach with a gps and that would track your position and you would go up and down to measure it but now this is currently for example being replaced by photogrammetry using drones unmanned aerial vehicles there's even lighter which is even provides us with higher accuracy not just higher accuracy but you can do what would probably take you a week to survey it would take you a couple of hours I guess if I went back in time I would have probably dedicate more time to be involved in international networks so between 25 and 35 there's a lot of amazing international programs networks that you could join there's a world bank has a young professional program the united nations volunteers have a young professional program if I went back in time I would have probably been more I would have probably been more active in terms of finding out about these initiatives globally because it's just inspiring and it's exciting when you go to these kind of events and your mind it it teaches you about issues in other parts of the world which you can contribute a solution to given that you live in a different part of the world where you've overcome this issue or sometimes you would find more developed countries giving you an idea which you can implement in your hometown know thyself try to experiment ways to understand who you are and understand what you would like to do we are receiving a lot of information more than we give ourselves time to reflect and meditate and I guess to understand who you are and to understand what you want and what you like it's important to reflect ask yourself questions and ask others who have done that path ahead of you questions they always say if you want to know the path ahead ask those who are coming back you
Get a free oh I know you've heard a lot about Fogo but what is it why is it happening and how can you make sure you put the right thing in the right bin well I'm here to help this is the new green lid Fogo be Fogo stands for food organics garden organics and it describes what can go in here the thing to remember is that if it didn't grow then it doesn't go in Fogo natural items only prunings from the garden are perfect as well as long critics even kitty litter and dog poo can go in and of course all of your food scraps this handy kitchen caddy also comes with your Fogo bin and it's great for kitchen scraps but make sure you use the compostable bags that are provided with it because they completely break down or you can line the caddy with newspaper or simply put the straps straight into your Fogo Fogo will be picked up every week and its contents will be taken to a large-scale composting facility trials have shown that more than prevent that amount going to landfill through this new bin system and also dramatically cut down on methane a potent greenhouse gas which is produced by the breakdown of trapped organic material in landfill sites by collecting nutrient-rich food waste along with garden waste in the new photovia we can generate compost to use on farms parks and gardens and avoid organic waste going to landfill your trusty yellow lead recycling bin will operate as normal and continue to be picked up every two weeks now it might feel good to fill up your recycling bin but what makes more of an impact is to stop and think about the amount of packaging you're bringing home in the first place that said what can go into the recycling it's important to remember that if your recycling is bagged then it cannot be processed and instead will end up in landfill what a waste so place items in loosely and this includes clean and empty glass plastic containers and plastic bottles with lids removed aluminum cans and steel cans paper and cardboard but not shredded paper paper towel or't go in your Yellin in recycling bin plastic bags and plastic film no bees seriously people do it meat trays and polystyrene clothes and textiles gas bottles and aerosol cans electronic waste and batteries ropes cables and hoses there's other options from a lot of these materials for example soft plastics including plastic bags can be taken back to some local supermarkets for recycling and things like gas bottles batteries paint and even all clothes can be taken to the awesome fremantle recycling center on Montreal Street if you're a freer isn't okay so what's left after Fogo and recycling goes in the little red lid general waste bin the red lead general waste bin will be picked up in the alternative fortnight to the yellow lip recycling bin and taken to landfill this bin is a lot smaller because we know that through the Fogo and recycling bins we can divert most of our waste automatically this new three-bin system is going to make a huge difference that we can all be proud of reducing methane emissions which contributes to climate change decreasing landfill be put to good use ok Frio let's go fo go for more information go to Fremantle W a.gov got a you bo go you

 Fremantle is officially now a filmer friendly City with the passing of the film friendly city policy this month at Fremantle council and this is a really great initiative around actually encouraging more film makers into Fremantle obvious who got this amazing city that's okay but great backdrop of heritage buildings cafes ocean and river and port but when I see more people filming films here so we'll be doing things such as no waiving fees streamlining approvals making places available and make it really easy for the film industry to see this is a really key spot to fill me in Fremantle the voice policy together in conjunction with screen West and film makers around Fremantle and we hope to see even more films made right here in the heart of freer this one 3 repealed our policy back from 2000 which was around reconciliation of Aboriginal people in fact this is one of the really first policies in this space some we've pronounced one of us again a pioneer but of course now with a new or the other reconciliation action plan our rap policy has been superseded so we've got rid of that policy and impart that so we can get on with actually implementing the new rap had our first of our rap meetings this month and seeing some of those really good initiatives take place bikes are I think they were passionate about here in Fremantle and we've just passed a new bike plan which they sure will map out how we can better connect Fremantle both in within Fremantle also Fremantle to other suburbs over over the coming years in fact we've done pretty well over the last few years we've seen increasing numbers of cyclists in freemen to a thirteen percent jump in inner-city cyclists we're up to about 3.1 percent in terms of mode share but we want to do a lot better than that we can spy things a key part of both a more livable sustainable and healthy City and this new bike plan is it maps out the way forward on that so that was passed unanimously by by council we look order making fremantle and even more bike-friendly City
 this concept includes a public transport service that provides a much needed east-west connection within the perth transport network two transport modes are ideal for this service trackless trams and light rail other transport modes could be suitable as long as they provide the same transport and economic development and social benefits when heading westbound the service will travel along south street from bull creek district shopping centre across the kwanana freeway bridge before entering the murdoch university campus on discovery way the service continues for several kilometers before heading north towards fremantle station via ray avenue and the famous frio cappuccino strip it would also perform the reverse journey from fremantle to the murdoch station and potentially beyond ending at the shopping center at ball creek the southwest group of local governments and several major stakeholders collectively ask that the state government make a public commitment that the proposed fremantle and murdoch transport link will be included in future stages of perth's transport network as a dedicated mass transit connection and that funding for a detailed business case will be included in the state's 2122 budget you

The heart of freo's been transformed well yellow civic center you can see behind us here along with fomo um with the retail and hospitality and the government offices to see new life bring back into this precinct and it's a really good time to rethink what are you going to call this going forward it's been known as king square for a long time but it's a real good opportunity to think that is that the name you weren't going forward when I first moved to fremantle in 1984 the center of fremantle was known as said john square and in fact I knew it as the john square right up until my early adulthood what it shows to me is that the name has changed in the past and that maybe it can change again and with a king square being in the center of perth cbd and us not really being a king square kind of town I'm interested in what I've used other people have to call the name for the center of our city we're going to came up with three names fidget guru well yellow and mandarin as what they think would be the fish name for this place to rename king square I think it should be I think we should take it back to our way to our law and our culture and name it and give it a good cultural name when the council started talking about changing names I was looking for an average domain simply to put the recognition that um aboriginal february was a long long time ago and it's about time recognized but we also want to hear from you what ideas do you have which of those names do you like or maybe there's others so please have your say go to the city of fremantle my state website it's open to november 1 we'd love to hear from

What I love about living in Fremantle is the level of connection people really care and passionate about other people around them and and the community around them and I think that goes back generations it was a long history of social justice and and we see the generosity of spirit that comes through you know work at the Fremantle foundation a lot of people are looking to support the local area looking to support the causes that they see on a daily basis there's a connection between residents a connection between neighbors that that I really value and I love being panel
There was a motion on the council agenda to look at reducing the lease payment that the public golf course passed the Fremantle people would obviously remember lots of discussion over many years about the high street widening and that of course is right next to the golf course and that's how going to have an impact on how the golf course operates over the next couple of years it actually takes away some of the fairway and to redesign the golf course we're also having to rebuild the clubhouse so we're going to take the opportunity not only to reduce their rent while all of that happens but also to create a community hub of activity around the golf course
 freeman on fishing boat harbor was a key item of discussion at the council meeting where we reaffirmed our position that the freemen efficient bar harbor should be retained as a working fishing boat harbor one that keeps those marine industries that support the fishing fleet and and other associated industries whilst acknowledging that actually what makes it are the interesting places at how they sit alongside the tourism and hospitality industries as well they were undoubtedly be new developments coming in that area and we absolutely welcomed those we just want to make sure that as they come that they don't undermine what makes it special and authentic and unique and that's to work inside with the port as well cats in natural areas was another key area of debate councillor Amy Lane put forward a notice of motion through committee and that came to council as well and council supported that and he said the heart of that notice motion is where we will restrict cats being able to roam in natural areas of bushland areas for example William Borough Park or Sampson Park where and fauna and actually isn't appropriate for a cats to go hunting in those so the council has asked staff to draft up a local law and that local law will go out for public advertising come back to the council but we certainly we think there is merit in taking that forward and giving better protection to our native to our natural areas from cats that can be quite predatory the planning application for deus ex machina for Queen Victoria Street in North Fremantle was a really key area of debate this is a proposal to change that used to us a small bar amongst other bucks retail and other things I think it once was a really great proposal the room challenge of course is that it will probably be extremely popular and that the challenge of ultra mantle is parking and how he actually managed the growing popularity of that great little precinct and the growing pressures of our parking in the area so there was a really robust debate around that and the council supported the application but also acknowledged that we need to do provide extra parking in an area as well as better protection for surrounding residents whilst encouraging great new businesses like this into the area the new city of Fremantle community and crime prevention plan was adopted by by council and this is after some extensive community consultation this is an area that people really care about we had 500 people putting submissions and been been involved in the consultation process around that and it was really to make sure that we were targeting our what we're doing in this area right around getting the right resources on the ground but not just around community safety officers and ranges and those kinds of things also make sure we're designing our public spaces right around lighting and passive surveillance for all those kinds of things it's a really comprehensive plan and one that will guide the council and the investments it makes overcoming years to make Fremantle and even more safe and inviting place you
I think it's it's good that all cultures could come together as this is a multicultural way or showing that we are all Australians in that but the best thing is that there's no animosity I love how multicultural is that you'll see different people every day everywhere and you kind of fit in no matter where you are or who you are what I love our Fremantle is it's just a place for people to come together and you know celebrate art and all sorts of culture and all sorts of community stuff you know beautiful vibe you know we're celebrating multiculturalism here in Australia obviously celebrating First Nations and the beautiful indigenous people of this land and overall messages peace level unity man absolutely yeah it was it was fun to be up here and playing yeah like the crowd was awesome as well so yeah it was awesome I think it's a very beautiful community and you know it's a council that's changed the day so that's yeah that's another amazing thing about this place very it's a chance for our community to kind of come together and show why reconciliation matters why we want to be a nation that respects the amazing history that this place has respects Aboriginal people and wants to move together with them it was am just very wholesome what's a family's I was really lovely to like connect with a lot of the kids up there it's nice to have a crowd who seems to be switched on to a message of love performing at one day here today made me feel pretty connected you
This Community Safety team is there to support W a place our Department of Communities and the department health so they operate seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. our conducting community sector patrols of the CBD and all the surrounding suburbs recently we introduced after our security patrols so Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday night when working through to 00 a.m. and 00 a.m. targeting anti-social behavior we started work on this plan I think it was in about November 2018 we had our first community engagement session since then we had some business sessions and also gone out to a few schools to me but the kids had find out what their issues are we've gone through my say we've also met with stakeholders business owners residents we've engaged close to 500 people the original intention was to have about 15 or 20 really good achievable actions we ended up with 45 actions in the draft plan so some of the key priorities we heard was in social behavior in the city lighting drug and alcohol use and also awareness in our feedback from this 3 week and engagement report is on why say for you at the end of a three week process will obviously look at the report we may add further actions when may modify actions we really look back on the community you
The city is trying to increase its tree canopy cover for number reasons one to reduce the urban heat island effect two to increase biodiversity across the city and three to provide food and habitat sources for local birds and native animals so following a request from the south city precinct group the city best to gather the options about planting a large mature tree in the Rea around about which would have been a great landmark statement for our city and help us increase our canopy cover city then began investigating line of sight and also pipes which way beneath the ground fortunately after the investigation we found there was gas sewage and water pipes that would have prevented us planting into a trade instead we'll be putting in a grass tree and some shrubs including Bank Sears wifeless firma and scapula and although that these plants been putting in won't go directed towards increasing canopy cover they will increase the biodiversity of our city and also beautify this roundabout unfortunately yes we couldn't plant a large canopy tree here the cities then decided to investigate that will help increase the canopy cover in our city throughout this process is really harder to me how hard are these plant the tree in an urban environment it's not as simple as digging a hole and stick nutrient so much more to consider when you see a young tree going in the ground at City Fremen or probably only got 30 percent chance survival so it's look at us the local council and the community members to help ensure those trees make it to maturity if you'd like to get involved help the city Christmas canopy cover keep an eye on our website and our Facebook page for upcoming volunteer opportunities and entry fighting days you
 the new community safety plan which is the committee staff team confirmation plan actually was a an item that we would love your feedback on and council voted this month to put that out for public advertising this is actually the plan that runs from now through to 2024 and what we'd like your feedback on is really does this capture that be fair to say this is one of the key issues I think for me a community making sure that we feel like we've got a safe and inviting not only CBD but also our suburbs obviously we're rolling out a lot of CCTV at the moment have had a particularly strong focus in terms of our community safety officers so I want to make sure that you are comfortable with where we were going and then we have for public advertising soon and please give us your feedback sustainable buildings are one of those issues that's really really important so to Fremantle we're in the community so this month we look to actually a suite of policies in that area and reflecting some of the best rating tools and there that that exists all the way through from one planet model that we use here City of Fremantle threw away through the great work the Green Building Council of Australia does so we've updated those but I always actually revoked one of our policies that went all the way back to the 1990s and replace that really with some of them really great work now that's gone mainstream actually since the council did this around the your homework and those kinds of things because what we want our community to do is have access to the best information to get sustainable houses and buildings built and we also want to make sure that we can keep showing leadership to encourage that the next generation buildings that we're doing the best and a plan for the 21st century the king square project kept progressing this month as well so with the council agreed to sign off on a tender for the stage one of the public work so obviously King Square whilst being a lot about some major new of new office jobs the over 1,500 Department of Communities and Transport employees as well as a new library and city centre probably it's also about the public realm so this month we voted on the first stage of those works that would actually new in court and the areas down the high street alignment repaved actually to bring those ir to date to met tomatoes buildings it's a really really big project we want to make sure that we don't only get the buildings right but we create a great new public realm as well because we want that community to enjoy it to linger and make it feel to feel like it's part of their part of their community so I'm really pleased to see King Square progressing and the works underway
 being the dreamcast meeting is the end of the financial year so of course it also saw the criminal counselor consider its new budget for next year 2019 20 financial year we were really determined this year to whilst have you ever made the major project King Square in their hands to make sure that we kept their rates low so we've managed to keep the damage rate increased about 1.8 percent which is really I think really good one of our lowest rating increases in fact we've mentioned to do that the last two years whilst of course delivery was a pretty major projects and the King's grant project of course being the centerpiece of that we will do both the buildings and the the public realm components as part of this year's budget coming up and also of course the further rollout of Fogo that will hit your driveways and your the Nubians being delivered in September this year so it's a big year a good budget the one with which we kept the rates low technology that is tough Financial Times meeting because we got to pass our records to the HHS action plan they were only up Rick is the actually action pen the wrap as it's commonly known and we very nice actually had a couple of elders who came along and spoke with us so Uncle Ben and Andy ming-lee in support of the plan it is wonders have a really beautiful process of having more than a hundred people involved both Aboriginal and non-aboriginal talking together around the things we can do together so against the aid reconciliation in around Fremantle so really nice to have that plan after the community consultation period signed off is that maecius is a 107 actions in there but now that will now guide reconciliation Australia for sign-off and will beginning to work to actually further progress but I think it'd be a really nice journey a reconciliation here in freer the banning of gas-filled balloons has been a quite a important issue for our community we've had quite a few petitions and the like on it and the council has looked at a local law in this world that would ban the release of gas balloons and got back 29 submissions all in favor of that bear none again so that was great for that we can now sign off on that local law and put that ban into place it would still need to go through a stay covert process but we hope to see that bandit place sooner rather than later and I want to thank the community especially Lisa Jane hills and everyone that she's worked with this that works with the council to get this band into place
Well almost 10 years ago I was inspired to start riding a bike again and it first it was a real challenge I didn't have my bike Fitness up and then it got easier and easier as I went and then I was riding every day from home into Fremantle along the bike path and it was such a joy I found that I had only used one tank of fuel in six months and that one car was sitting in the driveway being unused because I was enjoying being on the bike salute the new cycling infrastructure and Fremantle has made it not only much safer for people to ride but also much more enjoyable and we've seen a massive increase in the number of people riding as a result don't think of it as an all-or-nothing kind of proposition I found it a very gradual process where the cycling became easier and easier and more and more of a positive choice it's about tackling these things in bite-size chuck's and seeing how you go and finding the enjoyment and then doing it more often

 King Square has been a very important space for free men ever since it was created there has been some improvements made to try and make it more pedestrian and reduce the impacts of vehicles but this is our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with the private sector so not only upgrade the buildings our own public buildings but also the public square one of the key ingredients the hulking square project is getting the private sector to do redevelopment of the Meyers building and and the old Queen's Gate Center surround a capital of doing that and it's fair to say they're only doing that project in the partnership and understanding that the city improves its own building and public realm there are many reasons why we needed to replace the building there was asbestos throughout the building there was concrete cancer the building didn't comply with its disability requirements it's been added to over many years with lots of different extensions it was clearly time to replace the building the center of Fremantle has had some some minor improvements over the years but in time where we can not only just bring in 1500 new workers and build a new Civic building for public use but to get people to come into the city centre and to stay to be part of public life to be part of the king square space and everything that will of the new building has been designed by carrier Hill architects they're very well known internationally renowned that Australian firm so we're quite excited about being on a half and Harry Hill building in a sense of Fremantle probably the best well known Kerry Hill building in Perth would be the State Theatre and also the city of Perth library on a street I think Kerry Hill do beautiful architecture which is timeless and they have a great use of material they're very lights they use light really well and they have a civic quality which I think we really need for the new Civic building in Fremantle you want a piece of architecture that's going to last a long time and update that's something that Kerry Hill brings it this this significant site next to the Old Town Hall which in itself is a challenge for new piece of architecture while Kerry Hill has donors to design a contemporary building that complements the the Old Town Hall rather than try and mimic like a fake heritage style it's a very simple building in many ways I think is very calm it's very open there'd be a lot of lights coming through the building and a very careful use of materials one of the key elements that you'll see on the outside of the building is this fine metal mesh that goes all the way around the building part of the function of this mesh is to of course provide shading so that we don't get too much so the game inside the building but it's also an architectural treatment of the fenestration so as you walk around the building depending on what angle you're looking at the building at or where the lights coming from it would go from looking like a solid part of the building to something it's very transparent and experienced as you walk around the building we're aiming to achieve a carbon neutral building a part of achieving this we'll be putting a lot of photovoltaic cells on the building roof basically covering the whole roof as much as we can the the part of the building is having a solar passive design to the architecture which Kerry he'll have done but probably one of the biggest elements to achieving carbon neutrality will be opening the windows and turning the air-conditioning off and this will all be automated it will be I think a first fremantle one of the key features if the building is a sloping lawn that goes from king square up to council chamber on to first floor and that sits above the library people refer to it as an urban room I guess that's because it's a public space it has a roof over the top that makes it a room but we see very much as an integrated part of the whole design which is about bringing people from the square into the building and to connect up to there's five levels to the building from basement through to level three the basement is going to be the library the library is going to be state-of-the-art facility we're referring to it more as a community hub there will be books in the library of course with a lot lot more than just the books the basement will be anything but dark and dingy we've got a lot of natural light that will flow into that space from two courtyard areas either side of the library which not only provide natural light to that space but would be beautiful spaces in themselves the library has a large sloping ceiling and of course on the other side of that ceiling is the sloping grass ramp of the urban room we're moving up from the basement is the ground floor which is arguably the most important floor because it's so connected to public spaces outside of the building and it is the main area where people will come in get their orientation as to where they're going whether it's down to the live reel up square you're enter into an exhibition area or a foyer space we should which will have temporary exhibitions it's also very useful space that's connected to the Old Town Hall which will allow activities from the Town Hall to expand into our new building when you leave the foyer you'll walk into the customer service area this would be a dramatic improvement on the customer service area that we had in our old building the way that we would do customer service would be more with a roaming customer service officer who will come and greet you to the building and ask what they can do to help you with your inquiry there won't be an old-fashioned desk it would be a very open modern type of experience beyond the modern customer service area you start moving into the community hub and that includes things like the over 55 s on the ground floor there will also be opportunities for commercial leases these were being around the perimeter of the building and will help to bring activity to the streets one of the key sites's a great opportunity for a new cafe to be right in the heart of the king square project when we move up to the first floor we come across one of the key features of the building which is the oval shapes council chamber the council chamber would be a very open space that's connected to the veranda and also the sloping lawn outside providing a lot of transparency and connection to the outside spaces beyond the chamber itself that oval shape of council chambers reflected on every floor of the building right from the bottom of the basement to the top of the roof creating an architectural you'll see both from within the building and also from the outside also on first floor will be offices for city free mentor as well as an area that can be leased for commercial offices when we move up to the second floor it's the same mix of city and commercial offices and then when we go to the third floor it's entirely commercial office space one of the reasons for having commercial office space besides having for its own needs should it need to expand in terms of office space requirements so this building really is a civic center it will be an amazing community asset when you look at how the floor space is allocated you find that only about a third of it will be used by the City of Fremantle itself the building is very integrated with its surroundings part of this can be seen with the laneway that's going to go through the middle of our new building connecting King's Square to the fomo development that Cerrone is doing this Emporium retail development and also you can then continue through the laneway between the old myers building and the queen's gang building through to the Queen's Gate carpark this new building is going to bring world-class architecture and in the heart of Fremantle as well as vastly improved community services the commercial aspect of this projects going to bring thousands of people back into the heart of Fremantle and the rejuvenation of all the public spaces around King's Square will make it a beautiful welcoming city centre
I did I know how to work I do what's the best bit about riding to work for you say there's a few reasons but first of all it's it's probably just as quick if not quicker then catching a bass or drive a car and walking or anything like that so there's a practical element aside from that I think it's partly just the ability to sort of be out in the Sun and the wind for about 10 to 15 minutes in the morning and in the afternoon it's a nice sort of break between being at home and being at work and it's a nice way to start the day and of course finish the day as well thanks yeah we're gonna check out your I'll see you later okay nice way to start the day good morning from the little nice symbols you think you're pretty useful
 welcome to from the Council of chambers for may 2019 we had a full gallery and interesting meeting and one of the key items which was spoken passionately about from the members of the Fremantle youth network which is the advisory group of youth in for the sea Fremantle who really spoke passionately about climate change and the impacts that they see having on them and actually where they broke to us asking for some leadership on the issue and I say it's an issue that I'm really passionate about as well and it was certainly the council unanimously accepted the letter from the from the front from the youth network and importantly acknowledged that the reason our climate emergency in front of us and community to actually say that we are going to take some serious action on this so we see this is a very important first step and be fair to say there is a sense that there isn't the leadership that we'd like to see other levels of government and I think that local governments and especially a place like Fremantle with our with the youth in the area in fact with all of our community to make that happen we also had quite a few youth in the area for a very different item which is actually on mountain biking in William Borough Park boo Parkers is often known is a is a great area it's got some challenges somewhere there's some asbestos contamination the like but we saw this as a real potential to actually get some mountain bike trials in there as long as it can be done safely so following the the communities lead on this one the council agreed to fund some work into how it could be done safely and and test that up and assuming it could be to do some planning around that so we can actually go out and work with other providers Locksley's west and others actually around creating what could be one of the first urban mountain biking trails much better than having to drive via an hour or so up to Kalamunda which are the which are the closest trails for this very quickly growing sport community both young and old really loves so I hope to see this first step grow into something bigger and better many of you would know about the heart of Beaconsfield project and of course one key part of that is the Davis Park which is that very large landholdings it's over ten hectares by the Department of Communities now they've we've that predict is is continuing to progress with the lodgement of the structure plan over that's right which will see it change from the way it is now which is predominately it's a pretty eight old single light housing and a lot it's actually much greater diversity of housing types and mixed-use and some retail and a real revitalization of that area so this is a really important first step but we're really wanting community feedback on that structure plan as we see that hard as beacons to a project continue to take shape and really transform that area in a really positive way you
I saw that it was open for feedback from the local community and I know that because it's visit the area news that area a lot so the students made up some draft plans and it was really great that they were received so well by the City of Fremantle so the upgrade was great and even for the students they had seen that that their ideas have been considered and were part of it great I likes brainstorming all the ideas and when I saw it for the first time I loved the creativity with the basketball hoop are they all colorful like the natural logs I won't have they changed the swing to the net with the circle and the wonderful designs are possible my favorite part was designing for pop absolutely love seeing all of the new things and I saw exactly like all of our ideas well I loved that we all got to design our own part of the park I didn't think that this would actually happen but it's is really nice knowing that we've contributed to the park you
 one of the key items for this month was actually about King Square but probably playing a bit different Mad King Square wasn't about the buildings as Tom was actually about the public room so King Square of course is not just about the commercial buildings and the in the new Civic Center but also actually at the Battle of public spaces around that so we've been looking at some new paving that will run up Moumen human court and back back down High Street which council signed off on if I can take out that paving in King Square looking at that new playground equipment and the like and really that next stage because when we open up the new library in Civic Center run all these great new public spaces to feel like it's given the Royal City a refresh so are great to see that going to the next stage others head and the roundhouse are undoubtedly heritage buildings and places that are not only of local significance but state and national significance be fair to say the ravages of time on this is italia takers toll on both that building and also on the cliff sender we got a report that suggests that we need to do about 1.8 million dollars worth of works to look after those and make sure that they can remain open and a place that people can visit from not just all around the world but also locals as well so council receive that report and now we've got an information will be going to the state and federal government and seeking the work of partnership with him and where we how we can stabilize the cliffs and in the Roundhouse and make sure it stays open for at least another 200 years received a report about a original cultural center one again that's not just a local center but actually one that will be of off-state significance and after engaging with our local Aboriginal community on on this and and others we received a report that actually suggested that interesting where the JC is just below Arthur's head was a potentially a really good location for that one of the reasons for that our first first connection now obviously when Fremantle was and Perth was first established that whether the flag was painted the first contact in that area as well but also it could be a human point of reconciliation actually acknowledging that at that point and actually seeing that as part of the healing process so council was really kinda once again progressed that see and we will actually commit a major about fifty thousand dollars in the budget next year to a more detailed plan around that again so we can work with the state and federal government to actually finally get a major Aboriginal cultural center in this part of the world
It's taken a long time to get here but it's very exciting construction business for years like these really iconic buildings that code will be a transformative for geography marvel for me most importantly was the City of Fremantle to determination bring you life and the king of square to be the catalyst for that many ways really very much the aim of what we're doing today is to create a building that in a hundred years time I hope people are standing here we're pleased that this Duty is yeah at the heart of the square it's about designing the heritage the future irani including of quality of putting a large essential fighting in the center is not only with an on any sorely needed that will be crucial and I think most agrees to provide the starting point for domino effect that we'll see direct the potential starts to be realized throughout the Fremantle central area changes often scary at start ugly in the middle and beautiful at the end and this project alongside huge dozen accomplice accommodation and phone line will phase component of Fremantle stevie be revoked you
If you stay here in the silver late in the evening and all its quiet you can hear their footsteps
 from the council chambers for February 2019 it'd be fair to say the fibrin meeting was along with the long agenda over 250 pages in a really wide range of items but he used to share a few of those with you in terms of some of the decisions that the council made I guess one of the ones that was sending has come out of a couple of community responses is around the city's ability to control both the releasing of drones and m-f filled balloons on council property the council was considering a local law in this regard so that we can better manage these I'm obviously drones a large difference of why Casa but we saw that there was a for particularly events like around Monument Hill and the and that they don't service and those kinds of things a really good opportunity to make sure that we had some greater controls in that regard so that those services in these one in Hill could meet community expectations and similarly around the release of balloons from council land and we're really we manage those there local or go forward and will be subject to greater community engagement going forward as well the council also considered funding for the fremantle street doctor a really important community service which says doctor around key locations around around Fremantle bulk building and many ways been really important put a contact some of the vulnerable in our community community disappointingly we've seen the state government withdraw support for this important service and we were certainly came to see that that wouldn't necessarily stop right and because of the impacts that that would have how many of the most vulnerable in our communities so we going to step in and provide 20,000 a year of funding for that but we will be going back to the stake up but we really think that health is a state government issue and one that needs people poppy funded by the state and not simply seeing cost shifting to local governments will be making sure that we make message heard loud and clear as well so this comporting service can continue I noticed a motion by council ahead Fremantle was very timely because this week we had a range of visitors from China which has a massive film industry looking very closely Western Australia and especially places like Fremantle for filming in the future and we think is a really important opportunity here for both from our economic development perspective and a tourism perspective and getting Fremantle on the map from a in terms of the film industry and growing that because we do want to be a real hub for this kind of credit credit industry so I'm great to see this policy will come back to us actually how we can really encourage the film industry in our city and make us a really film friendly place where many people from all around the world want to come and film the amazing backdrop and amazing place that we are you might have heard about the Fremantle alternative which was the idea around big ideas for small housing which has been a really wonderfully ambitious idea and how do we actually get in few low density lower density infill in in the suburban area is that so much pouring forward to sees large houses built on small blocks no trees and this is a complete opposite of that and the very final stage of that has has come back to the council where it's now been signed off by the state government and we're gonna see smart sustainable smaller and more affordable housing in Fremantle some trials of that over the next five years again once again Fremantle straighten the leadership in this and I want to thank councillor Rachel Pemberton for her driving this in the City of Fremantle staff this has been a great process and I think they're going to see some really good new kinds of infill that I hope will be rolled out more wildly across the whole state you
There are a lot of different opportunities here at City of Fremantle you can work alongside some of the council staff doing lots of different activity we have programs specifically for children that you can come and be an assistant on help out with the play buster it's all about play is a activity bus that travels around the city they have volunteers working for them helping set up clean the toys and also helping the activities with the kids as well we also have volunteers who are ambassadors for the City of Fremantle they roam around the city and they're trained to tell people about how to find things where to go what's on in Fremantle their tourism ambassadors basically helping people around the city and to get the most out of this day in Fremantle we have also the roundhouse bites involved here with us at the city and they again our tourism guides and people who have just loved the history of Fremantle we also have helpers in our library we have people who just help stack the shelves and check the shelves and also have volunteers working in our wanju lounge which is a lounge that's specifically for over 55 people in our community and it's basically a place where people can come and feel welcome sit down have a cover and a chat so we have volunteers in there that are purely there just to make people feel comfortable and connected in the community we have volunteers involved in community planting days so if you're interested in conservation activities we have a lot of programs where we work with the conservation volunteers there's a lot of reasons why people aren't here and it and it it may just even be a feeling of giving something back to the community and it feels good
Because I'm retired now I need something to stimulate me I have a once-a-week rolling ship which means 2 hours from 10 to 12 just wandering all around Fremantle we usually walk to the railway station because Lots terrorists will counter to the railway station stop look around and think where they go so we give them that's telling about the catch and which direction to head then we walk down to Fisherman's Harbor and have a look around here in case of lip gloss and usually I'm on Fridays and the markets are open cause a lot of people looking for the markets and yeah it takes about two hours to get out route both fully in Fremantle and I do lots the travelling overseas so I know what it feels like to be a tourist wonder he have lost their going round in the circle so for me this is just helping people that whoo-hoo we feel like I do when I go disease
Over the Christmas New Year period some hot temperatures cause the trees to become highly stressed and defoliate the majority of their canopies what we've done is we've undertaken some mulching works of the tree worlds which ensures the moisture stays within the profile we've implemented a revised irrigation program so it's getting multiple irrigation cycles per day and we've also had sand saw moisture probe installed in one of the trees and this will give us real-time data on the moisture levels at various depths within the soil profile trees are showing great signs of recovery with all seven trees and they are showing signs of budburst and the forming of new leaves
It's really huge difference to my life because I am off the streets people are compassionately unites a wonderful finger better for our community and so I can understand that urge to give money to people on the street what you've got to bear in mind the difficulty reversed is that that might sustain them for that moment for that instant but it doesn't resolve their homelessness in fact what it might cause unintentionally is to sustain their homelessness the name of that does been around few years and it came around because the ferret committees are here in generous community who actually wanted to be able to help the less fortunate we were within a community to do what we do and to cope with the increasing demand we need financial support that's in the scape of them unfortunately seventy thousand dollars that's been donated so far through today without doubt goes to a really great worker Simpson Pat does people can see the good that we do inside all the money that comes in from donate without doubt and makes a huge difference I have a roof over my head I have accommodation I have comfort I have all sorts of things I hadn't had for quite some time so it's been a wonderful experience for me any initiative that support st. Pat's is absolutely wonderful as far as I'm concerned and these things they're so simple to use the money goes straight the same hats what more can you ask for
It's a modified game it's a smaller pitch it's either side it's quicker it's it's sort of length because it's obviously in terms of running on grass or artificial turf it's a lot different to learning on the sand can you imagine if you better some great this is some great sport there's an amazing amazing background you can have a cocktail the beach at the same time of if you want to work the City of Fremantle before a few years back where we've had bay beach football at a smaller scale and it was working the City of Fremantle team we who was just a great experience we thought we'd bring it back in and just have another opportunity to really bring the public down to the freemen on be able to see the great sights are there is here on the Saturday the 19th we've got our women's and mixed competition and then on the Sunday the 20th we've got our men's competition both starting at 12 o'clock and with the the speakers was for a long time one of those kind of it was a forgotten part of Rio and I think we've seen in recent years that really come to life and obviously the debaters beach house works the other works the city's done and then great events like this with football West I think you really see it at the coming up and create the City beat it's a great urban beat through the earth and a real focus on are things are really fantastic outcomes just a chance to get all our players and their members of the public to be able to participate in the competition great location the beaches fantastic great cafes restaurants nearby as well and and then really just a really awesome place to actually fight
 the free middle Council agreed to enable the transfer of this Bisons like car park from Sirona across to the forest family in investments as part of the king scrap project this has always been envisaged to be part of that integrated redevelopment and I guess well this is really interesting is really pleased to see that we've got a major new investor in Fremantle train the confidence for MLS future and also seeing this at great car park there's always been under utilization at site who actually be made into a major new development in the heart of Fremantle the city's move towards better waste recycling come one step closer with the step towards Fogo and spending a lot of money well over a million dollars on new bins and caddies and bin liners and the like um so where you might know it's quite a submissive lee important we are moving towards a three-bin system Fogo stands for food organic garden organics to make sure that we can actually hit our recycling rate of 70% that we've got under under one planet've agreed to purchase those will be delivered next year no idea this this works you roll out about August next year as part of a new recycling system the cities received quite a few complaints recently around parking on marine Terrace Muse Road and South Beach predominately because there's been untimed free parking in those areas and we're seeing both students not sure damn commuters and those kinds of things making use of that parking because quite closer to the cat bus that's at the unfortunate consequence of people who want to go to the beach and those kinds of things not going to get parking so we've taken onboard that feedback and are now going to introduced a range of measures to make sure that people can access the beach so such as time to parking along South Beach for our time parking to our time parking in other areas along marine Terrace and and use rope and also some quite cheap paid parking for those who do want longer-term car parks I can either be going to the city throw in a free dollars fifty today I think they don't get the balance right and as we go into the the great summer season people get importantly access the great beaches of freer has this was the last council meeting for 2018 and it's been a really good year like to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and see you next year
 this month we start off with some sad news the passing of longtime community development director Ken posny ken well known to many of you and female do well he was a director we worked the city of Fremantle for over 30 years and was the director of community development for much of that time and did some amazing things around around the city in terms of innovations in the community development space some of the key firsts that happen in the city we're done underground under Ken and he was did an amazing job of making sure that me are the less fortunate we're well looked after in our community so certainly our sympathies to Ken's family who I know we're missing him and at this time and big thanks to him for his service to our community single-use plastics will be banned from all City of Fremantle vents under new policy that was passed through our Nets of creating more sustainable events everything from obviously plastic bags is now banned across the state thankfully all the way through to bottles and cups and use plastics won't be allowed events that we run such as straight out festival one day and those kind of events but also working with others at run events wooden City of Fremantle like Falls Festival Winter Fest and those kinds of things to eliminate the plastic that they use they also won't be able to use straws obviously we're seeing more and more of these plastics end up into into our ocean and we really came to eliminate that and do the bit that we can in fact one of the most depressing statistics I've heard is that our oceans are predicted to have more plastic in them than fish by by 2050 and it's time that we act to make sure this doesn't happen once again in Fremantle we live leading the way on this to have more sustainable events marine Terrace is well as increasingly popular streets basically with the youth Plaza and the skate park down there people coming from the cappuccino strip across it and for a long time had the community calling for safe zebra crossings pedestrian crossings the council has agreed to install upgrade lighting and install new pedestrian crossings in this area to make that area even safer and more family friendly as Fremantle becomes a more popular destination for people going down the beach below path you

 the City of Fremantle destination marketing plan for 2019 2020 was unanimously adopted by the council and this is actually a really important new plan for free many ways it's simply about how can we make sure we are attracting more visitors to Fremantle and more people down to enjoy our amazing town um basically around the brand pillars of soul spirit and see this I think really great great plan that's put together by an expert group led by Linda Wayman and from some really really good Fremantle locals who really know their stuff in this space I think really puts and I also want to get out there and both attract visitors obviously we're starting with how we get more visitors from around Greater Perth people haven't_''_62.479 been to Fremantle years for years get them back back to Perth people from around the state but ultimately how we can work with tourism a and others to actually get more visitors both from interstate and internationally into into Fremantle this is both from tourism but also for for conferences for meetings and other international down to Fremantle so this plane has now been adopted you'll see this rollout and the new branding around this rollout over the next year or two and hopefully we'll see many more visitors down to Fremantle the intersection of Hampton Road and Scott Street has been a key area of discussion of the council as to how we make this intersection safer over the last few years has been a crash incidents including two involving children and obviously something needed to change to make sure that that was safer so council looked at a variety of options around that and ultimately I went with the option that would keep that intersection closed in terms of retaining the median strip on Hampton Road so that people couldn't turn right from Hampton Road into Scott Street by acknowledging that whilst that wasn't going to please everybody because that was causing some issues around Lloyd Street that we would improve that intersection as world with some of the leftover funds that have been given by the state government towards this project again a really tough a tough debate came read through it clearly in the debate in the council chamber was that we need to ultimately go back to the state government to Main Roads and look at some more substantive changes on Hampton Road so it can makes you make that a really safe area because for people with children crossing for school but also people coming to the shop so we're looking at some bigger longer-term solutions as well but I think in the short term the solutions proposed will continue to make this a safer intersection an item that was of great community interest was a cure and Samson Park and that as a dog off the lead exercise area now council has been grappling with this for some time trying to find that right balance between knowing that this is a really favorite probably regional area where people come from many places to exercise the dogs awfully but also acknowledging on the other hand that it's a a bush forever site we need to make sure that we preserve the conservation values of that site so this is a tough debate but on expert advice from our from our officers around keeping the middle spine the green grassy spine as a dog off the lead area and simply access points but giving the rest of the park as where dogs will need to be on on the lead I think that's the right the right balance they can see both this remain a really great meeting spot for people to walk their dogs but also preserving what is one of the last Bush forever sites in Fremantle with some pretty special species I mean you need this area and when they want to see it preserved into the future the West Australian Planning Commission recent release of discussion paper on entertainment precincts and noise and have proposed a trial for the North Beach area on how actually that entertain precincts can trial different noise regimes that can see residents and important the existing live music venues and other music venues continue to operate this is of course of great interest to Fremantle because like North breach we have some of those kind of challenging interfaces as rollin Fremantle CBD wants to don't want to see those kinds of venues closed down because of other other uses so the council agreed that we will support this trial in North Beach but also write to the state government asking that a trial be extended to Fremantle and I think that one of the things that we can demonstrate here is that how it works in different locations be fair to say Fremantle which probably has more Live Music Venues and North Bridge which has more kind of other kinds of other kinds of venues and I think that we could really add to the trial and add to the success of how we can actually start to create our city centers so that residential uses hotel uses and music and live venue users can walk right side by side in a way that actually continues to create vibrant city centres you

Welcome to the quick guide to parking in fremantle if there's one thing everybody loves about Fremantle it's the beautiful heritage buildings like the elegant Town Hall the vibrant National Hotel and the grand old Spice's building oh wait that's not the spices building that's where the spices building used to be this is the spices building it was demolished in 1969 to make way for a car park back in the 60s and 70s Town Planning was all about the car even our leafy King Square was a car park you see the center of Fremantle was designed long before there were cars the streets were laid out for pedestrians and the occasional horse and car so come the 60s the only way to create car parks in the middle of the city was to smash up our history thankfully Fremantle came to its senses before too much damage was done these days car parks are mainly developed around the edges of the CBD a short walk from your destination and there's a lot of parking there are about a thousand Street bays parks plus about 1700 more are provided by Fremantle ports and commercial parking companies in all that's about 5,000 spots to park but which to choose well the key is knowing what sort of visit you want to have if it's just a quick stop there are Street bays on High Street where you can park free for thirty minutes if you need one two or three hours you can find that as ticket parking on other street base or you can choose one of the many indoor or outdoor off Street car parks rates vary but it's possible to park all day for less than 10 but why is parking charged for at all after all some suburban shopping malls offer free parking well like Perth and Subiaco and others who also charge for parking Fremantle isn't just a shopping centre surrounded by bitumen it's a living vibrant city with the city's amenities and services and well personality all that costs money to maintain and of course Fremantle isn't just used by residents people come from all over Perth all over the are one way for visitors to contribute to the city's upkeep to share the load with ratepayers and keep in mind that free parking is always paid for by somebody if the city didn't charge for parking rates would need to go up by about 15% to compensate the other effect of free street parking is to flood the city with visitors who use it as a car park often traveling elsewhere parking fees and time limits keep car Bay's turning over to make way for the next visitors who want to do business in town by the way Frio residents can get a permit that allows them free on street city parking between 3 p.m. and 00 a.m. so next time you're coming to Fremantle remember that there are plenty of spaces to park as you're coming into the city whether you're entering from the north or from the east or from the south and have a great visit thanks for watching the quick guide to parking in Fremantle for more information and a parking map of Frio visit the website
 fremantle solar farm came one step closer to our reality last night when council approved the business plan for the solar farm with renewable energy company in puron council has approved a twenty five year lease with help Iran with an extension for a 15 year option at a peppercorn peppercorn rent the 20 hectare landfill site is heavily contaminated and at the moment it's of no use to the city and of no economic benefit to the city so we see this as a is a really important step forward it's a very good use for the for the landfill site the solar panels are designed to sit above this above the site so that there will not be no need for excavation or minimal disturbance of the soil any all the environmental processes and regulations will have to be approved before it goes ahead it's also very important part of our city's one planet strategy target is to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2025 and the solar farm is a really important way we're going to achieve that so approving the business will be approving any development applications and going through the environmental regulations another item passed last night was the adoption of Fremantle's new CCTV cameras strategy we were fortunate enough earlier this year to receive a nine hundred and twenty eight thousand dollar grant from the federal safer communities initiative and this allowed us to expand our coverage of CCTV cameras in the city free metal is a warm and welcoming and safe place for families right now but following a community survey done recently families felt that there was a little bit more that could be done to keep them safe so this extra CCTV coverage we're working in tandem with wo police and our community safety team just allows us to respond faster if we need to when incidents occur and keeps fremantle a safer place for for everyone to come and enjoy I think everyone in the community appreciates how important it is to have significant tree canopy in our cities trees are so important when it comes to urban cooling and habitat for our bird life it's always an issue when we lose have come up with a policy which will go out for public advertising and we'd like to get your opinions on how you see the best way to maintain our tree canopy the significant tree Register is different to ideas that we've had in the past this one will be generated by only by property owners who wish to nominate a tree on their own property so if you're interested in maintaining our tree canopy or even increasing it check out the website soon and and have your say on our maintaining our tree canopy

 after more than a decade of backwards and forwards and not making much progress this month we finally resolved the issue of the highest ratings telling high upgrade that's being long called for bought by the community and I must say in many ways been worth the way because we've finally got an outcome that I think really meets those key objectives that wanted to around improving the intersection in terms of safety and an efficiency of that key intersection into the port but also my improving humanity for residents but also these really key things like preserving some of the key mature trees minimizing impacts on the golf course but also providing the necessary partner for netball and those kinds of things so it's been a long road but be fair to say that the most recent discussions with the state government and Main Roads have been really really fruitful I think they've done a good job of engaging with with the community actually picking up on some of those key ideas so I'm really pleased with the outcome that we've got we all be looking forward to seeing this major investment of around about a hundred million dollars of upgrades of roads around Fremantle underway with the West port task force process now well underway it was timing that the Fremantle council made its very clear on the working Fremantle port the federal council overwhelmingly supported are working poor into the future and we did this with a rule 15 so it's very much part not only of the history and the culture of remember very much part a central part of our economy so the resolution was quite clear that we support a working container port on the north side of the harbour into the future but we want to see some key upgrades and many ways the port itself has got lots of capacity they're all challenges with the upgrades needed on some of those what we would call on the land side on the transport side so as I talked about before obviously at the high street upgrade we key part of that but we also need to get more Freight onto onto rail and actually I can get more that well that Freight on rail during daylight hours so really strongly supportive of that and well of course we're also really clear saying that it is an opportunity on Victoria key on the south side of of the port to see some of those port functions move into and expanded outer harbor and things like the roll-on roll-off cars no the key functions moved out of that area so he can actually really reconnect Fremantle to the waterfront improve the tourism and and and at the arrival point for me of the passenger who arrived by boat and I think we here therefore we have the best of both worlds are working port into the future but also a south side that that is actually a much better tourism location Fremantle over one Hospital precinct is one of those key projects that we see really transforming they did this hand of Fremantle we've been working very hard with the state government on this round actually coming up with a broad plan they can see some of the underutilized assets both of the feminine this drug planning is now well underway and we see that there is a really strong potential for that and for upgrading Fremantle overall has a really great community facility that can be used all year round so we a lot of the land that we're dealing with in Syria is owned by the state government so we're going to enter into a MoU as an call as the key state government Land Development Agency so we can actually get this redeveloped and actually see the important history of the oval area but also actually the bit that could the connections across it and the better use of it and development around it happen in future years and this I'll be fair to say this is probably one of the key most transformative projects for Fremantle over coming years the Hungerford award has been awarded with Fremantle press around supporting new authors in Fremantle that we've been proud to support the last few years and I was pleased to say that this month we agreed to continue their partnership and Fremantle will see the Fremantle would award where we every second year will give 20,000 towards this great prior so she celebrates the best new book by an unburned published author and we've seen some great novels come through and I think this is one things that I love every minute we are a city that loves the arts loves literature and I think it's really important as a as a city council that we actually support these things through Fremantle Press and I look forward to seeing many great new wealth was born in and around the Fremantle area in coming years

Welcome to the September edition of from the council chambers scheme amendment number 72 for the Davis Park area in Beaconsfield is a really major change in fact it's the first step on the heart of Beaconsfield renewal project that many of you would be aware of this of course is land that Department of Housing only the Housing Authority which is around South Street Caesar and the Froy within that zone there around Davis Park and here there's a really great opportunity to see that up zoned and some major changes made the department owns over 90 percent of the dwellings already within this area and you know the plan is to actually upgrade the area and actually get some greater density and diversity of housing stock I'm into that area as well as well as great new spaces for the community and public open space so it's been zoned from what it was which was in our 30 area to one now which is a development zone so in case you embed that within the greater Beaconsfield master planning that we're doing as project and as you see that whole area go through a major and you'll in conjunction with other major sites including the TAFE site the school site the quarry site and others so it's a great opportunity and great to be moving further down this road in partnership with the state government the king square project is a major urban renewal project but it's not just about new buildings in fact really importantly it's also about the public realm the spaces between the buildings that we want to bring back to life Council this week looked at the draft plan for the Kings group public realm and passed that to go out for public comment some really exciting stuff in in this area in terms of adding new trees new green spaces and creating a great new community hub and including a new community playground for children we've already budgeted about half a million dollars to invest in that area to attract families back into the area I think the plans look great but importantly we want you to have a look at them and even better because they're very much at the heart of the king script project is actually making it a place for people once again we look forward for your input into this process the council received a very interesting and ambitious report called the corporate energy plan that was put together by Joss Burton associates and others so that it showed how the City of Fremantle could reach 100 percent renewable energy by 2025 is their ambitious plan but one which is entirely doable and one which the council is very excited about because I showed how by investing in renewable energy we actually not only of course reduce our carbon footprint and continue to be a leader in sustainability but it also demonstrates that there are major savings in terms of electricity and other energy costs that ultimately can keep rates low and take pressure off ratepayers so this is a really exciting plan one that will see lots of large scales solar going on roofs other really great innovations in the renewable energy space and also some important partnerships with a private sector on projects such as probably one of the most exciting documents that we've seen in the energy space for many many years on council and one that is going to drive investment in renewable energy in this city going forward so I look forward to you guys having a look at that more closely and seeing how we can be a Hunt percent renewable energy by 2025 thanks for watching from the council chambers for more information please visit the city of free metals website

Hi I'm Bianca and welcome to news bites a wrap-up of the week's top stories from the city of Rio coming up the transformation of Fremantle's Civic heart ramps up a tough decision on some much-loved trees and a vending machine in Reverse the 270 million dollar King Square in your project has entered an exciting new phase with construction underway on Sirona capitols landmark fomo retail concept demolition has also started on the old council building to make way for a new admin and library building with lots of great new features the City of Fremantle is encouraging people to support local traders as the project progresses I'm here with one of the traders van from grumpy sailor cafe and ban what do you think about the king square project I think it's a great project I think it will bring vibrancy back into Fremantle which is much needed so I think it's a positive step for Fremantle and have you been managing while constructions been going on it's been better than expected at times it's a bit noisy but apart development sites and it hasn't affected it's too badly so that's been good the Fremantle council has made the difficult decision to remove and replace two ailing Moreton Bay fig trees from Kings Square the two trees including the much loved Christmas fig a more than 120 years old and have been in decline for some time community feedback showed around 70 percent support for the removal and replacement of the trees there's a lot of affection for these trees so it was a really tough decision for the council but we decided to remove both of those trees now and replace them with with mature trees straight away when the I guess the key element for us is making sure it's safe we didn't want limbs dropping in those kinds of things so he's decided to bite the bullet and do that now we also decided they're actually animate the wood available that was from those trees available to community groups as well and so they can have their own legacy continuing on into the future the Christmas people replaced with replaced by a mature London plain tree the city of Fremantle has listened to community feedback about dogs in Sir Frederick Sampson Park the city had proposed to ban dogs from the bushland areas of the park but will now allow dogs to be walked through the bush on a lead we do recognise the importance of dog walking in the bush land to the local community so we are proposing to put the proposal is for dogs on leash in the bush land and off lead in the parkland so the next step is the the proposal goes out for public consultation for the next 28 days and the submissions will then be considered and then we'll take it back to Council for consideration did you know there's a vending machine in Fremantle where you can put bottles and cans in and get vouchers for frere shops and attractions out the reverse bending machine we'll be at the Esplanade reserve until the end of September put in your recyclable bottles and cans and get batches that can be redeemed at places like the waa Museum sanshiro's urban forest plan has been recognized with a landscape architecture award the plan which aims to plant more than 11,000 trees across Fremantle took out the landscape planning prize at the w.a Institute of Landscape Architects Awards last week that's all from us this week to stay in touch with what's happening in your city follow us on social media or check out our website thanks for watching News bite
Welcome to the August edition of from the council chambers with the king square project now about to start up that we look to have a breaking the ground ceremony later this week with project construction happening in September there were a few items that came to the council where we addressed some of the implications of the King Square project and making sure we've got that design right this month we spent some time debating of all things public toilets because we know that was through the community feedback one of the key things that people want us to get right was actually providing the right kinds of public facilities within the new king square project so there's a fair bit of debate around that making sure that we got both really good facilities for families which will be as part of the new library development in the basement will be a new family room and public toilets adjacent to that but also flexible public toilets at the ground level so that both they can be used obviously during the day when the visitor facilities open but night or have it used for special events and openings and exhibitions and those kinds of things that enable different spaces to be used and have the adequate amount of toilets here as well so I'll ask for a fair bit of debate I think we've come up with quite a good plan to actually making sure that when the Kings great projects complete we not only have a great building but we have a great building with great facilities the king square project will also require the relocation not only of the council administration staff but also the fermentx city library as a new building is constructed in the Civic precinct so what came to the council this month was actually a discussion around that new library facility a report saw a new library temporary library that would be put into the form of dockers building at Fremantle level this new facility I think actually will be fantastic and actually is a good opportunity for us to trial some of the great new features that the long term carry hilt designed library in King Square will have to be a great new temporary library adjacent to Fremantle oval which will importantly have so many really good parking nearby they can be accessed by people as well and I think we're going to see actually a really great new facility within great new technologies that we'll see embedded into the building in the longer term so council I agreed to that new location and we look forward to seeing seeing that happen we expect that the library will be relocated towards the end of 2017 early 2018 council considered a really important contribution towards the Southwest partnership forum which is actually a partnership between local governments key community service providers in our region and the state government where we work together it actually makes sure that we're providing those facilities for people in need in our region now there has been unfortunately a drop in commitment from the state government towards some of this funding which local governments like Fremantle and others have been asked to fill the council I was really proud we did was we agreed to fill some of that gap with also via both Melville and Coburn so that this really important ongoing work where we could actually partner up bring together the key agencies to address some of the key points of need internet in our community and this has been a partnership that's included key groups like lights and Pat's and and and others in our community and it's one that we really came to actually see grow and and and continue because it's only through working together that we're going to actually start to really get a handle on and solve some of the key social and community issues that we have so a really good decision I think there by the council and we'll see the Southwest partnership forum go from strength to strength and continue to address some of the key needs in our community thanks for watching from the council chambers for more information please visit the city of free members website
 the much loved more by affixing King Square was a tough decision for the council this month as we decided that they would need to be removed and replaced with two other mature trees as quickly as possible if it's a there's lots of affection for those trees in the community but the community engagement on this clearly show that the committee understood that it was better to remove them now than having them become a safety hazard and need to be severely pruned back I've overcome in years as we as I kind of limped along so they will be removed in in coming months and we will be sourcing some maturity trees through replace those as part of the king square renewal project Sampson Park which is an amazing Bush River site in the middle of Sampson is also a dog exercise area so council over the last few months been trying to get that balance right between making sure that we preserve the the bush land in that area but also enable what's become a very popular dog exercise spot to which will now put out for a public consultation which enables the main spine running through there the grass area to be a dog off the lead area and another access point but the other key parts of the site dogs will still be loud but just need to be kept on leashes so that will go for public comment now and we certainly appreciate the users of that parks feedback as we go forward as population and economic activity grows in our region it's gonna be increasingly important that actually having really high-quality public transport to Fremantle South and East are going to be a major priority for us so council was adopted a position as one of our main payers will be working with the new state government around a high priority transit route down South Street linking the Murdoch activity center downs Gerry through to Fremantle and that and that's a really great opportunity to obviously get some good new development but also some really important important key transport link the second one is a link between Fremantle and Koba and central via Coburn coast that's been part of the discussion whether that's a light or heavy rail solution we also work with government on that and again linking Frio via public transport to the south and to the east
Welcome to the November edition of from the council chambers the king square project went through another key hurdle this week with one of the final approvals for the commercial part of the project as you might be aware underneath the government office which will have 1500 new workers from the permanent communities is a pretty exciting new retail precinct called FOMO and as part of that the Cerrone have applied for some adjusted externals to the building which is around some new canopies which kind of Express that nature of the building as well as some changes to the Queensgate car park which is going to be going through a multimillion-dollar upgrade as part of the project the council passed most of these the only thing on the advice of the design advisor committee who wanted some revised changes to the awnings and they will be coming back in negotiation with the design Advisory Committee and the CEO but certainly the king script project is getting very close to final sign-off now and I think we've got us some very exciting looking buildings and great upgrades to this really important community center and one which be fair to say has been crying out for an upgrade for some time and I'm pleased to say that the council meeting we agreed to a new plan for 300,000 upgrade to traffic movements and streetscaping in that area after some extensive consultation with the community there was a fair to say the strong support for this project and we're also very pleased that the state government has come on board as well to fund the majority of the project that we'll see not only the road made safer both for 50 pedestrians and for and for motorists sitting into it but some really nice upgrades to the streetscape that I think will really lift the area and make it an even better Town Centre for the people Hilton and beyond adaption to climate change and sea level rise was a big issue on on the agenda and a really important long-term strategic issue that the city is grappling with in conjunction with councils around us and also the state governments we gave some there strong feedback to the we also there was also a presentation of the Layton and Muslim carp beaches coastal adaptation plan for sea level rise both of these were very strong in saying what we need to do is plan for our future our long-term future where sea level rise will happen we expecting sea level rises of up to a metre over the next century and that will mean that there will be greater beach erosion and it's important that we keep our beaches we don't want to be in you know point in 50 years time where we've gotten a series of groins and rock walls and the very one of the things we love about Fremantle having great white sandy beaches is gone so that is about having planned and managed to retreat actually setting back to new buildings well back from the coast so that that natural erosion process can occur and our beaches will continue to be great places that we enjoy as a community so that feedback will flow through and this will form part of the longer-term planning here in the City of Fremantle say is getting more and more popular as a destination which is great since the new upgrades to the change rooms and the park lands in that area we see more more visit that area and enjoy the new cafes and restaurants as well one of the challenges around that of course is car parking and be fair to say that that gets under a fair bit of stress at peak periods so the councillors budget is 70,000 towards expanding some of the car parks on the northern side of the Layton Beach Surf Club there so that we came more parking for people who are visiting on the weekends at the request of the surf clubs world we'll be working with the Freeman reports and other government agencies around making accessible some of the underutilized land to the south of the port Road Curtin Avenue alignment there so that we can making that safer for pedestrians to cross some cars to access as well so it's important that we can allow everyone to enjoy the beach special peak period on the weekends but do so in a upgrades which we expect to happen in coming months thanks for watching from the council chambers for more information please go to the city or Fremantle's website
I think it's great for our residents to come here load up with all these difficult things to recycle freon is free I really closely located and having one joint facility where we can do all this stuff together makes a huge amount of sense I think they'll love it I think the feedback will be extremely positive for from the residents to town of HTML absolutely this will be a winner one place you can go and just drop off pretty well whatever everything and it's what's really important about it is the recycling rates are much better than in just really putting out in your virgin waiting for it to get chucked in the back of the truck and taking landfill you've got to be consistent people have got to have that across the metropolitan area and I think to allow our residents to come here and get rid of those hard items paint batteries the stuff that no one knows really know what to do it and to deal with it in a environmentally positive manner I think that's just something the city Fremantle red staff for allowing each member to join the partnership it's absolutely great

Welcome to the December edition of from the castle chambers a key item that had a lot of community interest this month was the item of the day said you know one the planning application was presented both the planning committee end was referred to council council ultimately decided to set this aside over the next three months so we actually mediate with sunset events and with those artists who are working in the area as well as the city Aaron coming up with a solution for JTED unit one that meets the council's goals but in a way that has broad community support one of the queer really came to see that area activated hasn't intended it can really support the arts in that area and be a great community attraction there's a balancing act there that we're trying to achieve and be fair to say that at the moment is probably bit of a gap between what staffs always been approvable and supportable from a planning perspective and what the community wanted to see down there and also what sunset events or as a together into one into one space won't be easy but we think actually sitting down having that conversation over the next few months and coming back with a refined proposal is the way forward and that was supported by the council South Terrace down the south end of South Terrace and South's room and has been a key point of community debate over recent months around the traffic coming in that area I mean you would have noticed that this boy some temporary speed bumps put in to slow traffic down into that area which has been quite successful in terms of doing that but now we're moving on to the more permanent stage and council was asked to consider some traffic treatments for the area on the corner of South Terrace and little love for a road that will see that slowed the traffic down make it beautify the area and actually make it more pedestrian and cycle friendly council approved that that budget and that proposal after some really good community feedback that we got through the council a website and other areas that will traffic coming that bit of South Terrace and making it even even even better community hub so this is a project that is both supported by the state government through Simone McGurk office some was be very helpful in getting us a budget allocation for that as well as City of Fremantle money so that project will now proceed and I think we're going to see that little great part of Fremantle become an even better more liveable and more pedestrian oriented part of Rio another key milestone in the king square project was also debated which was the awarding of the tender for the demolition of the existing Civic building in King Square including the library and the council chambers and the council administration office that that tender was awarded and that now means that that next stage of the project can occur and of course that also means that this will be the very was the very last council meeting from here in in this building in fact it will be the last from the council chambers from this building as well there's been a lot demolition contract ten tender now been approved and the next stage of works about to proceed we're going to see over the next year some very big changes here in King Square so will be of course moving down moving across to Fremantle oval but the council meetings will actually occur in North three mantle over the coming year and that's also where we'll be having council meetings and committee meetings and we will also be doing our from the from the council chambers from an alternative location other than here so nice it's been been great being part of this building kind of been sad to say goodbye in some ways but certainly looking forward to that new stage finally I'd like to just wish everyone a very happy Christmas and we can you all a safe new year and a great break with your friends and family and look forward to seeing you next year
The quick guide to planning approvals for everyday projects there are rules that guide property development in the city of Fremantle some are set by the state government and some are set by the city at the state level the rule Bible is the residential design codes at the city level it's the local planning scheme these rule books describe what sort of things can be built and where they can be built each proposal for a new development is assessed by the city according to the current rules so how does a new development happen well it starts with a landowner or developer having an idea hopefully they have a chat with the city about their concept and get some advice before moving forward then they lodge a formal development application it presents their concept for the project using drawings floor plans and documentation now the idea may not comply with the rules yet but the city has to accept every application and assess it and here briefly is how that assessment happens the city's Planning Department starts by checking that the application contains everything it should planning team gets stuck into the details they also refer the application to specialists experts inside and outside the city assess whether the development meets all the rules in an heritage Public Health engineering traffic impact and other relevant fields now while all those people are checking out the proposal neighbors will sometimes get a say if the project requires neighbor consultation there'll be a 14-day community consultation process letters go to the neighbors to gather their views and their comments a reviewed as part of the assessment so now the Planning Department has assessed the application all the specialists have assessed it and the neighbors have had a say the assessment and neighbor comments may be shared with the developer who can choose to solve some issues with a revised development application and that takes us to about 30 since the application was received and now it's time for the city's assessment report the report explains why the proposal is being approved or rejected based on the current rules and for most projects that's the end of the process even the project goes ahead or with the State Administrative Tribunal or perhaps a new application will be made down the track and it all starts again thanks for watching the quick guide to planning approvals for everyday projects for more information visit the city of Fremantle's website

Welcome to the July edition of from the council chambers it will be fair to say that parking is one of the most hotly debated issues in in fremantle and it was debated at the council meeting in terms of how we deal with residents parking permits you might have you ever every resident of the city of Fremantle has a parking permit that enables them to come and park in the Fremantle CBD for nothing but we had found from our surveys a lot of residents either weren't aware of it or were confused by the times they could use it and we couldn't in those kinds of things so we decided to simplify that process to encourage more people back into the CBD to do the shopping go to restaurants and make the most of our great city centre after a bit of community consultation and discussion we arrived at a simplified permit which enables free parking after 3 p.m. seven days a week all the way through to 9 a.m. the next morning and after 5 p.m. there are no time construct symptoms you can this is a really great initiative where we hope will get more residents back into the pre mental CBD with our free after 3 campaign and and more free parking in Fremantle the City of Fremantle has been keen to encourage people to better utilize their verges often our verges are weeds and kind of and lawn that that aren't wrongly used in terms of either native gardens or anything like that so we passed the neat principles for policy they actually encourage residents to get out there and make the most that bit of land Adrina for path and the road and what we've done is we've really start to cut back the red tape and just moment it pretty clear that we might want people to use it we'd love you to turn your bird into a native garden and we're happy to help you do that the council will be offering as part of this view policy a service where we'll come out and basically take take the old lawn or the wetland and the weeds out and at top top some subsidized plants from a pace that you can plant in there we've also simplified what you can do if if people want to put out seating raised garden beds for veggies even fruit trees and those kinds of things we've poured the principles for a new policy that will enable that I think this is a really exciting opportunity we did a really great walk around with the community looking at some of the best birds gardens in in fremantle and was a real sense of not only a verges great for the environment in terms of getting bird life back into our and and biodiversity back into our suburbs but a grateful community to around getting people to he spend more time at some of their houses and getting to know each other so well these principles will be rolled out in coming months and we look forward to seeing Fremantle once again been a-been_._173.97 Olivia this time in the third space the council also considered aj defecation for henry streets were packed for a large proposal for more than 120 units run between hen Street to us for a refusal of this and the council did support that refusal and that will now be referred to data the reason that this development wasn't supported by council was because it proposed five storeys in the in the West End as you would know we've recently put the whole of the West End more 250 properties on to the state Heritage List the largest listing in the state and which we've really proud of it because the West End is a very unique irreplaceable gem right in the heart of Fremantle so as we do major new developments which we are keen to and carried to my site we really like to see this kind of adaptive reuse of our buildings but an intellectual is of the right scale and doesn't overwhelm the amazing built heritage that we already have a new in this precinct the item now will be considered by and trade up it was also recommended for refusal by the state whether hedges council and from the site of Harry's office as well so we have my fences up refused and will actually all in the longer term see a major reworking of this proposal we're certainly keen to encourage residents back and the West End is a great opportunity their boat we're really careful and vigilant that we make sure we get these kinds of developments right and that they keep the West End going as a vibrant part of Fremantle for the next hundred years thanks for watching for more information please visit the city of females website
 the June cast meeting had a special start we had started some meetings we do presentations around significant things that have happened during the month and this month it was a real pleasure to acknowledge former councillor and deputy mayor Dean Hobson many of you have seen the playground in Kings square that have been there for many years was the teen Hobson playground and with the King scrap project now well underway in the and the demolition of the Civic Building underway as well that that playground was being dismantled and we had the pleasure of handing back this the sign of Jay Hopson playground to Jean as well as kind of thanking her for for her really important contribution to bringing families and life back into the center of Fremantle of course there'll be a new playground a new even far better playground designed by school kids around Fremantle that will be going in as part of the King Square project in coming years but this is a nice way of kind of acknowledging James for the important contribution to that handing back the sign and her grandkids more than 20 years ago when their playground was first installed so that was how he kicked off the accounts meeting before we got into some of the other business especially around the budget been the last meeting of the financial year I was of course the budget meeting and that was at the heart of the of the council meeting where we passed our budget for the 2018 2019 financial year it was really as a big budget year of course because at the heart of this year's budget is the king square renewal project over 46 million dollars of course we spent on the new libraries and Civic Center which is going to be a very much harder that 270 million dollar project that we are doing in partnership with Sirona that will bring many thousands of workers back into our city centre so that's very much this year's budget is very much at the heart of that despite that's a very obviously a very big chunk of money and big investment in the city's future but one of the things able to do it was actually the Cape right lo in fact this year 2.9 percent rate increase is actually the second lowest rate increase that we've had going all the way back to about 2000 in fact the lowest rate increase was well was last year and that's despite actually being the 2% of that 2.9 is actually so we can move towards three bins otherwise known as faux goat which is around food organics and garden organics and actually having a third bin for those so have a proper separate of separation and sure that much less of our waste goes to landfill fremantle along with other councils in the S MRC has already a leader in diversion from landfill but this going towards three bins I try we've been doing with Melville news Fremantle it's something that we want to put in place properly it's going to require of course purchasing lots of new bins and rolling out that whole new schedule over the next twelve months or so so this is actually a major investment in sustainability and the cities feature hard part of the project so I guess King Square Fargo and the other really big projects are is around from arrow Park where there's a major new community and sporting facility which we spend over two five years by this financier about 2.8 million dollars in that investment as well so I think it's really great stuff in the budget but I encourage you to go and have a look and see what else is in there you

The quick guide to planning approvals for major projects there are rules that guide property development in the city of Fremantle some are set by the state government and some are set by the city at the city level the rule Bible is the local planning scheme the planning scheme describes what sort of things can be built and where they can be built over the years the scheme gets updated by the council as things change for example when the city decided to increase its population the planning scheme was amended to allow taller buildings but only in some locations each proposal for a new development is assessed by the city according to the current rules but with very large projects the city doesn't have the final say on whether the project goes ahead so how does a new development happen well it starts with a developer having an idea hopefully they have a chat with the city about their concept and get some advice before moving forward then they lodge a formal development application it presents their concept for the project using drawings floor plans documentation and look a lot like a finished building but at this stage it's really just an idea in fact the idea may not even comply with the rules yet but the city has to accept every application and assess it and here briefly is how that assessment happens the city's Planning Department starts by checking that the application contains everything it should and there aren't any obvious problems next while the planning team gets stuck into the details they also refer the application to specialists experts inside and outside the city assess whether the development meets all those in heritage Public Health engineering traffic impact and other relevant fields if it's three stories or more it also be looked over by the city's design Advisory Committee for an expert opinion on the architecture now while all those people are checking out the proposal the community also gets its say there's a 28-day community consultation process to expose the project idea to the public and gather views letters go to the local area ads go in the local paper signs go up a community information session explains the project and gathers comments all the public comments are reviewed as part of the city's assessment so now the Planning Department has assessed the application all the specialists have assessed it and the public has had to say the assessment and public comments are shared with the developer who can choose to solve some issues with a revised development application and that takes us to about sixty days since the application was received and now it's time for the city's assessment report the report explains why the proposal is being approved or rejected based on the current rules and then the city's final report is released and presented to the council and for many projects that's the end of the process either the project goes ahead or if it's rejected the applicant may appeal the decision with the State Administrative Tribunal or perhaps a new application will be made down the track and it all starts again but if the project is valued at more than ten million dollars the city's report isn't the end of the story for these a body called the joint development assessment panel or Jade app the Jade app holds a public meeting within ten days of receiving the city's assessment report they hear recommendations from the city and any responses from the developer the community or others that meeting decides whether the project goes ahead sometimes overruling the city's recommendation and that unless the Jade app decision is appealed to the State Administrative Tribunal is where the approvers process finally comes to an end thanks for watching the quick guide to planning approvals for major projects for more information visit the city of Fremantle's website
Welcome to the April edition of from the council chambers the first item of business this month was actually dealing with the retirement of councillor Dave cupboard who has been the deputy mayor here at the City of Fremantle for a number of years and I want to take this opportunity to say big thank you to Dave and for his amazing contribution to the council he's gone to work as a senior adviser to our new premier so the first item of business was that we had to elect a new deputy mayor in order see the warm congratulations to councillor Ingrid Walton who was a elected deputy mayor from now until the elections in October I think for those of you who know Ingrid you'll know she's a person of great integrity and we look forward to working with her in terms of councillor cauldrons retirement from the council there won't be a election a by-election between now and October given it so close and instead that position in the East Ward will remain empty until the October elections a pocket park in the is a really great item partly because it's a really fantastic idea there was that small portion of Hilton on the north side of South Street and it doesn't have a local park and we not only had a really good discussion that actually approved a really great community plan for that Park but it was really nice for the public question time at the start of council meeting that we had a number of families come along and express their desire that that the council support this park um in fact on some really nice views from local children in the community who showed why small parts of this are so important as a place where community can gathering and come together so the council voted to support the creation of this park and we look forward to that happening in coming months and actually creating a great new hub for the community in that pile of children the ban of single-use plastic bags was debated the council the third time that the Fremantle council has looked at this issue the previous two times it was ultimately's different this time is that the New Labour government has said quite explicitly that they want to see local governments introduce bans is kind many ways the students have stepped towards a statewide ban down the track and pleasingly this time it's not fremantle alone we're seeing other local governments like the city of ginger anniversary mantle already putting these through their councils and I know that many others from Coburn's Rockingham and others are also looking at this which is really exciting so what we've done is I have a plastic bag ban of single-use plastic bags is a really thin ones the ones that are 35 microns or less that you often get from the supermarkets and they will be we banned and although they can be replaced by other kinds of bags but they're reusable bags or biodegradable ones so we'll never get the public advertising and we'd love your feedback on how that might work and and and making sure that you're happy with that and that we certainly bring our whole community along a really important coastal council I think it's very important we were finding many of these plastic bags ending up in our waterways and actually having quite a serious and damaging effect on marine life so we look forward to that ultimately we see this as a step towards statewide Bend and interestingly now we're only three states away from a national ban on plastic bags across the whole of Australia females really proud today is part the planning considerations around King Square were considered a council as it as a public authority and take that this will be a public work we are not required in fact we're not able to put it through the normal planning process that would include development tests and panels and those kinds of things but we wanted to make sure that we went through a transparent process so that the community and everyone could be assured that the new Civic building plant and for the heart of King Square complies with both planning regulations and building regulations but also that the community could have their say so the council agree that that will have that will come through both the planning committee as a application normally would most likely in the June round of meetings on to the full council but before that happens we will hold a community information session so those who are interested to come and have a look at the plans are able to do so and ask questions of professional staff and have understanding and for those who want to give feedback the plans of course will also be up online people can provide comments through that and we certainly do do welcome that feedback on what is a major project for rejuvenating the heart of Fremantle and one that we're really excited about children ward councillor Jeff McDonald board our notice of motion asking the council to support marriage equality and adoption the mag's equality proclamation this is a really important discussion and one which some people might say is beyond the realms of local government but I think Fremantle as a community is always one that I think is showing leadership in key social issues and one which the council discussed and was really join other councils from the City of Sydney in Melbourne and over especially actually to be the first West Australian export and local government to support marriage equality formally interestingly the city of Bayswater also debated motion on the same night and also supported it although the council did did tell me that they came in just after us in terms actually actually formally adopting it so it was it was a proud moment and one which I think really does capture the values of majority of Australians who think it is time that all people with other color should be able now thanks for watching this edition of from the council chambers for more information please check the City of Fremantle website WWE a mantle whe Iove you Forge

 the big item for debate this month was around unit 1 of Jason down on bathers beach behind Arthur's head which proposal to turn that into a tavern and as part of the Florida Arts precinct that the city has been looking at for some time if it has been a hotly debated item over a number of years originally started the first proposal was for a much larger venue of 150 people with a up to 12 concerts with 1500 a year after some after the council rejected that along with Western Planning Commission a scaled-down proposal as a result of some mediation with the council has come back which is a venue of up to 300 and a footprint of 40% that's it was to certainly a controversial it and he had a full gallery of people speaking for and against the item the council ultimately decided to accept the officers recommendation for approval and which is a recommendation that ultimately goes to the West Australian Planning Commission if the West Australian Planning Commission accept this recommendation and it goes forward what ultimately will a venue which the council intent is for it to be an attractor to the area and one that can for deactivate the Arthur's head precinct and also creates important linkages between bathers Beach which has become increasingly popular as long as the bathers beach house renovation obviously today go as well and connecting that through to to Victoria key and the port and we saw that as an important stepping stone around connecting up the city there's still some way to go in this proposal but certainly it was it an attempt to try and get that balance right and we'll continue to see this process through although now it is largely with the West Australian Planning Commission logo and waste was another big item in front of the council this month for those who don't know is about food organics and garden organics actually which is at the heart of it is how we start to make sure that we send less of our waste landfill this price is actually about having three bins instead of the true that you've got now one a recycling bin and then a third of being winter which will just be for waste stuff that can't_''_162.84 be other composted or recycled and will need to go to landfill Council has agreed that this new approach is one that's worth pursuing because we're really keen to keep our waste out of landfill and also make sure that we create quality compost they can go to farms as well as recycling so Council has agreed to a major budget allocation towards this it's about providing three bins to over 13,000 fremantle households over the next year or so and actually rolling out this whole new system which I think is it is a rule it shows real leadership and actually making sure that we reduce our waste to landfill get more stuff recycled and reused and composted and you can look forward to seeing that roll out in the next twelve months as many of you would know the silver leaf investments have purchased the old police station and courthouse there which is going to be turned into a hotel and and kind of market it as well which is really exciting but what we talked about this month was actually some of the land that just sits around that we're small parcels which have la which are rogue reserve how they could be actually complement that development and create better connectivity between the existing Fremantle markets the new silver leaf development at the old police site but also importantly the world heritage-listed Fremantle jail so we agreed that some of the small parking areas that were around there would actually become new public open space and actually importantly we were willing to consider some urban design options that would improve those connections through to the jail the extension of the fair and ramp interpretations of that and then those connections across the city is an exciting I think urban realm improvement that the city is agreed to and obviously some more detailed designs to come back to us but I think this is actually a really important step for really improving this part of Freeman fremantle which I think is gonna it's got some great history and we great to see more project now well and truly underway we've been putting a lot of effort into the public realm on how that works you would have seen quite a few trees being transplanted in recent weeks from the Maya the old my side of the building around to the church side and which looks fantastic we've also been looking very closely at the health of existing trees and what's come to light is that two of the existing Moreton Bay's near the church and the Town Hall unfortunately not as healthy as we would like so one of the things that we've agreed to this month is to go back out to the community around the potential of exponentially removing those two trees and replacing those of course with other trees and one of those sadly is the quite well-known Christmas tree that that's his thinking square which unfortunately we've been giving a lot of love and care to but it hasn't been responding quite as well as we'd like so it's one of those tough decisions we're going to need remove it or keep trying to see if we can bring it back to life so we'd love your feedback on that that's what councils agree to at this stage is to go out consult with the community on that before we make a final decision around how we make the best urban run we can for King Square as those new buildings are completed in late 2019 2020 we want to make sure we've got a good public spaces that can online alongside those as well one of the other parts rated council works is we obviously most of what we've talked about so far reports from offices which the council makes decisions on but individual councillors can bring up notices of motion which they issue is that are important to them that they want the council to consider the council considered two of these this month the first of those was from councillor Pemberton which is a notice of motion around the release of helium balloons in Fremantle and follow it and which they gained the council supported the banning of helium prunes balloons part I think it's really it's really exciting and I think we all agree now that especially councils that live close to the ocean and we're seeing sea life totals and the like ingesting plastics and balloons and those kinds of things that we've got to be much more responsible with this so we were happy to social leadership on this and we will pursue a similar local law to what's happened in cottesloe also another noticed emotional put up by councillor Sam Wainwright around increasingly Newstart allowance and even know that New START has barely increased over the last last few decades and has fallen way behind other forms of social security and pensions and the like so council supported that move around actually addressing some of the fundamental issues around creating poverty in the area and support of the broader advocacy position that New START should be increased as well so these are some of the other things ever that we do on council as well as the planning items and the other things we looked at tonight is actually advocacy items that
 from the thriving arts community to the historic buildings that house them Fremantle is the perfect mix of old and new the portside town is well regarded for its stunning heritage buildings Mediterranean climate and diverse vibrant culture beginning as a humble trading post to Laos 30 million tonnes of cargo per year Fremantle is at the heart of Western Australia's economy integrated urban design thoughtful planning and sensible development are key to building a city that embraces the past and nurtures the future in support of this the city of Fremantle made amendments to the planning scheme to encourage high quality development this is built investor confidence as demonstrated by an impressive investment pipeline the city is committed to working with developers who wish to be part of Fremantle's bright future key projects are already underway in Fremantle central city live apartment will see 166 new apartments on Queen Victoria Street directly opposite the recently constructed heirloom apartment open up 183 new residential dwellings to the market Kings Square will see over 20,000 square meters of new office space as well as retail and hotel rooms this will all build on recently completed projects at well our code offers over two thousand square meters of retail space and accommodates over 200 workers within its newly built offices quest Fremantle with 122 premium tourist apartments established apartments in the historic West End adding 19 inner-city residential units and a commercial ground floor space and the Mediterranean shipping company offices housing workers that will support the local economy the residential market coupled with an increased demand for high-density living unit prices have consistently grown in the Fremantle area by 2026 the lone person smaller household types are projected to increase to around 32 percent of total households in recent times Fremantle has been very popular for residential development for housing development and that's continuing it's a very friendly place to live in it's a very popular place to live it's got great amenity and it's got great street life the office market the fremantle office market is the fifth largest in the perth metro area the current development pipeline contains up to 38,000 square meters of new a grade office space demand for Fremantle's office space going forward I mean when we invested in Fremantle originally we looked at a whole range of strategic metropolitan centres around Perth and couldn't find anything that had nearly the amount of character that Fremantle does the port is a is a significant part of that character that history is embedded in everything that you see around you the retail market with average growth indicative rents of one thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars per square meter in prime locations Fremantle retail strips provide some of the highest yields in Perth vacancy on both Market Street and South Terrace remain low at five and three percent respectively you've got infrastructure in Fremantle so you've got bus and you've got train you've got natural attributes had in water and beaches you've got the bays restaurants bars you've got all the infrastructure already existing in Fremantle it just hasn't been utilized for a number of years the hotel market scree mantel is one of the most visited destinations in Western Australia there are currently three main hotels and a number of smaller hotels and bed-and-breakfast there are currently three so the hotel developments planned with a social investment of over one hundred and sixty six million dollars altogether the current investment pipeline is set to deliver over 1,300 new residential dwellings 20 thousand square metres of new retail and hospitality space 38 thousand square metres of a agreed office space and more than 600 hotel rooms if you'd like to find more investment opportunities in fremantle visit the investing in fremantle section on the city's website or contact the city's economic development team
 one of the really beat challenges I think over my time on council is actually I mean how we attract people back back to Fremantle at three middle council meeting where she talked about a destination marketing plan for Fremantle over the next four years and we and the aim is quite simply to bring visitors back to Fremantle both from overseas called state interstate in and locally on the metro area them to bring that life back into Fremantle support support for many businesses this is a key debate around how we use the differential rate which some businesses within the CBD pay how we best use that in a way to actually help those businesses council agreed with the officer recommendation for a destination marketing plan that will really bring a range of experts together to actually come up with a really coherent plan one that will ultimately replace rental story and ain't Fremantle on a really strong path as we relaunch as king Square comes to completion late 2019 early early 2020 to really bring people back to Fremantle rune get that vibrancy back't be funding for all the bid the Business Improvement District but there was a really strong acknowledgment of the good work that the bid had done and council will certainly continue some of those things including care pivot ease such as the winter ice rink and and also the great events like the long table dinner so it was a tough debate but I think we're actually now on a really good path for getting more people back to Fremantle more often the proposed Sala Falmouth South America site was debated at the federal council meeting where we agreed to put the business plan out for advertising there was a favorite of discussion and certainly some community feedback around making sure that if the solar farm was to happen that it would actually be safe for the community and the council was really clear this is actually about not only about sustainability about creating what's going to be the biggest urban solar farm in Australia but actually also making the site safer by provide the solar thermal over proper fencing and also will make sure that what if is very lightly and actually is done very safely for residents so I'm very excited about solar farm proposal the business plan is will no go now go out for advertising we'd love community input on that and that will come back to a future council meeting and then that will ultimately hopefully see this project proceed later on this year the unit one of J shaved down Vader's beach below the Round House has been a pretty long running debate in the female counselor and how we better activate and utilize that amazing glass-fronted space that and do it in a way that actually brings people back into the area and activates a whole area connecting the fishing boat harbor all the way through Victoria key be fair to say that the previous iterations that were proposed this of a very large venue are up to up to 150 people were not supported by the Fremantle council and not also supported by the west of Train Planning Commission so pleasingly the proponents that come back with a smaller proposal which we see this is a by 40% I think what we've got now and the council supported this is is a proposal I think meets the original intent of what we went out to to the market with to see a great little venue that they can actually bring people all year round down due to their arts precinct and what we wanted to do there is actually to by tracking people down into that area support the great range of artists actually are working in and around that area as well so that that's been passed by the council is a little way to go yet in terms of approvals from state government bodies and the like but hopefully we will finally see some action down in that part of the country the Sacramento Football Club have been here at Fremantle Oval for well over 100 years and at council this month we discuss actually how we can give them a license agreement that can give them confidence they're going to be here for the long term so owner unless we can't was a really good agreement that I think much part of our community the is now that the City of Fremantle has taken back control of the oval from the freemen or Dockers it means that we can use it all year round from a forever some concerts and all those great kinds of things but of course importantly it's also a football level so that's matter we'll be able to use that certainly during the football months and but the City of Fremantle will be paying to maintain the oval which I think has happened for a long time as well as helping Scouts remember lout with with some other revenue advisor prior sponsorship and car parking in the area I think it's a really good outcome and one that I'm really pleased we'll see South stay here and actually beam half obviously with exciting time beyond for over we can see this whole precinct ultimately redeveloped and very much part of our community
My name's Gavin I work in the design and projects team and last Friday we relocated to farms in human court as part of the kinks career development and the upgrades to award corpse water and a crow gas mains too often was slightly off alignment for the rest of the 7-pound so we need to bring them back into alignment and also to coincide with can use services of gas and water that are going through the square but the traffic management setup so the Fenton joins around the sign and our traffic management people come in then the crane comes in on-site with all the other other trucks that are needed with the diggers and stuff the crane gets set up around around the root ball and there's a record pizza cutter they cut the roof off and then the crane is attached and then the whole root ball is just lift it out of the ground moving one and then repeat the process for the second one the trucks and the crane roll offside and then we manage the traffic until it at 7 a.m. and about 30 so it's a good day's work to get the tribes if the crane set up stick around and then relocate
 the much free mental council meeting started off in slightly unusual style but it was very nice to kick off the meeting swearing in South Ward councillor Andrew Sullivan who was reelected in the recent by-election so we had a former councillor John Albert II JP swearing-in Andrew and before we got underway with our meeting we also had the pleasure of having been presented with the award winning with the award for this Fremantle Town Hall which one the best conservation project at the western heritage Awards recently and I want to also acknowledge the staff for the extraordinarily good work in that amazing projects or the hundred thirty year old Fremantle Town Hall restored back to its former glory the hildren town centre upgrades final hurdle was passed through the council and really exciting to see now that we having placed the the new plans for FI children will see those upgrades underway in coming days and weeks that we'll see some really beautiful hilton town centre some changes to the pavement and some of the pattern traffic movements which will make the town centre it's a been a long time coming but some of these really really important new works that are Co funded by the state government who and and this here Fremantle also contributing will see the Hilton Town Centre upgraded made more beautiful when I think more attractive for local residents in that area car share was a really important issue that we discussed and actually how we can start to get more cars here into Fremantle we received a report from for the boy alone associates which actually mapped out a really good way forward and on that basis Council agreed to go out for expressions of interest to kasha and one of the key things is we'll see through that the City of Fremantle actually give up some of its vehicles that we use and actually will become members of that car share and also see that scattered around the city looking at you can see locations down around the Freeman or train station up this end of the cappuccino strip around Fremantle oval and Fremantle Hospital but also down into south through mantle as well and a support we hope is kicking off Broad Akash here not just across Fremantle but importantly across the Greater Perth metropolitan area because especially for those people who have a car maybe even a second car don't do a lot of kilometres in it car she has a really great way of reducing car ownership but also saving people money and where it can hear the City of Fremantle just ocean leadership in this space and get car share under way perhaps the big issue of the night was actually passing through what was called the Fremantle alternative which was otherwise known as skimming member number 63 which was a really innovative idea around actually how we get more diverse and small dwellings and more diverse and affordable housing into our suburbs it was called big ideas for small housing and that's exactly what what what I will do it's what we've done with that is taken some key areas across different parts of our suburbs from white gum valley the Beaconsfield Sampson and others where we can actually get and demonstrate how we can get also we'll importantly be more sustainable keep tree canopy and manage parking in innovative ways so that scheme amendment has now gone through a very robust and really an award-winning consultation process has been signed off by the council and now we'll go to the West Australian Commission where we hope that we can see that passed and actually in coming years see some of that really great new housing on the on the ground in Fremantle once again showing how Fremantle is a leader in providing diverse and affordable housing you might not know but the Fremantle Festival is actually Australia's longest-running festival and going all the way back to 1905 which is pretty incredible and it's actually run on a variety of months and times throughout the year and I think the great success of it is that it's being kept fresh and if and evolved and that was a key debate at Council this month as we talked about moving the free mental festival from October to July to the winter months staff have recommended that we do that partly because the there's actually a bit of a gap during the winter months where market opportunity for the free mental festival to shine not just within Fremantle but also get coverage both across the state and across the nation so council looked at that and had a quite a robust debate around the pros and cons of that and it was clear that we decided that was a good idea and would support that but also acknowledging that we wanted to keep other kind of events and things going both in our suburbs and also for making sure also had a community focus my other events across the year another part of that was actually also moving the time that the Heritage Festival happened and that's going to move from May to April so can you part of the Australian Heritage Festival and Ally on those dates with with that as well and that was also broadly supported so there'll be some changes in our festival lineup there will still be a free metal festival in 2018 later on this year but it will be a shorter festival this winter Fremantle festival in july 2019 so look out for that and look at also how you can get involved and we can keep this draya's longest-running festival fresh and running over Lex fees which is
Welcome to the marks edition I'm from the council chambers the knutson street east local structural plan was the basis and what we're looking at doing this is revising the structure obtained tape the original structure pamphlets area was done around ten years ago and of course times have changed since then but it was a pretty good structure plan but we're making some amendments to that but keeping it as an area that's going to be medium density largely residential but really focusing on making sure that we get a really good mix of uses in there one things I love about the nuts of precinct is that it is a live-work mixed area and we're really encouraging ground floor mixed juices but also really sustainable design in in the buildings as well this is new series that we one of the one of the major growth precincts in terms of Fremantle's growing residential population we've already seen some great design out there with the first stage than that should precinct done by space agency so what we're going to do coming month we'd love your feedback on that and how we can improve it and make the next stages design even better the proposed design process for the new playground in King's square was discussed this is a really exciting proposal where the council with the community is going to spend around half a million dollars on brand new nature plays playground as part of the whole king square civic read rejuvenation group we want this to be a really great community hub but we want to do this is not just have someone come in and design it Rex you want the children of Fremantle and the families are free meant to be part of the design process this is actually what we did for the very well loves Fremantle Esplanade gives plaza and the skate park and I think most people agree that's an amazing designer practice won awards all around the country and we want to do something similar with this really great new playground that's going to be right in the heart of Kings square so the council agreed and signed off your school your families and how you can get involved in designing what I think is going to be one of playgrounds in the metropolitan area the innovative housing working group or was discussed and this is a great new way of involving the community and what I think is going to be one of the great challenges and opportunities for Fremantle over coming years there's a lot of fantastic new innovative housing ideas that are coming through whether it be the nightingale option which we're seeing gave me the publicity around Fremantle about grouping which is a process around actually build together for medium density housing where communities come together to designer housing and other community housing kinds of projects there's no doubt that is a really strong desire and Fremantle as a community's taking a real strong leadership on this around providing a much broader range of diverse and affordable housing opportunities and what this housing working group will be able to do is actually give feedback and help provide some that really great expert advice and community advice around we can make sure the right kinds of housing for Fremantle's future so people of all ranges of wages and salaries can can live in Fremantle but also so people can age in place and we have a give providing the right new housing both families and for singles and everybody in between it's an exciting time in this basin it's really great to have the great expertise and we had some really fantastic people put their names forward we're going to have a really great working group that we'll see we'll be kicking off our operation in a couple months time and providing us with some very essential feedback as we go forward as a community around housing thank you for watching from the council chambers for more information please go to WWE Emmental waaaaaa you for agendas
 my participation of living smart taught me so much there were so many things that I kind of do know that I didn't know if that makes sense I loved that course really really made an impact in my life living smart is an expert led series of sustainable living workshops run over seven weeks through group learning and practical experience people gain knowledge and skills across a range of everyday topics so they can take positive action to improve their health and well-being and reduce their impact on the environment when I started this course I had absolutely no idea what I was going to get I didn't know a lot about sustainability so everything that I have learned has just sort of been an eye-opener I think what surprised me in the course was mostly the fact that some of the simpler things that you can do which are not aware are it one first will arised awareness about so many things in my life you kind of look at things in a different way you look at how you need to manage say for making yourself a bit greener more sustainable and also that actually makes you save a lot of money which makes a big difference and it kind of makes you as well focus on different things in life I wanted to meet like-minded people but I didn't realize how fantastic the sense of community would be now I'm really analyzing myself in my own behavior in looking at other behavior and wondering how can we change this and I think it's this idea of community empowerment there is no one thing there's no magic wand it's just simply about applying a list of principles that are quite simple and easy everyday living smarts for everyone I think sometimes the perception is that it's a bit of a grainy thing or something like that but it's not it's a really great grassroots hands-on way to get into understanding about sustainability I think the living smart challenge is a great thing for genuinely everybody to do simply because it I believe it makes you live with more thought yeah I would definitely recommend this course to find out where a living smart courses being held near you visit the website living smart dot org dot a you
Apparently we did a survey what our trees are doing we've got 12 edging up to 13 percent canopy cover we thought we could do better than that and we're gonna aim for 20% canopy cover so as part of the greening female strategy the next step was to go in more detail plan and get an urban forest plan up and running which would guide our tree planting and maintenance and care for the next 10 years that biodiversity is an area of importance within the green plan and and therefore the urban forest strategy how does this play out in the plan goes hand in hand we've identified our biodiversity corridors that connect us with our surrounding local government across Perth and we have plans to plug those corridors as we roll out the plan across the next 10 years wildlife is something that's also important to local people in Fremantle Howell at urban forest plan support our local wildlife well when we were doing the the greening strategy we did have access to Perth wide biodiversity mapping which we've incorporated into our us where our biodiversity links are where we need to keep trees in those areas and where we need to plant more in different species to keep those links for our wildlife that was our urban forest plan explained very briefly but if you want to know more you can go to the website that's shown and you can have a look at all the detail and I hope that you'll join us in creating a urban forest in Fremantle

Welcome to the June edition of from the council chambers the June cancel meeting was a full agenda because of course it was the the budget agenda with a full chamber and public gallery and we certainly didn't get here too late at night but there was some really important items on the agenda bloody scary and first of those was around the small dwellings marked who were calling it which was many of you might have been aware of the public consultation process for deeds around called the Fremantle alternative about small and more diverse housing across three marahau actually except to encourage that next level of housing that can actually provide the kind of hands we need as free metal goes forward we just had the census results out and we saw that Fremantle has a larger number of small households and a larger number of households with only one only one person in them but much per if you also have a lot of houses that are three and four bedrooms so though we'd only want one or two people in them so it's forward and what we voted on at the council meeting was to put out for public comment the key parts of the it was called the proposed scheme amendment number 63 which will be around more affordable diverse housing sorts some really great stuff in it around built form and sustainability and diversity and just how it can start to encourage what I think is going to be a real model for housing across the state light small dwellings mark one which was called granny flats that granny's with ultimate ultimately became the planning rules for the whole state I think it will see the state following females foot steps on this as well the skinny member number 63 is now out for public advertising and we really love your feedback on that before it comes back to a future council meeting for adjustment and so on as many of you may know the point street development site between Adelaide and containment has been one that had a double tree Hilton Hotel planned to go on it there has been some delays around that project partly because the developers children hotels in both Perth and North Bridge and sister in the align and they have come to the council asking for a delayed start to the project because the council put timelines in terms of use of that site the countess was willing to support this as long as we saw some really key progress on the site that includes a sales office being in the Fremantle CBD as soon as the start of September this year so they can get the free sales they need for the non hotel component of that very large development it's a 5,000 meter site that's currently got our mobile multi-story car parking station on it and in the meantime what the city will do is actually take back the use of that to that car park as well as actually doing a temporary car park on the side of the multi-story so they've got really good CBD parking for shoppers in that part of town one of the reasons the council is really happy to support the delayed start since project was because with the King Square project underway project on the Coldwater site just adjacent to that also happening within the next 12 months we're going to see two major development sites in that part of Fremantle and we really came to make sure the East End of the mineral continues to work and it does have adequate parking so actually delaying the start of this was actually a bit of a win-win and once those two develop sites come to completion and we will see construction on Double Tree Hill start which I think will be really great for the East End of town and its revitalization the 2017-18 financial year budget was passed to the council unanimously and it was a really solid budget firstly it was importantly a budget with a very low rate increase 1.9 percent average across the ratable areas and one we were really keen to see that those rates kept low because we understand that it is a tough financial climate out there at the moment we want to make sure that both our residents and ratepayers are also our businesses were burdened by higher rates in fact it's years and one which we thought was really important at this point in the economic cycle despite the low rate increase so it is a budget that's got some really great ambitious projects that are going to make Fremantle an even better and more livable city of course at the heart of the project will be King Square where we're spending many millions of dollars upgrading the heart of Fremantle our civic and community heart a project that will kick off in August and September this year and the civic and community building where with the specific Fremantle is including the library and our new visitor center and meeting rooms that will kick off in early 2018 and so we've budgeted for that but it wasn't_''_307.11 all about Fremantle CBD in fact we're really had a really strong focus this year focusing on really improving services to our suburbs and extra taking that feedback that we've got from ratepayers and one of those was around waist people really value their yearly burg pick up but in addition to that they wanted more opportunities for're gonna be offering a greatly improved drop-off service at the Fremantle Depot where we will see large numbers of things all the ways from paint to batteries and to computers to furniture and mattresses all recycled as part of one of the most comprehensive recycling services but offered by any council in the South metropolitan area the other key change was actually been having a renewed version mowing service it'll be one of the most comprehensive virgin mowing services in in the Perth metropolitan area we heard from our ratepayers that was something that people wanted to be improved and we're certainly happy to do that as well as a range of improvements to car parks and in North Fremantle and a really strong focus on greening our suburbs planting more trees and actually adding more small play parks and really creating famille is a great post already but actually creating an even better community so more details with Google coming to you shortly via your rates notice about the and all the services it has to offer but it was really great to have that done climate to be doing a budget in and I think we've got to a really good point and a budget that I think will be really taking fremantle forward thanks

 many of you who have come to central frame adoration he would notice the king square projects now well underway and with the devolution of the Queen's gate and Maya buildings council this male looked actually at the public realm and how we will deal with that as part of the new king square project the plan is actually to spend about eight million dollars upgrading the public realm over the over the next ten years around Kings Square and is over meaning of that as part of the initial project which is really exciting so the plan was presented to the council as part of that public realm concept plan what was really pleasing was that that draft concept plan have some really great community engagement as part of that he would have seen previously the school was engaged around the design for the playground and will the play space that's going to be in there as well there's well some great feedback around how a casaya I know some of the history of that would have come through the archeological digs and the concept design which I think's fantastic see lots more trees in the area lots more great spaces for people to spend time and actually make Kings Square very much at the heart of of Fremantle and with some exciting innovations like the windows to the past project that will further uncover some of the long history that that's happened in King King square over the years so great to see this get to the next stage and we're looking forward to seeing this great public design implemented as part of the king square project a hot issue of debate over recent months and years actually has been around some of the density of the r60 developments around neighborhood centers and the like I'm council in its planning scheme has long had the ability to increase in seas around local centers and neighborhood centers and in mixed use zones as defined in the scheme where it's not get to mental to an area we've had a few different proposals come to us recently and it was fair to say that council thought they needed greater amenity in that area so draft policy was considered by the council and we agreed to put this out for public advertising we'd love to have feedback on this this is actually around how we can counsel case you make the best kind of decisions into how we can increase the entities around these zones but in a way that doesn't get romantic endeavors the feminine counsel has been very pleased that the state government has initiated a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags the state government has written to Council's asking for our feedback on that ban and as the council considered that this week is part of the council meeting one of the key gave was there's opportunity for us to learn from what's happened in other states where often the minimum weight of those bands of all those single use bags I should say was too light and that actually meant that we were still seeing too many bags in the environment and often not really reusable so the council has written back to the state government suggesting some improvements that can plastics from plastic bags actually that debate widen out bigger fair to say that there is growing community set concern around single-use plastics the Fremantle community has been for the the forefront of actually addressing those and we're really placed as the stake of an action this regard and we hope to see that to be extended further the upstairs of the old heaven Davies building above dome what used to be for long time culture that lease was considered by council last night and council agreed to a new lease for that space which will once again see they activated with a restaurant that's going to have some live music and and a range of other great uses and I think will be a great addition to the cappuccino strip for those of you have been to the to the area recent you would have seen that there's been some upgrades to that building including better access for a lift for people with disabilities and and certainly a fire escapes and those kinds of things and I think a very great contemporary addition to a really the first public libraries in Western Australia so great to see another new business waiting to be in the heart of Fremantle and look forward to that opening in jus
Welcome to the May edition of from the council chambers the king square project of course is not just about building or else will be one of the biggest building projects in this history it's actually also really importantly about improving the public realm and this month we discussed how we would actually do that and and a planned a broad concept plan that we want to put out for public comment around actually transforming the king square as a great community space we want to be a space where people come and linger and spend time where it is the real center of our community so the Kings were a public world process was debated and when we look forward to the public comments for that if it is a multi-million dollar project we expect to spend millions of dollars with the upgrading public rom including children's playgrounds but also having great community meeting spaces and those and those kinds of things all around the heart was going to be the new civic art I premed bust of the Fun Bus is one of those greatly loved Fremantle for parents in the area who have used that service you would know that there's been a bit of uncertainty around Buster's future as the state government who is largely funded the service as their funding model changed we've got some really great feedback from the community that people came to see the service continue so a recommendation was brought before the council to make sure that service could continue during the week that the parents could go down and some of the important space not just for parents to get together with your children but also I think a really great service around actually providing that community service that brings people together builds the capacity appearance and really helps children in their early stage of development as well so I'm really pleased to say that Buster the Fun Bus will continue to be out in your neighborhood and we encourage parents to get out there and use that because this was a lot of that was a strongly supported by all the council Fremantle Park is a great community feel you're right in this you've got a major football oval as well as a bowls club and Tennis Club or great community facilities but many facilities actually probably haven't_''_146.83 been properly upgraded for many many decades so we've been working with those clubs as well as with the workers club to see how we can upgrade facilities in this area and actually get new really proper facilities that I think will serve these key clubs that we want to see keep going for decades and into the future it's been a great partnership where the Fremantle workers club is putting in around 1.5 million dollars along with the city to see a big new facility built within within Fremantle Parker or whole Parliament that will house all those are those pubs together under one roof in a really modern purpose-built facility that kind of makes many of the standards that we would expect today so that was agreed to by the council and we hope to see work on that start with him towards the end of this year early early next year where we like to see a preeminent bowls pub and the other sporting clubs that use the Fremantle Park Reserve continue to go from strength to strength universally knocked her down located in the city female West End plays a major part in terms of females economy and the vibrancy of the West End but what we've been trying to do and working really constructively with the university with is actually give them even greater activation so that they are really quite attractive for the West End but we really see lots of Brandel activation so after I've said bit of discussion and negotiation we've knocked her down they've brought forward to us a new activation plan that will see many ways University come out much brought onto the street and actually see students spending more time in the West End and also things for other people to do they should come into the West End and enjoy what it is an amazing state churches it's a precinct part of it as well is that the university has agreed that they will on some of the high street premises actually move currently been using for offices and other things and they'll be returned to proper commercial activities that you'd expect on any city's high street this is a great partnership and the city will be using the contribution that was something part of the contribution that the university puts towards services within the West End area towards towards these projects we're really keen to see it happen to the University you have a really strong activating presence and really be part of our community thanks once again for watching from the council chambers for more information please check out the city of free mails website
 the precincts policy was up for a view and this was a good opportunity for the council to look at how we take the really innovative idea of precincts I think one of my favorite things about Fremantle is we've got some very active community engagement coming from the different precincts and really make sure that every part of Fremantle has access to a precinct so and we've reviewed the the boundaries and how the precincts work and also have how the funding work for those precincts and it's going to be out for public comment over the next month or so and we really welcome your feedback but also how we can strengthen community engagement and the precinct system here in Fremantle the 2016-17 annual report was received by the council this month and that's now available and certainly encourage you to look through what's a pretty good document around what's been happening at the Fremen our council over that period it was also an opportunity to set the annual meeting of electors date which will be held on Wednesday the really encourage electors to come down it's your meeting as electors here in Fremantle to come down and raise any issues concerns questions and the like at that meeting on Wednesday the 21st we will also have our first meeting of the new strategic planning and transport um committee this is a new committee that the council's agreed to that will actually give the council a way of focusing some on some of these really key strategic planning and transport issues that they go impact our city as a whole and so those terms of reference and the membership for that committee was agreed to on council and the first meeting will be also in Wednesday the 21st of February and we open to the public thanks for tuning in to the first from the council chambers for 2018 for more information please see the city of Fremantle website you
And I've also probably job the job is one of my directors who lives day by dead at a free mental hospital as you can tell from the accent I'm not local so I've been over here after that five nuts and still climbing my way to my first time at a mall etc but I've actually moved into three mentors I do class myself is a little bit of local clearly free mental hospital has a huge heritage okay and that is obviously much of two weeks before I start work and even just walking through town talking to locals because I'm a bit more knows of the hospital or alumalite and it's only people there's obviously passion people feel for free mental hospital and that's really important that we recognize that equally it's really important that we also recognize that the way we were able to look after patients now she's developing very considerably and I look at that too even only to go back to Roman times life expectancy male dimmers and around pinky we're back second world wars around 67 68 they family the first person from this to two hundred has already been born and 10% of children born this year and last year or probably it's about 150 now that's not because we're just eating five a day in everything else it's because medical technology is improving all of the time and that's a really good thing and I think that to the troubled my father went through and he was alive and he became three replies in that possible time limit at Parkinson's he's cooked that battery five years he had cancer twice he had to mention the end number of airplanes and vigor about 30 years you cannot survive a zombie debt and that's reposition for myself and my family and if it's possibly most patients but that technology becomes more more specialist and often up at the debate in the UK about services so what we did in the UK we centralize over to the right cancer services for example and the lot of the debate at the time is yes that care for part of the specialist in nature is a bit like riding bicycle is even ride bicycles Revere it--what every 10 years you probably won't be as proficient if you ride on every day and make sense if you do a tassel and there is something about that and a specialist natural so what we can't do is continue to deliver everything in every hospital as it's always been play these what musics two years ago in those hospitals is very different there so we're trying to get the balance between the understand Murray and free mental hospitals I'm responsible both hospitals and I also imported the Fremantle EP understand hospitals intentionally to remind everybody in Vienna actually that's not the only place they're actually hospital it's fair to say I think that when P understand he was opened there are a lot of changes in plans and what just within the hospitals gift was well personally close wasn't going to stay open what's going to happen to pre mental section but I won't gift I have home gardens I can't go back and make that good for what I can do is try with my experience and with the colleagues I work and with a patience that we work with in communities is to develop fremantle back into a state-of-the-art facility for the right services so will never become a heart transplant center because that's just impossible if we did that there are out as patients would be doubled because it would not be sufficiently robust to deliver that type of service however we are developing the services in reading but we also have aged mental health and the DA mental health care now those facilities are constantly being looked at and where we can we will continually improve them and we'll keep working on those services because they're really important we deliver elective surgeries that's a planned surgery so we have got a navy very briefly but what we do is people who have planned operation co-chief anything as you need to hit replacement need some plastic suit whatever else it is so for orthopedics we don't wanna walk there that's really the center whatever we happen to do some plastics we're going to continue to grow that when a started ENT important that we horse at slinging water and there'll be others such as China which will start on their shoulder so we'll grow those electively services but we won't be able to do it for every specialty and the reason for that is incivility number of theatres and what worker is if you have an orthopedic team also a theatre team and those not theatre nurses in the morning to the guy in the afternoon to do an orthopaedic next one they're going to do some more plastic from the next action images of urology mix mourners put them onto some type of commodity because if I buy the parsifal you don't have Constitution provision on the key thing is to get really good patient outcomes that's where our measure our success really good patient happens and for me the patient outcomes are only three simple things because it believe you the safest care possible and I've never hair and then when I flew there well actually I never wrote the airlines and axonal crashing I expected it and you should explain that movement or hospital and not see the get it right every time because we have a lot of people that for pretty much like small towns are hospitals but we aim to get safe as possible but thing to say isn't there a reason that a possible you also get so hopefully you can prove the outcome of okay okay and there's an easement what I will do is effective now effective to me means making sure that we constantly look around the world see if there's a better way to do it and it is a better way step is that we change and we follow the best practice those two things like again affecting some never let it come effectiveness I've never written to an airline said axis topic right now I just expect them to do it the third lien differentiates good hospital and a really great hospital this patient experience and that's something we will continue patient experience is not only important in terms of politeness and dignity it's really important at you in terms of your improvement in health care if anybody goes into an environment where you don't feel very safe as a hospital I suspect your recovery time will be longer okay it's proven evidence there all research we make sure you're you're safe you feel secure because we're going to talk about compassionate staff etc your recovery will be better for you so that patients for instance critical as well the third area of care that we're going to do is about the mental health and of the elective surgery is our care of the other facilities now care of the elders is across the to start that moment and I hope to tell the story of Horus Horus is a genuine patient I learned is a second name for personal reasons I met tourists that all these together in one of our 60 words in Jenna Stanley is in room nine and he was sadly chair Forrest was waiting to be transferred to earth come in the morning you don't have all our discharging to afternoon is a flash so we're trying to do we're perfectly the patients were very secure nervous territory transit manager and and horses didn't attend in the morning I came back the previous silts sitting there which is unacceptable and apparently is transferred at seven o'clock that night I did a bit of digging and I found out Horace that actually immediate first our mostly Department for a good while and then they moved into what we call a session am you keep metal unit and then they got busy city Luton somewhere else then finally medium towards 60 and we made them to freelancer and that is just not acceptable or are too many movies so while I'm planning to do and we'll work it through the teams to make sure related rights that won't happen tomorrow the world happened very shortly these will little to reduce those number of moves so horriston cannon reactant we did and if you move into the appropriate bed as quickly as possible which of very other specifications in answer etc from the car moving but for majority those patients Fremantle denied your site because actually it's more sociable interaction takes place there than you do in single state of yard on sweet rooms that makes it so that's why we written to their capital so our plan disease met those excellent services not second-rate assessing services the environment of the environment I don't remember that wallet dollars to change it but within the resources are available to me to me I will make the best use for all of our patients across both campuses let me to stop talking because otherwise I'll just talk and talking our and your people I'm sure I'll just ask really interested in more relative go get some more there is a conference on and something really important thing was to have not ever the area a lot of wonders agreement so I think I have to be honest with the facts it's ten kilometers okay I've come from an environment of I 100 but I appreciate that's not here as well in the UK and in the bush room that hundreds of promises the difficulty with the model you're talking about in practical terms is one it would need to have consultants you need a be a consultant were not trained in 15 years to just deal with drugs and band-aids they want to do the specialist work so therefore the ambulances are then thanks rejoice you've a patient who's had a Fremantle a round corner in Fremantle you haven't got all the other special support services and therefore all output that's the public hospitals is they're all built around several core specialties so they really have a general surgical service which means it has to have on-call consultant firm there it be does so that the first part upon you then new general medical in any degree you don't need other services so the form of the name actually was the front door is most of us because 14 most as extra small King because we've had an accident for those and fortress these you have about that multidistrict eating then actually ambulance will never stop it has to take the patient to the quickest place where they will get the care so I agree we keep the drugs and band-aids etc it's ideal which actually starting for that without incredibly difficult so that's the only reason I think it's not practical yeah the difficulty is consultants and just to set in the new gen surgery in Turanian it isn't health so the reason our outcomes certainly reason our outcomes are likely expectancies improvements because actually but I'll as people trying to speak this the general surgeon pretty much do everything now like at all speeds as a specialist my white mister finger is a specialist moment that sorting and medical attachments make the port which is actually as employment so stents a cardiologist okay we must have the general surgeon services patients with coming from John surgery we massive emergency team zero in life surgery which is the answer stop because you have to have that full range of services otherwise the ambulance crew with as the patient arrives our consultants see the patient straightaway and they will be a doctor ordered for render assessment and we'll call you on proteins immediately everybody needs there's probably about fifteen specialties built around it so often you look at about world emergency departments the emergency departments have to be built into large social centers Rodney Harris blobs a relatively good surah I can talk about walking as I know that every yonder Rockingham has got a range of specialties but it also operates almost like a large eghh district General Hospital okay it's in huge expensive model that we do and we put up here I would have to strip resources from Pierre because there isn't there are proponents of patience to warm that and the cost per here will mean the services also free mental but Fiona would have to reduce and the problem with that is then we're starting to get back into them let's spread our resources and not actually have all special teams on place for those are the cities for those who need relative straightforward pharmacy etc for those of you the needy in emergency you have to have a full range of services but they were able to do that high action now I realized that the practitioner resources now in the heart it easier for example over general practice so if we were to do something we would have to do it at a very very very little cutie you would not be able to be through then Goods transfers because that is just accuse you dangerous you cannot put a patient to an ambulance and stop fremantle and they also got this one wrong let's put them in the Yang's again it's just too dangerous how works personnel work happens it because I just can't_''_1140.789 do that so you have to have it basically from the walking wounded walking wounded you could do that it would be very minute service maybe most people who need primary care we most people need primary care not Q care and the impact and fear that in terms of volumes of patients would be negligible we have 300 languages and 150 wife called walkins of those walking's around 15 a day from this catchment for everybody else actions nearer to p.1154 those 15 would have to have consultant you need a backup consultant because not every patient walks in that is fine sometimes they actually claps in the way to work so one things the resources you require those were actually very very there are different models are such as and you can have minor injuries you're in session that's something that's developed in some I can't use that policy sorry well we've come yes sir I thought I thought Scott I don't know and now there's several around the world and rule significant that you could find okay but after hearing the conversation is you know AJ prodigies what they all senators and I we had been so now notice digit occurrence a latest policy was to open a theory of the urgent care clinic which my Jenny would be it's 24 hours there will be one in Fremantle we're not sure whether wave on we have footage that the contract but it also with at hospital and will be 24 hour and the primarily essentially cognitive have to be extra the edge of trauma care of more than 24 hours they helped in TGA assesses what I'm saying is actually pretty much occurs when he lost from the world and number of patients to arrive we require primary care if you ever built a new hospital back in the north of England and it was built on the south of the city the previous hospitals on the West versus and the hot spot where the emergencies came from moves you also get a number of people who live in the vicinity of the hospital that you go there rather than go too far okay now we don't turn patients away because they need care in each case we try to see everyone one sense of you're walking patients the law is being written that a white called primary care patients they could see talk sense care you've actually lived an era where you would normally do trouble find it easier now we try not to deliver primary care services who suddenly walks in and their real relationship under care our air we will actually try to us patience so on sends up the teleport you find another extreme you'll you'll find some now moderately obese under relatively and well you always get it so the elements of horribly are very home from a council oddity we saw designers we have Holocaust and Archie sucked a lot many areas the most ideal world readers are women hosting hair and the greatest sort of percentage all the often utilize energy cementing and what this is the future for George absences it's probably the last and anything vexing murder all areas and consolidated a little area the what we're looking at some of that sphere spices belatedly are to either government or non-government organization so in lots of conversations with different party around getting next five years so I think that's going to be really important because as we found other tenants will come off the side of just added a lot more bars morales talk with your openness at that number start class let's go what we're now trying to do that said earlier is to rebuild the services appropriately so they're the best ones state-of-the-art care for those couples so that sort of mental health care and those areas will again be maintained by six garner patients Australian bloodless design committee consultant will recover from efficacy and general direction in tasked with discharging our patients which is not ideal and it's what we thought so I wanna keep an eye on I mean or do you find retail or consultants register as a backup so that's why I said the care of the elderly but happen tomorrow will happen very shortly to that very reason if we move assess what we can't do is just use it as a doubly fremantle mustn't become they must become a hospital its own identity in my view for the patient's set of community safety can start and also for ten reasons are said you don't want to be looking after a general surgical patient one day in very much planning to move almost lock stock and barrel the whole circle so that for the whole lot important everything else that goes with we have to Mitchell those other angels that require sporting event we do active art what I'm looking to do is to try and create more a23 our state of the art electric piece of service a lot of cases now what used to come in hospital remember your caring doctor films patients will be running around the portable that doesn't happen anymore patients tend to be discharged back actually to their own homes because it's better environment than that again if healing process is often better of your own manager and planning search you are nice things as possible and of course hospitals have infections and medicines at their own and not true just cleaning this is actually this because it's a city environment so as much as we can we want to try and get what I could 23 our stateís surgery which means that patients who come in from tonsillectomies or other things connection canyon state the 23 and then be discharged but it must have all laps of all record you said if you let me the trigger at the moment over time it's kind of just a little bit of let's just move it there well the lines Atlanta today prove anything and tonsil decision Aid Society and you would not and my odds the earrings an annoying survey dishes for general decisions before the end I'm not officially a genie fallen off it is very very rare for the knot and then gold yes so that move is larger and time for the databases that attract me as we develop the 23 app then we'll move more more but you're absolutely right it's country versus profit range of support give such orders safety is paramount for oldest that are very timely actually had a meeting yesterday with his generals there's always hit the fish leader and that exact issue so actually charters that just saw those really small mountain multi high taxes letters they are not there's going to be the color what the escalation point what've come on so sonic yesterday the choice and but that's an issue that's a right so we really came to aggressive but happy to talk to you after you later you know if you're going and exchange service once the most active very experienced men to for in athletes and artists I addresses we learn differently because a lot of people we also have time without the experience that and then the customs are not taking as many graduates messaging now I used to actually reduce in occupation and finally I know senator majority regarded it will override live internship screening are very resinous and Western system-on-a-chip really special so the nurses we worked in nursing application day so as associate nurse's account careful that nursing assistants don't after that has to be the right number of nurses award as per the rules and that's what and monitored daily we become an employer choice by making sure we're a good place to work we are doing lots of work around trying to make sure that happens it won't happen overnight the people to work out we have new using agency as what's the hospitals have the past a game erosion recruiting our own hora terminer TSA's who will d be destroyed rather than using either safety that's another way to grow in terms of themselves as we move into free metal is about moving we don't have a letter chapter so what we're trying to do the stance the services across both sides so what's appropriate fremantle and what's appropriate at the end so be case of moving staff with air agrees to Fremantle has been the same way as when Pierrot what's the staff move from pre metal it's again so getting the right numbers well again we tend try not to do that we do we try to move our staff appropriately and we try to make sure we have sensible recruitment program where we know people are likely to completely we're constantly trying to recruit choices but also about having our own pool you like us of agency and she is for you to give us some kind already but we what we got to do is make sure we do them safely as per your question guide you will be within the next class dart is well Marin and as I started met but will end up probably been about half the dozen specialties for the same reason said oh we have more than half a dozen the theater team then actually expected over to broadest number of specialties and it's not not as good an actor organ is maturing at the right path specialty for advocacy happens which is a critical thing well what we're doing BNC now and that will grow as we are really doing it yeah DYI we're already but what we're doing is identifying those places which are most appropriately we're also trying to plan it so that the scheduling works the limited number of dates we have there the intention we to occupy all of this convert and it's happening now I mean I'm busy with probably about six months well we will open as we need to but there might be some other in Fianna what we've got to do is make sure it's the right patients in the right plans for the right pair that's the better critical facilities we can't imagine things maintenance continues actually continues what we can't do is operate in any areas or run in the area that I'm saving the budget for a rebuild is out of my control but that's not really my gift but what I have responsibility for to make sure that whatever area I use is said is your ID card you're so normally because some of the facility actually wouldn't be appropriate for direct acute patient care a lot of it still does not be areas of music I'm sort of tragic that so another policy that my little collection you might have certainly helped because we do try to get out I don't think it really got their attention that wider ingredient of people as a leader when your password and often just a physical neglecting are either primarily relaxing about the care that includes inside posture that you as energy checklist or financial report financial policies better technology that the idea would be as well as the strategy this knowledge census the use at the hospital that we can also make sure that there is a look at the debt management the clinical work that's done in it and the opportunities officials specialty services and that sounds like insane done but if they're surface my idea is that if it's better it can be basically you son Baxter plan and keep the proceeds we did not proceed so if they're implying or solutely there are not many movies can we need to review the resources for that seller eventually maybe and ended up in the hospital because it's not going to be possible to come up with extra money for a reasonable rent but we can talk about sex mark okay hard at so nice completing money does come time and that's reused that wasn't going to separate bank somewhere that'll get reviews for patient care people youtubers could be taken to the land it's not required maybe select of what we look at is well worth it brain folks backing up to put that whole footprint he's very happy very very insensitive brilliant you know I gotta Marcel Ilan Hall which if I gather and pollutant fact I'm a part of that Ronnie who the rain over to that side looking for you know that would lead to job I am attending somewhere else so I wrote a book and I have a little grandpa sort of what initially opportunity position picture so the lady in the plan I got tested that undulating for my arm here are commercial pension one of those counselors well and I definitely agree in between the light land exclaiming remember how hot directly where every muscle is actually like what sense of hockey propagated is my preferences on my college are somewhat a hospital is helping put too much you can imagine Stanley told us engagement of the on shutdown and the location being unparalleled any other Australian group this year so all the ships of jobs and patients and activity and so on and at the time you economy and that's being as a grow and and we have seen a decline in that area we share with others work with business partners as long as the beginning answer to mention number in his of the number an employee if everyone's apparently there may be shut down illegal down by children of those we have storage on that and a number of patient days and the exact number the recurring 300 still any wheezing that's not contagious I can't exempt elves around are coming exactly what I was for it wouldn't be it wouldn't be suited I can't over the Carnegie is no overlooking prayer thanks iris massage about Marisa thank you mister access oil pastels important to us collateral considering the modern Jewish right is your panel I just make one point and it's important and we have to just face the fact that action trading as much as sergeant important we've got to remember that usually ten cane away now you actually got the tertiary hospital for the most sickest of our residents and we got some of that transfer you wouldn't have had enough specialist to do that so we just got to remember all the time what trying to do is make care as local as possible that's doable for the best outcome auctioneering the other nine are grateful practically promises that we are element that we had this major jr. graphical obscenity our community production answer I become Muslim doing anything looking at here accessories whatever you can I help well that'll be going to be most negotiations we can work through here but I do get the economic so I didn't get the ignore each other but I have to tell you from where I come from if I have a patient or or outcome for something I could have changed that as well now that I've got to get the best outcome some patients there's a whole load of matters I can't control you know economy housing Rose transport all I can do is try to make the surface across both campuses the best they can be for those special and that that's fantastic facilities locally either a sort of lady four weeks ago she's been flown in an Arabic she had a stroke and within the airport already would remove the plot and the next day she city are ready to go now you never ever had that capacity we haven't made these changes so we just caught up with all of the downside oral translators go bounces with the ups oh don't do this try to get the back some patients about male physicians and sitting back or community convinced our care but imminently on traumatic to mention any other I know it's that clearing obvious things that darkness is was there one care what beautifully they're all part of all gasp ones done in there and now sister administration what is going and so how to agree with you but again we've just sort of watch a young yet called the same trappers we've got this great facility that was used to something with that never change it we've got you you know I do get the point of it I'm free mental there are nothing they're part of dollars are here they'll take ever give you seven we've got to try to get the right balance what I've been honestly at the end got the right man yet I'm telling you that I haven't got the time machine which I spoke about all I can try and do have been there so far is go through a process of making sure when looking at everything we can do in the right location and doing it properly we spoke earlier about EMT that the danger just moving in too quickly that's gettable back it doesn't work that's just because if a patient goes off tonight there's nobody support them it's dangerous so we've got things wrong at the moment and what I'm giving you another statement we will know the shortage periods I'll go through all of those areas and try to look at what's the best use of that environment but also one thing about this use of our people and the best for the why I'm going to that part though I've got a bit of a process sort of I wasn't trying to produce it just just add to that way I actually looking through what's going to be the best or very configuration to try and put perhaps put more and more into a block so we haven't even what's the best Ward 8 well I know one of them is actually a really not sure I have a lot of renovations that we're looking at okay what can we consolidate we've got a bit of a mix at the moment one boards in a part surgical part medical another one's paddle boat paddle or than Jerry so how could we perhaps we're management there to have a bit more continuity and some of the water plus put them in the best possible so living things like special don't forget the Harrison one that is that is what jail illegal okay Ida notices is big planner that motherfucker's has got the Medical Research Foundation unit at the moment comes down to what was I talking about what the priorities environment and I probably want to invest a lot more money in the patient areas as opposed to something I'm passionate I serve so many dollars to spend if I went out and that's a reason to vote for me to give you more double implantation I suspect I probably not be elected so we've got to live within the compliance we're going to use our resources to as much as we can to catch our heritage or most important patient yes absolutely and we will do as much as we can so gentlemen innovative technology affordable premium hydrogen and our location making the trade regime some star exhibits were offering their own operatives having you for a field hospital download because of different attitude and then it was done when he was in hospital 1.35 out of assets with the murders of God is announcer birth to death 100 we can better best that you stay forces between us organic that is possibly in surah it non clinicals behind on your name well members are playing straight women aged warrior goddess and one thing that were happy to a controversial areas are capricious property good seekers refresh acne cost you and only report they're not still muscle developing really well but especially men make money site every normal looking at soils and looking at the norm for those what so the lungs could perhaps set hospital employee in a business future easier the problem with that speculation with the speed changing medical technology to get on to what we've got tomatoes you know it's always important like number Prasad all those mentions but if I think about how we need some treat step back to some the other struggle twenty years ago and the number of startled an application that stroke twenty years ago significantly more Magic Man now it's more specialists that are much more so it's hard to just say a 10-year bond that X number of people apply to really lose the speed of change is just incredible to me every day I've been asking something new Pokemon so it's hard to predict living and not climbing traveling it's just important rituals of the right members of the patients rather than total body sizes all in everything the most important thing in hospitals is your app make sure we get you best happens at our Hospital world and staff are a factor that the numbers aren't alone sometimes it's all been and concerns with pre depression and regarding the world the building's happen to thirteen and because that means responsibility of the bottom at the moment and you probably lived impossible not positive enough at this point in time it would probably be neglected with reasonable period of time and intelligence tactic to say if it was the most effective Controller General of a fremantle Congress establishment so it can be served back to the now world heritage-listed prison you recognize all that with our connection to our social history and our culture history includes probably needs to be relinquished not like angle is only through the Health Project so what we what we're doing is review the whole campus part of it to see what buildings we are heritage parlor to see which buildings need some improvement etc and in four months I have to admit it hasn't been my number one priorities but that's not dismissive it is important but we've got to try and get everything done in a sequence otherwise we'll fix one thing and realize that he becomes something wrong with it because actually it also affected be cpp in there on the options domino effect with hospitals so we'll try to do sequence it random services that we need silkies are needed for staff that immunity for it and that's how their turn you're actually right that heritage we've got to make sure we have no right to lose it but if we part of that overall we do so I'm happy to look into it I thought I knew I know about the numbers in know about the name and also Serena today someone had it's like a winery yawns not across the gate pulse of metaphor mark on talking actually not sobbing on Batman how many'd help a long factory help affected told me you trying to tell you are you know equals the director-general heart full remember before the Germans intersect and irate healthy bodies time is excludable probably didn't start the engine and the other question is one around Perry if in a vision the government that is today listen sorry bringing 3079 emission or I have the piece of salmon Chinese spring weather so how long's this been such a final objects is unbelievable I need to do the pontipines back now the part where proteins race the uses of that area are you mad with the review exercises that's on tomorrow's CD we go speculate about the future there are always upsides and downsides in transactions around hospitals with land it's quite strategic I'm hearing with some of the men of around the area where there's a spare land around air people the committee uses it's important that whatever decisions we take that are long-term decisions not short time so I absolutely intend to long term decision making all of those matters have to take will be a straight-talking they're just the answers of one of us any market right the positive is with the understanding vein pretty much full property hands pretty much for women as we have more activity it's this natural homes going to be frame out so that's almost out this is a way of where the activities dinner going to do it someone so hard against them too much more activity because they're so full and rocking out it's pretty similar so Premal having that capacity in infrastructure capacity is where I would imagine the Health Department put additional activity when they've got them up funding for I mean expectation of the people someone that will still down turn around places somehow minor emergency on the streets so the I absolutely it's about trying to make sure his locality where it's better outcomes when in keeping us back to this today another needy stay we had a gentleman who've been rushing from an accident in his workplace he had secondary degree burns all over his body he brought into Fremantle and somebody's at the laceration be armed etc then potentially a to Google and as a feature that sucks all that trying to make sure we get the right balance but if you have a patient's brought into manuals it's not always obvious what that patient requires and the very worst thing to do for the sake of 10 kilometers is to bring them to a place where there be unloaded be assessed and in the dark or there be severely injured and reputable because issues on subspecialty and it's not always obvious if you know medicines an arm of science and it sounds strange but it absolutely is is that being able to get the right people around at speed to make that diagnosis and intervention and it was a member of my family I say this honestly who had a choice being in Angers and potentially at the wrong place I'll probably move away the area I want the best clinical health complications but for things that appropriate at a local level and it's you can't always have everything on a about water safety increasing costs you look at the expended person acid product in Australians that night 6% my sons of that right I think the average developed countries of that 9.8% 9.6 miles per page Yetta france's up to 13% the United States it's just over 16% now I can talk to you came enters our gross domestic product that's at the annual country's earnings we spent a pronated just to putters up to the average for the developed world without two pens to income tax so 23 three-part paths to get us the United States with about 55 pence in the pound if it's a cost to having it as local as you want results other people issue as we said earlier you know you don't have necessary everybody crying out to come a nurse or a doctor and their professions when you leave our universities so we put a bounce everything up but as long as we can be caps to it or measure it's still the best happen maybe because that vision unit being actually in the hospital that the g20 is currently happening somehow help I made the resident additional I was happen to have a shooting to come out and cut employment but I mean it is we are connected to the contract direction so the collective talking about the Faculty of Arts yeah I think it's a social again the trick here there are multiple models of these are competitors which you are not very specific events you can have one religion children nurse later you can have one that focus on certain presentations be that ones with education attainment you can that ones where there is a general position there are multiple models around look that I mean the end of trick is that you not say there's one of those have happened the trick isn't say actually what does the population read what are the people who find the most useful how we structure we build it but it's got to be done in the bounce of everything but I mean it could be located Hospital could probably make changes but III are actually random in other places so it's getting about finding the right balance I suspect if there's any way we can try harder on in helping patients because the Diamonds Academy is awesome we might continue next animation effect at all popular again right capacity it's the top of all people walking upstairs all this so we just like we work together to make sure it works really well what we want to do is whatever it is it's passable best first third that's when we get it so the Gabby's Gabbin handbag common art to have my sight out as customs without here but now down the minister's going to kind of tilt apartment main campus counselor so we don't have any particular or in far apart from the policy what we get more official you see with the theory that I'm just one really important work more I try to manage to do that so we're actually looking at that whole facility is a better location can't_''_3755.38 go into too much detail but actually that's something that's crossed a difficult painting the metal is a possibility irregular to RTP hasn't called there I can't say today because actually there's still some things to find you but to 2-under for gas station and I have one budget I both my budgets into local areas so I try to get your 31st budgets to be pushed and as local as possible to the services so the I do to my mother between Jerry Matt and then I also subdivided between surgery medicine I already have a budget so that's just how much about it thankful if you could put your hands together for
Name is Fiona book and I'm the managing director of our kilts and we're here on day two of the king square historical archaeological excavation we're here working for the City of Fremantle doing archaeological excavations as part of the King Square redevelopment so we're here in this particular location because we've got we're predicting that we'll find remnants of the 1929 centenary building the certain or evil that was built here so we've opened up an area of excavation yesterday and we've been working on it today and we found what we think may be a collapsed foundation for the Senate centenary building but we've also found lots of evidence for a farrier and maybe a black thread working in this location and so the archaeological team are currently excavating all of that and we've got horseshoes and we're very excited that we've actually found found something it's always difficult when you predict what you might find and then you don't find anything or you do find things it's a good thing to be here

Is your boat more like to start by knowledge in your room or jumping running a mine is fix people's personal prism only way to do it is tonight into a tag team and I'm only eight Carolyn's who's the new economic regime it's going to kick off but she's going to talk to it about me that why Cannot enormously passionate about an hour and none of them come back and talk a bit about what that means your program water can you criminals being broadly supportive of that idea of nool come together and answer any questions unit so on okay thanks charity are not very cheap no service myself become better supports all young especially in the room from 1.5 hopefully look family opportunity give an overview of the city Qin Ana's vision for a new boy banana this is nothing new I need 14 finale without something that has been in planning documents since the 1950s and what happened back in the car suppose instead of the beginning back in August this July the city of canal get like a lot of businesses are closing there's a lot of uncertainty in the industrial area so the city of when I decided to come to take a bit of a leadership step and thought they'll bring together leaders from we have 23 hand with pen new people we had a forum and our people from government industry environment the investment sector and we look very narrowly focused to start with about what we could do to try and invigorate the Canadian dustrial area itself it became very clear during the course of those discussions that we couldn't all very narrow when are we had to really look at this as a regional opportunity so the critical owner took all the information that they've learned from that from that those discussions and we did our own research and we came up with the indian ocean gateway proposal in the meantime the government announced the sale of Fremantle port Liz and so that really galvanized us into action and to talk to our neighbors as well because we saw this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try and enforce contractual clauses that there is a leader a cabin transition or migration to an outer harbour Tanana as part of a requirement on a new owner so it's just a friend before stop sit down drive this some surprise wife ever Harley important to her Nana so put simply the planning document is saying that by 2050 750,000 people will be living in our region not just one opened our region and there is no strong employment or economic driver to try and assist us stimulate the area of our young people with jobs so so that's what we're very concerned about we and we can on the proposal just to put you into a bit of perspective here where we're talking about are they or where is the video I hope you just met that we had talked in highway then we have rarely mode angkatell boy and this is where we're proposing a stage 1 and stage 2 of an outer harbour we have the proposed row lake that is going through proposed then time to be going through your nose with over has not had a full position on roay or Perth lately what we've been trying to portray if there is a better alternative if the government takes a good step back and have a good look what's what's proposed and of course we have the inner harbor all the free mental or here so let's never harbor what are people actually quite pleased we think we livin breathin of course outer harbor is a Harvard section or the coast road insolent encoding sound and you know half of course criminal forfeiture which goes up into the Swan River so we're advocating for a some sort of epitaph accounting for a stage transition to a full working port which will mean containers murder vehicles both boards Darris a livestock scrap metal etc anything that is now coming into Fremantle we want to have a full operational working port into the future and I will add that the city of kelowna works with five other regional councils of volunteer each organization for last 30 years so we have Rockingham in Winona Coburn Fremantle this banana and milk with an actual configuration of this piece of infrastructure what we do agree is it is actually needed and it's needed to abduct plan for now I mean female and ok Manhattan have issues and replacement and we ran into moma might go rockingham some issues with rail free mental issues about potentially full transitional we use to keep some in Tanner's not sure where talk about that little about that later as I said 30 action or Christmas or ethnic someplace so this is the Western trained Coast it was a setup five is no government a few years ago and where it is the land that runs from the AMC through the Robin down rockingham industrial zone the red line here is an industrial buffer which you hope is soon to be educated and what industrial buffer doesn't feel concerned e to the businesses that are in that area that they won't be encroached on and certainty to those people outside of that area that industry will not approach on them and in here we also to have a very very mental area which quite sure are you familiar with now brown area it's obvious on them super nice one so in present substage devourment and following consultation with many people are waking up certain information along the way it really does need to extend an extra kilometer south will also require breakwater the combined length of the full build-out stage one and two is six to seven kilometers so it's quite a large port where complies with all this land back porch base because comes about business is built out into the covariance sound and this is allows capeside's business to use occurs at the bottom and przemek a concave sides vessels it also allows rail on the paupers Weaver part is an intermodal which means that the car logo is just from the ship drowned or shipped afraid instead of having an interval 0 which is over here so it saves duplication so surprised poof ratings we know is designed to ease ingestion and fremantle for traps still going to fremantle its harbor century and work and beyond and we say it has a lot bit of proposal as half of payments my to the western trail closed in coming years and decades and in this option does take traps and fremantle engine for our industry and investors that I've also agree now to have it is the best option and we've had discussions with large superannuation fund managers as part of our research and is saying that the government doesn't have to funds they can do this in partnership with a gun or in some circumstances to David willing to fund the outer half of themselves of course the government's or responsible for Rome and grow and what we know business of closing and some areas jobs are being shed we know businesses want certainty and they want to go in the area where is room and isn't and enough land to expand fremantle doesn't happen on industrial air is about 6,000 hectares with only two thousand currently been utilized the one thing we do have is what's underutilized very bland as a council we can now certain encourage industry into the protection zone once it's legislated an example is areas I'm up with smelling food processing is one that we've certainly trying to encourage into this area they provide employment for low skills and erection and transport route granada is a really high unemployment problem we have something like twenty percent youth unemployment and that's a 10 to 25 year olds and senior our unemployment is ten ten percent so there's a really really looking at just isolated to really start getting something happening part of it is the protections on and then of course the other half and of course it's not just about to come out of no co Binh has a minor from Rockingham and looking this would got our friends Accardo recent on Jared a major benefit and now this is at full build-out_,_671.17 and your revenue of forty-two point four percent 4 billion with a further twenty eight billion indirect annual revenue direct employment freight transport links and the notion gave our projections I'm just simply legislature where are these figures coming from the Western trade coast integration assessment planning very being of our research that was done the dales change person on that so they drink plenty of is that fool don't forget about the buffer zone a lot it's not just quoted for you it is the form the full area for build out our improved efficiencies and for operations with mental note of our rail facility Jason to the porn or three kilometers away again a better solution for addressing first road congestion issue new residents and commercial development opportunities in cream and which brad will touch upon some points to ponder this is very quickly and definitely out on how the means using existing or planned rights we have talked and highway rally right is already in reserve angkatell road through to Thomas rotatory highlight low dangerous for the carnival it would be need some extension of an detail ride most importantly there were no tunnels and no homes lost one we love about environmental side of it because I spatially komen is a beautiful piece of sound there so we contacted James went private limited however the people who did environmental is more than which was a private however they had going going belly-up that's now a Supreme Court where consultant we their environmental empower people and they have provided a preliminary investment on that it's basically saying the land back option is seen as much more environmentally home pitch that said is no doubt they have to be very careful planning around cohoon sound and that's why we say it has to be a whole of government approach to this this is a beautiful area and so I just need to make sure the key environmental factors are taken care of in this stuff just repeating 25 thousand new jobs created for you Billy antidote William you read these doubling 21st technology and innovation heading through the relocated from Fremantle to the Western cocoa because we saved in budget provides consultation save files within our CEO a nice to the council passed a resolution do to really go ahead and try and educate our Harbor we had brief reach as many people as we can and have it used in your strength we've been we've been to camera being anyone ask for briefing like you go and respect to a long-term dividends increased economic output for the stage school no school jobs which is really important you have such a high unemployment level global competitive and of course releases of the inner harbor at Fremantle so really when you look we can dump it take a step back and have a little bit overall man mostly most of the government the frame coming from you know any truck drives in here looking okay most of truck drivers we'd speak to a salient road comes reviewed up why wouldn't you use talkin highway angkatell road rally road and of course the federal government gave funding for the construction of London John road which goes to Tonkin highlight talkin highway now stops our friendship servant I'm Jared I'll things is wonderful opportunity to get talking to highway extenders that can then open up opportunities for them our friends and our dollars clean out the promise of funding for our dough right again is more arterial coming down in the region of 750,000 people expected by 2050 seems a long time tamil over there what we will be asking for is a task force to be headed by independent person not of government so that they can pull together or the government agencies that are actually needing to make this work because the end of every day red devil respective say I just really just makes sense this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity not to have free meal harbor as if tire sweating it no he's going to anything down now I economic and employment outcomes if there's nothing even government contract the government to government of cycles ago the rest of you know the contract so so it's a little bit scrambled but that's based if you're hoping give you a better than I very broad brush idea we don't have it the answers I'm not a planner I'm not environmentalist I'm not a geographer what I am is mere in the region that has significant employment problems and so many people coming that we really needed to be piped and get on the front felt really try and make something happen and it's agreed that now harbors lead but it's not if it's when and we father met though the premiums language changing from 20 years down 10 years that even willing to government there seems to be different debate about when this is going to be the important point is that we drive size the government doesn't have to pay these investors we speak to say they were large investment funds out there superannuation files looking for new infrastructure projects they to see the outer harbor is the candy because there's so much room to expand to have some great for some sort of changes so thank you and I'll just hand over to Fred this is an interview I think it's very nice segue in around around the sale because no doubt that a lot of this has come up because of it because of the sale and I was just a radical for business news that was out late last year in December and really if you can't do a poor or anywhere near that unless you invest billions of dollars in transport the sections we've got is bit between where company finishes have it went on freeway and then on to the extend through to the stock road very expensive in a row rather than 4,500 million dollar mark 44 flooded robotics a lot of it has to be breached to reduce environment packs button is doing and then of course section 2 which is the deep there were approval of section 1 until rest of the right now so that's being skidded out probably for another four months possibly to the other side of neck selection of course put all this back into you have much more questionable space see part two letters written history based on this was lifted from main road website and that where the original proposal had it running apps topper over the whole series of flyovers of windfall and self coming behind us Anya and then flyovers at Carrington where it hits during our way but then that was a big one option and of course the more reason you would have heard about the alternative tunnel option which num is that the sure website indicates and kind of cuts through their concealed and work on valley and pops out so it comes up after we default so and the tunnel fit alone is 1.3 billion dollars for that three times of optimal okay very very expensive Disraeli started had to do a lot just what they've got there is probably around a particular normal which is carrollton exam good for the port or but probably for the point out is actually doesn't that little English get to report it pops up about here to the issue mellow and then yeah if we need to come into their time I said yes but they can't plan you'll see this of course there are no planes took me probably roll want that farm last mile 23 done at the moment it looks like this which is and I looks up the initiative group what it even is a lot these google maps for the point isn't actually the western at right so it's no point upgrading all of it don't fix his last bit over the bridge and its houses coming off it on titan road into the port itself and the reason that's added it because the yacht have to spend a very very substantial amount of money to get us through that main road technologies will be include the doubling is daily regimen and interchange and canning highway and a solution or pregnant or extreme and tied the road which no one seems to be able to me lists what that was waiting for so there's talks of trenches and flyovers and another thing as well I think to be frank none of them are very appealing at munger bow lane roads own verbal is this is ready to pick that last days alone to be around the farm from indomina at least so your sub C becomes a very very expensive bit of project to get this actually to make the other harbor expand jabra has been expanding for a long time and at the port in eastern span and be fair to say anyone who has a pleasure of driving high street at the moment I'm on the week then what race to rights and we would agree with that and the question is to what extent that you actually go and do those because I mean it ultimately wrote this route interesting point right now and that point is we need to choose where we could add the structure spend either we put billions of dollars into a road to the existing able to try to set up a can double and triple in size or we put those where for billions of dollars into our outer harbor and we then find overall we do a combination of but this is the Pope I think is the most expensive in these Roman history and I think it at the very least there's people in rivers a service for those who oppose but very least it should be a proper if you can s be more money with it has been on the road for proper cost-benefit analysis of options I mean for me that seems like good sensible approaches to this to these things and that hasn't happened it's only been one option is costed and it with would rather see a view then saw creative investment both in the other hub we'd like to see more investment public transport but it said it also needs to be some improvements of those roads leading people right now with all rid of that end and we are something advocating the first time comes and I should get on them do it and make that safe with its a pretty low cost things you can do to the racemate and work much better right now then there should be happy but I guess what's been interesting those who have been following the whole right around the outer harbor and the frightening journey right is that stop being called her frightening I think was talk acquaintance what were sort of pickles harbored because it was about it was about actually it's going to be for proper proper cars and an item sent them will remind us how excited I lyricist including just about if you do the strength of your being separate people become user that sets a nature of Road planning work it works if you we could ever leave them Sam is to do a transport it will get at me I guess for us as a community is a bit of a decision around what's the kind of instruction that really want to see within within average and council is pretty clear we'd rather see if 15 been a library from Fremantle to Middleton through curb in general and we would a billion dollars of extra freeway so frequent version but one is actually that we see that the current me and the dog are you sore loser purposes for saying you are already about now our radical solution is that section was government policy on tool in Ted it was bipartisan double policy for decades until about a year and a half so so now we become this country become quite radical and our solutions basically saying actual results into the system with kind of planning you had in place of decades on both sides apartment and that is that character going to board should be basically be capped and there should be it happen it should be a transition beyond what that number should be that could be me Jessica 40 now my dear is it probably in terms of in fact ideally you'd bring it back down be very kind of fire to 705 lat four thousand a year long term means if you keep using the SMS air now me and government promises we don't want to move the whole all right now because there's a lot of there's a lot of money invested in us we understand that when we actually again consistent long-term government thank you think that should statement I partly admit that it's partly my nostalgic almost Oh perfection but I love let free man is that a key son is a real place as Corner and it does employ people enter that it is part of your way up but it's not me though I realize entirely consistent with saying though that well we've got to keep that port going for a long as we can we are going to talk about New York structure investment into the other half so that's certainly how we see that as you approach the what we are going to meet 2020 it's pretty evenly shared between inner and outer harbor engine container members also very much keep kicking of this is so fun off that obviously semi-hard Nana's devote this is whether if that you did it to mean there are lots of ways of carving this up and this is where so the economically really keen on seeing that every utilized which is a major everywhere you can actually put containers and do a terminal dead but also proper investment in rocky road at the moment we've got about twelve thirty percent of them kind of command row the vast majorities could come out on trucks and this is a really great opportunity to invest in really great infrastructure that gets more competitive row if it sets up a cropper 21st century freight system for 24 w and then hopefully that means the robot isn't required and when you've got me to row that cost extraordinary amounts per kilometer and open team so I think Rose that five kilometers from from Emory a forest highway that 100 kilometers and cost just to give you a bit of a sense of this is actually just badly and I think we need to understand it we actually getting really really bad day that's on this competition because they're so focused on trying to fit in better trying to try to squeeze through what was really nineteen fifties planning into 21st century environmental controls should be it and twenty percent of communities and it's costing a lot of money actually not getting we can do a much cheaper road and rail system through to the other one of the things that I would like to see happen sooner rather a rubber present later is around have fragment up next to its waterfront nothing is an opportunity here with the other half around free memory actually written it to the wall fits at the moment it's pretty pretty blatant we put premium 20 Miller free up if you like actually near the work and certainly even a connection through to that the pattern determine which is of course will be maintained of poor people walking for hundreds of meters carrying their suitcase trying to find with it the fashion of terminal is and how to get there just about 40 degrees they understood this slightly cringe-worthy but um but this is what we can't leave happens is the current situation is is we and it's and it's actually a really important part of freelance economy now as well is that that there are 57 research this year 14 hours of passages is about into a car park with a little bit of variable walk to anything which I'm finding their way is only going to expand so it is actually I see the outer harbor and taking some of that pressure off your mouth opportunity to prove some of these aspects like around how it helps it interfaces with the passenger to me again the idea that this is the best use of the South key or what we call you on Victoria least have a common usage it yet by the idea of the north gate we're predominantly it's just a car back it's one of the groups with students and work on which it should have finalized within about a week is what are the opportunities of moving this is roro or roll-on roll-off cut objects are moving those things quick more quickly than can I know that and so the instructor was most intensive as a cranes and those kinds of things moving those out as quickly as possible so and I don't think that need to happen various but planning for that so that we can se start to see Fremantle it started reconnect with it warm front you can imagine in these areas where you could have hotels you could have a range of puzzles and different things and restaurants and all those kinds of things that go right down to the water and for me and the idea of having a working port and the other side of water is pretty we really pretty extraordinary after opted for a city that's impressively been tourism to part of which more than whether we like it or not and lonely planet same weather and one of the top 10 was it I mean I probably a bit of an interesting turning point for us where I think we've I want to get free mental to embrace tourism with others in a soft without losing you want Alexis you name cities quickly saying this area be transformed this is obviously whether the cards were and you've got the heirloom for NOC developers happening I've been redeveloped so but pretty good but the best land actually you close and you can see that there's a real opportunity to connect or that's rid of the water and that's hard conversation that we would like to have we done with with me which alone which is why we're whatever this crazy thing is a real win win is a win for medium noah and is win with me the free mail and for the state to the next general construction or so this actually wise to be really good to work with terrible in the other councils and then be fair to say I mean it's been a really interesting and broad-based coalition kind of the current approach and that's been quite fascinating you optional whether we win this battle not is yet to be seen but I think the evidence is on our side due to questions and one observation first of all I born and bred and three other grew up them through and female more the great place to defer catching inlets blowies but question one is what is the current global important export and vessels coming to Fremantle and between now and when state one of the new harbour will be up and functioning mission that does are you going to get more and more congestion in other words vessel waiting out under waters with the off-road or your own exports and more important is here it's totally going second question if stage one a row highway is built before the blue section will get the up and running the thinking is as 45 trucks off the road ok so those mice and just thinking in her that would be against it would be your truck ease and your petroleum industry who is with science now me right right what I saw was 11 vehicle carrying what 45 others in freaky speed of sharkus you know my senses yeah I think I think it comes down to watch the quickness why would they can get their right to a port and at the end of the day if it is a quicker route to get to canal they've probably been favored that rather than I have an operative island Bloods stop-start I think my issue yeah thanks a quick question from Carol it is a finance position that ultimately Fremantle would host of other in passing issues yeah we would just and we can't cherry pick me would you squealed like a full working how to come down to so this would be free as air quality and this is the point of difference because no clue because they were fighting I wouldn't you think that's I think I think you two before it be passenger 1990 because there was no other tunes we would say the north side of the key it's also some wonderful valuable and the gum so who paid for own idea and I guess my Nexus my point here is a rather see that would before attaining on north side whilst the south side been opened up in the city making for to you say in and navy visitations will end up at aha Oh buddy matt grupe reserve yes Edward research pixels because I Vikings bring opinion without me we are agreed yes sorry I just wondering first about to comment on how exciting this is because I can see that people are going to mean it's going to be huge benefit to everybody but this is like the goose that like gold egg and that gold next should stay in public hands it's absolutely Sheard and I'm just wondering just please people just coming to serve a show of hands who agree to things that we do not privatize our fourth we do not privatize our army has it that we continue to keep our money for WI for our kids Brussels for a whole system please everyone this is fundamentally this is going to happen it needs to go to us we just your voice will be strong in reflecting what we all believe is right that would be the best outcome because doing winkle generation and really brilliant and it would be such a thin and how they are fear the progress is that we just lose the trop may I think that's been a beginning to its government I mean so we are we've kept the others cuz there is the council positions at the moment but but be fair to say that I've certainly had concern today's broadcast companies right which one my comment that does what they doing there was only one they'll try to make them yesterday and there is a sea of grass that we in a process while we in the middle this very complex planning and a major transition prioritizing midway through that to me makes my one censuses is honorable christopher higher than one expression on the school council our position on disability support innovation gateway for all sorts of reasons but just on the comment that you made we would actually prefer for Tanaka side because we had's a hash profit over two dozen it is when it's in public hands and we have a much better ability to be able to interest as customer Russian sir don't get me wrong but if that was solved to try the industry like things in heaven his country BM with the prophets a guy offshore the multinationals all right now I'm not aware but I will give your children do a couple morning okay just first living on your wife remember board the Newport should also visible to the public I need for the sarcasm if that's called a lot of money they use the gun post more but the question about is the reason what is your reason for the capital 500 700,000 containers yep is it EOC system what Assad on our vehicle there's never an emetic number it really it really depends on how much of this rating throat so you could you did nothing your capital pub we did not sit on the road if you'd actually improved upgrade parts of high streets but it was much safer and again and do some minor upgrades you probably pushed update and still have reasonable melody geez we understand every needs been a lot of money double degree and I guess there's gonna be a line there somewhere where at some point you can't_''_2380.45 bend bend it in three four hundred million dollars being a new bridge across this hungry but I think at that point is probably not worth it so I guess that's what I'm trying to work out there's no magic number and I think that's a big big work through but it's about getting how can you do the transition and do it really quickly I think I think this really really thoughtful and reading enums in a way that doesn't require heat rock right up raised in it I guess that's why I was asking the resin polluter reasons about getting the trucks off the road I just identify where we've got some great in efficiencies we'll just go in for cunent I'd say them how did the truck siren off which effectively done talk to industry sodium when I meant me to participate anywhere on the line voltage both your counsel to work or going to say by heaven and Charlie committee around the stuff and all your support is Compton but I think it's really important that everyone has to be a greater role on Broadway because not only what happened it is all absol advice the money spend two million dollars to effectively ended up the front yard and you have to sell report which is work to being as well it's mad right so that should be put on hold to stop let's work on improving efficiency and then let's really engage all the stuff colors in the proposed Muhammad Peters sit down you guys have been so he introduced into the operators as well though in oppositely over there billion dollars and cyber and price as well so if I just heard you to do that no problem just brushing your I think it's probably okay many ways this relation is a conversation starter me some of this we don't mr. we're think you make a really good point in that wonderful to share one other bizarre statistic that every tape no harm acknowledged ease into the hall of the freight link lemony will oppressive airport by 1 million dollars so I just think where in the world would you spend to an art free and in order to increase abelian my younger because yeah st. Jude because it's pitbull government money not statement thank all our taxes in my onions I just like me is just one of its executive Isis is this is a stupid icon and really what we're trying to do is kick start a conversation and we certainly have over the last six months leave you've got people talking about the prospect of an outer harbor how can we work together to do it and all the people that we've spoken to even people in the government you've always come away with a great ideas there's something more we've employed it into our plan so then we can expand more the repetitive it's very much of working your document not it's not how system to white it's the win and the longer it takes the outer harbor to be even starting more God's going to put up with congestion here yeah sorry I think that if you know what I way that gives you the focus that's a first step because he goes to want to spend it to me eventually let's go down but that's good Rosie's commune I agree and it was good I when I christen you presented to the Senate inquiry and for some very odd because one of the officers were there were two very good points across so I'll ever chat you that something I'm really astounded by the blockages that we look forward to our and what I'm starting to think is that the whole purse rate in possession not about first rate is actually they are getting the river Queen comes back to the sense plan and I mean Nikki Stevens man so I just want to get your opinion on if the person rate that wedding and yes it will then also the end cars because we've got an idea to send three cars and the interest rates heading up the western suburbs up towards Malaga's the original plan has feelings and highway which should come from the sharon mitchell corey way around good way through the Cavalla park and alton avenue and inflate that ring road that main roads had wanted do you think this may be is why there's such a blockage because memorization 104 yeah something I forget all the potty record this story is a story together but it's been told by a lot of it is that I should I can't think it's just intonation anyone knows the basic story the story of a perforating is is that the fake went into asking for money there that after the men after after having a reasonably short meeting him out and said well good news is got money bad news is not for the other harbors for this eruption to the yeah I mean it was that kind of thinking end of time Tony Abbott was a rotating Prime Minister of damage the legal decision-making that doesn't issue wasn't too planning and I think the some unknown reason despite a change of Prime Minister it's stuck because people have invested in an end it's pretty hard to untangle I don't really even think it's based on would wind up certain s justification hepburn's name is a plan and a part of the justification for it but but I don't really think it's based on long-term planning thinking so there's no it's about toll roads it's about kind of particular financial models that make it work or not work and and it's about politics politics and sure there's more referendum Western not possible to have a friend of the windy with showers and mr. truly important issue likes you all right I probably should wrap up but I was a big veiny body for coming out listening in you
It's really nice to be back for another four years it's a really exciting time in Fremantle and tonight this morning some really great people I'm really excited about working with so looking forward to making the sworn in as counselor for esport I'm very much looking forward to working with the team on the counts of the people I'm counselor Aidan Lang representing see warden Fremantle being his counselors recently it's a huge honor I hope for the representing both the business community and the residential community which are major city a better place thanks to honey but Cheers
Beginning of the shift at 8 o'clock Paris come on to you was just about to leave we come together do what we call hand over then we got a notification for wanted patrons that Ian was face down in the water and we run a couple yards away and it only just happened and we raced over the girls done an assessment pulled him from the water and began CPR in that time I went to get the ambulance called and the emergency services sorted and got back when we put the emergency equipment on him and we got him back all I remember is getting into the pool and waking up in Fiona Stanley hospital day later so I just so grateful these people for their skills and the common sense and their ability to rescue me from a life-threatening situation
G'day_:_0.0 I'm Brad Pettitte and welcome to the februari 2017 edition of from the council chambers the experimental overall redevelopment project was a big item of discussion of the council this month and importantly we've reached an agreement that's been both signed off by the CD Fremantle and the Fremantle Dockers for the free mental oval to be handed back to the criminal community so that it can be used for a range of community events throughout the year and pleasingly we came to an agreement with the doctors which was both the win for the Dockers m for the city of Fremantle as part of the King square project we need a new home for our administration building while we're rebuilding cat Kings square and we've agreed to the doctors that will move into their their headquarters now that they'd move to Coburn and that will pay them 1.5 million dollars over three years as part of that but at the end of that will actually get to keep the building and there should be over will be handed back even earlier we can see is that we can imagine now the over will be used all year round for everything from women's football games through to waffle games or all year round summer sports and in the warmer months but also music and community activities and those kinds of things so it was it was a good outcome it was a hard-fought negotiation but I think ultimately now we can see that 20 million dollar redevelopment of Fremantle load will happen as well a second item related to the Fremantle open redevelopment was actually the questionnaire understand Riley and some pad for those who don't know sir perhaps have been using that as a temporary accommodation based for about 30 men who have been using that as a crisis accommodation the council was really committed to making sure that some pets continue to have the ongoing capacity within their organization to offer that Chrysler accommodation we obviously want to see those men put out and straighten it in anyway so we work with them to come to an agreement where the city will pay some perhaps two hundred thousand adapt another facilities that they've got in the region which will hold those men into longer-term again it's a really good outcome because some fact the sandbur early I should say was actually always only a temporary location and what we've done now is actually make sure that we've got a ongoing sustainable option for the clients and perhaps to use in the region and the upside of it as well is that when we demolish the samurais right now and turn that into a temporary car park so during the Q square project we will have an extra 160 really easy to access bays to actually make sure that people can have some really good convenient parking so there was a series of wings that came out of that in terms of both good our comfortable some pets and their clients also too without outcomes for businesses and fremantle integers more easy to access parking they're not Saddam proposal for the corner of clinton high street was a big item of development the city of Fremantle offices have recommended that which has been refused of that development proposal for those of you who hadn't heard the proposed awards for a five-story development that values for their nursing and also have a public theater in there as well well still a lot to like about the proposal it was agreed both from our South also from the Heritage advice that we got that it wasn't_''_214.79 that the scale was too large it was um we would were really careful in the West End which is an hour course part of a psychiatric list that we see that the that the heights are kept within what would almost always be three to four stories but also that the design is made to be very compatible with it's really important heritage precinct so the council unanimously refused number three High Street but ultimately it won't be a council decision this will go to the joint government assessment panel in coming weeks and that will ultimately decide this will be fair to say that both the community and the council I think have a very strong recommendation to the Jade out there should be this was put forward to us by a range of non-government organizations who are really trying to put forward and as an advocacy document that aucks about how we can as a community seriously address climate change and move towards a society that's based on renewable energy and sustainability really great to see this and come to us and see the wide range of church and community groups that have already signed on to this important document to the best one dollar city Fremantle was the first local government in Western Australia Chris Islanders climate consensus statement and it's about putting really our values really at the heart of what we do I think you probably already know that the city free mental is puts the first local government Western Australia to be carbon neutral the second study behind the City of Sydney and we continuing to make sure that we invest your rates into investing into renewable energy and all kinds of things just for example with every year we put one percent of breaks towards renewable energy projects and what that means over the last few was go down not up and that's pretty unusual for any organization or any household in Western Australia so and we will continue to do this investing in renewable missing and sustainability and making sure that we really do address the major change of climate change as we go forward 21 beat street is a property that city of Fremantle has down on nearly straight jetty which data had been in four million years of course data are now moving up to the old boy school which means that this property we were putting back out out for lease one of the things the counselor was considered that there was an opportunity for the aboriginal center that we currently have it at Arthur's head that was that Aboriginal cockerel seller could move down to beach trip so what we have some very good applications from a range of great organizations from autism WA to the RSL and others who are looking at beach trip but we've decided to defer finalizing this process for the moment whilst we looked at whether this was a more suitable venue for from counsel referred back to the finance policy and operation and legal committee of the council at Paul in marks where they will ultimately get considered the pros and cons of this also with a budget of twenty thousand dollars so that they can go if they do choose to go down the road government of the aboriginal cultural center that that engagement process can happen and be done properly and fully so we have a really good conclusion for that account so it can make a long-term precision and what is ultimately a really important a really important side and one which has got a lot of opportunity and it was my guess we're really blessed as the community that so many good organizations saw that they wanted to

This is an interactive water puddle that was designed specifically with a soundscape so that when people jump on it its motion to ticked so start to splash and react to the people as Emily through it we were asked to come and have a look at the different arcade this particular arcade I saw really needed to have a change of color to entice people to walk through it and I thought the interactive water puddle was a perfect sort of blue contrast with the the brown that's of the arcade major challenges with this project has been the artwork trying to find people that could produce something of this caliber I had a lot of people without their perception of what I wanted in one instance turned out to be something different so I did go through quite a few artists but I am very happy with what we finally got and as you'll see it's it's a it's a great public art project it's called through here so it's a video installation of two videos short throw projectors the video screen just up here and that will reflect on the floor on these reflective panels and that will bounce the the image around we've had to do a lot of prototyping and a lot of changes and adjustments as we've gone through so that the space has been on the one hand where it drives or ideas and makes things really interesting it's also been challenging to work with that space there's nothing in this space people just travel through it and so we really wanted to transform the space somewhere that people could really pause and reflect and see the whole space differently and see their place within it as well to actually kind of be a little bit self reflective we really like the idea that it's not going to be permit that it's going to disappear and become a memory I had to go through a few yeah just nightmares or waking up in the middle of the night so I didn't think II know it's not going to hold this very time consuming and I have learned through time I think I started in november making the actual pixel everyday couple of hours today took you know over four months to extra make it any gluing of the making them together I will hope there will be a certain type of wonder and surprise and that they would appreciate the work we went behind it

Please welcome david shetlift today sharing his vision for the kings square project thank you thank you very much alison it's a delight to be here I acknowledge the presence of mayor brad pitt of member of parliament del carls elected members of uh council tim milson and members of the board of the uh of the chamber of commerce um guest one and all and as I look around the room there are a remarkable number of people that I recognise so I guess brad I've partly achieved one of my goals which is to get myself out and about around fremantle almost as much as you do um I've just some of you know I've just come back from overseas and and um that was a uh an interesting exercise and in that I went to to south america and it was interesting to look at some of the some of the big cities over there and how they deal with public space and um and and heritage buildings and things that much of that nature with the sort of you know eye for sitting around yesterday sort of watching the activities of fremantle I realized that I've actually been home in adelaide for two of the last nine weeks so I'm actually looking forward to spending a bit of time in adelaide getting my golf handicap back in order again my age one has to keep that balance right I thought it might be useful just to remind people that perhaps don't know me or haven't_''_101.6 met with me and talked with me over the period that I've been around fremantle which is over 12 months now and just share a couple of moments about what my role is as I see it with the city and I guess the first point is that really I I'm charged with the responsibility of trying to help achieve some outcomes for the city and on the economic development and investment front fundamentally I'm an interface between the city of fremantle investors developers land owners tenants and community groups and individuals my role is to try and increase understanding of the goals of the city in terms of economic today to overcome blockages in the system whether they are within the investment community or whether they're within the city and a number of people that work for the city that are here today will know that I've come knocking on their door and said well hang on you said you're going to do this please do it to maintain momentum on the projects that I'm involved in it's a bit like you know when I come to town I sort of start agitating to meet with people and to find out where things are up to it's a bit like having a board in place in many organizations or having regular council meetings provides an interesting discipline to keep things going shetland's in town he's stirring up we better get done what we said we're going to get done otherwise he'll put his grumpy pants on again and also part of my role is to coordinate various professional advisors that may be retained by the city in relation to the various projects that that are going on in the the city I'm somewhat well I'm completely independent of the decision making of the city and that's proving to be a useful sort of catalyst role if you like to have somebody playing when there's a lot of activity going on it just keeps some momentum it gives an opportunity for people to to talk without feeling as though they're they're talking to to those that are finally going to make decisions about their particular project and you know it's it's been an interesting journey over the last 12 months and I suspect it's going to continue for a little while yet but today I wanted to talk about and been asked to talk about one of the projects I'm involved with which is become known as the king square project and what is it it's essentially the redevelopment or potential redevelopment of the ma building what's known as the queensgate building next to it the city admin building the queensgate car park at the back of the maya building in the queensgate office building and also potentially known as the spicer site because spicer stationery used to have a large building there many years ago why would we be wanting to think about such a project in fremantle and if you have a look at those slides that I've put up there which are photographs I've taken over the course of the time that I've been around and there's a couple of things that I suspect strike one straight away firstly the buildings aren't all that attractive secondly what's not clear from those slides but what's well known is that the owners of all of those buildings have a desire to redevelop them and there's also significant underutilization of those buildings both now and shortly to be in the case of queensgate and of course vacant plots of land right in the heart of the city is not necessarily ideal use of of the property but I think most importantly what strikes me about those photographs is that there are no people in them and at the end of the day if you want to have an active vibrant the difference is people and this is stating the obvious in many ways but as I mentioned I've just been to to south america and I don't want to spend lot of time talking about that but when we first arrived in santiago which is the capital of chile in a city of about 7 million people we stayed in a place called providencia which is a little bit out of the main downtown area it's sort of like a subiaco I suppose of of perth in many ways and there was something wrong with wife and I walked around the streets buildings were interesting and nice and and so on but there were no people and we asked what was going on and they said oh it's all saints day and everything's shut um in the whole of chile I suspect um probably the whole of south america if the truth be known which they're all good catholic countries but the next day we went out for a walk and the place was buzzing with people there were people walking down the streets it was a live and a really great place to be and it absolutely struck me between between the eyes on that occasion just how important people are to creating a sense of vitality and activity and economic activity for retailers and for everybody else within a city and so one of the key the key problems of um of the space that we actually know is king square is that it doesn't attract enough people so the benefits of trying to turn it around around obviously increased economic activity and efficiency improved community amenity make it a more interesting place better building design than what's there but I'd have to say murray the 1960s and 70s weren't the greatest uh period of noble architecture in this country or elsewhere and reduce or eliminate anti-social behaviour by increasing the number of people that are around there each reinforces the other they're not all do one thing and that'll fix it there's no magic bullet but if you do a combination of things you start to achieve some positive outcomes finally the king square for future additional developments within the city of fremantle the drivers of course have been first of all the owners of the ma building who are now serona capital management they used to be saracen properties but aren't any more there's two unoccupied floors in that building and in fact there's three because there's a very high parapet at the top that's got nothing in it and it's a pretty ugly 1970s design I think there's been polls that say it's about the second ugliest building in australia um so it's hardly a flagship building to have in the heart of fremantle the owner of the other buildings the city of fremantle the cinema's lease expires in about a month's time I understand and they'll be departing um there's vacant land which I mentioned known as the spicer site which has obviously got potential for much greater use than it currently has there's an inefficient and tired office building and library that's the the city admin building and redevelopment of those sites was identified quite was brought out 12 80 months ago now and there is general desire by the city and a need I would suggest to revitalize the fremantle cbd so if you put those two together the my building and the city's buildings you finish up with a potential opportunity which we identified in the original retail model plan that david west and I produced 12 months or so ago and serious discussion around the potential coordinated integrated development of these sites started around april this year and it was the intention all along uh to explore opportunities for some kind of joint development across these buildings the local government act prohibits the city or any local government in western australia from entering into a commercial joint venture arrangement with another commercial party and so a joint venture was was never an option available to us as a consequence of of our discussions at the time with with saracen properties since reinforced with sirona we um we managed to get an extension on the time that was available to maya to renew their lease they were due to to commit to of july 2011 and as I'll share with you in a moment we're still very much involved in active negotiations with them um so if the city hadn't intervened at that point in time I would certainly have announced by now that they were they were leaving fremantle the ownership of the mar building changed in about september this year and uh when final settlement took place on that and the parties that's the city of fremont and sirona as the now owners of the my building then entered into a memorandum of understanding which is essentially an agreement to evaluate the benefits of a joint development it's an exclusive an exclusivity clause in but it's an exclusivity to negotiate and will only result in an agreement to develop if agreement is reached between the parties and I'll have more to say about that in a moment the city or by agreement the the city can can eliminate one or more of the properties listed so that for example if it was decided not to redevelop the city admin building as part of for the for the city necessarily to do that it can step out in relation to one or more of its buildings or properties if it chooses to um the exclusivity exclusivity period runs until june this year and I make the point we cop the city cops and criticism at the time as to why there weren't public tenders around this this development and basically if you're wanting to explore the opportunity for a joint development with your next-door neighbor you can really only do business with you with your next-door neighbor now at the end of the day that doesn't work out then you explore other options as I'll say in a minute but the mou had an interesting outcome in that it brought the project right out into the open and it's the city's intention certainly my brief is to be as open and transparent about what's going on as we can be and today's luncheon is very much part of that process when you look at that particular diagram that shows the sort of boundaries if you like it makes sense I would suggest is for the city to consider an integrated development for this project when both parties both the owner of the ma building and the owner of the city's assets have are of a mind to redevelop their own assets why wouldn't you look and see whether it's there is an opportunity to do it as an integrated development which you know could result and should result if it's done properly in some form of consistent design across the whole precinct shared floor plates so that you can get larger areas for for tenants to occupy you can get alternative ownership outcomes parts of what the city owns serena my own parts of what serena own the city may own those kinds of options become become open to us you can get an integrated retail tenancy plan across the whole precinct and you can get a common engagement with maya which of course is what we what we currently have so that just sets out very briefly the sort of elements of the mou and I won't go through each been sitting on the website of the city for quite some time and you can you can read it in detail for yourself but there are two possible outcomes of the process we either reach no agreement with sirona in which case the city will then be free to consider what it might do with its property assets or there will be some form of binding heads of agreement between sirona and the city that will that will emerge and I should make the point that irrespective of what the city whether we reach agreement with serena in relation to an integrated development or whether the city finishes up going its own way the maya building will be redeveloped and the owner's plans certainly are to start that redevelopment during calendar 2012 if at all possible that'll depend a little bit on discussions with with meyer and what the outcome of that turns out to be but that's certainly their their current thinking the heads of agreement that that could result if agreement is reached between the parties is spelt out in the mou what it will it will have some conceptual design and planning will be incorporated into it the structure of the land ownership both during and after the process and of various other issues the security over the city's assets for financing is obviously an issue that's got to be got to be dealt with the structure of the transaction the respective financial contributions between the city and sirona an allocation of risks all of those kinds of things need to be spelt out and of course that plan will be very public document the city is in the process of uh has just very recently um looking to appoint somebody to give it financial assistance in understanding the financial implications of this both in the immediate term of the project itself but also in terms of the broader impacts on the on the city the local government acts quite specific in terms of there being requirements for a business plan to be prepared quite specific that that needs to be subject to six weeks of public consultation needs to be advertised statewide and a whole lot of other issues there's time not the ideal time in terms of the current economies particularly access to finance in the state and australian economies and that's a potential show stopper for us going forward um but nevertheless um we are progressing and the work we're doing now if we have to defer until times are a little better well then the work won't be wasted in terms of what we're currently doing there are a range of of political issues that are going to emerge as part of this assessments not just simple financial and economic issues that will impact on it and community aspirations are important and as I look around the room there are a number of people in this room that I've already had conversations with about this project and we will continue to have conversations with people about this project people say to me you know if you've got some designs to show us you know what's it going to look like well I don't know nobody knows at this point in time the focus at the moment is much more it going to be financially viable and what sort of tenancies we're going to be able to attract they're the issues that we're focused on at this particular point in design at the time and I just make the final point on that that we're not building a shopping centre in the traditional sense of a shopping center we assure people that's not on the agenda what we are building is an outward looking retail commercial and civic precinct the problems of most purpose-built shopping centres is that wool stores shopping center in fremantle is a classic of that type of design that they by design they look inwards the center of activity is is in not out and the intention from day one in regard to this particular project is that we'll be very much being outward looking with activity on the outside not just on the inside this sets out the business case that that the city is having to to prepare at the moment um and it will ask the questions you know what are the alternatives for the city would did its own thing um would it uh what what are the real paybacks what are the what are the benefits in terms of the wider economic input of this project etc etc so that process is will be starting shortly and that will result in the business plan as required under the local government act the requirements of which are set out there they're quite specific in the act as to what the city has to do and as I said earlier that requires a six week period of public consultation so I guess you know whilst that's a lot of process and there's a lot of economics financial workings out to be done throughout this certainly the brief that that I've been given by the city is that we'll be a very very open and transparent process as much as you can within within there's obviously going to be some commercially confidential issues arise but as much as possible the city's intention is to engage with the community and interest groups and stakeholders as we go forward over the next three got a june deadline which the mou currently suggests inevitably by agreement that can be extended but if we were to stick to that end of june deadline then the real crunch decisions about this project and its viability are really going to have to be made in february march april at the latest by the time they have to start going to the elected members let me just spend a window or two on maya it's pretty obvious that it's important if possible for the city to retain my within it if you're setting out on a journey of economic revitalization and attracting investment it's not a particularly good look if one of you made your flagship retailers up sticks and moves out of town just as you start that process so it has been an important goal it's being one of the key drivers you know people have questioned why has the city pushed on with this project with unseemly haste usually they go the other way around why is the city so slow at doing anything and making decisions but this case the reason is very clear um the timing of mars lease and the the desire of the city and indeed the owner of the my building to keep maya is what drives it because the lease expires at the end of july 2012 unless the parties agree to an extension and we've already pushed the boundaries quite a bit in terms of the period of notice that's required so those negotiations are are ongoing and I suspect they will come to a head over the next few weeks and some decisions will be made by the owners and by by maya the mou was actually a very important catalyst it actually was a was a shifting of the ground in terms of of both sirona and maya in terms of taking the city seriously in terms of what it's trying to achieve so whilst in itself it's a pretty innocuous document and it's just an agreement to talk symbolically it had a very significant impact on those negotiations between those two parties if maya were to go there is an alternative major retailer sitting in't ask me and so in economic terms you know the damage of my going won't be won't be huge but as I was asked when I spoke the first leader's lunch back in february this year what the impact would be was I just noted earlier sort of perception wise it's it's it would not be helpful to the city's cause what else might be included in the development and I've underlined the word might because no agreements have been made with any anybody about any of these things at this point in time but another in addition to maya another major retailer is potentially going to be involved there will undoubtedly be a number of specialty retailers would be considered considerable amount of commercial office space and what the owner what's the owner are finding is they go out and start talking to major corporates looking for alternative office space from where they are now there's actually stronger demand than than some of us expected which is encouraging him and clearly the the the more strength the owner can the sorts of rents that they will be prepared to pay for quality you know six star environmental style office accommodation in fremantle which will be cheaper than what they have to pay in this perth cbd quite considerably cheaper but more than than a maya will pay then you finish up stacking the economic viability of the project such that the owner is more able to carry the rents that that maya are seeking to pay in terms of the overall project the same goes for being able to incorporate the city's assets into that deal the the more high-paying rent componentry there is the more capacity there is for the owner of the ma building sirona to be able to come to an accommodation with maya that is commercially viable for both parties and that's their intention and the city's intention there's a couple of design questions that I'm going around asking people their views about there's a bit of public space out the front of the ma building that's marked with a blue triangle there um it's actually not by the city and so there's a question as to whether any buildings go across that particular site or not and we get differing views about that as we talk to people the second thing is newman court which is the public space formerly a road between queensgate meyer and the city admin building it's still a road gazette it as a road and uh questions of you know some people are suggesting traffic should be allowed to go back into that space other people are saying leave it 20 metres wide as it is others are saying narrow it down to about nine meters so that you create a real sense of hustle and bustle through that uh through that precinct so they're issues that we need to think about it's worth having a look at what um what the precinct was like in 1957. there were buildings right across that that site and the park was very much a triangle then the architects got hold of it in 1960s and we got that and it was a car park so now it's something know when we visit there so if you go back to what the heritage of it was then you start you know looking at whether it's possible to put some form of built form across in front of maya or whether it's not now again no decisions be made on that but they are some issues that are emerging as we talk our way through this project there are a range of other potential impacts clearly the king square public space that's owned by the anglican church are a number of representatives of the anglican church here today and we've been a very close and ongoing dialogue with the anglican church and will continue to because they are our neighbours in terms of this this project and they they they have a view and are entitled to a view about uh about what we're doing so we're actively engaging with them um but are there opportunities to jazz up or improve the public space that exists around saint john's church or is there not as part of this project are things that we of traffic movement around king square will inevitably arise um there's other future developments alongside queen the queen street front edge of queen square which is partly owned by the anglican church and partly owned by a private owner and we're in constant dialogue with them about what could or couldn't happen with with those sites there's also linkages down to south terrace that are going to be important these issues are going to be issues in my view that will arise from the king square project and and not issues that need to be sorted out before we solve we'll come to a conclusion about the king square project and I need to make that point there their follow-ons not pre-conditions to uh to the king square project but we need to start thinking about them if if the king square project looks like getting legs and there's a whole range of issues for wider fremantle which is seeking additional commercial and residential development the mayor's made no secret that that's that's the goal of the city it's all are part of the tools that are available to the city to try and achieve that you put a view that it's very important to fix the retail and community community amenity such as having a you know fully developed king square project up and running which will make it easier to attract tenants into fremont or commercial tenants retail tenants because at the end of the day that's what makes development projects viable you can build a building but if no one wants to occupy it at an economically viable rent then you don't finish up with the sort of outcomes you want it's the people in those buildings that matter it's the residents and it's the office workers is what drives the economic vitality and viability of of any city so in conclusion the project will be a major challenge for the city it's a big project it's got a lot of dollars it's an area that a lot of people I I'm sure and some research that I've seen shows that the residents of fremantle want in a way they want to see it develop remains to be seen but we will be engaging to try and ensure that as much as possible within the constraints of economies and finance and all the rest of it we're able to do the financing costs and economic certainty clearly are not helpful to us at this particular point in time there's a potential further gfc coming around the corner at us um if europe doesn't get itself sorted out so we've got to work our way through those those issues and they may affect the timing the city is obtaining professional independent advice to help guide its thinking and it's important it does so because it hasn't done a project like this before and it's very important that we assemble some people around us that architects financial advisors and so on that at the end of the day help us deliver the kind of outcome the people of city the people of fremantle want and deserve but if it does come off it's potentially transforming for the city and as same point the end of the day it's all about people and creating a sense of activity and vitality in the heart of fremantle thank you very much keep you here because I'm sure you've got some uh questions for david thank you very much to david shetler for that very very strong update on the challenges and progress of this vital fremantle project you just want to pop your hand up and um we do have a microphone but I think probably in this room you could probably hear your questions anyway yes please thank you um I guess uh delight is always in the eyes of the beholder john at the end of the day so what I might say to you is absolutely delightful as uh somebody else might not I mean I guess somebody thought queenscape was delightful at one day one stage or the mar building was delightful but um and and and and times change look this project will be very strongly driven by serena um the city will be making its assets available for serona to redevelop now the city to proposition put forward the proposition that in fact the city will insist in delight in the design because it is about the heart of its city and in the dialogue we've had with both saracens and now with sirona um one of the things we've said look if you want us you know if you want to come and do business with us one of the outcomes is going to be a very close attention to to urban design issues and building design issues and I can only say that we will and enduring my my dialogue with people I'm asking them what what they mean by delight and what will what what will what will make it delightful as I've said to a number of people around fremantle quoting you again john at the end of the day what we want to build now are buildings that the citizens of fremantle in 50 100 years time will will stand in front of the bulldozers to protect and I'm afraid the buildings that were built during the 60s and 70s uh I'd be over um um I'm I'm sure they will and they've asked the city what work it's done and the city has a as I understand it has a an economic model that enables us to look at the impacts of traffic flows around the place and I had some discussions with somebody the other day about that um I mentioned newman court in my in my address and I did acknowledge there were some that want to put the traffic back into newman court and heather's one of those um and has made her views very clear to me about that others have others though have different views about it um you know the question of the downsizing of maya you know I wasn't here and I've not had a long dialogue with with the senior management of maher about why it did because they weren't involved in those days either as you know mars has been sort of sold off from the old coles my group but bernie brooks the managing director of mars has met with us on a couple invitation of the mayor and he would be the first to concede that the mars store and did to us concede that the current my store is one of the worst in there in their folio of stores in australia and uh our task is to try and convince them to to get it out of from being the worst store and get be one of their modern new format stores uh increase the range I talk to a lot of people around fremantle that say yeah I'd go to my but I go there and never got what I want and of course that you know from my experience in retailing that's the worst sin that a retailer can can engage in and there's no doubt in my mind that myers had in mind for quite some time to close that store at the expiration of its lease in in in july 2012 no doubt about that that's why they've allowed it to run down now we've got them talking to us about what the city has in mind to try and lift worth their while rethinking that position whether we all succeed remains to be seen but as I mentioned during my address we are further down that track now than we were two or three months ago and if you'd asked me two or three months ago I would have said it's about a 20 chance of my staying if you ask me now I'd say it's probably about a 75 chance um but time will tell and matthew mcnealy was of serena capital was originally hoping to share this podium with me so you could have had a chance to talk to him direct but he got summonsed off to south korea for a um for a conference with his you know international equity fund partners so he wasn't able to be here but but um he will be very diligent knowing matthew in what he does in terms of traffic and in terms of design uh the city I think my personally and I think those that have been involved from the city are very impressed with their dealings with uh with matthew he the answer is yes I look the my building won't be knocked over um it'll be refurbished um it'll have uh mires on the ground floor and possibly the back into the basement um and first floor uh an office commercial office space above it with open you know opening windows and glass instead of that horrible white brick wall which you see we know that because we've got a development application that tells us that that's what they have in mind that as I said earlier that will go ahead irrespective of what the what the city's assets are used for in terms of the city's assets there have been a range of proposals you know part of the problem with queensgate is that the back it's actually two buildings and the back half of it if you like the nearest henderson street as opposed to the bit nearest king square has been used to cinemas and was purpose built for cinemas that means it's got sloping floors and there's not many office people that like working on sloping so there's likely to be a fair bit of bashing around have to go on there in order to turn that into office space which is what the intention is whether the whole of queensgate gets knocked over or doesn't will depend on the economics of it some of the earlier discussions um had it been knocked over which gave the opportunity to put underground car park down there and to align the footplate footprints with the maya building that's still an option um you don't have to knock over too much on the spicer site um and you know there's been a lot of discussion about what to do with that and nothing's been resolved with the spicer site whatsoever um as far as the city admin building is concerned um it's got asbestos in it I'm told um safe for the workers I'm told but nevertheless when it comes to demolition we'll have to um you know we'll have to go through those those processes but it's a it's a pretty inefficient ugly kind of I suspect if the economics stack up with the uses it'll probably get knocked over um I hope that answers your question like undecided finalization of oh it'll probably be um uh have to be done by the end of march this year next sorry next year I mean if it can't be and if the things delayed we'll have to talk to serena about extending the period of uh the mou and I've no doubt that if things are looking promising that will occur but it is a very tight time frame and again the reasons for the type time frame as I said earlier have been all around all around maya now if maya decides to to pull the plug on us then that may alter our capacities and their time to to to assess things but the redevelopment of the mar building is on a time frame they they have always hoped to redevelop that that part of the thing in in calendar 2012 started in 2012. so to align whether it's feasible to go down path a for the city of front timelines on it absolutely right one more question are you anyone else no all right well thank you very very much david for your time today and answering all those questions because as we mentioned um to have david as this year's final guest speaker was very appropriate because he was the very first speaker that we had the first of these leaders luncheons back in february john longley's uh book of guest speakers and trying to do this from the heart if any of you were at the um lunch sorry the breakfast that we held on thursday john said that the mayor is wouldn't allow him to actually read anything because they say if you're going to talk you talk if you're going to write you're right so I'll try and do this and try and be sincere firstly thank you very much david most informative um I think congratulations to brad and the city I really think that um you're doing a great job brad leading the city forward um there's some contentious and difficult issues that brad is pushing forward and actually making this happen and it's a brave and courageous thing that we're doing but I think it's one that we need to do I think we need more people in fremantle we need more people living in fremantle working in free mental and playing in fremantle it's a fantastic place to live I mean I just love it I've spent the whole weekend here enjoying the isaf festival and one of the great things that I think has happened just part of the festival is the reclaiming of baylor's beach I just it's just magic unbelievable you know this thing has been hidden um I've lived here six years never never been on bathurst beach before tried to get on it on friday night and had to queue to get on it's like what's going on it's just it's just a wonderful jewel um and as I say if nothing else comes up this isaf event we've actually reclaimed bathurst beach um and I would just like to say maybe city to actually come down via the high street because you know if we can actually encourage people to come down now past the roundhouse and then into the high street I think it's a it's a really good catalyst for that so I'd like to see if possible uh it to continue I mean it'd be great and again one of the things that I was saying today is fremantle is crying out for places that sensible normal human beings want to go and have a drink you know regard I don't you know as I say it's just fantastic I sit there and watch a sunset with a glass of beer and just think how good is this I don't want any more than that I basically just want somewhere that I can go uh that that isn't about actually going into a really big place with 200 people and I'm competing to get a beer and blah blah blah I just want to sit somewhere so again these licensing laws that I think brad's introduced into the fact that I can go as a european and sit and have a drink without actually anything to eat you know it's crazy the draconian laws we've got over here is just ridiculous you know we are all of us in this room you know adults you know I like to have a beer no no secret but so maybe again we can have a look at those licensing laws and and encourage people to drink sensibly but being able to drink when they want to do it um the chamber supports the uh amendment 49. uh we're wholeheartedly behind you brad my one question maybe is have we gone far enough that would be my my biggest concern if I put a developer's hat on and actually come into fremantle and I'm now competing against joondalup and I'm competing against sterling and I'm competing against all the other cities they've got the same mandate to increase population to increase density have we done enough or are we restricting development in fremantle by putting the restrictions on we're saying I'm round of applause bradford doing something but as I say just let's just make sure we push on be brave just keep going mate fantastic anyway that's enough for me that's from my heart and uh enjoy the rest of the day thank you
Hi I'm mayor Brad Pitt welcome to the second edition of from the council chambers one of the key items that was debated at council this week was the short-term lease of the j said unit one which overlooks Botha's beach we've got some great applications for how that could be used and activated over the coming six month and it was a bit of a tough decision for the council because we were there were so many but ultimately it was a group called six mo six months only who are going to look to activate that site was really great community activities and actually really enhance what we won't bei this to be which is a arts from cultural hub this dan Riley site next to the free mental hospital was one of the key items that we debated we're looking at using that site as temporary accommodation for the city of Fremantle while the King square project for this new Civic harder Fremantle is rebuilt for about two two and a half years one of the key considerations was around whether that terms of effective use of ratepayers money but the other really important part of that was that the 30-odd gentlemen who are there staying with some pets that they could be rehoused appropriately so we had a really good discussion on that and one of the key things is that those guys will be rehoused in and around the Fremantle area and different accommodation and that ultimately will go ahead and we'll use that site for temporary accommodation while the Civic Center is rebuilt thanks for watching from the council chambers for the full minutes of the council meeting please go to fremantle wa govt to a you forward slash and genders
Actually I must say the surf looked pretty good this morning but I thought maybe I should prepare this instead of going for a surf not like I get to do it very often anymore great to see so many of you here it's really exciting to see that there's so much interest in where fremantle is and where we're going and um I hope that today will be a really stimulating look at some of the things that we've been working on over the past few months and years this is really a tense as well for the city to start to respond to some of the key issues that um have been brought up by the previous leaders luncheons many of you would have been at david shetliff's early one in march on retailing in fremantle then leona and ray who in may talked about the drivers of the activity centre here in development here in this freemium cbd and of course most recently stuart hicks who gave the very interesting presentations on the rings that bind us and uh which is and of what I'll be presenting to you today because many ways this is a chance for us to respond give you an update as to where we're up to and also talk about where we go to from here there'll also be an announcement um of a new initiative towards the end so but I'll let you know that is when I get to it so as I said this is our chance for about re revitalizing fremantle how the city responds so just I just found the point that's gonna make things easier um I guess the background is one that you'll be all very familiar with for those of you who have heard myself and many others over the past few years to really talk about the fundamental challenges that the fremantle economy is facing and I don't want to paint simply a negative picture because I think it's actually much more diverse than that but there's no doubt been some significant trends and those broad trends I'd say have if they were to be left roll out't see change from the city and other players we would see fremantle two would continue to decline as a re as a regional center retail floor spaces you can see that there has been a 20 20 to 25 000 square meter drop in retail floor space over the last couple of decades um and there's been of course some major changes in poor industries that are in town and around storage and distribution and those kinds of things but there's some good new stuff as well I think we've really got a growing education sector growing in terms of fashion in terms of other forms of retail have have been thriving um entertainment and the like but there's a real concern I think from many including the city and the council that as an economic centre we were losing our status as a regional centre and ultimately losing our status as perth's second city so the council and myself when shortly after elected we got to work put together our strategic plan where they get with that core vision that we want fremantle economic significance and I think that's really underpins everything that we're doing and economic capacity absolutely key to that obviously um and um so a few kind of goals come out of that and this really links into broad estate planning as well directions 2031 the is the key document um that's in that has influenced a lot of our thinking and some of the targets that it's set um fremantle um wants to be a primary regional center as I said before the second city behind the city of perth and to do that we need to actually make sure that we get more people living and working and shopping and playing in fremantle in the cbd we're looking at 15 000 extra dwellings if you take the whole city of fremantle boundaries our population has been pretty stagnant kind of fluctuating between about 25 to 28 000 people over the last few decades um the the plan is by 2031 to increase that to about 35 000 people um and an extra I think the targets set by this document were three and said to state government actually we're going to beat that and our target is four and a half thousand new dwellings in in fremantle more retail floor space and more a great office space there's a real lack of quality office space within fremantle and we want to see that is actually going to be absolutely key about having quality jobs here as well as a great place to live underlying the strategic plan we had a whole great range of working groups I'm going to talk about two of those today and the first of those is the economic development strategy that came from the economic development working group and many of those members are here today and thanks again for the group that put in that extremely hard work to come up with a fantastic succinct doable plan that we're rolling out at the moment that really captures how we're going to change this city over the next 20 years as I said there's a decline over probably 20 years or more I actually think we're going to turn this city to see some pretty as you'll see today some pretty substantial changes rolling out but it is a process and um and and some of those things will take longer than others now apologies for those of you who've seen this before I must say I um I don't think I can barely watch this video again as much as as good as it is and linda who's here I saw linda before somewhere um it's a fantastic video and um but I think it's really useful especially for those of you who haven't seen it um and it is on our website and um to really capture where some of the thinking is on fremantle and some of the things that we've been doing so let me just see if I can make the technology work fremantle always has been per second city until recently we've had that sense sort of getting lost amongst a myriad of other activity centers and this is a fremantle's great opportunity to restate itself as per second city to build on that social and work shop all in one place we've got the great build heritage we need to make sure we bring our economic and social heritage as well we've got in this city four wonderfully dense intense activity centers they're the envy of every town and every city in australia one of them is of course the west end wonderful preserved 19th century port city equal of any in the world the second one is the port itself it is a moving viable economic generator of interest all the time and the waterfront victoria key can I think become much more part of the city we've got the entertainment and leisure football ground the espionage the fishing boat harbour an intense area of attraction day and night seven days a week and finally we've got our seafront from the south mole right through to south beach a wonderfully historic intense active part of west australia's coast the one of course that I haven't mentioned yet is the fifth activity circle which doesn't in my view work so well right now and that's of the city we have certainly a set of economic imperatives as far as the future of the city is concerned it's a quite narrow window of opportunity I think for us to turn some of the economic conditions in our central city around I suggest it's no more than about two years through which we need to move as a city to re-establish together the retail residential and commercial activities in our centre if that continues to fade away then the other four activity centres will in turn struggle because they will miss the wing that holds them all together brad pettit was elected mayor on a platform of green redevelopment and won with a significant majority in late 2009 new councils was elected about 20 months ago and with one of the key focuses was around economic development revitalizing the city not just as a tourist center but as a real place but doing certain way that really honors our past but embraces the future of fremantle as a vibrant economic center and for me that's what's really exciting and that is the absolute released its strategic plan with economic development as its key priority and proceeded to commission a retail model plan well first and foremost is there's a lack of people in fremantle particularly from a retail perspective that has to be fixed in three ways really one is to add some more office space and residential units within particularly the the central part of fremantle secondly there needs to be much better management marketing and coordination of the retail offer that's already here and thirdly there needs to be additional retail space put in to cope with increased people that finish up living here during the same period the city also commissioned a report into drivers of activity in the city centre the report revealed there's enormous goodwill and enthusiasm in the development community about doing business in fremantle unfortunately the report also revealed that over the last 20 years or so a perception has taken hold in the development community that fremantle is opposed to development and investment in the city at all costs being a fremantle ad from way back uh it was quite interesting because to perth what the study revealed was in fact it was very much losing that position and that is it still has many of the iconic things that you relate with fremantle in terms of the particularly the entertainment and the cultural components but where I suppose it was losing ground so to speak with things like the retail offer it doesn't have that full retail offer and you know the question is how long will it even sustain what it has now because one of the things we also did for fremantle was looking at office accommodation and the reality is is that there is only so much suburban office space that can happen so what you need to do is you need to make sure that you're competitive based on these reports the city adopted its economic development strategy in april this year one of the things that the strategy did was set some targets for city central which is hundred additional dwellings uh seventy thousand square meters of a grade commercial office accommodation and twenty thousand square meters of retail uh floor space in order in the city that are realistic that are commercially viable and also provide for those targets there are three ways the council is achieving these goals the first is through scheme amendments the east end scheme amendment was recently gazetted and is an example of the council's resolve the east end was previously zoned just three stories and we expect to see major new developments of five six seven eight stories happen throughout that area the scheme amendments are absolutely important we really haven't seen any major quality developments for fremantle for many decades actually because none of the right incentives have been there for the land owners so what we've gone through and said to landowners is we'll give you extra height extra bulk other development bonuses in exchange for getting new development and getting high quality new development in the city centre what we're going to be doing instead is taking this ugly parts freely 60s and 70s buildings that no one loves in fact most people hate from the maya building to the target building and the wool store shopping centre and stories which they're currently zoned up to five six seven to encourage quality new development so to get new new residents new office space new retail into those areas and actually and in that way revitalize fremantle as a primary regional centre the second way the council is revitalising the city centre is through developing council properties and working in partnership with landowners one of the things we're working really hard with the development industry on is developing our own properties to getting really good development plans up for our own property to try and increase that commercial space and retail space and residential space we own this building in queensgate we own the queensgate car park the spices site we own freehold the office site we own a 5000 square meter site over in point street we're talking to development industry about all of those sites about facilitating development and working with government to actually help us do that the third way is through bringing all the planning agencies together and creating a fremantle union there are other planning agencies in addition to the city who work with the port of course that we need to break down any semblance of a barbed wire between the port operation on the one hand and the city on the other we need to work with the planning department and the wapc because their powers and responsibilities in relation to the overall metropolitan region greatly affect how ours goes in the future and finally we need to work with the pta transperth department of transport because we have a railway station at our heart which is still in my view not recognized as much as it needs to be but it sits right now in a sea of bitumen and car parks and that provides the great challenge but also I think the great opportunity as we come together as a community and as the agencies work together to ensure that our central city progresses the way it needs to we are a regional city and we serve a catchment much greater than fremantle it is our intent to regain our status as a primary center and to once again be perth's second city when I went back going to come back to europe and live here and I guess what I kept saying to them is that fremantle has got so much potential to develop and I'm excited to be here to watch that the exciting thing is since I've been here we've had the election we've got a new mayor he's young he's for me what's really important he's in the field of sustainability and you can see his what he's trying to do to the city as well so I've been advocating that cities in general in australia really do need to increase increase their density but I guess the biggest thing that you come up against is people's fear of oh no density means high rise and it means you know 50 stories shanghai style and you know it can just mean five or six stories I think it can be really beautiful I mean that's what you see all through europe as well and you can start to incorporate little courtyards within those those areas and increase you know have more there have been a few key changes that have come about and I think that you know the time is right we should talk about when you know all the planets align I think that the planets are aligning to perhaps bring about some change the economic conditions in wa now are just perfect for fremantle to really jump in and take advantage of those benefits four agencies working together within a community that trusts and works with them we can move the city any place we want to take it so yeah so I think that provides a really hopefully a good summary of where the city is at and some of our thinking all right very good so um what I want to talk about now is some of the things that we have some of the initiatives that we have implemented and some of the progress that we've made again in response to some of those earlier latest luncheons you'd be aware that the east end scheme amendment so east ends when for those of you who came from the north when you drove over the east end basically from the chaos all the way down to princess may park now that scheme amendment which as I talked about in the in the video has been is now gazetted and we look forward to seeing the owners in that area convert their krs and the like into what's going to be a primarily residential area we expect to see two to three to three thousand more people living in that area above commercial uses on some of the ground floors so again a really exciting way of getting more people living and working and supporting the cbd of fremantle as well another key way and I think the city has shown some great leadership on on this and a really innovative approach is through the small dwellings scheme amendment where the first local government actually embed within our scheme a as of right approach to having data build a small dwelling on the back of your on the back of your house australia is extremely good at building very large houses with very few people in them and and that of course can't_''_1077.919 offers is much greater flexibility and getting again getting that diversity of population back within fremantle and we expect up to 5000 properties could be developed that way and you can see the population benefits as well as the affordability and diversity benefits of that point street that we've just updated our development guidelines for that for that precinct this is a council owned property where the point street car park is in the port cinema adjacent to princess may park and so so now that that process will be ready to go to the next stage in terms of going through a tendering process around landowners of that site so we'll we're seeing that progress and also a quite an innovative approach coming from an economic and development team around a really cooperative approach to marketing and I think this for me is I hope and I hope that you're starting to get a sense of this is about the way we want to be working as a city where we actually we're really working with key stakeholders like ourselves in a really cooperative around where we need to go and it's about working together to do that and and this is a really nice example of that and um there was the east coast advertising campaign that many of you might have heard about which had more than ten thousand entries around the find yourself in fremantle and uh that was drawn recently and we've got some very happy winners from from sydney I think who are going to be coming over and another quick 30 seconds you might not bench 140 kilos or have six all australian guernseys you might not even play football but you can always find yourself in fremantle stay in style shop in the west end fun at fishing boat harbour experience right in this island and take home a diamond necklace from creations win a holiday for four people worth over thirty thousand dollars find qantas business class to fremantle so head to find yourself and fremantle.com to enter and we'll see you here another thing that's a great a great way of promoting ourselves to the rest of australia and in a in addition to that we recently purchased back in june the visitor center which actually was privately owned until then and that's enabling us to properly embed that into the way we market the city it's open more dates can be open public holidays and on the weekends now and we'll start to be a proper visitor center which is really exciting for the for the city as well so and so we'll start to see that roll out and of course the maya application that was passed only a couple of weeks ago by the planning services committee and of a 30 30 million dollar revamp of that building and um which I think we well I know when that happens is going to be a really important catalyst for free development across the whole city so there are some of the things that have happened and I guess there's also a very a few other things that are in train and are equally important and as the video talked about quite well the fremantle union is probably the most important one of those in the city um including fremont reports and chris leda from fremantle ports is here um and along with the public transport authority along with department of planning and wapc department of transport and and of course the city all working together on those key projects that we can't do by ourselves because there's land some different departments on different bits of land and it's only through that cooperative approach working together that we can actually make this happen so so that's really exciting the um stuart hicks is also here and who you would have seen in the video and who gave the previous leaders luncheon and stewart's the independent chair of that and it's very exciting for us to have stewart involved in that process for those of you don't know stuart's heads up the east perth redevelopment authority and also the waterfront um this is the city of perth waterfront master planning for that area as well so stuart's expertise and the fact he's also a fremantle boy is also is really important so he'll be wilson from from the city of fremantle councillors and also the ceo graeme mckenzie along with graham pratley who's the chair of the wapc eric lumson who's the director of the director general department of planning reese wardock who's the director general of transport and as I said before chris leder who's the ceo of the of the fremantle port authority that'll be the board of the fremantle union and we are underway focusing on these this is stewart's term these big bangers these key projects that we need to get going again a stuart in the video talked about that railway station precinct and I think everyone agrees fantastic railway station the work that pta has done on that recently is stunning but it kind of sits by itself surrounded by lots of bitumen and it's a fantastic opportunity to really use that space and connect it with the city and use that redevelopment way of connecting the water connecting the port back in with cities but we were the center of the city so um that would be the first one an area really important to fremantle and I'll talk about this a bit more in a minute but which needs some comprehensive and major redevelopment around it so the community reference group is also going to be a group that we're going to be setting up that's going to sit alongside the union as a way of a a way of us bouncing ideas off our community so having key members from key fremantle groups businesses industry and and the like um will actually be a really important way of us engaging with with our community and in the longer term approach at the union will actually be to do the structure plan for the whole city and that of course includes some of the key things around transport around parking the million dollar question fremantle that I when we get more emails about than anything else and actually starting to starting to integrate all those into the broader planning that actually will complement some of the scheme amendments and the scheme amendment part two is now underway so this is the east end we've put now uh is now gazetted and and so we're focusing our energies on a second scheme amendment that in this area sits between the east end and the important west end now the west end certainly hasn't been forgotten we actually got a new working group that's got community members on it that's actually looking at better protecting the west end giving that state a state heritage listing and actually providing and updating some of the policies and protections around that because the city is very clear we're not trying to do major developments in heritage areas our hair is what makes us really special is the city and we don't need to do that I mean in many ways the irony is we've got a whole bunch of areas as we talked about in the video that look pretty shabby and pretty rundown and don't have any heritage value at all and they're the areas that that are actually where we have here which is the the city center the area outlined in front of you so the scheme amendment ones that are outlined there in pink and really around king square as the target building westgate mall coke and gas site um the coals building my building and and those kinds of sites all really capable of actually having some great new developments on them that really add to the city as a whole so and you get a sense there so look at looking across from the west end and to to the areas which we're going to be increasing the heights on those sites and I think this is the part of fremantle as stuart hicks said in the last ladies luncheon it's the pa it's the ring that's not working it's that part of fremantle that has so much potential but unfortunately at the moment just doesn't have the development incentives there to actually make it work and if we are going to get 70 000 extra square meters of a great office space an extra 20 000 square meters of of retail floor space and we are going to get several thousand more people living in fremantle in fact center of freeman at the moment and we want to quadruple that to making sure we have um far more people activating fremantle seven days a week not just on the weekends so in addition to some of the the base heights will be increasing um there will be also some be some discretionary heights on a couple of those sites and I think it's probably been a fair bit of press around how we're going to do that but I think this is actually important this is about getting key quality development outcomes and that's always been the fear in fremantle is that we've by always trying to obsess obsess around height we've almost often forgotten about the question pardon me about the question of how we get quality development so and this is um keith we've got a design advisory committee now the picture there of jeffrey london who's a victorian state government architect and who's the chair of that committee a very an independent committee of council that advises council making sure that developments are are of a high needs a tick from this independent committee it also need to make sure it doesn't impact on surrounding open spaces and of course it's got to make sure that actually provides very strong leadership in terms of environmentally sustainable design and we want this to be the heritage of this century of the 21st century that when in 100 years time when our grandkids look back on it and say isn't that a great precinct and that those buildings are still there not just so we want so building quality is absolutely key so you can get a sense here so this is the current building height limits um really in that um four stories with a fifth setback is and then the these are the the basic um that the scheme will increase um if it's out for advertising it it's about to go for advertising early october actually when the advertising officially starts it's part part currently with the department of environment and um then it will these are the base heights so it increases and then there's on top of met so I hope that's visible to you there and you get a real sense of how how that will work and I mean it is a very substantial increase in what we've previously planned but it's not high rise and I think it's vanessa nice to put in that video we're not talking perth stealing glass skyscrapers here we're talking a particular style now I'm just going to give you an example here I wanted to preface this by saying this is not a da that's currently before council this is something we're working with the architects and the owners eg property owned the bookstore site it's a huge site it's about 1.6 hectares 16 000 square meter site so it's a very important site about how we so we're doing some early preliminary work on that I just wanted to share some of that with you because it will give a bit of sense about some of the built form that we're thinking might emerge out of this so um the architects have really looks like and that's our model that idea that you have that that range of heights between six and nine stories maybe with little with smaller other bits jutting above it and and and that that roof scape it's still human scale it still has that but but actually but it also has great urban spaces around it as well and you can see so the preliminary design actually takes on some of those classic european forms across that whole block and actually with having piazzas within it as well as and different roof forms and those kinds of things it's a really modern interpretation of that as you go forward and you get a bit of a sense of of of how that might look there and and as I say this is just early ideas working with with the architects about how we do this but but it gives you a sense I think of some of the the way that we hope the this new kind of built form will play out in this new part of fremantle it's not going to be per cbd and it's not going to be like the west end it's actually going to have its own precinct with its own with its own form and I think that's a really exciting idea about how about how we start to do that there's a number of other sites just to give you a sense of the ones that that are part of this scheme amendment the coke and gas site the westgate mall the both the meyer and the queensgate building I think as as I go through these I get the sense that probably no one's gon no one's gonna be very sad to see fundamental changes to these sites I have had two emails of people who are sad that my building will change um but but only two I think there's probably not very many people and even our town hall center I think you know is is an area that I think um could do us some work and the spices sites the site next to the uh the fremantle markets um is again a car park be much better used so there's a bit of a snap of the scheme amendments um there's also been some very other very exciting work actually done by the economic development team around business improvement districts now this is an idea that um has come out of the economic development strategy and is a very exciting idea around for from that working group and again it's about that cooperative model about how we work with you actually handing back power handing back decision making to the key people in our community to say what do you want to invest in what's what's the what what kind of city do you want to make and how do you want to make sure those resources happen so and there's some fantastic examples from around the world from boston to to wimbledon dublin and others I actually looked at one in new york when I was there last year and again you actually really saw there how businesses got together and they said we want to make these improvements to our district this street's not working new lighting let's in fact in one in new york actually had had public toilets but with a with a with a gentleman who would greet you and you know and had fresh flowers in the public toilets because that was actually their way of saying that's what it needed to attract people into that area to shop that they knew that there was clean and usable public toilets in the area one of the most important and the biggest ones bids that is the one in the new west end company in london and what's amazing as you read all the the range of literature around bids is how the overwhelming evidence is how they've been a success story where you've actually got people coming back into town because it's the businesses who know what their shoppers want who know what they need and they're the ones who are making decisions around how the money is spent in their area so I mean and security and safety is a very big part of that and for example um 61 reduction in smash outcomes of of that new west end company london bid and 82 percent of shoppers believe the west end is cleaner 15 000 15 000 miles of pavement were washed 750 000 visitors assisted by red caps by people actually advising people around the district et cetera you get a real sense of how you can actually get some really positive outcomes and that's a very big bid in london but there's al but but the one in civic which is in the main centre of canberra also has a bid where they've again worked in partnership got the international film festival in their joint marketing initiatives as well and again seeing a really positive feedback from businesses in that area perhaps the most overwhelming and I want to read you one quote is around the british bids when they did a study of those where it said that the value and positive impact of bids is clearly recognized by business communities around the country and demonstrated in particular by a hundred percent success rate on the 16 renewal ballots today so 100 of those have actually we're actually um see fremantle's the first to do this in wa that I'm aware of in fact the uh simon o'brien the minister for finance actually gave me a call last week and said go I'm really interested in this can you send me some more information because I'd like to see how we can start to roll this out around other parts of the state so I think again a really a really great initiative and you can get a sense of there's a lot happening and I guess there's also a lot more to do so I wanted to share with you now around some of the key things that we will be focusing on over the next little while and one of these is I guess the big the announcement that I wanted to make today um and it is a very it's it's a big it it's a big project for the for the city um as I indicated earlier in uh when we're talking about the big bangers that we needed to square where king square I think everyone would agree is an imp very important part of fremantle and but one that really probably hasn't worked as well as it could have um and has that real sense of I think we've got in the habit of kind of putting a head down and running through it as we go somewhere else rather than actually be part of our square today I would like to announce that we will be planning to work with serona capital who are the new owners of the maya building to do a integrated king square precinct redevelopment and matthew mcnealy is here from serona and this because what that offers we could just do the maya redevelopment as you saw the pictures of it we could just do that and could sit by itself next to a pretty uninspiring queensgate building and a pretty uninspiring town hall centre and and car park and the like or we can actually take this opportunity where we're going to see a 30 million redevelopment there anyway to actually redevelop that whole precinct instead of them of them said to me he said we don't want to do this redevelopment and then just be a shiny new maya in kind of a drab precinct and that's totally fair enough and we don't want that either and this is actually an opportunity to have a shiny new maya in a shiny new precinct that actually has great much better facilities much better public spaces and the like so as the king square is absolutely central to our city and to our city's redevelopment and this new project and this new partnership will be absolutely key to make sure that happens successfully so the process around that oh this is just some quick snaps around king square's changed a lot mean in fact you've done if you can actually recognize it there actually used to be all buildings in that part of the triangle and and since john's church triangle was the only bit of parkland in the road um actually went through and then in the 1960s there was a very attractive car park whereas uh at the back of there's been many incarnations with that and look I want to be really clear we haven't made any decisions yet on what it's going to look like this is early stages and we'll be certainly engaging with you all about how you think king square can best be revitalized and but I think right now it's it's an okay part of town but it has so much potential and could be so much better so later this month an mou between serona capital and the city of fremantle will be coming to the council meeting on the 29th and um for full consideration assuming that council agrees to that mou then and that's signed then it will be a strong and robust committee engagement with each of you and our broader community around how we can best revitalize king square with the businesses around that area uh with with the broader residence with the broader businesses and industry and the like and then only after then we'll get to the planning and design issues assuming that all works we get a sense to the next stage to a heads of agreement after that so this is early early stages but um it's very exciting first step on a revitalization of that whole precinct I hope what you've got a sense of today is a lot's happened a lot's happening and there's a lot still to come um and there is a real sense of a lot of balls in the air and um and I think we're doing a pretty good job of making sure that they're all pr we're juggling them in a way that actually is really getting that sense of fremantle moving in the right direction I i don't think it is an exaggeration to say what we're proposing here is the biggest urban deal project in fremantle since the america's cup and I think it's time and I think um it is a really key time for us to do that and I think there is also a fantastic consensus in the community that we're at that point where we're kind of ready to how we do this together so I really appreciate your time today and for listening and I look forward to any questions that you might have oh okay yes I forgot this is uh andreas dick uh kindly said I should share this is all about brightening up fremantle so and female having a bright future and um this is a concept of some the lights that will be going in in the city centre before christmas this year so um thank you very much thank you very much um brad lots of exciting new concepts then I'm sure you've got lots of questions with probably limited time to ask now if you just want to ask a question put your hand up and we've got a portable microphone here courtesy of brian smith from the chamber so pop your hand up brian will come over to you just identify yourself and ask away okay who's going to be first don't be shy because this is what always happens with 30 seconds to go we get 100 hands up who's going to be first with everything that brad's got to say okay here we go I better kick things off I think um yes on behalf of the church which which is a key player in the center of king square and so on um we've uh sort of sat and watched this process for for uh for many years what sort of um what sort of time frame were we working on for some of these uh some of these property developments because the church owns bits of queen street and so on and we're we're sitting there wondering what sort of time frame we should be letting out for it's very good questions the question well with with the joint project around king square the mou that I understand is going to be coming to council will be for a nine month process around the planning and consultation and and those kinds of things um so which will take us to the 31st of june um 30 30 june uh next next year ultimately maya if I mean I must say the stories on maya are probably these things until I see them sign on on the dotted line but I mean it is certainly encouraging and the conversation with my have been very encouraging but I would probably say that there's not 100 locked away yet um but but for but for my uh obviously aren't going to don't want to stay in a building in its current form um and and we don't want them to stay in the building in that form either and and serona capital don't want to see that building statements form either so that that development is going to happen that da has been signed off um you'd think in the next year or two so um we would love and the church is a really important property owner on queen street along with with with a couple of other owners and that is a key that's a key precinct I mean in many ways that that queen street precinct the way that links the king square down to the train station and we actually have to absolutely have to get queen street is going to be the retail heart of fremantle where where the new offices are where the new retail is where many more people will be living so uh making sure that the church is part of that and we can get some redevelopment on that precinct we're absolutely absolutely fantastic and I know that david shetliff who still who gave the first ladies lunch and is now employed as a consultant by the city has been talking with you with with you around how we start to do an integrative redevelopment there as well hey brad jarrett brian I'm just a little concerned about the staging the process I think we have to make sure before we build the retail that we've got the residential up and running there's a lot of studies are out if we produce more than two square meters or 2.2 square meters per head of population of retail space then we know that all we're going to do is have second rate retail and again close it won't make the turnover the occupancy cost will exceed it I to make sure that we do the residential first and get this 28 000 people up to 35 000 then you will drive the retail I think if we do it the other way we're doomed to have very secondary ordinary results and then we're going to get a very bad name can you tell me how you're going to stage it and can you tell me how you're going to ensure that we've got the people here before we get the second stage because that's that that's the real key to it that's a good point and I think that's why we did the east end first because east end is primarily residential so that enables the developers who own those properties and unfortunately we've got a global financial climate that's not really conducive to people putting huge amounts of money into developments at the moment which of course is a bit of it's a bit challenging so it makes staging all that more difficult but we'd certainly like to see that east end happen straight one I showed you are prime look they're primarily residential I mean they've got large components of retail in them on the ground floor but we're talking when you're talking a nine story development which is what that is you've actually got a huge scope for a residential above it and we're actually mean so I guess I'd answer your question partly by saying this is all going to be happening simultaneously because these developments are multi-layered so they retail on the ground floor and they may be office above or and of course office workers are equally important in fact you could argue more important to retail because they actually got people with money working in town using their lunch time to go out and shop but it's not going to have office above they're going to have retail above so many ways they're going to be happening in parallel but the staging is very important and car parking is actually a key part of that staging what we don't want to see is us point street will skate car park all of a sudden no one can actually get into fremantle anymore and I'm sure you for those of you drove here today parking itself was enough of a challenge without making it too much worse so one the other things we are doing we're just setting up a new working group that's actually going to be looking at where we mean from a sustainability perspective I mean someone who's never been a fan of building new car parks but we are going to need a new car park and fremantle and that's one of the key things that we are going to be doing is actually making sure that's in the right location um and actually we got a strong legible parking regime in fremantle and so that's going to be another key part of the staging gary hayden from elixir marketing um is there any chance that any of the new buildings can be built in the traditional victorian or edwardian style or would that be cost prohibitive well it may be cost prohibitive but I'd also do that because I i think the danger is you actually devalue your I mean we have got such a fantastic heritage precinct in the west end and and and we don't need to do some poor imitation of that um as as in part of a new part of fremantle but what I actually hope we get is innovative contemporary architecture so you've got a very clear different precinct that reads differently I mean and I always hate going to places where where you feel like where did the old part end and the new path start and you can't quite read it I actually want to be in a place where I understand the history and understand the layers of the city and understand that there are different precincts with a different feeling now ultimately we don't get to decide what people desire we put in height limits and we put in other other kinds of planning constraints and uses and those kinds of things the kind of architecture that comes to us will be ultimately down to the owners of those buildings but that I would be encouraging in in this area um shirley coucher information enterprises um I was just wondering you talked about the east end and you've talked about cbd in the west end what about the part from ord street to perry street on high street there's still a two story limit there and whilst there has been some approval just on the parry level and there's some really ugly 70s buildings in that area yeah um look there will certainly be I guess what we tried to do and I think many ways while we one of the reasons I think fremantle hasn't managed to actually do a scheme amendment like this before this is the first major scheme amendment that I'm aware of in in fremantle's history is in the past we've always tried to bite off too much and they end up getting bogged down in a whole bunch of small ones so we were quite clear about picking the strategic sites at the heart of the city that doesn't mean that down the track and once this underway that we won't look at other scheme amendments in other parts of the city um and I think that we need to be seen on a case-by-case basis and in fact that part of high street obviously is an entry to the city and I think it has some real potential but I think it's important that we we make sure we don't get bogged down and trying to do too much at once and then ultimately having nothing happen and that's why we've done it the way we have um john tedesco rotten stalin authority and thanks very much brad for excellent presentation really really appreciate that a lot of this development is going to require um matching um streetscaping from from the city to what extent is the the city willing to devote you know redirect the resources and priority to streetscaping because it's it's not just having all these wonderful buildings and developments of the streetscaping is not going to match it yeah now it's a very very good question and a worthwhile comment and I think for tried to come down queen victoria street where the east end is we're actually trying we've got a clear plan to actually see those street great streetscapes upgraded so we started with queen victoria street in the east end and at the moment you'll see that these new street trees we've got a major redevelopment of that whole street in terms of streetscaping because it's the the public spaces really matter there's no point having some fantastic new buildings if you don't have high quality public spaces in fact last night the planning services committee also looked at the percent for art scheme which would be something else that we're doing here in fremantle where new developments will be us to contribute towards high quality public art within there which is I think quite a common thing around councils now across australia too because that's absolutely again I mean I guess my vision for this city is I want it to be where people want to come out on the street where I mean there's not no good simply having we actually this is about vitalizing the streets of fremantle getting people back out and about and you need high quality public spaces to do that so we'll absolutely absolutely be investing in those uh brad john longley from the perth 2011 world sailing championships brad congratulations it's just the most fantastic uh having me involved with the framework chamber of commerce and have been through all those dark years it's so wonderful to see this great light coming over the horizon uh brad and I want to be negative how the heck are we going to sell we I say that we we are we going to sell this and if we take a single example of the sea lanes development that was squashed in those dark times a wonderful development you know four to six uh there it was all went through council all the approvals were what were happened yet a small very small vocal minority of people who wanted to try and get themselves a future political career leapt up and stopped that and today we still have run down warehouses in that of leadership how do you get the vast majority of people who are with you and you heard the applause as soon as I said congratulations how do you take them with you because we've got to make it happen mate because if it doesn't happen this time then we might as well all quit yeah I'm not a quitter and as stuart hicks said and I think I've heard eric lumson said as well you know we've got around about two years to make to get a lot of these things in place and I think we do I actually think there's been a fundamental change um over the last few years around attitudes and fremantle around not everybody there's always going to be a very vocal and very loud minority who don't want to see a change and I hear from them regularly but but I do think amongst the broad population there is a fundamental sense that we need to change and I think there's a couple of things that I think we need to do well and clear we're not going to be bulldozing heritage buildings that's off that's a long time ago off the agenda and it's not there's no one's contesting that anymore so we're going to keep our heritage places and we're going to focus our redevelopments on areas that look awful and I run down and a crap and it's pretty hard to argue saying why don't why wouldn't you redevelop a crap area the question of height is a fundamental issue in fremantle and I know people get really nervous around it I again I think we've got that balance right look nine stories is it's a lot bigger than anything we've done before it's twice as high um but again it's about quality and I think if you can actually make the conversation much more about quality much more about a vision around that european scale and we're not talking about that kind of ugly glass and steel high-rise this is actually about the kind of density we need for a sustainable city going me of one of my favorite things is that he says for every unit you build here is one less house you need to bulldoze out on the margins and for perth as one of the most sprawled unsustainable cities on the planet we need to do this and the reality is I actually think there's a growing awareness that it's an opportunity that's not only right for fremantle it's right for the state and it's actually a responsible thing to do and it's going to make us a diverse and vibrant community and I actually think people get that now and I think that message is not a hard one to sell and I think while you won't convince everybody I don't think we have to I just think we've got to move forward thank you very very much brad and also thanks to brian for our movable microphone and thank you everyone too for being such an attentive uh audience and guests and now for the last word today um that goes to tim wilson the acting chief executive'm just going to duck and I promised brian I'd do something I forgot to do there's a for the election there's a candidates meeting coming up on thursday the 7th thursday at seven p.m thursday thursday the 29th at 7 pm so for those of you who because the kind of council we get obviously makes my life a whole lot easier in

Fremantle always has been per second city until recently met that said sort of getting lost amongst a myriad of other activity centers and this is a free metals great opportunity to restate a self as per second city to build on that social and economic heritage of a place where you can live and work shop all in one place we've got the great build heritage we need to make sure we bring our economic and suddenly you're into this as well we've got in this city for wonderful intense intense activity centers they're the envy of every town and every city in australia one of them is of course the West End wonderful preserved 19th century port city vehicle of any in the world the second one is the port itself it is a moving viable economic generator of interest all the time and the waterfront Victoria ki can I think become much more part of the city we've got the entertainment and leisure centres see a cappuccino extra football ground yes Bernard for the fishing boat harbour an intense area of attraction've got our sea front from the South mole right through to South Beach a wonderfully historic intense active part of Western coastal the one of course that I haven't mentioned yet is the fifth activity ascetical which doesn't in my view works so well right now and that's our central city the cvd the retail commercial residential center of the city we have certainly a set of economic imperatives as far as the future of the city is concerned it's a quite narrow window of opportunity I think for us to turn some of the economic conditions in our central city around I suggest is no more than about two years through which we need to move as a city to reestablish together the retail residential and commercial activities in our Center if that continues to fade away then the other four activity centers will in turn struggle because they will miss the ring the poles Brad Pettitte was elected mayor on a platform of green redevelopment and one with a significant majority in Lake 2009 new councillors it was elected about 20 months ago revitalizing the city not just as a tourist center but as there as a real place but doing so in a way that really honors our past but embraces the future of Fremantle as a vibrant economic center and that's me that's what's really exciting in that is the absolute focus of this council within six months a new console released its strategic plan with economic development as its key priority and proceeded to commission a retail model plan well first and foremost is there's a lack of people in Fremantle particularly from a retail perspective that has to be fixed in three ways really one is to add some more office space and residential units within particularly the central part of Fremantle secondly there needs to be much better management marketing and coordination of the retail offer that's already here and thirdly there needs to be additional retail space put in to cope with increased people that finish up living here during the same period the city also commissioned a report into drivers of activity in the city centre the report revealed there's business in Fremantle unfortunately report also revealed that over the last 20 years or so a perception has taken hold in the development community that Fremantle is opposed to development and investment in the city at all costs being a Fremantle lad from way back it was quite interesting because Fremantle had always been thought of as that second CBD to prove what the study revealed was in fact it was very much losing that position and that is it still has many of the iconic things that you relate with Fremantle in terms of the rigidly the entertainment to the cultural components but where I suppose it was losing ground so to speak was things like the retail offer it doesn't have that full retail offer and you know the question is how long will it even sustain what it has now is one of the things we also did fall fremantle was looking at office accommodation and the reality is is that there is only so much suburban office space that can happen so what you need to do is you need to make sure that you economic development strategy in April this year one of the things that the strategy did was set some targets for City Central which is 1,500 additional dwellings 70,000 square meters of a great commercial office accommodation and twenty thousand square meters of retail floor space in order to achieve those targets we need to identify height limits in the city that are realistic that are commercially viable and also provide for those targets there are three ways the council is achieving these goals the first is through scheme amendments the East End scheme amendment was recently gazetted and is an example of the council's resolve the East End was previously zone just three stories and respect to C major new developments of five six seven eight stories happen throughout that area the scheme amendments are really important we really haven't seen any major quality developments of fremantle for many decades actually because none of the right incentives have been there for the landowners so what we've gone through and said to landowners is but we'll give you extra height extra bulk other development bonuses in exchange in the city centre what we're going to be doing is ted is taking this ugly pass freely 60s and 70s buildings that no one loves in fact most people hate from the mire building to the target building in the wall store shopping center and actually getting those redeveloped rezoning those from two to four stories which they're currently zoned up to five six seven to encourage quality new development through to get new new residents new office space new retail into those areas and actually in that way revitalize Fremantle as a primary regional center the second way the council is revitalizing the city centre is through developing council properties and working in partnership with landowners one of the things we're working really hard with the development industry on is developing our own property stupid getting really good development plans up to our own property to try and increase that commercial space and retail space and residential space we own this building queensgate we own the Queen's Gate carpark the spices site we own freehold the office site we own a 5,000 square meter industry about all those sites about facilitating development and working with government to actually help us do that the third way is through bringing all the planning agencies together and creating a Fremantle Union there are other planning agencies in addition to the city who we need to work with very closely we need to work with the port of course that we need to break down any semblance of a barbed wire between the port operation on the one hand and the city on the other we need to work with the planning department in the WA PC because their powers and responsibilities in relation to the overall metropolitan region greatly affect how else goes in the future and finally we need to work with the PTA transfer the Department of Transport because we have a railway station at our heart which is still in my view not recognized as much as it needs to be but it's it's right now in a sea of vichlen and car parks and that provides the great challenge but also I think the great opportunity as we come together as our central city progresses the way it needs to we are a regional city and we serve a catchment much greater than Fremantle it is our intent to regain our status as a primary center and to once again be perks second city when I went back some of my friends are saying are you going to come back to Europe and live here and I guess what I kept saying to them is that Fremantle has got so much potential to develop and I'm excited to be here to watch that the exciting thing is since I've been here we've had the election we've got a new man he's young he's met what's really important is in the field of sustainability and you can see his what he's trying to do to the city as well so I've been advocating that cities in general in Australia really do need to increase increase their density but I guess the biggest thing that you come up against is people's fear of honor density means high rise and it means you know five or six stories I think it's can be really beautiful I mean that's what you see all through Europe as porn and you can start to incorporate little courtyards within those those areas and increase you know have more public space the most exciting thing about it is that they're there have been a few key changes that have come about and I think that you know the time is right we'll talk about when you know all the planets align I think that the planets are aligning two packs bring about some change the economic conditions in w way now are just perfect for Fremantle to really jump in and take advantage of those benefits for agencies working together within a community that trusts and works with them we can move the city any place we want to take you
Hi I'm Brad Pettitte me here at sea a Fremantle today I wanted to give you a quick summary of some of the decisions that we made it in November council meeting one of the key issues that we debated as part of the planning part of the agenda was around 52 adelaide street which is where the old spotlight is so there's a planning application that was put forth at that was refused by the development assessment pedal the DA p because it already been infused the council just noted that refusal but we also are aware that there is some modify plans and that will be submitted to the council that are more compliant than than the previous one so we may see that development proceed in coming months the beaconsfield redevelopment area what we're calling bakersfield west this is a big story opportunity we've got the department decided so now the housing authority land which exists next to bruce lee oval the three-minute eighth the school site and the 40 quarry site I have an opportunity to be part of a joint redevelopment housing authority to take their area of that land and to make that a development area development zone so we can plan with the community over the over future years and the key part of this now is exact to engage with the beaconsfield community and the broader Fremantle community to how we want to see that area redeveloped the king square project which of course now is moving ahead very very quickly because of the state government has committed to bring 1,500 workers down into what were the Maya buildings and the Queen's get cinema buildings they will be redeveloped that's 20,000 square metres of new office space plus new retail one of the key things we discussed was around actually seeing that the Civic part of this project we're behind the Town Hall the new library and and visitor center and council offices where we will be redeveloped at the same time so we hope that all of this development will be completed by the last quarter of 2019 another key issue that we debated was bus to the Fun Bus unfortunately the state government from the 31st to December of this year the good news that that was announced at the council meeting was that that funding now has been extended all the way through to the 31st of March and what we hope we can now achieve through that is a reasonably seamless extension of that service so we're going to go to state government now and under the new providers of all of that service so they can actually see that continue because we think it's a really important service that should continue in fremantle and to continue to be funded by the state government the fremantle town hall restoration what was discussed key to this project is has been around taking off some of the damaging acrylic paints that were stopping the building breathing and actually for the very first time actually bringing back to the building to the original fabric that will help with design so it could breathe in doing so we've uncovered some unexpected outcomes one of those actually was that some major cracks were unveiled probably going back to the mac earthquake in the tower and that unfortunately may delay the project a bit as we need to basically expand the budget and expand the works around that but this is a project worth doing initially the first time that that clock tower has actually been had substantial restoration worked on it in its history from when the town he'll always built way back in 1887 so it could be a few more months yet but it's the project absolutely worth doing thanks for watching from the council chambers for more information please check the free city of free mobile web site at fremantle wa govt a you forge agendas for any extra information you might like
Brad what I'm not too interested in getting involved in there's four piece yeah um certainly a long sense of that we need to do something about it so many ways it's one of those issues where I know people are passionate about it but it's often not top of mind perhaps a real changing moment for me was when I got to visit roschmann recently and and certainly seeing firsthand impacts in the devastation of nuclear weapons I think has really driven driven at home for me the importance of what me estas around Matt Fremantle is joining quite a few initiatives in trying to get rid of nuclear weapons are we on the cutting edge of change given that a lot more people are taking an interest in nuclear wealthiest now I think there is a renewed interest in this and there is any renewed sense of urgency in terms of when you got the doomsday clock at three minutes to midnight there is a real sense of that we shouldn't no longer be complacent about the proliferation of nuclear weapons actually needs it's great to see that there's a really strong interest in here in Western Australia with a number of councils getting behind it and made the masterpiece and and and furthering these international connections on that path the gift to the city of Nagasaki the Peace Park why have councils joined to to make this contribution so this gift to Nagasaki which of course was devastated in at the end of World War World War 2 by by nuclear weapons is a really important step link between Australian mayor's with these cities and Nagasaki and it's a real gift from from Australia genetic it was a way of raising awareness around this that we shouldn't ever allow these kinds of things ever happen again and making that connection because many ways Australia feels a long way from it but actually we're not as far from it as we think and this is the key also linked as part of this is the mesophase councils joining with Aboriginal communities who are impacted by nuclear weapons as well for nuclear test so what's your message in mezcla peace um our message is that we're really proud to be part of a global movement that is pushing towards the elimination of nuclear weapons now's the time where we really need to do this and we hope that over the coming I mean this gift and then over actions going for we really see much more emphasis on this in global action and is there anything we haven't covered it like to say you
In the past few years we've had half a billion dollars of new investment come into Fremantle which is either already under construction or recently completed we've got another half a billion dollars that's already planning approved this is going to see an amazing array of new residential hospitality and commercial spaces that were really enhanced through the 250 million dollar King square cultural precinct is a great example of our approach to development it's about creating the heritage of the future and creating a new civic heart for our city to be the biggest development ever undertaken blow a Fremantle council and one of the biggest in in Fremantle's history
 criminals transformation is well underway the next wave of opportunities promote our of state importance now boost jobs create new tourism opportunities and actually see our underutilized spaces prop the use in activate criminal pressing is one of these it's going to take a like a tight area and turn it into a community and sporting precinct right here setra free you
Haha just from listening to the community there was concern that essence of fremantle may be lost but at the same time they understand that Fremantle needs to grow because if it doesn't grow and become economically viable could be lost the challenge for Fremantle is to actually retain those really good bids part of our drive in our strategy and our thinking is to get a really strong commercial sector back in the city to make sure the retail services that that sector and pop and the local population as well as the tourist sector of course and the tourism sector is no bigger anywhere in WA than it is in free now it's a fine line of how you how you mix the old with the new Fremantle has the challenge of how do you keep those sorts of diverse businesses and attract them if you want some more of the creative arts the creative businesses you've got to have low rents you've got to have you allow them to build up its diversity has always been free metals been about the city has the economic strength of the city and through economic development business development in the city but also urban infill land like this just east of our city is a perfect opportunity to create that urban infill to create a population that supports the economic activity in the city centre and we've just put out a scheme amendment which could potentially see well over 2,000 people in an area just just a very fringe we've also set ourselves the target of having in the next five years least five new major development sites either build around away within close proximity within walking distance or bike riding distance comfortable by riding distance of the city to make I guess to actually provide the retail sector the turnover that it needs key city center strategic sites committee now that that group is looking to identify sites that are ready for redevelopment realistically probably could be redeveloped engaging the owners of all of those sites and looking at potential development densities and uses the main planning challenge is how to accommodate growth in existing built form and with the existing community expectations everything comes down to that Fremantle grew up as a working port soon very quickly became a regional center has been a regional center ever since and as far as this community is concerned as councils concerned it will always be a regional center it will be other evolving industries in Freeman we partake in part of our strategy stakes you review that and see if we can actually facilitate or help that along in the suburban areas it again same issues about accommodating growth within community expectations of answers from Nancy and lifestyle and count practical usable spaces that blend in with what we've got I don't see that we should be a heritage village and nothing else I would like to see how we sympathetically do that with good quality architecture and spacers working for there's no one else has and we have a victorian edwardian town center but extra beach and working harder the waterfront is such a great attractor to Australians and Fremantle's blessed with both ocean and river water fronts and that that just provide an atmosphere and an attraction that not too many other places can buy
30 is one of those places that just gets under your skin it's such a special sense of community diverse it's inclusive it's got soul it's quite history and it's a place where you can live and work and play all in one place criminals transformation as one of the world's most vibrant livable cities as well underway at the heart of this is having more people with living and working in visiting Fremantle but also as this transformation happens it's really important we don't lose what makes Fremantle so special which is its community its arts and culture known as history and heritage in the past few years we've had half a billion dollars of new investment come into Fremantle which is either already under construction or recently completed we've got another half a billion dollars that's already planning approved this is going to see an amazing array of new residential hospitality and commercial spaces that were really enhanced for the 250 million dollar gene square cultural precinct is a great example of our approach to development creating a new civic heart for our city to be the biggest development ever undertaken by a Fremantle Council and one of the biggest in in Fremantle's history the next waiver opportunities promote our of state importance now boost jobs create new tourism opportunities and actually see our underutilized spaces proper use and activated freeman over pressing is one of these it's going to take up ok tired area and turning into a community and supporting precinct right here central 30 this year free man was Bodie is one of the top ten cities in the world of visible alien planet unfortunately though for 150,000 cruise ship passengers got off their first regression wa was actually some pre-tied car parks and old industrial buildings are not on the wharf our vision for South key is to open it up as a tourism and commercial pressing that links a passenger terminal back to the heart of fremantle this development would return nine hundred forty million dollars to the state government and create thousands of jobs over the next 20 years wa has a new airport and a new river compete the picture is a world-class ocean entry point personally I think it's the water I mean the beaches are pristine a sunset epic cultures rampant weird it's wonderful maybe that's one of the reasons for your punches so much about its weight as a city Fremantle is a wonderfully unique part of the world and it's come a really long way in recent years and there's some really great opportunities before us but to realize those and that vision it's going to be about collaboration and working together for the benefit of all West Australians
What is often overlooked is that the state government itself is a major employer in Western Australia if you look across 100 different agencies is close to 140,000 people employed directly by the state government and its various entities that means that the state government itself is a major participant in the property market both in government owned buildings old and new and also in leasing from the private sector there's a lot of debate about where public servants work and state government has had an ongoing program or try to decentralize jobs out of the central city of area in Perth also looking at trying to amalgamate agencies into single site or civil agencies into a common building that's got obvious advantages and also in many cases just improving the quality of accommodation our security issues like that some recent decisions that are already now in play first the relocation of the Department of Parks and Wildlife's to Bunbury that was the first government department to be relocated out of the metropolitan area the country area has its headquarters that is now into construction initially 100 department is headquartered this the second major projects are seen in joondalup that was announced about two months ago with the environmental and water agencies relocating to joondalup about 800 jobs going out of the sin city area to the laws and suburbs and I'm delighted today to announce some major project a fitting a major project affecting Fremantle directly most made the comment about Fremantle prior to the Second World War Fremantle was the major commercial district for Western Australia it was more important as a trading commercial area for a whole number of reasons Fremantle is probably not kept pace and even defined in some respects a lot of manufacturing industry that used to be in Fremantle is no longer here the numbers of people employed on no we knew what it used to be all those years ago the closure of the meijer store had a big impact and there's no doubt the Fremantle beautiful location full of historic buildings has languished so it seems an obvious location for a redeployment for government office accommodation and the sauce that goes with space government has reached the central area of Fremantle underpinning that is the relocation of three public sector agencies the Department of Housing will now be headquartered in Fremantle corrective services will also be headquartered here and in addition staff from transport also be located in this new building to be constructed in a total in total 1,500 public sector jobs will come in to free man that's a huge boost to the working population of the city of Fremantle's construction itself means jobs within the 1,500 permanent jobs will boost the whole retail ambience housing and development of Fremantle so I hope this is a a great day for the city of Fremantle the project will get underway in terms of structured next year and should be completed by 2020 this is a very significant day for premium and I don't think we'll go skating to say this is probably terms of the investment in fremantle economic 50 and also have called probably the most significant aces who won America's Cup I think I could honestly say that we're there there's actually as the premier certainly and we are I think seeing a new wave of investments what this office workers coming to Fremantle do actually sees I think a real catalyst in terms of more investment in Fremantle actually returning Fremantle was a seven-day week economy and actually as per second city that's what we want to be actually want to be a real economic hub of a place where people can live and visit and then work in Fremantle seven days a week and did this project is absolutely essential for that so do one of both things premier and the government I mean it's a Henley a real vote of confidence I think in we're free men who is going and I do think that it is a really important investment in fremantle future I also want to thank Serena this has been a process where it has required patience and collaboration and working together and what's been really exciting that this is that there is a real collaboration where we're not going to just is not just about 1500 you office workers is there so I've the heart of our city probably giving free medal for the first time a really proper heart and trust that really exciting project so we're really excited and looking forward to welcoming those workers from all across earth to come and work in Fremantle it's a great place to work and I think it's going to be a fantastic addition to the city so this is a very very significant day for us but the hard work starts from here in terms of delivering this project but I think we'll look back on an eye on today and say this is a real milestone in a positive human
That's absolutely right in fact that is captured in the in the visioning document and and um and one that actually is also captured in our integrated transport strategy because one what's really going to be important here is that new traffic bridge should also have a dedicated rail bridge as well which will rot which will which will ultimately run one of the passenger lines or one of the freight lines now that's right this one here is the old bridge and the truth of the matter is I'll probably have to take a section out of the middle here because they can get vessels through that they're currently so it'll be ever but our view is they should retain as much of that as possible and then there'll be a new traffic bridge which the state government doesn't work on which will be both traffic and rail um now that reason that's important is because this comes links to the port the port is growing very rapidly we're at 700 000 containers come out of the port a containers within a few years now you can either try and get all those in and out and truck which is a disaster for people who live on those roads and from all of us or we can get more on rail and the problem at the moment is that rail has to happen mostly at night because they can't squeeze them through the passenger trains because they're sharing a track so they actually need a dedicated freight rail line so they can run those trains during the day and actually get more containers out of the port by rail which is good for everybody so absolutely support that and that certainly is certainly capturing the detail on our integrated transport strategy and one that we're lobbying hard for we have some major concerns at the perth freight link well there's how long have you got I won't get a stock on this but the council has some major concerns about I mean from billy wetlands through to the fact that it just stops before canning highway sees a freeway just arrives at canning highway which of course is just going to shift a traffic jam from one area to another but perhaps our longest term concern is that there's a danger that it becomes a fremantle bypass and that's actually at the and this is actually wired to come back to your bridge why your bridge is really important is that what we want is actually not a doubling of the sterling bridge but an upgrade to the fremantle traffic bridge because that will get more people come into fremantle and that's actually at the heart of what what this is about and the danger of the freight link is that it will just simply create a huge bypass that will encourage funnel people around fremantle further damaging the city economically yeah it's a good question and we that work has been done at the moment in fact we're just going through the process of doing a new economic development strategy that's going to sit under this um which will tease out some of that detail but I guess at the heart of that is to say that so that should have a range of office workers so this is actually and the reason we think a government department's important not because it's bringing government workers down per se but because that catalyzes a whole bunch of private sector people to really to follow on the back of that and actually start start to activate those areas but there's no doubt freeman's already got its strengths you know if you look at things from design to architecture to media there's a whole range of strengths that we that we have got um which I think we need to build on because I think you know it's a really overused and I and I'd say there's a whole around creative class people wanting wanting to be in interesting areas fremantle has those ingredients and I think it is that creative class that we do attract already but I think we can even do a better job of actually attracting more and so that's probably where I see us going alongside that inevitably there's going to be a major jump say gram amount of applications for hotels that have come across our desks in the last year have I mean I mean I just think they can't all be built there's just too many I mean so there's a there's a huge push for tourism in in fremantle and associated industries look that's going to be an important part of it my passion is to make sure we don't just end up as a tourist town but we end up as much more than that so that's actually why we actually attracting real jobs and real people seven days a week so and would love to have your involvement in the economic development strategy as we start to roll it out yeah so just want to have one thing that you talk about 2029 the aging population is a really significant factor here and the opportunities in health particularly now that the fremantle hospital is is changing its purpose um the opportunities for a future uh really strong economy around health particularly age related health and which is where the fremont hospital is a great opportunity to become a really specialist medical center town attached to the notre dame university are in fact lots of pillars to the economic opportunities for fremont I think we just we need to be smart about where we put our energies but the opportunities are boundless really but health is a really big one I think it's really important one look I think I think it's a fair point and I think and that's an interesting was interesting outcome of the visioning actually is that of all the people who came along the overwhelming passion was for the fremantle cbd and the changes they wanted to make there it means that we didn't push out in any direction as you're quite right we didn't say you've got to focus on the suburbs so you've got to focus on the center we left it to those who are involved and people are passionate about fremantle and its centre as they should be because I think to be honest with you it's a it's it needs it needs some what in response to you are we just doing this for businesses and the like it'd be fair to say I mean if you took in that really narrow sense there's no doubt that businesses pay much more many more rates than residents do in fact the more vibrant we make fremantle the the actually the better the services we can offer for ratepayers the less rates we have to charge ratepayers because we've got a vibrant core that actually can actually subsidize the rest and that's just to give you an example so or at the moment pat graham knows he's better than me but we have about three thousand rape right thirty thousand rate pays um what was it so it's about three thousand dollars per repair here so we raise about three thousand dollars per rate payer in fremont compared to about twelve hundred dollars per rate pay in the city of melbourne so because of and that's not because we charge more rates that's because we've got a commercial core because we've got parking because we mean that we've got much more economic ability to do things than we would otherwise so that's actually so just so you understand that it actually leads to greater financial capacity and I don't I don't see it as an either roar between residents versus commercial or vice versa they're actually very complementary paul I did mention at the start the products that came out of this the first product was the because I guess the the data that was collected through that community envision the exercise and that's been posted on the website the transforming the transformative moves that you've seen tonight is pretty much focused on the cbd all of you it'd be fair to say it's very strongly focused on how you get into the cbd as a resident and a visitor which is really important to the economic wealth and well-being of the city but the next documentation the next product that will come out of the exercise later this year will be the city's next five-year strategic plan and it was always the purpose to the suburban part of the city so that we we can articulate better where we see our suburbs going and how we actually go uh the sorts of things that we can do for the subject no apologies for this exercise this is actually is about the city centre and about the economic well-being of the city centre and attracting people whether they'd be visitors whether they'd be workers whether they'd be great parts bringing them into the city to make it a viable city point of I guess during the point um the international design competition came up with this design um it is I mean that's one that's one drawing of it um you the other plans when they do get approved is actually better seriously better than a ground floor library when you put a ground floor library in um I think there's council sullivan articulated in the local paper what you end up with is blinds or tinted windows so that no one can see you because you don't like the sunlight the way this has been designed they and visible and a much more enjoyable space naturally um with water ponds um on one side of it on both sides of both sides on both sides on both sides it is to say absolutely and it's a matter of opinion it's a matter of opinion I i respect that yeah um but I'll say to you this will be the best just quickly respond that access is not a problem I mean it is a grand entrance off of king's square into the library you can either rent it steer it or elevator I mean from an access point of view um it's no different to walking into the current library okay so just don't explain the process so we did an international architectural competition run by the rules of the australian architect's body peabody and they actually that meant that I wasn't_''_599.279 on the panel only architects were on the panel and they ultimately made made a recommendation so we had 60 odd applicants to start with they got shortlisted down to three who did detailed designs and then winner was chosen so neither graham and I were involved in choosing that winner and they made the judgment that um that despite that or because that either way when we want to look at it that that was still the best design given the city's criteria we see these criteria we wanted a bigger library with better access and they they and they've you admit that criteria so so I guess it was one of those things where we can second guess we could have gone back and started to second-guess the architects and those kinds of things I actually think this is a very a beautiful design and it does what it does enable is this grass this this grass knoll that is sitting in the middle of the square library actually sits under that so have a huge rate break ceiling to do two stories comes to ceiling so it actually starts to enable some of those things um and I think it graham's right I think it will be beautiful and also understand jun's concerns I'll be upfront with you when but speaking to the architects and working through the detail of the design I thought I feel much more comfortable and again and I think it is going to be a pretty stunning outcome yep I think that's a great question because it is actually you're right it's what makes freo and and look in fact you know it was is it truth yeah 24 years ago when you were born I first moved here um and and you know could rent a house for you know 40 bucks a week a room for 40 bucks a week you know and and um and that's you know and that that's changed every idea of you know renting right in the middle of a free mantle it's almost impossible now if you're if you're not earning a lot of money that's enough so the affordability both from the housing perspective and then from what you're talking about from actually a space perspective is absolutely key so um absolutely so that that's that's not in this plan per se um it certainly came through and certainly in our cultural development strategy as well we're actually having those spaces and that's why we did around the fly by night take a really proactive role and say we don't want to lose you guys from freo we've got a great space here in victoria hall and um and look that will be a good outcome we'll have the flub or not here we'll have a whole range of other concerts by sunset events in in the drill hall and hopefully other spaces but but I think what you've highlighted to me as well as I think that as if this comes to fruition and this does gather momentum we're going to probably need to be more proactive in that space to make sure that we actually do get the right spaces to make sure we keep them so that the heart and soul of fremantle's not lost through a slow process of gentrification you know yeah absolutely just want to add to that um what grade family mentioned was that directly advertising for fremantle for 50 years has been really lucky the arts scene and the cultures and music scene has taken care of itself we haven't had to be the community in the council like it's an entryway proactive in that space and the mayor writing points out the big change has been the price of property um to hire or buy and it's caused a number of our artisans to move whether it be music art or or whatever surroundings whatever to move out of the city um because it's cheaper and it's unaffordable to actually stay in the central premiere we're working on a strategy I'm starting to think about a strategy about how we can provide the space we recognise the arts and culture scene in three models one of his gems absolutely one of those gems and we don't want that to go to rockingham we'll do love or midland or anywhere else we wanted to stay foreign and so we're actually structuring up our own capacity internally now to deal at a much higher level at a arts um and that in that whole thing not just be reactionary in the way we have been even just lately like panic let's save the fly by night and panic let's try and find out if we can save culture or addictive or harvard theater all of which we haven't been able to actually find the home for we don't want to be in that panic situation where we don't want to be reactive we actually want to be ahead of the game we're actually gearing up as part of our 2010 2015 strategic plan we've done that to gear up we've actually said we're out advertising now for that really a much more high level officer who will have links in the government links into the arts organisations around actually bring it back on track a bit yeah it's a good question I mean my there's a couple of things that suppose you need a question question live exports and in the future of that I mean there is certainly the council has a very strong position be moving to a chilled meat industry it's fair to say our influence in that area is pretty limited um and they're likely to continue um look there's certainly some changes that are put at the port I mean on my my personal view is hiding it in quinana is not a good thing for the industry if you want it to disappear but there's no doubt that that ultimately having scrap metal cars and sheep down on some of the best waterfront land in in the state is probably not is not the best use of that land either and it would be a really compelling logic from moving all of those whilst whilst keeping a container port here moving all of those industries down to james point quinn away would actually make a lot of sense um and I think government should consider that seriously I mean it just it just is a really silly use using that land um on victoria key for parking cars which is where the passenger terminal also is so there's just a huge amount of potential there you put live sheep out of sight and out of mind and will have a trade forever which is something that I personally don't agree with and you know what some good news we we plan to just specially I started work today yeah they started today finally no police station is is still on planning stage so I might say it's not when we say the council doesn't control this process the heritage the state heritage office I've now taken that off the department of housing this is the waters cottages um and they've actually been quite good and have fast-tracked some work and they've started scaffolding went up today and that so they're starting some initial work and refurbing those there'll be a debate around the longer term uses of those because probably to be honest with you at least a year or two of work to actually to fix those up they will let let run down badly the police station and that whole complex with the old court is is another really great precinct um that in my's view which think it shouldn't be used for residential purposes there's a really good use for that which could be again a hotel use a historic hotel use it could be some other it could be arts use in fact we didn't do a walk around with with outsourcing a range of others for that for that area because but for our view I mean just turning into residential be what wouldn't but wouldn't be the best use but government wants to dispose of that asset and they're going through there like we've found out with government office accommodation moving to fremantle government processes are long um so they're going through that disposal that process where they will probably on sell that to just to to somebody yeah no it look there is there's one of those tensions that you do need to manage um but my sense is lots of cities around the world do it I mean they have that they have lots more people day time and night attracting more people at night time is it makes mean yeah I mean in fact georgie's here who who runs the sunset markets down here and that's when that area feels the best is when it's full on a saturday night full of people I mean and that that's for me actually really really exciting and that's where I see this this area where imagine the j-shed actually um you know got things happening there probably maybe his bands playing there um and then ultimately you've got something happening on victoria keane is actually a proper well-lit linked full of people path through through that amazing part of fremantle at the moment on probably on most nights you don't really feel that comfortable walking through on the wi-fi one look that that's been rolling out and pretty pretty well and pretty widely and it's not entirely linked up across the city yet but it'd be fair to say the wi-fi maps one that's increasingly taking shape but we actually I've actually resisted rolling it out across the whole city and there's a couple of reasons for's a whole bunch of backpackers out there right now who are who who are skyping family back home and the like um we actually wanted to pick key areas we wanted to activate and bring people to and make feel safe again by having people there so actually we didn't need people on the cappuccino strip there were already people there so actually it was about focusing on key areas where we wanted to bring people back to so actually using wi-fi as a place to as a place making tool rather than just simply as a communications tool and I guess that's actually why it is targeted in some areas and and not not others thank you very much and thank you to you all for questions certainly graham and I will um be hanging around and happy to have a chat with you tony's provided food so please make sure that gets eaten and thanks again for your part in futures and fremantle's future thanks you

Please welcome to me thanks thanks graeme and welcome to you all nice to see both faces that are familiar are not familiar which is actually really nice so it's nice to see uh so many of you out here and this is actually what we did this is kind of the first public run we've done on this we did a launch a week or so ago um um which actually when we went really well and it was nice to see among some of our key stakeholders as well that there's a a lot of interest and a lot of love for fremantle because bringing this to fruition ultimately going to be one of those things that is going to be about partnership and that's actually what I want to talk about tonight is that what we one of the reasons we've done this and taken what ultimately and I hope for those of you who are involved in the visioning process that you'll actually see many of your ideas actually illustrating because there's some nice illustrations in this as well process from council debates and actually started to put them into one document that we can go to the private sector to the state government and to others who we want to partner with and say this is where we want to go as a city over the next 14 or 15 years so this journey started with this document in many ways and it's a nice analogy to start with because I it's a document which has a something just starting to break through the soil break through the surface and it feels like over the last five years or so since we've did this strategic plan that we are starting to finally see ideas that we planted come to fruition start to break through and at the heart of those was a real passion for making for me for men to draw on what I saw and what the council saw as it's as as its legacy fremantle and there's a nice book called the play as a place of consequence where fremantle has always been more than just a suburb more than just another part of perth but actually has been a really significant part of the history of western australia and as a port city as per second city has been a really key part of that history what the council was really keen to do is make sure that that really that strategic importance actually flowed through to its future so that meant ultimately it was going to be more than a tourist town more than a dormitory suburb and actually was going to continue to be a place of commerce of vibrancy of life of a seven day week economy and a place where things happen a place of consequence this is divided into two parts this presentation the first part I want to kind of recap the journey for the last five years and then that flows into where I want to see us go over the next five 10 15 years so one of the first things that we did a few years ago was start to change our planning scheme so we can actually get some of that vibrancy back into fremantle get people living and the east end the area that's surrounded in red there and it'd be fair to say that that entrance to fremantle by the car yards is not one that anyone has I think has loved in its current form and it's kind of looked like that I thought it's another great photo which I probably should have included 40 years ago changing almost exactly the same photo just in black and white and kind of some pretty cool 1970s cars so one of the first things we did was actually change the planning in this area but also upgrade the streetscape and this is what it looks like today and as those trees grow we actually start to see some of those developments such as the heirloom development others start and of course we've started to see the first of those seeds popping through in relation to elements like this cafe down in the east end of fremantle which for the first time has people starting to actually use that use this really great into town and of course this the heirloom project as well yesterday to some of the people involved and that project is about to kick off this month so finally after all this time in terms of actually getting into build phase which is really exciting reuse that's going to be 183 apartments in that beautiful old building the next and perhaps more controversial stage for those of you around three or a few years ago was amendment 49 where we actually looked at upping the heights in the core of of fremantle in in the city centre we took a really key approach then around doing that what we saw in the less attractive parts of town where the queen street with maya target coals kind of 1960s and 70s parts of town and actually up in dense cities to encourage major redevelopment of that area so that passed through and they had some really key targets around getting another 1500 people living in the heart of freo but extra 70 000 square meters of commercial floor space extra 20 000 square meters of retail which was really key I thought this was a good forum to just to got to with some of those so our targets I mean it's amazing thing is that a few years ago and there was about 820 odd people living in the fremantle cbd which is pretty extraordinarily low so we were really keen to quadruple that um through 1500 dwellings we've currently have just over a thousand that have either been da approved which is 416 326 which is actually constructed either underway or completed in the last few years or another 259 where the plans are made submitted so you start to see that it's starting to happen now and those things are rolling through same with a with a great commercial office space something that the city had really severely lacked so a major target there and this is probably one we're not meeting as quickly as I would like but um certainly some of that seventy thousand square meters about thirty eight thousand square meters of that in the pipeline uh or so or certain certainly both in construction and da approved which is pretty exciting and finally retail interestingly fremantle actually has lost 000 square meters of retail um space as that's not including the stuff that's not lit so our goal was to put that back because ultimately you need a certain massive retail to make it work as a core so um so that again that's tracking pretty well about 16 000 square meters either da approved or under construction or or underway which which is which is pretty exciting and we certainly heard this this statistic before we just updated some of these as well around that that one billion dollar development pipeline in which about almost 200 million of that's either under construction as we speak or complete about 386 million of that has a development application that has been approved and there's about another 500 million odd which is further down the pipeline further away so this is a long this is a I mean it's a 10-year process but one which we're starting to see gather speed which is pretty exciting and I'll go through some of those in more detail but there's certainly been a bit of at least is a place where people are looking to invest again and that's at the heart of it we're actually going to get some of that vibrancy back into the middle of freo the major one for that end of town especially I think this is I mean it's pretty ambitious so the council actually owned this block and we slowly bought up the different parts that block over time until we owned the whole 10 000 square meters that it set on and um that's 5 000 square meters right um we which um so 5 000 square meters and then ultimately that um which we then could sell as a block to one owner um who's obviously now doing the doubletree by hilton hotel um we contacted them recently to see how they're traveling obviously they've just demolished part of the site um and they're telling us they're gonna demolish the second half of the car park and start construction in may which is which is which is exciting and of course tourism is actually where fremantle is that and I i I should find this interesting statistics I wouldn't have thought this but certainly tourism wa tell us that outside of the perth cbd fremantle is by far the most visited tourist destination in western australia and one of the fastest growing as well so with 1.2 million visitations a year and certainly well above the second is uh margaret river followed by king's park which I think is kind of kind of interesting around um so that's certainly one which is our strength and one which I think we need to keep growing and I'll talk a little bit about how we can keep growing that as well another point and this probably came out of some of the debate around local government reform where there was a big debate around local governments and how sustainable we were and all those kinds of things and there was certainly a fair bit of mud throwing which we did our patient best to ignore and go to the keeper but certainly around around debt and those kinds of things and I wanted to put's cash reserves are about 35 million our debt is about 10 and what that's what's really important about that in terms of these transformative moves is that puts us in a very strong position as as we go forward I mean having a basically a position where we have really strong cash reserves to actually deliver these projects so obviously they're going to be delivered in partnership we're not going to do them by ourselves but but I want to make it really clear that fremantle's in a very strong financial position to be able to actually go and go and do this and that means it also has meant that we've been able to deliver a wide range of projects over the last few years from obviously queen victoria street which I spoke about um the espionage youth plaza the old port project a range of these the upgrades to the fremantle leisure center I mean I think this is a this has been a really fantastic success um and one that I think that be fair to say is loved by I think is pretty amazing the year goes quickly and um and one that that continues to be to to be loved the leisure center went through an even more expensive upgrade we've been at 1.6 million on the youth plaza we spent close to 500 grand yeah um on on on the legend of 5 million dollars including doing a combined geothermal co-generation so it's much more sustainable energy now powers that but also upgrading the pools adding disabled lanes and access and those kinds of things and then of course actually telling the story because that's a lot of what I when I go out beyond fremantle's boundaries a lot of it is that there's this ongoing story there you know that fremantle's dying free meant free mantle's not doing very well I think we have a great story to tell and that's actually part of our challenge and partly why we're doing this project is to say actually fremantle's actually got the fantastic bones of a city and can do even better as we go forward and partly what we're doing today so that was actually what part of the fremantle story um certainly we've seen those brand branding around which has been run in the banners and those kinds of things which has been really exciting so thinking forward as we go forward to 2029 um what we what we did with this is take the ideas that came out of you the community the council other direct engagement with stakeholders and say what are some of the key changes that we can make over the next decade and a half to actually transform fremantle so I'll go through each of these from the city centre to the waterfront how we connect network city transport wise the northern gateway around the fremantle traffic bridge and the fremantle oval hospital precinct as well all those put them together and actually think I think make a pretty exciting next few years so I imagine a few of you might have come across the river from north from mantle over this the old traffic bridge which is certainly one which the main roads department have often the talk and the plans that they've put forward is to put actually put a new bridge in between the rail bridge and the old traffic bridge here now instead of though knocking down this whole traffic bridge I think is a really exciting opportunity to actually create a northern gateway for that part of fremantle that will actually better connect north your mantle up with um that new emerging eastern precinct the east end of fremantle so we talked about that higher density residential quarter where the car yards are at the moment and we've got a lot of interest emerging around that queen victoria street precinct which I think will be we can get two to three thousand more residents living in that part of town which which I think is really important one of the things that fremantle lacks is housing diversity getting a real mix of housing types into that part of town again activating ultimately city centre core because everyone was in walking distance to the train station back into fremantle you've got cantonment hill and the army museum which is an with the community in that area but also more broadly and actually starting to get that reused and reactivated which I think is going to be is really exciting and then of course this huge potential around what happens when the traffic bridge is replaced so obviously you're going to have a lot of people and one of the things as you've got lots of people in high density we need to make sure that we provide great green places places for them to meet place for them to recreate as well and obviously you can see that it is actually pretty well I mean we've got fremantle park in this area here but actually taking the old fremantle traffic bridge and doing something like new york did with the high line is an amazing opportunity for that area and not and not one that's that that radical um ultimately that's no longer it passed it's used by date for having trucks and buses and heavy vehicles running running over it but actually but reusing that for was primarily pedestrians and cyclists and actually down towards each mantle and up towards the port is a pretty extraordinary opportunity and one that I thought that I think some very very exciting so that whole precinct um is one that we'll be certainly working with government on as those changes happen and I think will be very transformative so those who didn't arrive from the northeast many of you would have come past another shall we say less than loved part of freo which is kind of this this this bit between a very vibrant cappuccino strip and a great ray ray avenue precinct we've got these two really and they kind of got this dead space in between where the hospital is and the synagogue and and a few other kind of pretty um unamazing places but there's a real opportunity here now it's an opportunity there's a reason for two unfortunate reasons and now be honest with you they haven't been very good for fremantle one is the dockers are moving their training ground out to copenhagen well aware that's going to happen probably early 17 and then of course recently in the last little while with fiona stanley opening and at murdoch we have another huge opportunity with the hospital being downgraded still still a hospital but actually having a lot of vacant much more vacant space within it that can be reutilized so that means for the first time we can start to connect all of this up fremantle oval south terrace the hospital and the prison to actually start to create a fantastic precinct around here some of the key changes that we're looking at doing in this area which I'm really I think have got a lot of potential of course is the old stan riley site which is a past it's used by date single story development next to the synagogue but actually we're looking at doing a medium density next year so ground floor shops and commercial uses but above that um accommodation and at this stage where the council has been working with providers and that is a combination of for seniors and then but then also for students because we don't we don and so getting affordable housing is one of the one of our our key goals for this site as well but also starting to get a much better connection through to the prison because the prison is the only world heritage asset that we have in in in perth um and we have it right here in fremantle on our doorstep and when getting those connections and celebrating that is a huge opportunity as is the knoll which is a beautiful old building here starting to link back through to those and having a really exciting activated precinct the third move is this area here I'm sure people recognize where this is anyone ever have a guess what what year this photo was taken so it's actually it's actually more recently things about 1985 996 right around about that period just just before the america's cup before it went through a major facelift but you can see the beach is almost not present down on babies beach so obviously you've got the round house right here the j shed and ultimately you've got the fact even babies beach house has gone through a pretty major transformation in the last few years for it feels like a whole lot life time ago that was the mcdonald's isn't it but um but but it's be fair to say but that area now is for the first time in my memory and I think probably a long long time promote for a lot of premium history really working as a place where people want to go and for me that's been a really exciting change and that's again um the the people who re-read the bayes beach house have done an absolutely fantastic job and the council did the new boardwalks and the whole the old port project which starts to interpret a really important historic area um in fact you know this is where the where the first flag was what was planted in terms of settlement um you know which will be in 2029 would be 200 years so that this water so and for fremantle this is one of its great opportunities that we've never for me is're absolutely surrounded by water we've got the river we've got the port we've got the we've got bathers beach got the fishing boat harbor down to south beach we have what we but we don't when you're here you don't feel like you're close to the water we've never connected to it properly so one of the key things this actually came through really strongly in the visioning process was actually connecting through to the water so starting with bathers beach actually starting to make those links from the new babies beach house ultimately up to the to the j shed and through to victoria key is going to be absolutely key so drawing drawing people down and what that does as well is that it strengthens the west end because as people come down from the city centre from the cappuccino strip through to bathers beach it starts to activate those key streets in the west end which I think you start to see high street coming back to life recently and that's really nice to see and a long way to get all the way to the roundhouse which is what we need to do the other really key one which I'm excited about is starting to connect through the esplanade park down to the water and one of the key elements of that is the extension of the espana park so at the moment all this is is car park here's the youth plaza there it's basically connecting norfolk street all the way through to to the water to news road one that increases legibility often trying to find your way to fishing boat harbor there's a special skill for I think people who live in fremont I know to get around everybody else I think always feels slightly lost so actually start creating some of that legibility through and then actually we're working with the italian club who are situated here to actually get some car parking on that site with probably probably the italian club above and actually where we still actually probably increased car parking is actually a good spot for a car park but at the same's grown 20 I think probably every 50 50 years or so and it's a good opportunity to actually do that again the last time was um in the 1970s where where the area where the skate park was added added back then so for me there's a fantastic and really exciting potential here the old poor jetty the long jetty reinstating that possibly an ocean pool either in this or another location down down up down on the harbour and ultimately extending both the fishing boat and the uh and the sailing harbors potentially as of course you know making sure that the impacts on south beach and others don't happen at all so there's some really great potential that that we can do there and for me this is actually a really exciting project as we start to reconnect to our water the final part is around actually how it reconnects through to the port because again be fair to say that it's a really tricky and really poorly done at the moment the everything on the other side of the railway line through a major process but one of the things that I'm excited about that's coming through this process is for the first time to get the passenger terminal back connected to the city and that's going to be absolutely key we have 50 cruise ships arriving this year this financial year with 40 000 passengers disembarking now at the moment those passengers arrive what in what could only be described as one of the least attractive places as you arrive in this car park with a long walk to anywhere and it's just and it's really there's a huge amount of potential here to actually shift the cruise ship so they're actually much closer to the train station have a really clear link back to the city because we have a lot to offer in that in that regard and we're just not making the most of that opportunity at the moment so we're talking certainly talking with with the ports about that process at the moment and then also even the clear links in from victoria key back into the you can start to see this is approved plans that we've done with fremantle ports about actually extending cliff street alignment and bringing that legibility and that connectivity back and of course victoria key itself these plans are currently with the west australian planning commission um and this is a plan which which fremont reports have been driving both with the public transport authority and the city of fremantle to transform this area here which would be fair to say is where you park your car but you don't linger any longer into one that actually may want people to actually spend time there and be an attractor in itself which I think is a really exciting project so um and this is will be a major development um so once the ports go to market on this and this is in the area of about 300 million dollars or ultimately down down in that regard the city centre now what we've talked about in many ways has been the areas around the city center and in many ways what's been an interesting phenomenon I think that the areas around the three-minute city have really thrived there's no doubt that south america is probably the the most got the best buzz about it ever hasn't and in its history same with nordstrom mantle george street you've got these precincts all around fremantle that are really coming coming to life but I think the fremantle city centre hasn't followed that path and one of our key goals is to start to connect up those precincts to make sure the city center really works and a lot about a lot of that is about getting people obviously living here as I spoke about earlier but but also people working here and making a really attractive place for people to visit at the moment when you arrive in fremantle via the train it'd be fair to say that once again we've managed to do a very spectacular job of making it not very attractive and that's you kind of dodge some buses and and then walk across a series of what feel like pretty open exposed and unattractive areas and that as there so one of the things we've been working with the pta on as well is them moving that bus port to the north so we can create a new city square right in front of the train station that would look like this as you can see it's a major traffic calming and then so the buses instead will come down here so you've got to see other for those who catch the train that's the other entrance which will go straight to the bus port it makes a lot of sense and it will start and then all of a sudden you can start to imagine then how those connections through to victoria key all the sudden start to be a lot more attractive and actually start to draw people through the city in that regard again and this is another really big opportunity from this at the moment you only end up on queen street if you got lost I think because it's it it is a really unattractive streetscape but what that does moving that bus port it actually then for in that area this is where the areas where we gave the most density bonuses in fact the site this this side here to the right can go to 10 or 11 stories it's a major it's a major development site that's recently been purchased and the plans are underway for a major development on that site with a combination of retail um car parking and actually it's a really great mix of uses and I can't_''_1452.24 say too much about it yes because it's not public but but when it comes out I think it's one that I think will potentially be transformed that whole part of part of fremantle which is and for the first time start to make queen street work at the heart of all this is because queen street obviously has to link up to something at the moment as a good planning almost as like getting dumbbells with great linkages in in between so and at the heart the heart of fremantle it's king square our town square has never really worked so for the first so with sirona who owned this my building here and in the city who own these buildings here a coordinated planet he starts to link up the fremantle markets which is a huge attractor with the town square with queen street with the train station and all you back around to the cappuccino strip which is a really important way of actually starting to make the city legible as a as a call so these are some actually some of the very latest images from kerry hill you'll be very well that carry hill architects we're the winners of the international architectural competition that we ran and this is a view actually of where we're sitting right now through that and obviously the new library with the grassy mound and the library and ultimately council chambers and new combinational office and ground floor activation kind of food and beverage in in that area and the town hall sits down here so and this is just to give you a bit of a sense of that and I know there's been some debate in the local press actually come up with a very thoughtful way of designing what will be a light field pretty amazing space so um and one that's over double the size of the current library but it's not just the square it's actually also areas like the spicer site here which again not the most attractive site but again where there's actually some pretty stunning architectures this has already been approved this da's already been approved by the by the council and the design development assessment panels and as has this the queensgate cinemas which are currently unleashable um will be also absolutely transformed so it's a pretty exciting time for the city centre where obviously there's an eternal question which I think is a legitimate one as to where is this up to it's been a lot of talk about this for some time now be fair to say we've been working very hard with government on this and we have said to government that we need they are still being very open and saying they are absolutely committed to moving a government of us would have liked but we are pretty confident that we will have a response from them probably the next two to three months so um that's that's certainly commitment that we've got from them and one that we'll be holding them to because I think it's about time that if this project doesn't go ahead in its current form then we've got a plan b that we will run out and and do but either way this project will happen in one form or another now the final bit of course of this is about how do you tie all of these parts together it's one thing to have great precincts ultimately great cities only work when they have good transport links between those precincts so making fremantle a livable walkable and accessible city is absolutely at the heart of it this actually links in very much with the council recently passed the its integrated transport strategy which goes into this in a bit more detail but actually having a core that is low speed a walkable core in fact a fantastic talk by the lord mayor of melbourne last week and he had a wonderful quote which he said that uh no city has ever thrived by by aiming to attract more cars to its core its cause should be where pedestrians are and this is actually the strategy that we've taken but in fremantle this is not an anti-car strategy in fact it's about making the core really pedestrian focused and a really legible accessible simple way of parking on the periphery many ways it's not it's not it's not genius it's actually what the shopping centers do every day they make you make you park on the periphery and you walk into a very walkable call many ways but fremantle gets to do that and with a really special heart to it in this heritage heart that see that that's legible in in in the very same way so that's a really so that's basically very much at the heart of it but then it's also about how we link to the areas that are that are of our strategy here around actually getting a more balanced mode share where we want to see more people on public transport more people on bikes more people walking but also making the car available and easier for those who are going to use that and light rail is going to be absolutely fair to say it's been a very interesting debate over the last few days around light rail um where government is fair to say is barricading on on whether to go down this route or not and this would be also fair to say that this is probably one of the longer term parts of this project I mean I'll be upfront so I can't see this happening for next 10 years but this is a 2029 plan I can see it happening sometime in in the 2020s I actually do think that and the council's role in this is really important because what we're doing is we're locking down a light rail route one where it's ready to go so when for the first time we get a state council they won't be spending their time debating with the council about how this goes we'll be actually ready to say we've already got it here it's been mapped out and and we can actually roll it out as quickly as possible because this will be a transformative project and there's a few reasons for this one is to our south in coburg coast we have 10 to 15 000 more people just south of south beach we'll be moving in into that precinct now we can either try and attract them all to fremantle by you know riding the bikes or driving their cars or we can actually provide them with a really accessible easy public transport system they're only a few k's to our south and that's the kind of catchment we need to make fremantle more vibrant in a similar way we're going to have 30 000 people working at the murder activity centre where if you understand the myrtle union now again we want a really clear transport route for them down down south street where be a really really good way of starting to link up with the economic centres of fremantle with the economic centre of murdoch so that's actually why we've embedded this and that is certainly a long-term goal but one that I think we will see come to fruition and this is at the heart of the transformative moves document these are not all things that the council will be able to do by itself many of them we can and many of them we will we will do not over not not in 15 years time but actually over the next two three four five years you'll see many of these these things happen but what we are doing is mapping out a clear vision both to the private sector and to government about how we will about where we want to go as a community building on the visioning and building on engagement with our stakeholders which is really exciting so when you put it all together looks like a guitar playing whale but I think you can actually see how all these different bits from station the city centre the oval and the waterfront will start to tie together for what I believe will be a major transformation of fremantle so to finish off I think this is where we were five years ago this is probably where we are now where things are starting to take root we're starting to see major things start to happen but ultimately this is where I keep coming back to the point of partnership where the role of this is not something the council will deliver by itself is something that we will deliver in partnership with a range of others um and that's actually one of the key reasons we put this out so everyone knows where we're going and we can always start to take that journey together because that's the only only way that that revitalization really takes root and there is some of that really great partnership happening and I just give future freo as a nice example of that where we've actually got the private sector putting their hand in their pocket actually funding some really important research actually help us make our decisions but also help them and the state government make theirs which is really important thought that was a nice slide to end on australia day this year for the first time and I guess I think fremantle is an amazing place I mean we certainly we we see lots of that extraordinary extraordinary moments like these when it is a place where people want to be what I think this transformative move document is makes that possible more often more regularly and actually in a way that I think actually will become the norm rather than just a place of special events so thank you very much

My name is Drew Sandilands I am the attend at John Curtin College of the Arts I'm Clara and MA and I go drunken and I would also Hughton we're going for two weeks to Japan and the main reason why I'm excited to go is to learn more about the language and the culture there and see how it's different to Australian culture and all that so yeah main reason that I'm excited is to learn about the culture to go to a country I've never been to and to do something I've always wanted to do for the SI the topic that we had to write about was why we were interested in Japan and its culture and language and I read about how there's a lot of things in my life that similar and are also practiced in Japan but are very different and I really wanted to experience those I wrote about how I'm actually currently learning Japanese but I want to learn more and I think that it would be a great learning experience to be learning it back here in Australia and I also included that well my cousin is also Japanese and he lives in Japan and I felt that culturally if I go to Japan and learn about and also experience the culture firsthand I get to feel that I'm closer to him in a sense yeah for me when I go there I'm expecting to learn a lot more about language as I've mentioned before and especially when I come back to fear or to birth I'm I want to bring back the Japanese language because I want to learn more about it and I'm also thinking that maybe someday in the future our should go back to Japan and lived there for a while so bring about language here and practicing here as well as going to Japan and practicing there is also something that I would like to benefit yes when I go over there I really want to learn about different customs and definitely the different cultural experience that we have conserve ously in Fremantle were quite laid-back literally relaxed and from what I but it's very there's lots of costumes it's a very respectful place so I really want to be able to come back and compare the two cultures and look at Fremantle and look at Australian culture from a Japanese perspective konnichiwa with oshawa accredits you're joining us konnichiwa

Australians use 7 billion plastic bags per year that is one bag per person per day so the city of Fremantle is taking a stand and wants to ban plastic bags all together for more we're joined by Fremantle man dr. Brad but it dr. Mayer good morning to you how are you good morning you actually want a law banning the use of plastic bags how is that going to go down I think it's going to go down really well in fact our constituents in Fremantle actually very supportive of it both many of the businesses that we've surveyed but also the local people go to the shops and actually realize that the waste of plastic bags is it is too much and how do you think the law will be enforced though that's going to be the hard thing ah well what we will do is have a proper education campaign with our local businesses and with local residents and I think what we'll see from that is actually a great deal of cooperation it's already rolled out across south australia radical reductions in plastic bag use there and what hope does head out in Fremantle as well I there's some responsibility on behalf of consumers but a lot of the responsibility in fact most would come on behalf of the local businesses that are supplying the goods that they go in the bags exactly right and we'll certainly working with them and providing them all the materials and the advertising and the posters that they need to explain to the consumers why it is that frame and will no longer let's do a giveaway single-use plastic bags for free and helping them find the right alternatives biet canvas bag or other kinds of bags that people can can bring back to the shop on a regular day what about if people don't comply businesses don't comply how are you going to enforce it under the local law we will be able to come in for certain we have many local laws in in Fremantle that that we don't mean that are enforceable for example South Australia there's a 315 dollar on the squat we really believe in hope it won't come to that in fact what we're hearing from our retailers is that really really excited to about Fremantle being plastic bag free and they'll be cooperating with us on this no it's a great idea as long as there are effective and I guess as cheap alternative it'll be it'll be a good one dr. Amir are not sure which comes first doctor or me but we'll go broke thank you for your time and and great idea great initiative that's my pleasure thank you very much

 hello fellow follow here too my name is pepe live and I'm from the rock of polynesia new island my name is rakesh and I have migrated from india to new zealand and from new zealand to australia my name is astite ozawi I come from indonesia okay my name is richard olzowi I was born in germany after the second world war so we came as refugees to australia and I grew up here hi my name is elvi I come from malaysia hi I'm steve muzaffar ahmed I graduated from bangladesh in 2012. my name is jessica I'm from vietnam christine and I came from indonesia hi my name is hannah wolensik and I have migrated from germany my name is fawzi majid I'm from jakarta indonesia my name is dina abraham I'm from thailand my first impression of australia was it was so massive huge especially in land area coming from a small island a new island with just one hospital one high school one primary school and no traffic lights so yes it was very huge for me too busy I thought the functioning of australian government and indian government relies on the same pattern what it is like democratic values and right to freedom and right to speech that's what really impressed me and when I landed here so nice and beautiful neat and clean country coming from jakarta big city never sleep 24 hours keep going boom everything's hectic but as soon as I'm of the first is quiet which what I love so when we came here we only spoke polish in the house and when I went out to play with the other kids on the street most of who were the same situation but they learned to speak australian or aussie on the streets talking to each other and mixing with the other kids who spoke different languages so australian or english became our street language and then that all improved as I went to school and to speak better so yeah it was it was interesting because as soon as I stepped in the house we didn't speak english it was polish and mum used to take me everywhere with or something I would go and translate for her she'd tell me in polish I tell them in english and I grew up like that it was quite interesting married to australia citizen men and it's a really good a lot of thing and big area is not crowded area I love I live like this and would like to more travel and go many areas I believe that for many young people in their 20s they would always like to have some changes so that was the reason behind I choose to complete my bachelor degree in a new place like western australia rather than completing my full degree in malaysia back then my parents decided to migrate to australia because of the conflict between the indonesian and the dutch in indonesia after the war and they were happy to be here because they'd already suffered a lot during prison of war camp mom in indonesia dad in japan and they decided that australia was better a better place to be he said that the primary reason for us to market to australia was a seven years and my son was two and a half years we wanted them to obviously give them the best possible education and best possible lifestyle we came because it was a challenge a little bit of an adventure biggest change that I and my family faced was getting a house actually that was the peak of mining boom in 2012 and we hired because we didn't have any references we never rented any house here um we didn't know anyone we didn't have any friends so it was a very hard it was very hard for me doing nine to five job because by five all the home opens are finished and the biggest challenge was how do we say how do we tell our family that we are leaving we are taking the grandkids away we are taking the nephews the ants the ankles we are taking everything we are leaving that behind you know back there in indonesia and then american system and I arrived here I hear people talking I didn't understand just a little bit difficult for my job because when applied for jobs that you want to experience had a lot of experience but they just want experience and work in here so within our both our families the migration was always part of our story there was always a suitcase in the doorway I come from a very traditional chinese family in malaysia whenever there is festival celebrations we always have a big family extensive family of three generations celebrating together and also I have very close relationship with my grandparents so I remember there was one time when I was living in a home alone calling back home during the chinese new year time I can hear the happiness and noises at the other end of the phone while I was just there alone in the home it made me very sad and I was crying over the phone as well at that time oh homesickness was a big big problem and you didn't want to you didn't want to really portray it because it would have been like perhaps failure I don't know but you just wanted to get on and in so you only rang if there was absolute need so you had to write and I wrote and I wrote and then the mail took about six weeks to get there and if people didn't reply straight away it took another six weeks before you got an answer and the posty was my best friend did he bring some letters from home or did he not yeah it was a huge challenge for me leaving my family behind was one of the most saddest day of my life I was so homesick when I first moved here to australia you know getting to getting used to the new life here lots of changes for me and and my girls but I was fortunate that I already have extended families living here in perth my mom's family they were very supportive and so that's the new community internet helped me a lot because I can skype or messenger talk with my daughter and my mother father every day most every day my particularly my my work colleagues they were really supportive and giving all personal support to to taking me to various uh tom opens and the various even to you know showing me where to do the groceries and all those stuff so that really I'll say that that really took a lot of anxiousness anxiety from me when I moved here to australia back home our sundays is all about going to church so it's a sacred day where everyone rests so moving here seeing people working on sunday you know our neighbors doing their launch to me it's like well it's sunday and I mean people should be resting or you know we're respecting sunday but that's just our culture for new island bring a plate didn't know I thought well poor people they haven't got enough cutlery and they haven't got enough plates my housemate quickly bring a water a glass of water from the tap to me it was first culture shock to me because in my own country in my own cultural background I don't drink tap water and all the time for me for myself I only drink warm water I thought it was plum jam so without you know anyway so I put it on like you would put plum jam on a piece of toast and I didn't notice the horrified looks from the family and in those days and I just bit into it and I thought what a horrible thing to eat one of the pieces of advice I would give them is to mix more because what many of the newcomers do is find people from the same origins and they get together and they don't mix so much they when they get together they speak their own language so my advice is mix more with people to get yourself involved with people your neighbors your friends you know just school learn to drive because if you are thinking about that you like to be independent you would like to find a job first you must speak english properly fluently and then you get your license driving license so you can go everywhere that's the key we went to the kenwick and gosling library we became members so we can have to know when the events were held in that so that was really good for me really helpful be positive never to all to learning new things even me I still learning every day take your time don't be afraid speak up if you need to stand up for yourself do whatever you need to do learn the language and also learn about the culture and you'll be able to fit in just fine watch tv so I learn a lot when I'm laughing watch tv I learn something I can know about new and improve my language everything this one so it's me more important you need to open your shell you don't close your shell so you can know how to catch up with some people make friends and you can feel all this is good my advice to newcomers is when they come over here they should try to get settled in their life and take it easy not to rush because the system here is a little bit different and efficient than what they have come from city of kosovo we enjoy riding down on the bush track along the river city of arsenal's have people from nearly 140 nationalities living in city of boston which is itself a multicultural community living in here and gives you an opportunity to have variety of food from all those nationalities which you would never get in any part of the world I like op shops being able to practice my religion without anybody else bothering it which it already is at this stage which is perfect also we mean group I like swimming pool yeah I thought with costner community facebook and really thank thankful the reason that I moved to city of course now was because of the affordable housing for bigger space and another thing I'm very happy when we went to miu park that is sushan festival a lot of fun and relaxing and enjoyable also people are so loving and caring and you got so rich flora and fauna around in city of gosnell to explore which gives you perfect life here in syria you

 sporting activities in the gospels area had their beginnings in the 1860s and as the population grew sport became an important part of community life to cater for the need sports facilities of all kinds began to develop in those early days if a sports ground was needed it was the members of the sports clubs themselves who had to clear the land and create the pitches when the gosnell's oval was first planned during the 1920s the members of both the football and cricket clubs united to clear away the thick bush that covered the land no getting a contractor in to do the work in those days in the mid-1930s gosnell's bowling club used a horse-drawn plow to prepare the ground for the first bowling green facilities at these early sports grounds were virtually non-existent at the often very wet and muddy gossels football ground during the 1920s there were no changing rooms or showers the one advantage of the first football pitch was that it was behind the gosnell's hotel with no other facilities around the players refreshed themselves with a swift beer goal kicking in the second half of the game was always far less accurate than in the first in those days pretty much every aspect of ground maintenance was done by the clubs themselves one lady member of the bowls club recalls on sunday mornings I had to hop out of bed quick smart duck over to the green still in my dressing gown to take the dew off the grass and then my husband would go over and cut the greens while I fed the children then I'd end up sitting on the roller in my pink dressing gown being wheeled up and down to give extra weight because it wasn't heavy enough I bet he got a frosty look when he made that suggestion to play tennis on saturday afternoon people needed to get to the club early to chase the cows off the court a shovel was also necessary to remove the aftermath of their occupation but it wasn't just care of the grounds which had to be improvised sports kit was in short supply too gosnell's first women's hockey team made fabric the team was soon given the name the checkers many of the football jumpers after the second world war were old army jumpers with a v on the front and a number on the back sown by the local women over the years many women have contributed to local sports not just as players but also by their practical contribution behind the scenes this has included making uniforms acting as scorers and producing gargantuan teas for hungry competitors one member of the cricket team pointed out if you haven't been to a gosnell's cricket club afternoon tea you've never lived by the 1950s the addition of women's teams added to the social aspect of community sporting gosnell's off the field social events were and are an important part of sport events like club picnics ladies days and costume days added to the fun of being a club member and also helped to raise much needed funds a bus trip to bunbury for the maddington football club in 1924 was not only a bone shaker but also the highlight of the year gender bender days women's hockey club and gosnell's football club social fun day in 1956 the ladies dressed as footballers and the men dressed as lady hockey players some serious fundraising has also taken place over the years two maddington football club members cycled to calgarian back on a sponsored bike ride raising 5 000 for the club a thornley cricket club fun day included car smashing which at 20 cents ago proved very popular shame about the opposing team captain's new car over the years much hard work has gone on behind the scenes to ensure sport in the gosnell's area runs smoothly and is enjoyed by all

 g'day I'm scratty possum from the city of gossel's museum my old thing of the week is this game from the museum collection it's called chinese star checkers in fact star is the only accurate part of its name I found out that it's not from china and it isn't a version of czechoslovakia sneaky the first version of this game was invented by an american in the 1880s the board was square like a checkerboard the game pieces jump over each other the game was called helmer because the greek word for jump is alma a german game company changed the board shape to a star in the 1890s and called it sternhalmer meaning star holmer an american board game company started to sell it with a chinese theme in the 1920s and other board game companies soon followed eventually it was called chinese checkers why did they do that well it was marketing there was a big interest in asian art fashion and culture at the time a real chinese game called mahjong arrived in america in the 1920s in asian games and the exotic style of the game board to make this game really popular what's that I hear you say a company misappropriating the heritage of a culture it doesn't understand in order to make bucket loads of money surely not oh yes friends look out for it it's still happening want to learn how to play the game yay let's have a look you can set the board up for six five four three or two players my friend andy mccann face is going to show us how to play hi handy huh oh you've brought your friend jillian henderson hi jillian they're wearing their special gloves for touching old things nice one you put your pieces in a triangle across from your opponent your pieces have to move along the lines they can change direction where the lines meet your pieces can move one space or they can jump over one or more pieces to go further you can line up a few pieces to jump over and you can jump over anyone's pieces careful jillian gets all of their pieces into the triangle on the opposite end of the board first is the winner oh well done handy you won bundle up next time jillian there you go you can find an old game like this in a second hand shop or you can make your own by drawing the star on a piece of paper and using some little things to make the game pieces it's a great game for grown-ups and kitties join us next time to discover more things inside the gossel's museum see you soon bye you
 I'm spreading awesome and I live in the city of bellsville's museum this is my friend nelly hi everyone ellie's going to show us how to make butter and scones ali did the people who meet here in the olden days make butter and scones yes they did scratty the wilkinson family ut event they had a big orchard full of oranges lemons and grapefruit they had lots of people working for them when they were picking and packing the fruit so they had a lot of people to feed scones and butter were quick and easy to make first they needed milk to make butter it's granny where's milk come from uh a bottle yes but before that the shops before that um a milk tree what no milk comes from cows oh okay the wilkinson's had a cow she was brown and white and her name was beauty and they would milk her twice a day do you know how to move the cow um do you press a button on the side of the cow no you find the others around them and you give them a gentle pull and a squeeze you need to have a bucket underneath to catch the milk oh that sounds a bit weird we've got a video showing how they milk a cow let's take a look okay here's the cow two calves have come in with her oh where are they going they're walking towards the milking shed she walks there twice a day so she remembers where to go oh can you see her udders um oh where are they they're under her belly next to her back legs oh yeah I can see them the calves drink milk from them oh next the cow will walk up the ramp to go into the milking shed the lady is going to show us how they milked cows in the olden days now she'll use the mod milking machine the cups form a vacuum inside which draws the milk out of the others it's similar to what the carbs do with their mouths when they drink the milk the milk is moving through the the cow is standing still because she's having something to eat while she's being milked her head is inside the feeding box the milk will be collected in this tank so that's how it's done yeah the wilkinsons would bring the milk from the cow up to the kitchen and pour it into a bowl and then let it stand for a while the milk would separate into milk and cream cream is fattier and thicker than the rest of the milk and it floats to the top of the bowl you scoop it off the top and use it for making things like whipped cream sour cream butter and ice cream yum shall we have a go at making some butter okay so we'll need a couple of plates and a blunt knife a mixing bowl and some hand beaters a jug with a sieve some butter packs in water and some cream you can buy free from the shops if you don't have a cow at home ally why do you have ping pong bats they're not ping pong bats they butter later they're made of wood and wood soaks up water we don't want them to soak up the buttermilk later because that would make them smelly we've put them in water so that they fill up with water and have no space for buttermilk I've left the cream stand on the bench for a while so it's at room temperature now do you have beaters like these at home if not you can use electric beaches or an electric mixer see how I'm running the cream is right now oh yeah let's start beating it now it's thickened crane now it's whipped cream this is yummy on cakes and scones with jam yum now it looks like scrambled eggs scratty look at this the cream is turning yellow and it's separating into butter and buttermilk oh wow it's like magic yes it is it's going to get splashy so I'll tip the buttermilk out as I go I'll pour it through a sieve to catch the butter so oh scream're finished now let's push the butter out of the beaters now spready what would I use to do that um your fingers oh no scratty if the beavers turn they can pinch and hurt my fingers oh no I'll use a blunt knife if you're doing this at home with an electric beta make sure the power is turned off and the cord is unplugged before you go ahead oh done oh cool oh but the butter's all messy do we have to scrape it up with a spoon we have something better in the old days people use butter packs just like these to make the butter in nice neat shapes we need to use these to push the butter together to squeeze the buttermilk out can I let it go yeah sure oh can I help what we need to do is we need to push the butter pats in into the middle to use push the butter in do you want me to finish it off now spree yeah if I leave too much buttermilk in the off so I'm squeezing it out at this stage you could mix in some garlic salt or herbs to give it flavour can you see why they're called butter pats because they pack the butter if you don't have butter pats you could use some spatulas or some big flat spoons what are your hands well if they're clean there let's put that in the fridge for later and this is the buttermilk it's funny really because it's milk that's had all the butter taken out of it oh well that's just silly it should be called another name like uh butter milk or de-buttered milk or oh yeah no butter milky dog face keep working on those spreading okay we're going to use the buttermilk to make scones in the next video oh it goes in the next video to make scones bye
 hey I'm freddy awesome and this is my friend ellie hello we're at the city of gospel's museum today and we're going to show you how to make scones we made butter in the last video which was so cool and really easy ally what do we need for making scones it's great first we need an oven to cook the scones in you definitely need an adult with you for this part because we'll be working with a hot oven I'm going to turn the electric oven on to 210 degrees celsius if you have a gas oven turn it to 190 degrees ah well this oven's pretty new what did they use in the olden days the wilkinson family who lived in this house used a wood fire oven this one over here now I will put pieces of wood in here and light a fire that could heat up the hot plates which are up the top here and up here you would put saucepans kettles and irons and then underneath was the oven where they called the to chop up lots of wood to keep this going oh wow well it's much easier now because on the new ovens you just turn a knob that's right let's have a look at this one so what's different about this new oven it has a window that's very good and the window so that you can see how your food is cooking without opening the oven door and letting the heat out oh that's really clever now to make scones we need a large mixing bowl a sifter or sieve measuring cups a cutting board a blunt knife scone cutter or a glass and an oven tray the ingredients are one cup of self-raising flour half a tablespoon of butter and half a cup of milk or buttermilk now let's look at the flour first spray okay where's flour come from do you know um a bag no before that ah the shops before that um cows what no flour comes from wheat oh of course we've got what's wheat we use a plant that's grown on big the wheat has a tall stalk with a kernel at the top that's where the wheat seeds are seeds taken out of the kernel and ground into flour yeah I've got a wrister here shall we make some flour oh yeah can I go sure the wheat goes in the top and when you turn the handle it turns a metal plate with little teeth that grind the weight as it moves through I've put some weight in now you can turn the handle oh that was hard work ellie yes it is there you go that's how you grind wheat to make flour oh cool they would have had to do it a few times in the old days to make it nice and smooth okay let's make some scones we want one cup of flour make sure it fills up the cup and then we're going to sift it into the bowl you can use a sieve or a sifter oh why don't you just tip it in twice aren't any lumps and it makes the flour fluffy and an extra purpose bags of flour would often be stored on ships for a long time and in warehouses so the bugs such as weebles would start to live in them now the weevils wouldn't fit through the holes in the center so they'd be cool and then they couldn't go into the food oh oh did you eat the weevil separately we don't eat weevils oh what a waste now we'll add the butter this butter has been in the fridge so it's cold we need around 15 grams or half an ounce you need to mix the flour and the butter together to do that you take little bits of butter and you mix the flour into the fingers like this you rub the flour across your fingers and thumbs with the butter until you have it all mixed in together and it looks like coarse bread crumbs next we'll mix in the buttermilk that we got when we make the butter we need around half a cup just over half a cup or 200 ml and we pour it blunt knife well why aren't you using a spoon well if you use a spoon it overmixes the dough and you don't want to overmix the dough because it'll push the air out of this condom and then they won't rise up and become all nice and fluffy so we use a knife instead now we'll put it all together by hand and get it all into a little blob or a ball to put on the board ready to cut out there we go scratty look at that it's almost a nice little lump of dough now we're going to put the dough on the board first of all we'll put some flour on there so that the dough doesn't stick and we're just going to push it out with my hands until it's about a centimeter thick and we'll use the scone cutter but if you don't have a scon cutter at home that's not a problem you can use a glass do just as good a job oh cancer sure you can just we can get more scones out of the dough okay ready push it push it down good job yeah oh here we go and I'll finish cutting them out okay there we go we've got five scones and we'll just the rest of the dough together and that will make scone number six there we go we don't waste anything that's great it's a bit oddly but it'll do that's good I'm glad you approved okay it's time to cook these in the oven get a nice hot tray out of the oven now scratchy wanna count with me one two three four five six thank you now we're gonna cook these in the oven for about 10 minutes okay well um what are we gonna do while we're ready for that pickle we're going to do the dishes ready spray scrape scratty I'm just getting hungry for the dishes oh let's go let's have a look at these slimes what do you think oh these look great so here's our yummy scones I like my vegemite how do you like yours gray I like mine with jam and weebles oh yuck no we don't have weevils but we do have jam so you can have jam oh okay well join us next time at the city of hostels museum to learn more about life in the olden days see you soon bye you

 home burglary can be costly and emotionally devastating for victims and their families the following video will provide you with practical advice on how to improve your home security and dramatically reduce the likelihood of experiencing a burglary understanding the nature of burglary you can reduce the risk to your property with a little understanding of how burglars think would be burglars don't just pick random houses to break into rather they identify a series of factors which ultimately help them choose a target but these factors include the risk of being caught the effort involved in breaking in and the reward they can get from the items they steal risk thieves target houses which pose little threat to them offenders may look for shrubs or fences that are high enough to conceal them an easy escape route such as a lane or park insufficient or poor quality locks on doors and windows no one at home lack of natural surveillance from passers-by and a perception that neighbors are not watching does the property have a dog dogs can be a physical risk to the offender or effort although thieves will sometimes target houses that require a bit of effort most break-ins are crimes of opportunity generally targeting homes that require minimal effort to enter this may include unlocked doors and windows including front security screens poor quality locks a lot sheds which can provide tools to break in reward thieves generally look for items which they can easily dispose of for cash think of these items as being craved they are concealable removable available valuable enjoyable and disposable concealable stolen items that are easier to hide are often targets for theft removable easily removable items such as mobile phones bikes and scooters require less effort to steal available items left out in the open such as laptops cameras and jewelry require less effort and are a favorite with offenders valuable valuable items are favored by thieves however sometimes items are stolen that don't have great financial worth such as stealing pot plants from a front yard as a dare enjoyable often thieves steal for themselves rather than to dispose of the goods for example iPads trail bikes and alcohol disposable items which have a ready-made identification are some of the most stolen items have a look around your house what items do you think could be craved principles for reducing crime once you know what thieves are looking for you should be able to identify ways to reduce the chance of a home burglary essentially you need to increase the risk increase the effort and reduce the rewards external security measures always keep sheds and garages locked with a high grade padlock items in your shed and not only a target for thieves tools can also be used to break into your house items such as ladders bins and furniture can be used to climb onto your roof so keep these locked away in your shed or garage if it's not possible to secure up items such as toys or bikes then use a high grade locking chain instead to prevent tampering with your power and being plunged into darkness by would-be intruders keep your meter box locked and lock side gates as this restricts the ease of access and makes it harder to escape with stolen goods in the garden trim shrubs and the road and neighbors homes if you would join a laneway or park you can check with the city about extending your fence with trellis or planting prickly plants inside the fence as a deterrent you could also consider getting a dog to protect your home and family however remember that dogs require care and commitment so do your research on dog ownership before shopping for your new pet installation of security cameras or home monitoring kits doesn't need to be an expensive investment these days security cameras are competitively priced and can easily be self installed motion sensors on outdoor lighting can improve visibility and improve safety remember to check your lighting regularly at night by replacing brown globes and checking for black spots where lighting doesn't reach internal security measures home security measures inside your house can also deter thieves burglaries can occur when people are at home and this includes when you were in the garden it is good practice to lock external doors regardless of whether you are at home or not wearing a lanyard with your keys attached is a good way to door to a stranger even if they claim to need help instead you can offer to take down their information and assist them by making a call never leave the door unlocked for them to gain entry while you are inside a solid core door with a dead lock is the minimum use you have in your home if you have security screens and window locks get these key to like and keep them locked with the key removed alarms are an excellent investment to increase a thief's perceived risk and effort for breaking into a house the best alarms are highly visible audible and monitored by a security service visit the Gosnell's district neighborhood-watch resource center for information on door locks or other security products be careful with your keys and don't leave them in a visible easily accessible place like on the back of a door car keys are a particular target as they allow vehicles to be stolen easily instead make it difficult for the intruder to find them and never label keys as this tells the thief where and what they are for reduce the effort they need to escape with stolen property unlocking doors to remove larger items presents an easier option than climbing through a broken window rather than leaving spare keys unsecured use a home safe or ask a trusted friend or neighbor to store them for you consider engraving or marking your property with a UV marking pen as this makes the goods more difficult for thieves to exchange or sell use your w8 driver's license number on engravings as this will assist police in identifying you as the owner of stolen or recovered property items that cannot be engraved such as jewelry and antiques should be photographed remember to photograph jewelry next to a ruler to show the size of the item finally step outside your home and consider what people may see from the street preventing burglars from seeing what they can steal will reduce the temptation and incentive for breaking in during the day open blinds or curtains only as much as you need to brighten the room and at night keep them closed neighborhood watch Neighborhood Watch is a community-based self-help program where neighbors something unusual is occurring in their Street it involves a commitment to ring the police as soon as they see something suspicious visual signage such as stickers on rubbish bins letter boxes and windows worn possible offenders that neighbors are looking for suspicious activity neighborhood watch also has lots of information on security products which will increase the effort required to break into a property they

Hi uh welcome to the queen's park theatre uh we're 2022 and this is the 40th anniversary of the theater and we're lucky enough today to talk with tony turner thank you tony tony uh is like an icon of the building he's been here he started I believe when the building opened as a doorman was it that's correct yeah a doorman 27th march 1982. we actually started as staff we were appointed probably about two two weeks or so before that um the the council had appointed a theater manager at that stage yes nigel mccomb and nigel was working over at the civic centre and he was getting all the paperwork ready and liaising with people to get shows here and things like that one of his tasks was to employ staff and the staff were obviously going to be part-timers casuals so when the opportunity popped up I was also working over the city in their town planning department and decided that it would be good idea to have a second job something a bit different and applied I then had me being a town planner um it would cast dispersions on my position over there and I said to him I said so you're saying that your theater is not world class is that the problem and he said I think you've got a good point you can have the job so I left it at that so that was the first front end and nigel basically got us together a couple of times the building was still being completed up until almost the last week so we came in a couple of times and he pointed out where toilets were where the box office was and we did the basics yep um and he said to us look anytime you want to come in and get familiar with the place before the show starts shows start just feel free so one night after work I decided I'd walk from the office over here down to the stage door area and things were feeling quiet but open the stage door and I walked in there's nobody around here nobody in the fire so I walked up opened the door there was nobody there either and I came out and I walked out there and this alarms going all sorts of things so I thought well I must go and sit in the car for a while and see if somebody else arrives I'm walking up there just about get to the car the police arrived have you seen anybody in the theater I said I've been right through the place you said never saw us all you set everything off and I'd set it all up and then nigel comes walking across and he sees me standing with the police he comes I said this bloke will know me I said he's the theater manager and he has not never seen him in my life I thought you were not inside so that was my introduction to theater in that sense you would have actually seen the building um as it was being built yeah we're working with the council um the history of the place actually goes back quite a number of years um I mean I started at the uh in 74. and prior to that the engineer had the planning section under his control but they decided that they would they had some land um at muhammad's and they had some lands up at mount scott and they decided that they would subdivide mount scott first and sell the blocks as residential blocks and put the money the profits from that into a reserve fund for an entertainment facility they started to do the same with the most of muhammad's flats and by the time the council decided that they were going to build a facility they had two million dollars in this reserve and they managed to get a million dollars from the state government so for three million dollars they got this building that's quite incredible I mean in today's terms um to build a theater you can't do it for any less than 30 million and 30 million would not get you much so that is an astounding accomplishment yeah for the city and it was very you know forward thinking on the council's part um what was the was was mixed there was a fairly strong pro theater but there was also a very noisy um anti-theater because spent three million dollars on this building you know it's a white elephant look you know and that was right through from the start and some of the earlier shows that happened so obviously they weren't there to go as unless you put something on that they enjoyed but that seemed to win and disappear eventually because the the class of shows that were coming were world class I think that's a very interesting point because a lot of people do get upset about the cost of actually having the venue here but it really is a a civic building that attracts a lot of good to the city and and some of the shows that you must have seen over the years you would have seen that I mean it's still been available for locals too I mean you you ask the staff here um you know the end of the year is a nightmare for them because you've got all of the dance all going across the stage performing to mums dads and aunties and uncles yeah but that's what it should be it should be part of the community absolutely and it's good to see that over the years those studios that are in town have consistently come back in the majority yeah I think they had a struggle over the last year with the covert situation but what it's done is make people appreciate when you come back into this venue the capabilities that this has yeah that a hall for hire does not have that's right I mean prior to this the the venues in town was the gymnasium over at the high school and or one of the hotels the winter sun having a fairly big room of potentially 400 people but the old sun seeker hotel which is where the police station is now built had an upstairs section that a lot of shows used to used to turn in up there yeah but just going back to the council I mean the mayor at the time that this was being built was lyle radio announcer very much into the arts himself um and a really nice guy and he's too I see the the deputy mayor was phil cooper now phil was um he's sort of your average working man type of person so he'd call a spade a shovel yep and people know exactly where he stood um so that combination was quite good because they being the two opposites they really got things done yes through their discussions and that and their council were quite strong too so when the theater first opened was there a big turnout for the what was the first show okay um I'm just trying to think what the first show was actually you must have seen so many look um it was it was a celebra celebratory week um yep the whole of the events in conjunction with nigel mccomb had been organized by john thornton from down perth now john going back into the history of him um in the 1960s he was john thornton trio so he was in a jazz band of three he moved into I think he was the jt of the jt jasmine he played piano and banjo I think it was or something like that but they had saxophones and all sorts of things in there they're very popular in perth in the 60s and 70s john teed up with a fellow by the name of stan bird and stan and john basically manage the regal theater in perth as a an historic building yes and for many many years until about I think john retired in 2010 12 something something like that 2012 and yeah they understand still going both of them are still going as far as I know but john organized a whole week of performances and we had ashton stage lighting from perth came up and um ian ashton and his brother and they brought up their ex-world war ii searchlights and parked them out the front from side numbers at prom side near the fountain and crisscrossed them in the night sky for the whole week to give it atmosphere yeah and we had every night we had something ranging from uh plays comedy um we had the symphony orchestra or something like that was a mixture yeah I do have programs at home and it's interesting because you wouldn't get those shows without a venue like this you actually need that capacity for a lot of these shows to make it uh financially viable and worthwhile to tour when you've got 30 or 40 people performing you know you've got to pay x dollars per person that becomes quite a you know expensive ticket seat because you've seen a venue like this you're right I mean it was very forward thinking of the council to actually get this and it was a risk at the time but I think it's a great asset for the community now tell us some of your favorite shows I think I know which one is going to be your most favorite well the one that I missed that I would have liked to see was during open opening week and that was timothy west timothy west since then has done a number of uh timothy is the husband of of uh pronella scales're still married they're still she's not that well but um they're still married over in england but timothy has since done winston churchill and a few other serious plays and done it very very well he just didn't turn up on the night here and we're all standing around waiting all the is sitting in there and no timothy west and he rang up and said oh look he said I'm just leaving perth how long is it to go to geraldton somebody said forget it you know you won't get here in time so it was a bit of a disaster on that night but um look my favorite shows uh you know I mean you'd never guess but you know a little bit of country music and things like that is I think we might need to have a look at something bring it on over so yes yeah country music look I mean um people like john williamson yep I've been here yeah um you know but this one has got to be your all time this the the man slim dusty and this photo was taken right here on the stage um that's incredible this is um this is you tony that was me 20 years ago 20 years ago um that's incredible age well for somebody that's 302 come on show us the back of it as well but um yeah I mean as part of front of house manager just a story it's kind of a front of house manager um was meeting the people down here at the door just to see if you know anything was needed in front of house wires any drinks or whatever and slim was a great guy to to talk to his family were always traveling with him that's fantastic I'm gonna have to have a hold of that yeah that comes back andrew um I think it'll look good up on the wall I'm sure it looks good on the wall in my place um but no he was a really you know thorough gentleman so um this particular show on stage here that set was the front and come through join his band in the front and and play and at one stage I think might have been interval I came down to see if he needed anything is there any chance of getting a signature from him he said yeah yeah no worries come down and slim's little trick even from the days I saw him as a kid up in the bush when he finished the show he used to sit on the edge of the stage people would come up he'd chat to them he'd sign autographs and take photos he'd never go out the front his wife's sister she used to sell the merchandise yep and she'd almost drink the bar dry sometimes but she'd sell she'd sell merchandise down there but slim never used to go out the front he always met his audience here and after the audience went he said yeah let's just stand up in here and I had a program that he had with him and he is actually signing that program the whole of the staff got dressed was very much into carrying the theme into the foyer so because it was a country music night we did country music out there and country look yeah we borrow the gear from one of the local stores very nice um and funny I had some photos taken in the in the foyer and he came back the back of that is signed 2000 that was a 1988 tour so when he came back the second time my missus brought that in got it mounted didn't tell me and gave it to his daughter ann kirkpatrick to get signed into the show I come down here and she comes out and said ah somebody might like to take oh I shouldn't have brought this out should I all right but it's another story to go with it isn't it are there all right yeah now you started in 82 or 83 but when did you finish up because you finished up a number of times from what I hear yeah look um we started on you know place was open 27th of march coming up to ushers that's all we had and just to direct people to toilets to get back to their seats and so on the role changed after a while nigel once the theater had started nigel was the sort of manager who would set up a system set up the theater get it running and then move somewhere else and he actually moved to the arts center in alice springs because that was being built at the time yep so he did exactly the same job there and set it all up following on from him was bill mason and bill liked to be involved in the theater he came from the hole in the wall theatre in perth um and he liked to be involved in everything but he got to the point where I don't want to stay here every night so that was our role and then he sort of created front of house manager and and sort of positions that were able to carry on running the place while he wasn't there so whilst I started as a doorman moved into the front of house so I finished I i worked through pretty much consistently until my wife got breast cancer and that was in I'm trying to think now that was probably in 2001 or thereabouts was when I i said look I'm finishing off I'm going to look after her she went through treatment the whole treatment and was given a breathing space we think we've got it all and then um now it might have been later than that actually it was probably probably 2005 60 something like that I think it was and yeah for a couple two or three years she was fine and then it came back but it was scattered in the chest wall so they gave her 18 months to live and that's pretty much what she did and she passed away in 2014. but when she'd gone through the first lot of treatment and was feeling relatively good um she said to me she said you're probably gonna you're gonna miss that theater you've been there so long and she actually worked here too so she knew here didn't you we did we were very good friends for a number of years she had a husband she lost her husband at some stage there and the ushers that were here bless their souls after a couple years decided that they were having an usher's party and I should go along and I said I'm a house manager I'm a bloke I'm not part of you girl mom you know and I said no you've got to come along you have to come along and of course it was just a bit of a setup for us because I knew how well we got on and they reintroduced us to each other we got married and got married for 20 years before she passed but I did come back at her suggestion to see if I was going to miss the place or not and sort of was different staff had changed over about the 12 or 18 months I was away and atmosphere from the staff point of view wasn't quite the same so I did about three shows and really not enjoying it so I pulled the pin and spent the time with her towards the end and once she passed I moved on out of the corporate world and finished up doing music 24 7 in one form or another around town that's fantastic well it's not fantastic what has happened to you but it's fantastic that you found your passion in music yeah and I think the theater probably helped me in that to a degree because as a small kid uh in the bush town in norseman I i had the desire to go and play music a couple of guys up the road with rock and rollers my mum always used to say you're not going up there they're a rough mob you can't go up there so dad bought this little mellow chord which is a keyboard plus buttons like a piano accordion that laid flat and I used to sit at home for frustration to play this thing so over the years I sort of drifted a bit away from music and then when my wife passed son who has got a band in perth the bamboo ca rhythm section that was an advert by the way but he rang me one night and said what are you doing dad and I said I'm sitting in front of tv he said what'd you do last night and I said sitting in front of tv he said have you got a guitar I said yep he said get it out find a teacher see where it takes you so that took me uh I found a teacher the next day had just come into town he's a great guy I'm still going to him not that I'm not learning things it's the case that he's got so much to teach but that got me into a band for about four years and in that band we toured right up to karatha all the way down onslow and all the way down the coast had some bookings down in margaret river and denmark did a couple of recordings covert hit we dissolved that so it's been a bit up and down now back to silence stuff okay so yeah it's it's I put it partly to the sun but but partly to having been involved in the theater yes and seeing people on stage and how they are when they come away from that audience you know they're as pumped as I think I feel a similar thing to you with that as well I mean um my role is similar to what you've done and I feel it's a privilege to actually be amongst all of these shows that come here and seeing the effect it has on the audiences people who often are quite moved by what they see on stage without knowing it yeah and I think in this position you actually get to see both sides of that you see the shows but you see the audience as well and look we've had I mean there was I can't think of the guys now scottish guy singer and solo act basically he came here he was breathing difficulty he was hardly walking the show started he came on here he he had some tablets lined up ready to go he had the tablets he had some water he lay on the floor for five minutes came back again did the second half and they carted him off to hospital after that to see if he was okay but that's dedication to the audience yeah the audience had no idea no you know no that's right what was being shown was what was here the show must go on yeah yeah and that to me was I'm getting goosebumps thinking about that but to me that's a thing that about theater you pay your price for your ticket you sit there you get entertained these guys on here are as dedicated as you'd ever find anywhere and they get as much out of the audience as the audience gets out of them yeah it's true they wouldn't come back yes very much so yeah I mean I've met some great artists you know um harry second um spike milligan two of the the famous goons yeah um sir harold or circumference as he'm gonna do a sound check on him why do I need a sound check yes the voice bounced off there almost out the back door and he didn't need microphones um the barry crocker was another one and I have to laugh at this because it's we had a technician ian ashton from ashton stage lighting ian was a technician here for a while and anne's working on stage putting gaffer tape over over cables barry crocker walks in and says um hey you you are you talking to me pal yeah he says um I want to show a 55 I've got one putting the tape down barry cracker says well just go downtown and get one now he says the town's so small crocker's face just about dropped on the floor and he just walked out and then come back did he show later with whatever microphone they gave him but I just you know the the attitude I mean he ian had been in showbiz for quite a while and technician-wise and knew it all so he wasn't phased to go and do something yeah yeah he was also a bit of a prankster there's many stories about that we had a show on star I got to tell you one at least had a show on stage here called caravan yes now the play caravan is about three or so couples that go away for a weekend in a caravan and there's the interplay between each each person's partners and so on and it gets a bit muddled up towards the second half but the cat the set was a caravan actually cut in half the roof had been taken off but all the insides were still as a complete caravan so the audience could see inside the artist would come in through the door this afternoon it was all raining and they're all stuck inside the two ladies up the far end they're playing cards they each had a drink on the table the other couple were sitting opposite each other they hadn't spoken because they had to fight and one guy walks in and he comes and he props himself he's looking straight up into the lighting gallery before that just before that scene ian said to me grab that bucket of water and the pipette and go up on the grid now the grid from here is probably 40 feet up or more so I go up the stairs carry this thing up there walk over I get to a point over here where I'm above him but there was a light in the way and I couldn't so you know sucked up the water in there so he's lying there's going like he's right next to him he's looking at me he's shaking his head and I couldn't get him so I moved up to this end moved across the grid up team there wasn't so much lighting up here and the two ladies are sitting there with their glasses I couldn't get them again because the but the glasses were there so I dropped one in the glass with this thing from 40 foot up just about hit the roofer and hit the water there I oh yeah and you know we just moved the glass quite you know they're all sort of trying to play with it you know um that's the sort of thing that used to go on unbeknownst to the audience and ian was quite good at doing that we had winnie the pooh here and it was pooh's birthday and I think christopher robin gave him the balloon for his birthday and the idea was he oh this is wonderful I've got the balloon he's throwing it up and catching it the matinee director of the show was down here second row in or something he throws it up and through the lights you could see it was full of powder and he's meant to burst this thing and it goes powder goes over including over she just fell off the chair laughing you know and he just oh you know and there's a little there was a bridge over the creek that came into this area yep and uh eeyore was crossing the bridge now he always a very negative sort of person looking at and unbeknownst to me ashton had set up on the top up here a blanket with some foam packing and he pulled the cord and this stuff just come down in one foot right behind him and here whenever mr beaton just went typical all the little things you got away with but the funny part of the whole of that was when they had the big downpour and pooh got stuck up in the tree christopher robin had to go in the upturned umbrella to go and rescue him the week before we had kerry's dance studio I think it was had come in here goodness man and they had put a a scrim across here yeah mesh type stuff from that side to that side about that far up this colored like water and of course oh we'll use that again so we use that again as the water for the flood there was also a paper mache shark six foot long over there christopher robin goes in the upturned umbrella and of course you can see just to the bottom of the over here is ashton slowly pulling the fishing line that's connected shark so you have this situation where you know oh this is wonderful robin's crank he saved poo so they saw the shark and had to leave so you just mentioned kerry's dance school yeah so god I mean they're still going yeah how many dance schools would you have seen look there would be at the peak of it there's probably four or five in town that used to come and they always used to come around about christmas time the end of year but kerry's was always the the last of the year yep and to my way of thinking she was one of the best because she really related to those kids a lot of the others were technically very good yes and would create some people who'd gone worldwide in terms of their their craft but kerry would take little kids in and they all had a ball yeah and I think most of the staff enjoyed kerry's show one because it was so much fun yeah because there was nothing related to that nothing but glitter left inside so you know it's yeah there's a lot of fun stuff that happens and were you involved with the friends of the theater um no not directly okay they started about two years just under two years after the theater opened about 83 84 I think they started yep um and do a great job they they you know have um the wine and cheese I think they still do that here the wine and cheese um they uh offer different rates to join yes which give you different but no I never got to that because I was always working here so I thought no I won't cross the boundaries and yeah do that side of it but they were a great multi they did a lot of things yes and sometimes at the shows they would put a bit of wine and cheese on afterwards too for the people to stay so they can meet the artists yeah yeah nice well it looks like you've had many fond memories of this place to hear you're welcome in here whenever you want to come in thank you and we'd love to see you in here yeah and uh do we have your mark on the wall no you don't well we'll have to go and show you the slim dusty one and get your photo next to the slim dusty
